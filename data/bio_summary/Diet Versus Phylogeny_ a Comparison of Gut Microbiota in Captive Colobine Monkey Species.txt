Different but not fewer microbial species may thrive in the presence of different dietary substrates and even if we had had larger sample sizes we may still have made the same observation that within a host species microbial diver- sity did not differ across diets.Microbial CompositionOur study identified a colobine Bcore microbiota or a group of bacteria shared by captive colobine hosts.

When host species and diet were combined in a PERMANOVA analysis diet had a significant effect while species had only a margin- ally significant effect on microbial composition diet pseudo- F  1.17 R2  0.067 p  0.016 host species pseudo- F  1.09 R2  0.124 p  0.053.

Because of the significant effect G032 had on some results analyses are reported with and without this individual included.Table 1Diets by captive instituteDiets by captive instituteBeijing ZooBeijing Zoo Breeding CenterPanxi Wildlife Rescue CenterSingapore ZooSingapore Zoo Primate Conservation Breeding CenterTreeleaf speciesMature leaves of mulberry Morus speciesGreater number of treeleaf species than Beijing Zoo due to proximity to the moun- tainsMature leaves and barkof species in the following genera Prunus Folium Cornus Buxus Litsea Ilex Euonymus54 species from the following families Acanthaceae Anacardiaceae Arecaceae Bignoniaceae Caricaceae Combretaceae Dilleniaceae Euphorbiaceae Guttiferae Lauraceae Leguminosae Malvaceae Melastomataceae MeliaceaeMoraceae Moringaceae Myristicaceae Myrtaceae Musaceae Oleaceae Oxalidaceae Poaceae Polygonaceae Rubiaceae Rutaceae Sapindaceae Sapotaceae Tiliaceae54 species from the following families Acanthaceae Anacardiaceae Arecaceae BignoniaceaeCaricaceae Combretaceae Dilleniaceae Euphorbiaceae Guttiferae Lauraceae Leguminosae Malvaceae Melastomataceae Meliaceae Moraceae Moringaceae Myristicaceae Myrtaceae Musaceae Oleaceae OxalidaceaePoaceae Polygonaceae RubiaceaeRutaceae Sapindaceae Sapotaceae TiliaceaeFruitsCantaloupe dragon fruit apple UnknownApples plum peach pearApple pear mango coconut papayaApple pear mango coconutbanana watermelon peach tomatoes pear honeydewVegetables Carrot radish kang kongcucumbers corn lettuce sweet potatoOtherSteamed corn meal cakecontains 50 corn 15 barley16 soybean meal 10 bran2 calcium carbonate1 calcium hydrogenphosphate 1 salt 5 sugar cooked egg peanuts cooked beef strips biscuitshoneydew cantaloupe pumpkinUnknownCabbage bok choy carrot eggplant cucumber sweet potato radish daikon celeryUnknownSteamed corn meal cake with contains 50 corn 15 barley 16 soybeanmeal 10 bran 2 calcium carbonate 1 calcium hydrogen phosphate 1 salt 5 sugar cooked egg peanutsmangosteen starfruit guava orangeCorn long beans carrots sweet potato kang kong French beansRice ball bread with Nutroplex vitamins sun flower seeds cooked meatpapaya mangosteen starfruit guava tomato dragon fruitSweet potato cucumber corn long bean carrotMazuri primate pellet cooked egg chicken rice ball bread with Nutroplex vitaminsEach captive institute varied in diets and feeding schedules of colobine monkeys.

In a study on obesity humans exhibited no change in microbial diversity but a dramatic change in gut microbial species composition before and after diet therapy .

Samples were rarified at 15029 reads.Statistical AnalysesObserved OTUs Shannon Simpson Chao1 and PD Whole Tree diversity indices were calculated in QIIME to compare gut microbial species richness between colobine species and genera.

A similar result was found in a study of 283 ant species distantly related her- bivorous ant species shared more similar gut microbial commu- nities with each other than they did with more closely related carnivorous ants .

Additionally diet had a stronger influence on the gut microbial community than host phylogeny did--potentially because hosts were so closely related phylogenetically that there may have been few differences in their gut microbiota.Microbial DiversityAll colobine genera except Pygathrix had significantly greater gut microbial diversity than Nasalis.
