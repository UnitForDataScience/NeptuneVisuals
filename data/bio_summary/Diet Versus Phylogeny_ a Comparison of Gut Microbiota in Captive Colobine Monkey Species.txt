different but not fewer microbial species may thrive in the presence of different dietary substrates and even if we had had larger sample sizes we may still have made the same observation that within a host species microbial diver- sity did not differ across diets.microbial compositionour study identified a colobine bcore microbiota or a group of bacteria shared by captive colobine hosts.

a similar result was found in a study of 283 ant species distantly related her- bivorous ant species shared more similar gut microbial commu- nities with each other than they did with more closely related carnivorous ants .

additionally diet had a stronger influence on the gut microbial community than host phylogeny did--potentially because hosts were so closely related phylogenetically that there may have been few differences in their gut microbiota.microbial diversityall colobine genera except pygathrix had significantly greater gut microbial diversity than nasalis.
