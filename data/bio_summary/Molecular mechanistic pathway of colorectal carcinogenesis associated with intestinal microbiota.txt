The balance between intestinal microbiota intestinal epithelium and host immune system is decisive for normal functionality of the intestinal cells .

It is quite interesting that the balancebetween intestinal microbiota intestinal epithelium and host im- mune system is decisive for normal functionality of the intestinal cells.

It is believed that the intestinal component whose products determine the health of the colon and the individual and interact with environmental factors and the genetics of the person .The GI tract is the reservoir of diverse populations of microor- ganisms mainly bacteria that have adapted to life on mucosal surfaces or in the intestinal lumen .

This cleavage increases the permeability of the intestinal barrier and triggers b-cateninWnt signaling trans- duction in intestinal epithelial cells that contributes to the prolif- eration and oncogenic transformation of CRC .

Growing evi- dence suggests that the intestinal symbiotic bacterium E. faecalis produced extracellular superoxide and hydrogen peroxide lead- ing to intestinal epithelial cell DNA damage both in vivo and in vitro test system  It is also evident that E. faecalis has an ability to induce dysplasia and carcinoma in IL-10 eemice .

Therefore there is certain evidence trying a target about the unclear mechanism between intestinal microbiota and CRC.

Therefore the aim of the study is to identify the possible mechanistic mechanism regarding host-microbiota interaction in colorectal carcinogenesis.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

imbalance in of normal intestinal microbiota can promote chronic inflammatory conditions and the production of carcinogenic me- tabolites leading to neoplasia .

There is growing evidence that the complex gut microbiota community plays an important role in the devel- opment of intestinal tumorigenesis.
