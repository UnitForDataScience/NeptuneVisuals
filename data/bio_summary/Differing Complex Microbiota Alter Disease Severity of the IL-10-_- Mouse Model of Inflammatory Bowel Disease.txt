These findings suggest that the composition of the resident GM is a primary determinant of disease severity in IBD and provide proof-of-concept that CMTR can be used to investigate the contribution of contemporary complex GM on disease phenotype and reproducibility.Keywords gut microbiota GM complex microbiota targeted rederivation CMTR inflammatory bowel disease IL-10-- mouse model 16S rRNA V4 next generation sequencing disease phenotype mouse modelsINTRODUCTIONInflammatory bowel disease IBD is a multifactorial disease thought to involve a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors leading to aberrant immune responses to normally innocuous microbes Zhang and Li 2014 de Souza and Fiocchi 2016.

No differences in lesion severitywere detected between male and female mice in any of the GM groups examined.To determine if these findings were unique to the IL-10-- model on a C57BL6 genetic background C3H IL-10-- embryos were implanted in surrogate dams from the same vendors as used in the B6 IL-10-- experiment.

When gnotobiotic IL-10-- mice are monocolonized with H. hepaticus they fail to develop intestinal disease implicating the role of the normal GM in disease pathogenesis Dieleman et al.

With recent studies suggesting variation in naturally occurring GM composition and complexity among mouse producers we hypothesized that differences in these naturally occurring complex GM profiles may modulate disease severity in the IL-10-- mouse model.

Statistical testing for differences in beta- diversity was performed via PERMANOVA implemented using PAST 3.12.RESULTSIL-10-- Mice with GMCRL have Decreased Typhlocolitis SeverityIn order to determine the impact of differing complex GM communities on disease severity B6 IL-10-- embryos were transferred to surrogate dams purchased from three different vendors Figure S1.

Using these methods we show that the GM of surrogate dam greatly influences colonic and cecal disease phenotype in both the B6IL-10-- and C3H IL-10-- mouse models.

While these models are largely useful for the study of specific GM populations they are by definition restricted in GM complexity and do not fully recapitulate the complexity of the human GM.Helicobacter-inoculated IL-10-- mice provide an attractive animal model in which to study the role of complex GM communities for several reasons.

We surgically implanted genetically identical embryos collected from IL- 10-- mice into surrogate dams harboring different GM varying in composition and complexity to produce IL-10-- pups colonized with the desired maternal GM profiles.

In addition we found that in both B6 and C3H IL-10-- mice there was a greater relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria in the GMJAX and GMTAC profiles and greater relative abundance of genus Sutterella genus Bilophila and family Enterobacteriaceae in the B6 IL-10-- mice and genus Sutterella in the C3H IL- 10-- mice.

Again no differences were found in lesion severity between males and females in the GM groups examined.Diversity and Composition of GM Profiles Differ Following Disease OnsetTo evaluate the contribution of the GM in the differential disease severity observed between mice cecal contents were characterized via sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene.
