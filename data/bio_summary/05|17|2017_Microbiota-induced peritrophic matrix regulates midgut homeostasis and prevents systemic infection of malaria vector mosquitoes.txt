together these data are suggestive of a model whereby the presence of an intact peri- trophic matrix facilitates the efficient clearance of bacteria from the gut after blood bolus diges- tion while co-localization of the gut bacteria and the peritrophic matrix may be a pre-requisite of this.the peritrophic matrix prevents dissemination of the midgut microbiota into the body cavityin drosophila and other insects one function of a local gut immune response is to prevent or minimize systemic immune induction arising from an oral infection.

this could suggest that the bacteria that are directly associated with the peritrophic matrix are efficiently excreted with the blood bolus whilst those located in the ectoperitrophic space remain in the gut seeding the bacterial population in the next gonotrophic cycle.in addition to local effects in the gut we observe the induction of a systemic immune response upon disruption of the peritrophic matrix and show that this is associated with the break down in the integrity of the gut barrier and translocation of bacteria of the enterobacter- iaceae family into the body cavity.

the funders had no role in studyincrease of the gut microbiota but little is known about the mechanisms by which the mos- quito controls this bacterial growth whilst limiting inflammation of the gut epithelium.

we also show that the peritrophic matrix plays a role in resistance to the enterobacter- iaceae bacteria present in the gut microbiota both reducing the extent to which this family of bacteria grows and persists within the gut and precluding this family of bacteria from seeding a systemic infection.resultsrna sequencing analysis of microbiota-dependent expression in the gutto explore the transcriptional response to the dynamic changes in microbiota load over the blood feeding cycle we sequenced rna extracted from a. coluzzii midguts at five time points 2-3 day old mosquitoes that had accessed only fructose since emergence sugar-fed 'sf' 5h 24h and 72h after a human blood meal and 24h 96h after a second human blood meal that was given at the 72h time point.

in order to confirm that the effect of polyoxin d on the immune response in the gut was due to disruption of the peritrophic matrix as opposed to any direct effect of polyoxin d on gut bacteria or the cells of the epithelium we sought an independent method of peritrophic matrix disruption.

we observed the majority of staining in the periphery of the gut suggesting possible co-localization of the gut bacteria with the peritrophic matrix .we next used gram staining to investigate this localization further in both control and polyoxin d treated guts.

again this systemic immune response was fully dependent on the presence of the microbiota .mechanistically we considered that this could occur either via translocation of live bacteria from the gut to the hemocoel or via bacteria or mosquito-derived molecules signaling from the gut to the hemocoel.

the presence of the gut microbiota in the tick i. scapularis has also been shown to be necessary for production of a peritrophic matrix of proper thickness with this being dependent on stat signalling .finally a proteomic analysis of the type ii peritrophic matrix of the tsetse fly identified 27 pro- teins derived from the secondary endosymbiont sodalis glossinidius suggesting similar interac- tion of this bacterium with the peritrophic matrix .in the mosquito gut the microbiota is also known to induce the imd pathway .

here we investigate the gut epithelial response to the changing microbiota load upon blood feed- ing in the malaria vector anopheles coluzzii.

we show that the synthesis and integrity of the peritrophic matrix which physically separates the gut epithelium from its luminal contents is microbiota dependent.

we reveal that the peritrophic matrix limits the growth and persis- tence of enterobacteriaceae within the gut whilst preventing seeding of a systemic infec- tion.

our results demonstrate that the peritrophic matrix is a key regulator of mosquito gut homeostasis and establish functional analogies between this and the mucus layers of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract.design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist.introductionmosquitoes of the anopheles genus are responsible for the transmission of plasmodium para- sites the causative agents of malaria.

the study of the anopheles gut microbiota has recently emerged as an important field in an effort to characterize mosquito-parasite interactions in greater depth and to develop new methods to stop disease transmission.

the microbiota have been shown to trigger a constitutive immune response in the mosquito gut epithelium that enhances resistance to parasite infection .
