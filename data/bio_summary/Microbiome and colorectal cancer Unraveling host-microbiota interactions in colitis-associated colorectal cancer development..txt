found that il-10- producing foxp3 cells were enriched at sites of inflammation in ibd patients suggesting that the consequences of chronic inflammation in the gut might not be as simple as treg cell deficiency .

moreover the dysfunction of regulatory t cells or anti-inflammatory cytokines leads to uncontrolled inflammations.opportunistic infections induce intestinal inflammation and crcenteric pathogens especially enteric bacteria interact with host epithelial or immune cells directly to cause gut inflammation in certain scenarios a leading to the development of cac.

the differentiation of b cells to iga-producing plasma cells is activated by various signals from commensal microbiota through dendritic cells t follicular helper cells and intestinal epithelial cells iecs leading to iga mediated opsoniza- tion and neutralization of toxins and bacteria .

for example commensal bacteria in the gut produce vitamin k and most b vitamins some of which are acquired by and benefit the host directly .host-microbiota interactions that cause inflammation and crchomeostasis between the host immune system and the gut micro- biota is essential for maintaining gut health but this dynamic equili- brium is particularly susceptible under certain circumstances and can lead to the development of inflammation and cac.

this review will discuss recent advances in this field of research particularly emphasizing studies that examine the roles of gut microbiota in ibd and cac.composition and functional activities of gut commensal bacteriathe gut microbiota is composed of a complex community of over 100 trillion microbial cells composed predominantly of species from firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria verrucomicrobia and actinobacteria .

recently regulatory macrophage cells cx3cr1high cd11b cd11c mreg cell have been identified as the suppressor of cd4 t-cell proliferation and the inhibitor of colitis in a mouse model implying that dysfunction of mreg cells could also be involved in the pathogenesis of ibd .the role of chronic inflammation in iec gene expression and crcinflammation triggered by both environmental and genetic factors results in a higher risk for the development and progression of various types of cancer including crc  .

cytokines and chemokines produced by inflammatory cells in the colon activate various signaling pathways such as nf-kb erk pi-3k and akt path- ways to either initiate wntb-catenin signaling that promotes cell growth and proliferation or inhibit apoptosis leading to neoplastic transformation c .potential applications and challenges related to the modulation of microbiota for ibd and crc treatmentsrecent research suggests that modulation of gut microbiota compo- sition might represent novel therapeutic or preventative strategies for effective treatments of ibd and crc.

due to the diversity of the gut microbiota it is empirically difficult to define the healthy or diseased-related gut microbiota composition but increasing evidence suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota composition may contribute to the healthy or patholo- gical gut environment .

interestingly similar to patients with ibd patients presenting with crc had similar alterations in the microbiota composition characterized by an in- creased abundance of proteobacteia and decreased firmicutes  suggesting a microbial linkage between ibd inflammation and crc.

nevertheless it is still unclear which bacterial species are essential for the induction of inflammation or crc.a number of factors are known to contribute to dysbiosis in ibd andcrc patients including host genetics inflammation and various environmental factors such as diet drugs etc.

disruption in any of the above mechanisms could result in the over-exposure of microbial antigens to the host's immune system leading to inflammation c and ultimately tumor initiation.increasing mucosal and epithelial permeability a characteristic of ibd raises the possibility of over-exposure of microbiota or pathogens to iecs and immune cells .

paneth cells and immune cells employ various strategies to maintain an equilibrium between microbes and inflammation through clearance of pathogenic microorganisms neutralization of pamps from the intestinal lumen via the secretion of amps lysozymes iga autophagy and phagocytosis.

mice lacking hnf4a were markedly more susceptible to chemical-induced colitis .in addition to the physical barrier provided by both mucous and iecs paneth cells which are highly specialized epithelial secretory cells that mediate host defense against microbes in the small intestine and immune cells play critical roles in monitoring and eradicating adherent microbes or other types of pathogens.

to maintain gut homeostasis treg cells reciprocally suppress inflammation via diverse mechanisms such as the expression of inhibitory cytokines il-10 and il-35 .

patients with genetic mutations in foxp3 that serves as a lineage specification factor of treg cells always develop inflammation in the gut through lympho-cytic infiltration of the intestinal mucosa .
