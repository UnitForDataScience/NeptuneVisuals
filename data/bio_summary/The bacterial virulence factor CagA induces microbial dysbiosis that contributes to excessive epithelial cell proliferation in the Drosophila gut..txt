Because overexpression of the Duox gene is not sufficient for Duox activation at the membrane we were unable to use similar experiments to test its role in epithelial cell proliferation or dysbiosis.Dysbiotic microbiota of CagA transgenic flies is transmissible and sufficient for cell proliferationBased on our findings that the altered gut microbiota of CagA transgenic flies promotes epi- thelial cell proliferation in the midgut we predicted that microbiota of CagA transgenic fliesThe dysbiotic microbiota of CagA transgenic Drosophila is transmissible and promotes pathological proliferation in cohousedDrosophila.

Interestingly cohousing appeared to have no effect on the microbial commu- nity of CagA transgenic flies nor do we see any effect on cell proliferation .From these data we conclude that the altered microbiota of CagA transgenic flies is transmissi- ble with the ability to displace a healthy conventional community and promote increased intestinal epithelial cell proliferation even in control flies.The pro-proliferative effect of a dysbiotic gut microbiota requires interspecies interactionsNext we aimed to identify the specific pro-proliferative component of the dysbiotic microbiota in CagA transgenic flies.

Based on the observed differences in microbiota composition in CagA transgenic flies we conclude that CagA flies harbor an altered gut microbiota from that of con- trol flies.

These data suggest that the proliferation of midgut cells observed in CagA transgenic flies is multifactorial expression of CagA induces cell autonomous proliferation and the altered microbiota promotes cell non- autonomous proliferation.Next we wanted to determine if expression of CagA within the midgut epithelium was responsible for shaping the altered community observed in CagA transgenic flies.

This suggests that microbiota of CagA transgenic flies contributes to a portion of the total increased cell proliferation observed in CV CagA flies as compared to CV controls whereas the remaining portion of proliferation is directly due to expression of CagA.

We con- cluded that the excessive proliferation promoted by the dysbiotic microbiota of CagA trans- genic flies is not dependent upon previously known mechanisms and instead requires unknown interspecies interactions to promote proliferation in the Drosophila gut.DiscussionOur analysis of the H. pylori protein CagA expressed transgenically in the Drosophila adult midgut reveals distinct mechanisms by which this bacterial virulence factor causes excessive epithelial cell proliferation .

Plat- ing revealed that microbiota of the control flies was completely dominated by a single bacterial isolate whereas microbiota of CagA transgenic flies was made up of this same colony type and another distinct colony morphology.

Surprisingly we found the antimi- crobial peptide Diptericin was down-regulated P0.01  and the ROS transporter Duox  was not over-expressed in control and CagA transgenic flies in the absence of gut microbiota suggesting that the observed overexpression of these genes in the CV CagA-express- ing flies is a consequence of the dysbiotic microbiota.

To determine whether microbiota of CagA transgenic flies was capable of invading a control microbiota we first assayed the output microbial community from flies in each housing situation.

In the CagA transgenic flies reared GF we observed a level of cell proliferation intermediate between CV CagA flies and GF control flies .
