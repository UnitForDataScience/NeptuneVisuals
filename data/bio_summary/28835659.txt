we performed sensitivity analyses in which i the effect of azithromycin on microbi- ota composition was assessed among infants with no exposure to non-intervention antibiotics and ii compar- isons were performed for all infants providing stool samples without restriction to per-protocol infants.

the highest-ranking age-discriminatory taxa among infants as determined by spearman's rho included otus classi- fied as faecalibacterium prausnitzii lactobacillus ruminis and dorea formicigenerans supplementary table - all taxa that have been linked with microbiota maturation among infants in bangladesh.azithromycin decreases microbiota diversity via depletion of proteobacteria and akkermansia muciniphila.

pre-enrolment antibiotic exposure was associated with a decrease in the number of otus present at day 0 66.7 - 14.9 vs 74.0 - 13.9 in exposed and non-exposed infants respectively linear regression p  0.009 for the effect of antibiotic exposure after adjusting for age and a corresponding decline in microbiota age based on unweighted unifrac distances from adults which were higher in exposed compared with non-exposed infants 0.837 - 0.048 vs 0.814 - 0.044 linear regression p  0.012. however these discrepancies were no longer evident at day 14 supplementary results supplementary fig.

to further elucidate the potential effects of azithromycin on microbiota composition we used the random forests statistical-learning algorithm to classify infants according to study arm based on the relative abundances of otus on days 0 and 14. as expected models lacked any discriminatory power at day 0 median accuracy during cross-validation 41.7 interquartile range 32.5-51.1 baseline accuracy wherein all infants are assigned to the majority class 50.9. predictive accuracy was higher at day 14 mean accuracy 66.7 interquartile range 58.3-81.8. this represents a rather meagre increase over baseline accuracy 50.9 butfigure 2. impact of azithromycin on the bacterial microbiota.

activity extends to several common bacterial enteropathogens - in the present study azithromycin had both a therapeutic effect among infants infected on day 0 and a prophylactic effect among uninfected infants lasting for at least 12 days after the cessation of treatment.

infants were randomised 11 to receive a 3-day course of azithromycin administered once daily at a dose of 10 mgkg or placebo comprising a syrup of matching colour and taste starting on study day 0. a subset of 120 infants 60 per study arm out of the first 300 enrolled in the study were selected at random for assessment of the bacterial microbiota.
