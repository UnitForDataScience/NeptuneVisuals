In case of IAA content in the rhizospheric sam- ples of the three populations a significantly higher amount was detected in BSA P0.001 137.8-2.1nMmL samples as compared to other populations .Exozymes glucosidases and cellulases and indole acetic acid quantification in rhizosphere of wild and cultivated populations of B. sacra tree.DiscussionThe current study investigated the microbiomes associated with the rhizosphere of three popu- lations of Boswellia sacra tree.

The mean read count of fungal communities was 127-2.1 995-43.2 BSA 98088-5.1 BSD and 75979-103.9 BSW whereas for bacterial communities it was 146650-21.5 BSA 199516-34.9 BSD and 188036-44.9 BSW.

However a considerable progress is also being made in understanding the microbial ecology of the rhizosphere of non-cultivated plant species in natural ecosystems   and how microorganisms influence resource allocation biodiversity and above-ground interactions with herbivores and their natural enemies  .Current study elucidated the fungal and bacterial microbial communities of three B. sacra tree populations which showed a varying response in the metagenomic data output as well as the number of OTUs.

A total of 678Mbp and 1.24Gbp of high quality read data  wasDistribution of fungal and bacterial communities operational taxonomic units OTUs and Chao-1 of each replica from data generated through MiSeq sequencing 16S and ITS of the rhizospheric samples from wild and cultivated rhizosphere of B. sacra tree.generated for fungal and bacterial microbial communities respectively .

The R statistical framework version 2.11 was used for NMDS ordination plots metaMDS beta-dispersion betadis PERMANOVA adonis permutational ANOVA aovp and the estimation of diver- sity indices and PAST v3.01.ResultsMicrobial community diversity associated with the three populations of B. sacraWe assessed the prokaryotic and fungal communities of the rhizosphere of three distinctive populations of B. sacra viz.

The soil struc- ture in these three regions BSA BSD and BSW varied with respect to soil texture pH organic matter and nutrient concentration  which may act as potential selection fac- tors affecting rhizosphere communities and plant growth.

In current study we aimed to elucidate the core fungal and prokaryotic communities and their structure in the three popu- lation of B. sacra tree through detailed metagenomics and bioinformatics approaches.Materials and methodsSampling area and collectionRhizospheric soil samples of Boswellia sacra were collected from three major location at Adonab BSA N1720.47' E05404.51 Dowkah National Park BSD N194.89' E05422.81 and Dow- kah valley BSW N1907.76' E05425.43 respectively in dry summer season.

In case of nMDS of fungal commu- nities all the three populations and their replications were significantly distant a part from each other however BSW and BSD were found closely associated R2  0.78 P0.031.Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling NMDS plots for Bray-Curtis distances of different rhizospheric populations of B. sacra.

Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobac- teria were significantly higher P0.0001 from 5 to 29 in BSD rhizosphere whereas Actino- bacteria was significantly higher in BSW P0.0001 27.
