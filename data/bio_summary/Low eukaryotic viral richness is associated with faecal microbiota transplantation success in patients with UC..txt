while we did not observe any transferred eukaryotic viral families only the full responder patient 1 presented nine transferred phage otus.our results highlight for the first time the importance of the eukaryotic virome in uc.

the fact that the phageome was successfully associated with fmt in cdiwhile eukaryotic viruses seem more relevant in uc suggests that virome interactions are disease specific and fmt guidelines should be tailored to the pathology at hand.nadia conceicao-neto12 ward deboutte1tim dierckx2 kathleen machiels3 jun wang45 kwe claude yinda12 piet maes2marc van ranst2 marie joossens45 jeroen raes45 severine vermeire3 jelle matthijnssens11department of microbiology and immunology ku leuven--university of leuven laboratory of viral metagenomics rega institute leuven belgium 2department of microbiology and immunology ku leuven--university of leuven laboratory of clinical virology rega institute leuven belgium 3translational research center for gastrointestinal disorders targid university hospital leuven ku leuven leuven belgium4department of microbiology and immunology ku leuven - university of leuven laboratory of molecular bacteriology rega institute leuven belgium5center for microbiology vib leuven belgiumcorrespondence to professor jelle matthijnssens department of microbiology and immunology ku leuven - university of leuven laboratory of viral metagenomics rega institute leuven 3000 belgium contributors ncn jr sv and jm designed the experiments.

patient 3 vomited after the first fmt leading to bilateral aspiration and bilateral pneumonia for which the patient was treated for 14 days with broad- spectrum antibiotics.

on patient's request a second fmt was administered 8 weeks later and the patient has been in clinical remission ever since.

however for the eukaryotic virome healthy donors presented a significantly lower richness than patients at baseline  p value0.033.

the published bacteriome analyses on the same cohort showed that responders had significantly higher transferred bacte- rial phylotypes.moreover only the full responder presented transferred phage otus suggesting phage transfer concom- itant with their respective hosts.in summary our study shows that virome prescreening of patients with uc prior to fmt might be a valuable biomarker for response prediction.

these two observations suggest that eukaryotic virome richness is a poten- tial novel diagnostic marker for uc and uc fmt response.

in our study fmt responders already presented a significant lower eukaryotic virome richness than non-responders at baseline  which is a feature of the healthy donors.

it is clear that eukaryotic viruses and phages have different ways of affecting the human host and our findings now highlight the importance of analysing the phageome and eukary- otic virome separately.
