nisin is an efficient tool in the hurdle technol- ogy for food preservation and it was included as biop- reservative ingredient in the european food additive list with the number e234 efsa .in the last years many researchers have applied nisin to inhibit the pathogens related to food manufacturing how- ever only few researches have been carried out on the effect of nisin combined with other preservative tech- nologies on the shelf life of species with high commercial value such as freshwater rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss nykanen et al.

showed that combination of nisin and irradiation can extend the shelf life of minimally processed seer fish steaks in chilled storage.in food systems the antibacterial activity of nisin decreases due to many factors such as enzymatic degra- dation interaction with food components or lability at higher ph values therefore various delivery systems were developed based on the coating of nisin using food grade carbohydrates alginate or lipids gruskiene et al.

in particular the most prominent visual quality characteristic of salmonid fish including the trout is the redpink flesh colour.several strategies have been used to extend the shelf life of fresh fish products and during the recent years the combined treatment through creation of multiple hurdles to control microbial growth in food products is a very prominent strategy.

results showed no inhibitory effects of nisin on biogenic amines accumulation howeverthis preliminary study sets the basis for a possible use of nisin as food preservative not only for its antagonistic activity against bacteria but also for a possible effect on other quality characteristics such as colour in rainbow trout.
