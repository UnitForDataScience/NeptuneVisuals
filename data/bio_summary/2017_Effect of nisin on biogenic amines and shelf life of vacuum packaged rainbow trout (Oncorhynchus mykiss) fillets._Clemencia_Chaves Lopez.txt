In addition to combination of chilling withmodified atmosphere packaging and treatment with per- mitted additives the use of edible coatings has been studied to increase the shelf life of rainbow trout Raeisi et al.

Nisin is an efficient tool in the hurdle technol- ogy for food preservation and it was included as biop- reservative ingredient in the European food additive list with the number E234 EFSA .In the last years many researchers have applied nisin to inhibit the pathogens related to food manufacturing how- ever only few researches have been carried out on the effect of nisin combined with other preservative tech- nologies on the shelf life of species with high commercial value such as freshwater rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Nykanen et al.

These data seem to disagree with studies of Prester  that reported putrescine limit for the quality assesment during rainbow trout shelf life.High histamine levels in species of the Sgombroidae family have been explained with their naturally high free histidine contents Bulushi et al.

3 Biogenic amines index BAI during refrigerated storage of vacuum packaged trout fillets after immersion in control broth CB and broth added with nisin CB-N calculated according both a the formula of Karmas  and b of Veciana-Nogue's et al.

Fur- ther studies are necessary to investigate nisin action mechanism on the colour an important physical charac- teristic involved in the product quality and consumer acceptability.Keywords Nisin  Rainbow trout  Histamine  Biogenic amines index  Colour indexIntroductionIn the last years aquaculture has increased considerably throughout the world and in Italy rainbow trout On- corhynchus mykiss is the principal product FAO .

.Table 1 Characteristics of fresh rainbow trout fillets n  3 ParametersMean - SDand a quality scale ranging from 0 to 3 was used 0-- excellent no defects 3--rejected.Many authors have indicated a good correlation between sensory characteristics and biochemical parameters as total volatile basic nitrogen TVB-N and trimethylamine TMA Ruiz-Capillas and Moral  so the purpose of the present research was to evaluated only odour charac- teristic as suitable indirect index for changes in TVB-N and TMA during storage time.Statistical analysisAll analyses were conducted on each fillet rainbow trout sample six fillets samples were analysed for each inves- tigated parameter before treatment and during the storage time.Analysis of variance ANOVA and multiple mean comparisons with least significant differences LSD test were used to test the significance of difference caused by two factor nisin treatment and time storage.Weight g250.24 - 53.75Moisture content 87.29 - 3.70Water activity0.990 - 0.004pH6.71 - 0.07Maximum cutting force N11.87 - 3.96L48.79 - 2.69a2.85 - 0.64b10.48 - 2.38Microbiota Log CFU g-1Total mesophilic counts5.5 - 0.37Total psychroctrophic counts5.54 - 0.42Yeasts1Lactic acid bacteria2Enterobacteracaee2.47 - 0.41Pseudomonadacae5.10 - 0.53Enterococci3.2 - 0.15Staphylococci2Coliforms3.1 - 0.2As evidenced in Table  the low levels of microor- ganisms at the beginning of storage indicate the good quality of the raw material.

In the present study the putrescine content in raw fish was6.4 - 0.9 mg kg-1 confirming a state of excellent fresh- ness of the raw fillets employed in this research.Change of quality indexes during the storage of treated rainbow trout filletsFresh fish including rainbow trout is more susceptible to deterioration than meat.

Enzymatic and chemical reaction are usually responsible for the initial loss of freshness while microbial activity is responsible for subsequent spoilage Mohan et al.
