Taking into consideration that the foliar nitrogen feeding was performed during the veraison and the study was carried out during the grape harvest the lack of relevant changes in the microbial diversity could mean that the foliar application did not exert any effect on the grape surface.Only in the must samples were significant differences observed in the alpha diversity in control samples and samples after the foliar urea application.

Empty slices mean genera belonging to AAB light grey slices mean genera belonging to LAB dark grey slices mean genera determined as environmental bacteria and dotted slices mean genera belonging to yeast and fungus groups.were found among them 5 LAB the two detected in sample C g-d and Ln.

The LAB group was represented by 3 genera with the most abundant being Leuconostoc the mycobiota was repre- sented by 6 genera with Aureobasidium as the most frequently detected one finally 11 genera made up the EB group with Pseudomonas as the most important one.

Finally when ZPP was employed for grape incubation E it was possible to detect that the 2 genera of AAB were detected with Gluconobacter themost relevant one the other 5 were LAB with Lactobacillus and Oenococcus as the main genera and 5 were EB with Pseudomonas as the most abundant genus.MustsThe incubation of must in GYP A allowed the detection by DGGE of 5 yeast genera with Hanseniaspora the most frequent.

The AAB species were not very different in the control samples to those in the treated ones so no important effect on the species composition was observed after foliar feeding in grapes and it was not found in must samples.The non-enriched infusion showed a slight increase in the LAB spe- cies after the foliar treatment with urea with some species appearing which are traditionally detected in must and wine samples such as L. plantarum and Ln.

Eighteen genera formed a heterogenic group named as environmental bacteria EB-Zymomonas Burkholderia Collimonas Massilia Rhizobium Sphingomonas Citrobacter Enterobacter Erwinia Klebsiella Pantoea Rhodovolum Staphylococcus Microbacterium Pseudomonas Bacillus Geobacillus and Sporolactobacillus-.GrapesThe genera detected in the non-enriched media PT and in the five enriched media GYP DBDM MRS Mann and ZPP of the grape infu- sions are described below .

7 yeasts that were the same as those described in the Phe sample m-e and 8 EB from the genera Burkholderia Collimonas Massilia Rhi- zobium Staphylococcus Enterobacter and Sporolactobacillus.Diversity indicesThe average diversity indices assessed with the species forming each grape and must replicate are shown in  along with the statistical analyses assessed for the different samples in grape and must samples from enriched and non-enriched media.

The AAB genera were well defined by the non-enriched and enriched infusions of grape samples and for the must samples in Mann and ZPP media prior to DGGE.

lactis 4 yeast and fungi genera such as Alternaria Botrytis Davidiella and Aureobasidium and 5 EB of genera Pantoea Pseudomonas and Bacillus.Taking into account the five enriched infusions employed for grapes g-e different species were found as shown in .
