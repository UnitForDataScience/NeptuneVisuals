However only 128 of the 220 orthologous genes could be reliably annotated as essential against the DEG database  whereas the remaining 92 accessory genes still coded for basic metabolic functions.Pangenome analysis of the 27 Novosphingobium strains  identified 21915 nonredundant nonrepetitive genes in the pangenome out of 128647 total genes.

The analysis revealed that the genes encoding PAH and components involved in xenobiotic degradation were enriched in Novosphingobium strains  among which freshwater strains showed similarity in genes encoding mono- and dioxygenases with very similar metabolic profiles while strains from the other three habitats clustered separately and .

The genome completeness was estimated by analyzing the presence of 107 essential copy genes using the Comprehensive Microbial Resource as a database where 107 hidden Markov models HMMs of essential copy genes were analyzed in all of the Novosphingobium strains .Pangenomic and core genomic trend analysis.

Examining the available genomes of ecologically diverse bacterial species and analyzing the habitat-specific genes are useful for understanding the distribution and evolution of functional and phylogenetic diversity in the genus Novosphingobium.KEYWORDS Novosphingobium core genome habitat-specific genes pangenome regulatory hubshe genus Novosphingobium represents metabolically versatile members that be- long to the class Alphaproteobacteria and family Sphingomonadaceae .

The orthologous gene contents for Novosphingobium strains in four habitats were identified and a pairwise comparison was performed to obtain habitat-specific genes.

These habitat-specific genes were annotated against the KAAS server  but only 211 rhizospheric 125 contaminated soil 54 marine and 150 freshwater genes could be annotated with a KEGG Orthology KO identifier.

Freshwater- specific gene content contain genes encoding components involved in alanine aspar- tate and glutamate metabolism and marine water-specific gene content contain genes encoding components involved in the bacterial chemotactic regulatory pathway which could be involved in nutrient acquisition in this normally oligotrophic environment.

The x axis shows the number of genomes and the y axis shows the core genome size number of genes of Novosphingobium spp.

ANI whole genome based and 400 conserved bacterial marker genes could be due to the inclusion of pangenomic content in the case of the whole genome ANI rather than the conserved marker genes.
