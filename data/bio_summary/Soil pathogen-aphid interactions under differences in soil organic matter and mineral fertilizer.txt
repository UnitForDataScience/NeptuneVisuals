Also herewe tested whether residuals followed a normal distribution using Shapiro-Wilk tests resulting in pln1 transformation of the data.All analyses were performed with R 3.2.2 R Core Team.ResultsEffect of mineral fertilizer supply and SOM on plant- and aphid biomass and plant CN ratioFertilizer supply had a positive effect on aboveground plant biomass but only under low SOM conditions whereas high SOM content had only a positive effect on plant biomass under low mineral fertilizer supply .

Plant bio- mass was neither related to leaf CN ratio r  -0.01 P  0.90 nor to aphid biomass r  -0.00 P  0.99 but leaf CN ratio was negatively related to aphid biomass r  0.76 P0.0001.Effect of adding R. solani on plant- and aphid biomass under different soil conditionsThe addition of Rhizoctonia solani affected both plant and aphid biomass in unsterilized soils but the effects were different depending on the soil conditions soil organic matter SOM con- tent and fertilizer supply .

These different responses of plant biomass production and CN ratio to SOM and fertilizer could explain why an increase in SOM content could have a smaller positive effect on aphid biomass than mineral fertilizer supply while the effect on plant biomass is similar.

Poten- tially an R. solani infection increases immunity of the crop plant against aphids in some situations.Our second hypothesis was that mineral fertilizer supply would reduce plant CN ratio more than an increase in SOM content so that aphid biomass will be higher under enhanced mineral fertilizer supply than under enhanced SOM content.

To study the effect of SOM on aphid performance independent of all other physical chemical and biological properties of the soil that might affect yield and aphid performance we obtained the two SOM treatments by mixing different proportions of two soil layers that differed in SOM but that originated from the same area.

In soils with low SOM content R. solani addi- tion tended to decrease aphid biomass whereas it tended to increase aphid biomass in soil with high SOM content  resulting in a significant interaction between SOM and R. solani addition .

Here we examine how soil organic matter SOM and mineral fertilizer influence interactions among a pathogenic soil fungus a crop plant and an aboveground aphid.In natural ecosystems as well as in agro-ecosystems most plant species are attacked by numerous herbivores and pathogens that simultaneously subtract energy and nutrients from the plant .

However the effect of fertilizer supply changed with SOM content  in soil with high SOM content the positive effect of fertilizer supply on aphid biomass was greater than in soil with the lower SOM content .

2 Mineral fertilizer supply reduces plant CN ratio more than an increase in SOM content so that aphid biomass will be higher under enhanced mineral fertilizer supply than under enhanced SOM content.

Here we demonstrate that a belowground pathogen may also influence aboveground plant-insect interactions and we show that effects depend on soil organic matter SOM content and mineral fertilizer supply.We hypothesized that Rhizoctonia solani addition would lead to a decrease in plant biomass and an increase in aphid biomass and that enhanced SOM content and mineral fertilizer sup- ply would reduce these effects.
