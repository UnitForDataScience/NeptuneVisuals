Moreover these two methods are frequently used in many recent microbiome studies and thus can potentially provide the added bonus of allowing for comparative analysis of the mycobiota across a range of studies as well as facilitating a retrospective analysis of the mycobiome using stored DNA samples that were extracted using these approaches.A number of the most commonly used primer sets that target the ITS region were selected for this study.

Moreover the effect of freezing on samples prior to DNA extraction which is often the norm following sample collection and for example is known to affect the rumen gut mycobiome   on human gut mycobiota analysis has not been evaluated.

The aim of this study is to provide a comparative analysis of several previously published mycobiome- specific culture-dependent and -independent methodologies including choice of culture media incubation conditions aerobic versus anaerobic DNA extraction method primer set and freezing of fecal samples to assess their relative merits and suitability for gut mycobiome analysis.

With respect to the choice of sequencing platform a comparative analysis of different NGS platforms has already been performed using mock fungal communities and shown that Illumina MiSeq platform outperforms others for mycobiome analysis  hence this platform was employed for this study.Our experimental design and analysis allowed us to investigate variation in the gut mycobiome of individuals and across culture-dependent and -independent methods.

In particular no comparative analysis has been performed to assess the suitability of different DNA extraction methods and PCR primers for fungal specific surveys of the human gut microbiome.Despite being a relatively new research area    a number of studies on the human gut mycobiome have been published.

Freezing of samples significantly reduced the recovery of culturable fungi from samples with one freeze thaw cycle resulting in approximately a 10-fold reduction in fungal numbers post freezing compared to fresh samples p  0.0001 repeated measures ANOVA adjusted p  0.01 Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test .We isolated a number of morphologically different fungal taxa which were subsequently identified using Sanger sequencing of the entire ITS region and have been summarized in and Supplementary Table S1.

Four samples were also extracted post storage at 80C using these three extraction methods.PCR and Primer ChoicePCR primers which have been previously employed to target the fungal ITS region from DNA isolated from a range of different environments  were used to amplify our extracted DNA.Library PreparationThe primer set ITS1F and ITS2 was used for library preparation after modification to contain the Illumina sequencing adapters to allow for sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq.
