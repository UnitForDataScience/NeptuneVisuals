European Journal of Cancer 84 2017 60e68OutcomesPrimary outcome was the first newly diagnosed cancer defined by the International Classification of Disease 10th edition grouped into 16 anatomical loca- tions eTable 1 grouped into three larger groups of cancer 'reproductive organ cancers' invasive breast endometrial and ovarian cancer 'gastrointestinal can- cers' oesophageal gastric pancreatic gallbladder bile ducts liver colon and rectal cancer and 'other cancers' among the 10 most common non-haematological ma- lignancies globally or in Sweden lung cancer malignant melanoma central nervous system tumours kidney and thyroid cancer .Statistical analysisStandardised incidence ratios SIRs with 95 confi- dence intervals CIs were calculated to estimate the relative risk of cancer.

Nevertheless this alone should not explain the differences on the cancer risk shown by various MHT regimens such as for invasive breast cancer.The results for the major cancer types are consistent with findings from studies examining separate cancer sites.

However studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess the safety of different MHT formulations.Although the overall risk of cancer was lower for E- MHT than EP-MHT these results were not consistent for all cancer types.In conclusion this large cohort study indicates a slight increase of overall cancer among MHT users.

A reduced risk has been indicated for some gastrointestinal cancers e yet for other cancer types the evidence is inconsistent e. Most studies have examined only one cancer type and grouped different MHT regi- mens together sometimes also including non-systemic MHT.

Moreover there has been a great variation in the definition of MHT use and in the age of the study populations across studies .Whilst detailed studies of individual cancer sites are crucial for causal inference data on the net effect of MHT on total cancer risk are relevant for counselling and management of women with menopausal related symptoms .

Follow-up time was calculated from the index date until the diagnosis date of any first cancer except for non- melanoma skin cancer death or end of follow-up whichever occurred first taking into account changes in the age categories and calendar periods .

The 16 pre-defined cancer sites comprised the majority 81 of all incident cancers among MHT users.All cancerThe risk of any cancer was 9 increased among MHT ever-users SIR Z 1.09 95 CI 1.07e1.11 .

The risk of all cancer and risk of each cancer type analysed was similar for all duration groups.

In this group MHT was primarily prescribed by general practitioners 37 and gynaecologists 31 but the indication of use is unfortunately not recorded in the Swedish Drug Registry .This study also indicates that MHT reduces the risk of gastrointestinal cancer with the most pronounced associations for oesophageal liver and colon cancers which were also consistent with a more in-depth analysis of our group showing reduced risks of both major his- tological subtypes of oesophageal cancer adenocarci- noma and squamous cell carcinoma For other cancers evidence is less clear and there may be differ- ences by histological subtype which were not explored further in the present study.
