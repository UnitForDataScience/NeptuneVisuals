in the melanocortin-4- receptor mc4r 3 it is generally accepted that genetic factors can only explain part of the obesity epidemic.low-grade inflammation related to obesity was initially described in adipose tissue 4-6. in 2005 the first study was published suggesting that inflammation might also occur in the hypothalamus of obese animals 7. in this index study long term feeding of rats with a high-fat diet induced mbh inflammation and this induced hypothalamic leptin resistance associated with the development of obesity 7. histologically hypothalamic inflammation is characterized by gliosis which involves infiltration of microglia and proliferation of astrocytes resulting in increased cell density 8. in animal models mbh inflammation and gliosis is detectable even before body weight gain suggesting that hypothalamic inflammation might indeed be causative in the pathophysiology of obesity 9.while the findings of hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis were confirmed by several independent groups in rodent and non-human primate animal models 8-10 human data onhypothalamic inflammation are still rare.

in addition in animal experiments it has been shown that hypothalamic inflammation proceeds the body weight gain 9 also suggesting that the mbh pathology is not the result of the obesity-associated insulin resistance.in the present study we recruited our non-obese and obese probands from the focus cohort in kiel a cohort of n1326 cross-sectional controls and n511 obese subjects to investigate the relation of nutrition microbiome and inflammation 15 27 28. the obese subjects in the focus cohort were recruited via our outpatient obesity clinics.

using this approach they convincingly confirmed that mri is indeed detecting hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis validating that this technique is a reliable method for detecting surrogate markers of mbh inflammation in human studies.in the present study we examined non-obese and obese subjects by combining brain mri detailed nutritional analysis 16s rdna microbiome sequencing and array-based genotyping to gain further insights into hypothalamic inflammation in human obesity.research design and methodsmri imaging and spectroscopy the mri examinations were performed on a 3t mri scannerachieva phillips medical systems eindhoven with a 32-channel head coil.

and marinilabiliaceae with the mbhamygdala signal ratio was significant within the obese patients group suggesting a direct association of the gut microbiome and the inflammatory hypothalamic pathology.several animal models indicate that nutritional factors such as a high fat diet induce hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis 8 9. in addition nutrition is known to influence the gut microbiome heavily 31 32. thus we next examined if macronutrients are associated with the abundance of the two gut microbes which had been identified to be associated with mbh-t2- hyperintensity.

2. it is worth mentioning that the association of il6 and mbh-t2-hyperintensity l was also seen when examining obese subjects only p0.01 rho0.35 n54.hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis in human obesity is not associated with a reducedneuronal cell counthaving found that hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis is present in the left mbh of obese humans we next aimed to examine if the inflammatory reaction is associated with a destruction of neurons which would suggest irreversibility of the process.

however one caveat is that nutritional questionnaires rely on self-reporting of the probands and must therefore be interpreted with care.common polymorphisms in the c-jun n-terminal kinase jnk gene or in the melanocortin-4-receptor mc4r gene increase the individual susceptibility to hypothalamic inflammation andgliosisso far the data obtained suggest that environmental factors such as the gut microbiome are important in mediating hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis in humans.

in addition since adipose tissue 25 and liver inflammation 26 are also known to reverse much more slowly after weight loss compared to insulin resistance it can be speculated that after a longer observational period beneficial changes in hypothalamic inflammation would become detectable.the findings of the present study suggest that hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis are more associated with the overall systemic low-grade inflammation in obesity rather than with metabolic abnormalities e.g.

the individual susceptibility to nutritional components.several limitations of our study have to be pointed out i we are only providing data on associations and correlations and therefore we cannot prove causality ii the voxel in the hypothalamus l that were used for mrs analyses may have variable overlap with the coronal rois placed for t2 ratio iii nutritional data were obtained by self-reported questionnaires and might therefore be biased and iv the number of subjects undergoing bariatric surgery may have been too small to detect significant effects on hypothalamic inflammation.conclusionsin conclusion we present a prospective translational study of the role of hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis in human obesity.

mri-spectroscopy revealed the number of neurons in the left hypothalamic region to be similar in obese versus control subjects suggesting functional but not structural impairment due to the inflammatory process.

we performed a candidate gene approach by focusing on four factors previously described to be associated with either hypothalamic inflammation and gliosis in animal models jnk and nf-kb7 or human obesity mc4r fto 3 21. as shown in figure 4 this analysis revealed anincreased mbhamygdala signal ratio l to be associated with a common snp in the jnk gene p0.01 rs1062225 as well as with a common snp in the mc4r gene promoter region p0.04 rs11872992 within the obese patients.

no significant association was found for common snps in the nf-kb or fto gene after multiple testing correction bonferroni.weight loss and improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity due to bariatric surgery does notaffect hypothalamic inflammation and gliosisin a subgroup n10 of the obese individuals of the present study we also examined the mbh inflammation and gliosis in response to bariatric surgery.

of interest we found no significant difference in the left hypothalamic region in non-obese versus obese individuals suggesting that the number of neurons is not negatively affected by the immune process and the gliosis.

in contrast to mbh-t2-intensity within the obese group metabolic parameters homa bmi did not show a significant association with the mc4r and jnk snp tested again suggesting that other factors than the metabolic phenotype trigger hypothalamic inflammation e.g.
