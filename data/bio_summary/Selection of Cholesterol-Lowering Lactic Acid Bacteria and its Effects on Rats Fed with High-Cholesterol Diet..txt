the rats of the model group exhibited the highest liver index andsignificantly differed from the control group p  0.05. the liver indexes of groups that received the strain lp96 solu- tion were lower than those of the model group and the dif- ferences were significant p  0.05. liver tc and tg con- tents of rats are shown in fig.

the body weight of the model group was higher than the other groups and the difference between the model group and the control group was significantp  0.05 but the differences between the model group and the groups that received the strain lp96 solution were not significant p  0.05. during the first 3 weeks the bodyweights of rats increased fast and gradually slowed down at the end of 2 weeks.

the groups of rats that received the strain lp96 solution did not increase the hdl-c content significantly compared with the model group which was in agreement with previous results  and the differences among the high group the middle group and the low group were not significant p  0.05. as exhibited in fig.

the control group received the commercial diet and a sterile normal saline solution gastric gavage the high-cholesterol model group received high- cholesterol diet and a sterile normal saline solution the low-cholesterol group received high-cholesterol diet and a concentration of 107 cfu ml-1 resuspended strain solu- tion the middle group received high-cholesterol diet and a concentration of 108 cfu ml-1 strain solution and the high group received high-cholesterol diet and a concentration of 109 cfu ml-1 strain solution.

the groups were arranged according to the liver tc content as follows model group  low group  middle group  high group  control group.

in this study the strains lp37 lpn21 and lp96 had shown strong adhesion ability to ht-29 cells and this indicated that these strains could attach strongly to the intestine and not be swept away from the colon by peri- stalsis and flowage of intestinal contents once the reached the intestine.in conclusion from the results of the characteristic tests of cholesterol assimilation acid and bile salt toler- ances cell adhesion ability it was found that the strains lp96 and lp157 showed high tolerance to artificial acidic conditions and had strong resistance to bile salt and assimilated nearly same cholesterol level but as the strain lp96 was excellent at adsorbability lp96 was selected for further research.

oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis  therefore we test for the antioxidative effect of the strain lp96 on the rats and the results demonstrated that the strain lp96 had an antioxidative effect on the rats fed with high-cholesterol diet in terms of the significantly increased sod and cat activities in serum.intestinal microbiota in the cecum of ratsintestinal bacterial flora plays a central role in human intestinal health and disease .

in vivo results showed that the strain lp96 was effec- tive in reducing the tg tc and ldl-c levels in serums and had the potential ability to reduce the hypercholes- terolemic risk which was in agreement with the earliergroups of rats mode group4.91 - 0.24alow group4.71 - 0.21ab middle group 4.35 - 0.20b high group4.22 - 0.25bc control group 3.63 - 0.16dvalues are expressed as mean -standard errors n  5means with different superscript letters are significantly different p  0.05observations on the hypocholesterolemic activity of lacto- bacillus  .liver indexes and liver tg and tc contentsthe results of liver index are shown in table .

the result demonstrated that the strain lp96 had improved the health of intestinal flora and that the higher the concentration of the strain lp96 solution the better the improvement.the tremendous potentials of good quality food with viable probiotics in promoting and maintaining health has been widely accepted in the worldwide such as supple- mentation of diet with fermented dairy products or dairy foods containing abundant lactobacillus strains to decrease serum cholesterol concentrations.
