In this study the strains LP37 LPN21 and LP96 had shown strong adhesion ability to HT-29 cells and this indicated that these strains could attach strongly to the intestine and not be swept away from the colon by peri- stalsis and flowage of intestinal contents once the reached the intestine.In conclusion from the results of the characteristic tests of cholesterol assimilation acid and bile salt toler- ances cell adhesion ability it was found that the strains LP96 and LP157 showed high tolerance to artificial acidic conditions and had strong resistance to bile salt and assimilated nearly same cholesterol level but as the strain LP96 was excellent at adsorbability LP96 was selected for further research.

Accordingdid not assimilate cholesterol during growth in laboratoryTable 2 Adhesive capacity ofStrainsAdhesive numberconditions had no effect on serum cholesterol in vivo and a strain that actively assimilated cholesterol in vitro had significant effects on serum cholesterol reduction in vivo .

The results demonstrated that the levels of serum triglyc- eride TG total cholesterol TC low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and liver TC and TG were reduced significantly in the groups that received the strain LP96 solution com- pared with the model group and that the serum high-den- sity lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased without any significant difference.

Ten LAB strains LPN5 LP130 LP183 LPZ LPN21 LP192B LPB LP96LP37 and LP157 were able to remove cholesterol more than the other strains and the RR ranged from 31.88 for the strain LPN5 to 43.01 for the strain LP157 and the variances among the 10 strains were not significant P  0.05.

The result demonstrated that the strain LP96 had improved the health of intestinal flora and that the higher the concentration of the strain LP96 solution the better the improvement.The tremendous potentials of good quality food with viable probiotics in promoting and maintaining health has been widely accepted in the worldwide such as supple- mentation of diet with fermented dairy products or dairy foods containing abundant Lactobacillus strains to decrease serum cholesterol concentrations.

Not all strains could remove cholesterol from MRS-CHO broth containing cholesterol and bile salt.

Based on the result we selected the strains that were better capable in lowering cholesterol and identified those strains through 16S rRNA gene sequences.at the bottom of each well.

This result indicated that the high-cholesterol diet and the receiving of the LP96 strain solution had affected the growth of rats.Serum Cholesterol Levels of RatsThe increase of HDL-C is one of the factors in reducing the risk of CHD  and LDL-C is the main component of serum cholesterol and often termed as bad cholesterol which may lead to CHD due to its contribution to the for- mation of atheroma .

The ten strains all had above 85 survival rates after 3-h exposure to acid this indicated that all the strains had high tolerance to acid and the three strains LP37 LP130 and LPZ showed the highest tolerance ability against acid.
