This review summarizes currently available knowledge about endophytic colonization by bacteria in various plant species and specifically discusses the colonization of maize plants by Populus endophytes.Keywords bacterial endophytes colonization microscopy Populus endophytesIntroductionThe term endophyte is derived from the Greek words endon meaning within and phyton meaning plant.

While studying colonization of maize plants by endophyte H. seropedicae Balsanelli et al.

More recently Hardoim et al.

The importance of quorum sensing compounds for plant-microbe interactions has been reviewed in detail by Hartmann et al.

In addition Wagner et al.

A recent colonization study in rice plants using G. diazotrophicus Pal5 showed that bacterial cells were shielded from oxidative damage by exopolysaccharides which may be crucial for colonization.

In another study Balsanelli et al.

analyzed the mutant strains of Herbaspirillum seropedicae that are deficient in EPS production and concluded that EPS is not required for plant colonization which could potentially point to a variation in the genes required for colonization across different endophyte species .

Bacterial adherence and colonization of the root interior likely happen in close succession given how quickly colonization is observed in roots after inoculation with bacterial endophytes -.
