as water table drawdown reduces the content of labile carbon and increases the concentration of aromatic carboxylic and phenolic compounds in peatlands blodau and siems  urbanova' and ba'rta  it may favor oligotrophs and reduce copiotrophs.in order to predict the responses of prokaryotic microbiota in different depths to water table drawdown we studied three peatlands with different water tables across four depths and tested the following hypothesis water table drawdown de- creases the diversity of prokaryotic microbiota in different pat- terns at different depths and changes the community structure mainly via decreasing copiotrophs and increasing oligotrophs.material and methodsstudy site description and sample collectionzoige peatlands are located in the northeast of the qinghai- tibetan plateau belonging to the cold qinghai-tibetan climatic zone with an annual average temperature of 1.5c and pre- cipitation of 720 mm chen et al.

in this research the domi- nance of 7 out of 13 dominant phyla was associated with ph including that of bacteroidetes euryachaeota and others sup- plementary table s7.the difference of prokaryotic microbiota between low water table peatland l and intermediate water table peatland m was significant p  0.001 whereas the variation between high water table peatland h and intermediate water table peatland m was not p  0.166 fig.

our study illuminates that the variations of prokaryotic communities caused by water table drawdown are depth-dependent and that water table drawdown leads to predictive changes of microbiota in peatlands.keywords water table depth prokaryotic community diversity peatlandreceived 8 january 2017 accepted 15 april 2017qc fems 2017. all rights reserved.
