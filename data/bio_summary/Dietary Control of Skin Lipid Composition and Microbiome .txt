We conclude that maintaining animals on an HFD impacts the lipid composition of the skin.To investigate whether animals maintained on a normal diet or HFD display differences in the skin micro- biome we performed metagenomic 16S-sequencing.

Using the unbiased linear discriminant analysis effect size pipeline  multiple differences become apparent at the species level c. In particular bacteria from the Corynebacterium genus appeared to favor hosts on an HFD exemplified by the lipophilic Corynebacterium bovis which goes from barely detectable to being essen- tially the dominant species in the HFD group c. Interestingly Cory- nebacterium is part of the normal hu- man and animal skin microbiome but these species are often abundant in moist sites  where they can cause skin infections such as erythrasma trichomycosis and pitted keratolysis  .

Reports illustrate that a high-fat diet HFD changes the microbiome and influences cancer development  .

Therefore we set out to address how changes in diet affect overall skin homeostasis potentially shaping skin- specific microbiota.Animals were split into two groups and fed either a 60 kcal fat diet HFD or a caloric neutral 10 kcal fat diet normal diet.

As expected the HFD was associated with significant weight gain a and b. Histologic assessment of skin samples revealed a relative increase in maximum thickness of the hypodermis as the only obvious difference between the groups cee.

We speculate that the HFD resets skin homeostasis via influ- encing cutaneous immune cells and enhanced adipogenic activity thereby creating a microenvironment that sup- ports a specialized microbiome.

This needs to be further substantiated by additional studies.In conclusion HFD alters the overall lipid composition of the skin and is associated with changes of the microbial habitat illustrating the widespread consequences of our life- style on tissue homeostasis and the complex interactions with our imme- diate environment.ETHICS STATEMENTAll animal experiments were approved by the Danish National Animal Ethics Committee.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors state no conflict of interest.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported by grants from the Innovation Foundation Denmark 5158-00023A Lundbeck Foundation R105-A9755 the Danish Cancer Society the A.P.
