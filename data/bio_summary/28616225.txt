However among the three lactobacilli the supplementation of L. reuteri G8-5 was the least effective in enhancing the growth performance of piglets which was in line with the previous study in the rat experiment The rea- son is probably associated with the strain's lower anti- microbial activity compared with the other two strains which was reported in the previous study .Increased lactobacilli in faeces from lactobacilli-treated piglets on both d 14 and d 28 in this study verified the ability of the three lactobacilli to maintain the balance of microbiota which was one of the possible mechanisms of lactobacilli as probiotics in vivo Meanwhile the modulation of intestinal microbiota by lactobacilli might be strain-insensitive since all the three lactobacilli used in the study showed the same ability as intestinal flora improvers.

It is assumed that the increasing intestinal microbial abundance caused by antibiotics or lactobacilli has more power to resist the disruption of microbial bal- ance Further analysis on the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract treated by lactobacilli and antibi- otics by PCR-DGGE was investigated for the comparisonTable 4 Differentially expressed proteins in the ileum mucosa of piglets supplemented by three lactobacilli in diets compared with antibioticsa Spot No.

Sup- plementation of lactobacilli in diets could significantly increase the relative 16S rRNA gene copies of lactobacilli genus on both d 14 and d 28 and the bacterial commu- nity profile based on PCR-DGGE from the lactobacilli are distinctly different from the antibiotics group.

They shared strain-related in vitro functional properties in- cluding antimicrobial activity amylolytic activity and bile-salt-hydrolase activity respectively  Meanwhile from the in vivo studies in rats the three Lactobacillus species showed some similar beneficial effects and some of the functionalities to rats were strain-specific When used in swine nutrition the lactobacilli were hy- pothesized to interact with the intestinal flora and with the host mucosa which might be associated with the mechanism of lactobacilli as probiotics.

showed similar results after summarizing above 20 published papers on lactobacilli used in feed additives  The phenomena suggest that Lactobacillus strains may benefit their hosts through different mechanisms and more work should be done to explore the relationship between the choice of strains and their in vivo behaviours Nowadays the selection of Lactobacillus is often based on the strains' activities in vitro which is expected to show corresponding effectiveness in vivo.

The objective of the present study was to study the in vivo effects of the three lactobacilli on growth performance and to compare the differential effects of the strains on the faecal microbiota and ileum mucosa proteomics of piglets.Methods Three hundred and sixty piglets were assigned to one of four treatments which included an antibiotics- treated control and three experimental groups supplemented with the three lactobacilli L. salivarius G1-1 L. reuteri G8-5 and L. reuteri G22-2 respectively.

More experiments are needed in order to document the potential beneficial effects of the lactobacilli strains for the piglets notably in terms of mucosal health.ConclusionsIn conclusion this study provides a comprehensive com- parison of three lactobacilli with strain-specific activities through the supplementation in piglet diets.
