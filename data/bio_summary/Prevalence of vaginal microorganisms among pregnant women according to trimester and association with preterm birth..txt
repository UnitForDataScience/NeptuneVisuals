Among abnormal vaginal flora isolated in the 2nd trimester the presence of Klebsiella pneumonia was identified as significant microorganism associated with preterm delivery before 28 weeks of gestation 50 vs. 0.7 for K. pneumonia P0.029.ConclusionThere is an association between abnormal vaginal colonization detected in the 2nd trimester and preterm delivery before 28 weeks.

We classified participants into 3 groups according to the trimester in which vaginal culture was performed 1st trimester n221 2nd trimester n138 and 3rd trimester n234.

We classified the study population into 3 groups according to the trimester in which vaginal culture was performed 1st trimester n221 2nd trimester n138 and 3rd trimester n234 group.

However our study could be a basis for further studies on abnormal vaginal colo- nization in association with preterm delivery by suggesting that the 2nd trimester may be the most critical time to per- form vaginal cultures.It is noteworthy that in this study we focused on individual vaginal microorganisms and their association with adverse pregnancy outcome including miscarriage and preterm de- livery.

Interestingly it has been previ- ously shown that macrolides and clindamycin administered during the 2nd trimester were associated with a lower rate of preterm birth while metronidazole alone was associated with a greater risk of preterm delivery in a high-risk population 35.

Abnormal vaginal colonization detected in the 2nd trimester but not in 1st trimester was associated with a significant increase in preterm delivery before 28 weeks of gestation 6.9 vs. 0 P0.006.

There were no differences between the groups in the rates of nulliparity and history of spontaneous preterm birth.In Table 2 abnormal vaginal colonization rate was 21.7 21.0 and 14.5 in 1st 2nd and 3rd trimester respectively showing a significant decrease with advancing trimester ofVol.

There were no differences in the prevalence rate of Candida across the trimesters.To analyze the association of miscarriage or preterm deliveryawas used to check trend according to each trimester cIn one case the identification of the specific microorganism was failed even with the presence of Gram-negative bacteria.according to maternal vaginal microorganisms we divided patients into a bacterial colonization group and a no bacterial colonization group in each trimester and compared delivery outcomes Table 3.

S. agalactiae colonization in the 2nd trimester demonstrated higher late miscarriage rate 28.6 vs. 0.8 P0.007 compared to no colonization group.To examine whether antibiotics treatment affect delivery outcomes including preterm delivery birth weight NICU ad- mission and neonatal sepsis we grouped pregnant women ac- cording to antibiotics treatment in each trimester.
