e. coli is one of the most frequent microorganisms cultured in aerobic vaginitis 15. in our study the most com- mon microbiome was group b streptococcus 4.0 followed by e. coli 3.8. we recently demonstrated that e. coli was the most frequent microorganism isolated from the vagina in high risk pregnant women with preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor and correlated with as caus- ative microorganism of early neonatal sepsis 30. of note e.coli and group b streptococcus are cited as the most frequent bacteria isolated from neonates with sepsis and meningitis 3132. it has been shown that high density colonization with vaginal e. coli is more likely among women with a history of preterm birth 33.at present the performance of vaginal culture as a routine antenatal test is controversial and is not generally recom- mended 34. a cochrane review demonstrated that antibiot- ics administered to pregnant women reduced overgrowth of bacteria but did not reduce preterm birth 23. however a recent meta-analysis suggested that infection screening and treatment programs in pregnant women may reduce preterm birth and late miscarriage 24. interestingly it has been previ- ously shown that macrolides and clindamycin administered during the 2nd trimester were associated with a lower rate of preterm birth while metronidazole alone was associated with a greater risk of preterm delivery in a high-risk population 35. it has also been suggested that clindamycin unlike metronida- zole has a broader spectrum and is effective against aerobic microorganisms 36. considering that metronidazole only has antibacterial effect on anaerobes the superior efficacy of broad spectrum antibiotics such as clindamycin in reducing the risk of preterm birth may indirectly reflect the importance of aero- bic vaginitis.

there were no differences in the prevalence rate of candida across the trimesters.to analyze the association of miscarriage or preterm deliveryawas used to check trend according to each trimester cin one case the identification of the specific microorganism was failed even with the presence of gram-negative bacteria.according to maternal vaginal microorganisms we divided patients into a bacterial colonization group and a no bacterial colonization group in each trimester and compared delivery outcomes table 3. in the 1st and 3rd trimester there was no difference in gestational age at delivery or in the rate of mis- carriage or preterm delivery between the bacterial coloniza- tion group and no bacterial colonization groups.

among abnormal vaginal flora isolated in the 2nd trimester the presence of klebsiella pneumonia was identified as significant microorganism associated with preterm delivery before 28 weeks of gestation 50 vs. 0.7 for k. pneumonia p0.029.conclusionthere is an association between abnormal vaginal colonization detected in the 2nd trimester and preterm delivery before 28 weeks.

we classified participants into 3 groups according to the trimester in which vaginal culture was performed 1st trimester n221 2nd trimester n138 and 3rd trimester n234.

we classified the study population into 3 groups according to the trimester in which vaginal culture was performed 1st trimester n221 2nd trimester n138 and 3rd trimester n234 group.

when analyzed by microorganism species the prevalence of e. coli colonization significantly decreased as the pregnancy progressed 1st trimester 6.3 2nd trimester 3.6 and 3rd trimester 1.7. although the overall preva-lence of gram-positive cocci also significantly decreased with advancing trimester of pregnancy p0.012 there were no sig- nificant changes in the individual species over the trimesters of pregnancy.

in fact it was previously indicated that immune modulation by the change of helper t cells subtype occurred during 2nd trimester 18. mid- pregnancy plasma cytokines including interleukin il-2 il-4 il-6 interferon-g and transforming growth factor-b were also known to be associated with preterm delivery 19. similarly high levels of immunoglobulin m ferritin and c-reactive protein measured in mid-pregnancy have been linked to increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery 20-22. how- ever the association between abnormal vaginal colonization and the change by immune modulation or cytokine needs to be studied further.brocklehurst et al.

however our study could be a basis for further studies on abnormal vaginal colo- nization in association with preterm delivery by suggesting that the 2nd trimester may be the most critical time to per- form vaginal cultures.it is noteworthy that in this study we focused on individual vaginal microorganisms and their association with adverse pregnancy outcome including miscarriage and preterm de- livery.

abnormal vaginal colonization detected in the 2nd trimester but not in 1st trimester was associated with a significant increase in preterm delivery before 28 weeks of gestation 6.9 vs. 0 p0.006.

there were no differences between the groups in the rates of nulliparity and history of spontaneous preterm birth.in table 2 abnormal vaginal colonization rate was 21.7 21.0 and 14.5 in 1st 2nd and 3rd trimester respectively showing a significant decrease with advancing trimester ofvol.

s. agalactiae colonization in the 2nd trimester demonstrated higher late miscarriage rate 28.6 vs. 0.8 p0.007 compared to no colonization group.to examine whether antibiotics treatment affect delivery outcomes including preterm delivery birth weight nicu ad- mission and neonatal sepsis we grouped pregnant women ac- cording to antibiotics treatment in each trimester.

second abnormal vaginal colonization in the 2nd trimester but not in 1st trimester was associated with late miscarriage or preterm delivery less than 28 weeks of gestation.

comparable results were reported in another study reporting that vaginal colonization changed from 24 in the 1st trimester to 17 in the 3rd trimester 13. although decreased lactobacilli characterizing bacterial vagi- nosis are associated with preterm delivery 14 particularly among high risk women the impact of intermediate flora or aerobic vaginitis in pregnancy are not fully understood with some studies suggesting that it may cause poor pregnancy out-comes comparable to bacterial vaginosis 8.the intermediate flora state means a transitional stage between normal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis 5. thetable 3. delivery outcomes according to maternal vaginal bacteria colonizationgestational age at examination wk9.0 6.6-11.18.1 5.6-10.20.03021.0 16.6-25.1 20.1 16.1-24.10.32633.6 30.6-36.6 33.2 30.2-36.20.257gestational age at delivery wk37.3 5.3-42.038.3 18.1-41.40.13738.2 16.5-42.0 36.0 19.2-41.40.05138.3 30.5-41.6 39.2 37.0-42.00.234early miscarriage7 4.00 0.00.157------values are presented as median range or number .

whereas bacterial vaginosis is dominated by anaerobic overgrowth aerobic vaginitis is characterized by microorganisms such as escherichia coli group b streptococci and enterococci 56.the association between bacterial vaginosis and preterm delivery has been extensively studied while there is limited research on the clinical significance of abnormal vaginal colo- nization by aerobic bacteria particularly in relation to preterm delivery.
