Mean changes in body weight A and body fat B after 12-week intervention in the control n  9 and nonivamide n 10 group.

The find- ing that our 12-week intervention with a product formulation spiked with 0.15 mg nonivamide lead to a decrease in total body fat -0.61 - 0.36  in moderately overweight subjects compared to controls p  0.01 clearly points to a long-term effectiveness of nonivamide.Although long-term human intervention studies investi- gating the effect of pungent compounds are sparse the major pungent principle of red pepper capsaicin is already consid- ered as an antiobesity agent 30.

Kawabata and colleagues 15 reported that a 2- week daily administration of 0.4 gkg capsinoids decreased body weight and total body fat in normal and moderately overweight men by sympathic nervous activation.

Here our primary hypothesis was that continued bolus doses of 0.15 mg nonivamide over 12 weeks will lead to a reduced body weight and total body fat in healthy overweight subjects.

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study participants.Test day protocolAt day 1 baseline and day 84 end body composition was assessed with a Bod PodQR COSMED USA Concord CA a total body densitometry based on air displacement plethys- mography technology after an overnight fast at 800 a.m.

Differences p  0.05 in percentages of body fat mass and body weight changes within the groups were assessed performing a paired Student's t-test whereas differences between the groups C and NV were calculated performing a two-sample Student's t- test.

This 12-week intervention investigated whether a daily consumption of nonivamide in a protein-based product formulation promotes a reduction in body weight in healthy overweight subjects and affects outcome measures asso- ciated with mechanisms regulating food intake e.g.

Mech- anistic studies in vitro not only verified the stimulating ef- fect of nonivamide on serotonin release 18 but also demon- strated inhibiting effects on fatty acid uptake and adipogene- sis in differentiated Caco-2 cells 19 and in 3T3-L1 cells 20 respectively.The aim of this 12-week human intervention study was to elucidate the effects of a long-term administration of0.15 mg nonivamide per day to moderately overweight subjects on body composition plasma concentrations of hunger- and satiety-associated hormones serotonin peptide YY 3-36 PYY glucagon-like peptide 1 GLP-1 and ghre- lin and parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism such as glucose triglycerides free fatty acids and endogenous metabolites.
