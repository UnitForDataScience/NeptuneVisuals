TheAlpha diversity Microbiota diversity within an individual site or samplediversity one value per sample.Beta diversity Intervariability diversity between separate samples.PCR biasUnequal amounts of amplification across DNA sequences that leads to a skewed distribution of PCR products.MetatranscriptomicsThe study of RNA copies of the collective microbial genes in a community or sample.AssemblyThe process in which short DNA fragments are aligned and merged to form longer DNA fragments.ContigsContiguous DNA sequences assembled from shorter overlapping sequencing reads.AnnotationAssigning functions or functional categories to gene or protein.PHRED quality scoresA measure of the quality of base calling in a sequenced strand of DNA.can be determined from shotgun sequencing data analy- sis by comparison with previously annotated genes thereby offering data that is similar to compositional information derived from 16S rRNA gene sequencing although this process is reliant on the completion and accuracy of databases.

Here we use the term microbiota to refer to the collection of microorganisms in a specified location or sample microbiome to refer to their collective coding cap- acity and metagenome to refer to the experimentallyNATURE REVIEWS  GASTROENTEROLOGY  HEPATOLOGYVOLUME 14  OCTOBER 2017  585REVIEWS BioinformaticsThe use of computer science statistics and mathematics to analyse and interpret biological processes and molecular components.Phylogenetics Evolutionary relationships between organisms genes or proteins.MetagenomeThe collective microbial genomes and genes in an environment or sample.Shotgun sequencingAll extracted DNA is randomly sheered into desired fragment sizes for high-throughput sequencing as opposedto targeting a specific marker gene.AmpliconA target gene or sequence that is amplified naturally or artificially.Copy numberThe number of copies of a particular section of DNA some organisms have multiple copies of a targeted gene.TaxaA population of phylogenetically related organisms.16S ribosomal RNA gene A gene located in the 30S subunit of a prokaryotic ribosome which contains nine variable regions that can be targeted for amplification and used for microbial taxonomic profiling of a sample.18S ribosomal RNA gene A gene located in the 40S ribosomal subunit found ineukaryotic cells targeted in the analysis of fungal communities.determined dataset from shotgun sequencing the genomes of microorganisms in a particular sample.

One comparison of older andnewer clustering methods found the newer methods superior to the more traditional methods87.Another important step in the analysis of marker gene sequences is the removal of chimeric sequences a known artefact of PCR amplification in which hybrid sequences are produced from unrelated parent sequences.

However for initial stud- ies of the gut microbiota this type of analysis is very powerful and offers important information on both microbial diversity and composition.The marker gene most commonly used in pro- karyotes is the ubiquitous 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene which consists of nine variable regions each flanked by highly conserved DNA that provides ideal primer sites for amplification12.
