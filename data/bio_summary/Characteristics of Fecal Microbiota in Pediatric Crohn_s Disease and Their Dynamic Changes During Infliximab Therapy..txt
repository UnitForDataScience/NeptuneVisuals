In the present study a significance a-value on facto- rial Kruskal-Wallis test of 0.01 and an effect size threshold on the logarithmic LDA score of 3.0 were used.ResultsCharacteristics of faecal microbiota composition revealed gut microbial dysbiosis in paediatric CDFor characterising gut microbiota associated with paediatric CD we recruited children with a well-established diagnosis of CD n  11 between the ages of 4 and 17 years with a mean of 11 years and healthy control subjects presenting no abdominal pain diar- rhoea or inflammatory conditions n  16 between the ages of 4 and17 years with a mean of 12 years.

SCFA such as acetate butyrate and propionate produced by microbial fermentation of non-digesti- ble carbohydrates are a primary source of energy for colonic epithe- lial cells and are highly involved in determining the gut environment influencing gut transit nutrient uptake pH and microbial balance within the intestine.Importantly SCFA exerts immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties mainly via mediating homeosta- sis of colonic regulatory T cell populations.

Infliximab IFX is increasingly used to treat paediatric CD however it is not clear how the gut microbiota is modified during IFX treatment.

Additionally alterations were observed in metabolic functions of the gut microbial community in CD.

IFX treatment increased the biodiversity of gut microbiota and shifted its composition as well as its functional capabilities in the paediatric CD patients toward a healthy status.
