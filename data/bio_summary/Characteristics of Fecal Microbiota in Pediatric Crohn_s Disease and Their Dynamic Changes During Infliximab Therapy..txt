the sustained response of paediatric cd patients to ifx was associated with abundance of scfa-producing bacteria.conclusions a lower biodiversity with alterations in the composition and function of faecal microbial community characterising gut microbial dysbiosis was observed in chinese paediatric cd patients.

infliximab ifx is increasingly used to treat paediatric cd however it is not clear how the gut microbiota is modified during ifx treatment.

ifx treatment increased the biodiversity of gut microbiota and shifted its composition as well as its functional capabilities in the paediatric cd patients toward a healthy status.

ifx diminished the cd-associated gut microbial dysbiosis but was deficient in increasing certain scfa-producing taxa.key words crohn's disease gut microbiota infliximabcopyright c 2017 european crohn's and colitis organisation ecco.

clinical trials showed that administration of ifx can achieve a high clinical response rate in paediatric cd patients.it was also reported that ifx was more effective in obtaining mucosal heal- ing than immunomodulators.in a longitudinal study of 33 adult cd patients through exploring the changes in the gut microbiota predictive of relapse after ifx withdrawal rajca et al.

thus the faecal microbiota of cd patients may use different metabolic pathways from those in controls.in summary paediatric cd patients exhibited distinct structure intheir faecal microbiome community compared with the healthy con- trols the reduced microbial diversity diminished scfa-producing bacteria and overgrowth of opportunistic taxa constituted the char- acteristic gut microbial dysbiosis.

in this study we characterised the gut microbiota dysbiosis in paediatric cd patients as represented by a reduced biodiversity together with specific taxonomic altera- tions in the faecal microbiome community.

investigation of the stool samples collected at different time points during ifx treatment show that the gut microbiota structure of the paediatric cd patients was clearly modified and maintained stably during the treatment period between 1 and 7 infusions.

ifx treatment modulated the gut microbiota composition and functional capabilities of paediatric cd patients towards healthy status.
