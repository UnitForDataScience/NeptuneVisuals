recently gondouin et al have also demon- strated that both circulating tf concentration and activity were elevated and were positively correlated with plasma indoxyl sulfate in patients with ckd.41 these findings suggest that indoxyl sulfate should be considered as a biomarker or risk factor for postinterventional vascular access thrombosis in patients with esrd on hemodialysis.58peripheral arterial diseasepatients with ckd have an increased prevalence of pad.59 unfortunately pad in ckd is a challenging problem because it is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity including limb amputation.60 moreover outcomes of revascularization for critical limb ischemia in patients with ckd are poor.61 risk factors for pad among patients with ckd are not fully understood but probably include both conventional and uremia-associated risk factors.

uremic cardiomyopathy is pathologically composed of interstitial fibrosis microvessel disease with a selective capillary deficit and wall thickening of intramyocardial arterioles in the hypertrophied heart.48 by using isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts as well as a human leukemia monocytic cell line lekawanvijit et al demonstrated in vitro that indoxyl sulfate has proinflam- matory profibrotic and prohypertrophic effects indicating that indoxyl sulfate might adversely contribute to cardiac remodeling in ckd.34 furthermore reduction of indoxyl sulfate with ast-120 an oral charcoal adsorbent was accompanied by reduced left ventricular fibrosis and trans- forming growth factor tgf-b and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa b nf-jb protein expression in subtotal- nephrectomized rats in a blood-pressure-independent man- ner.35 fujii et al also showed that administration of ast-120 leads to reduction of oxidative stress cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy in a subtotal nephrectomy rat model.36 taken together the cardiac profibrotic effect of indoxyl sulfate is likely to be driven by the oxidative stress nf-jbtgf-b pathway through nadph oxidases.arrhythmiasudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in dialysis patients accounting for 20 to 30 of all deaths in this population.47 although a proportion of sudden cardiac death events could be caused by acute coronary ischemia the overall incidence of sudden cardiac death is much greater than the incidence of coronary events49 probably suggesting a primary increase in the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmiasin patients with esrd.50 several factors including uremia- specific factors that arise from retained uremic toxins could predispose patients with ckd to a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias.

poesen et al studied fecal metabolite profiles of hemodialysis and healthy individuals and observed a clear discrimination with 81 fecal volatile organic compounds detected at significantly different levels in the 2 groups.21 vaziri et al further showed a marked difference in the abundance of 190 microbial operational taxonomic units between hemodialysis patients and healthy controls22 with significant expansion of bacterial families possessing urease uricase and indole and p-cresol forming enzymes in hemodialysis patients.23 indole is produced by intestinal bacteria as a degradation product of the amino acid tryptophan and is subsequently absorbed andtable 1. gut-derived uremic toxins that have been associated with cvd in patients with ckdckd indicates chronic kidney disease cvd cardiovascular disease ptc phosphatidylcholine.metabolized in the liver to indoxyl sulfate the prototype of protein-bound uremic toxins.

traditional cardiovascular risk factors for the general population such as diabetes mellitus high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are more common in patients with ckd but cannot entirely explain the increased cardiovascular risk.3 compelling evidence suggests that the uremic milieu itself plays a critical role in the development and progression of cvd.4 various solutes that would normally be excreted by the kidneys accumulate in patients with ckd.

additionally lin et al determined that serum indoxyl sulfate level was a valuable marker in predicting cardiovascular events in patients with advanced ckd.6 recently cao et al conducted a prospec- tive study to investigate the relationship between indoxyl sulfate and heart failure in patients with esrd on hemodialysis.

the results remained significant after adjusting for both conventional and unconventional risk factors.7 in our recent study8 hemodialysis patients undergoing angioplasty for access dysfunction were prospectively enrolled over a 3-year period with 175 and131 of the enrolled patients having arteriovenous graftsavgs and arteriovenous fistulas respectively.

therefore indoxyl sulfate may be involved in the development and progression of cvd in patients with ckd.basic studies of cardiovascular toxicity of indoxyl sulfate in ckdby virtue of its proinflammatory and pro-oxidant properties4 indoxyl sulfate is implicated in the pathogenesis of at least 6 phenotypes of cvd in ckd figure 1 including atheroscle- rosis26-29 arteriosclerosis30-33 congestive heart failure34-36 arrhythmia37-39 vascular access thrombosis4041 and periph- eral arterial disease pad.4243figure 1. role of indoxyl sulfate in the pathogenesis of various forms of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease.

reported estimates of the prevalence of af in nondialysis ckd patients range from 8 to 18 compared to 0.4 to 1.0 in the general population.54 using data from a large population- based study alonso et al reported that impaired kidney function and presence of albuminuria were strongly associ- ated with the incidence of af independently of other cardiovascular risk factors.55 ckd may increase the risk of af because of poor blood pressure control and expansion of extracellular fluid56 leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and eventually atrial stretch and fibrosis.

serum indoxyl sulfate is associated with vascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.

free p-cresylsulphate is a predictor of mortality in patients at different stages of chronic kidney disease.
