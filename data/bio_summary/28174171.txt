Recently Gondouin et al have also demon- strated that both circulating TF concentration and activity were elevated and were positively correlated with plasma indoxyl sulfate in patients with CKD.41 These findings suggest that indoxyl sulfate should be considered as a biomarker or risk factor for postinterventional vascular access thrombosis in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis.58Peripheral Arterial DiseasePatients with CKD have an increased prevalence of PAD.59 Unfortunately PAD in CKD is a challenging problem because it is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity including limb amputation.60 Moreover outcomes of revascularization for critical limb ischemia in patients with CKD are poor.61 Risk factors for PAD among patients with CKD are not fully understood but probably include both conventional and uremia-associated risk factors.

Uremic cardiomyopathy is pathologically composed of interstitial fibrosis microvessel disease with a selective capillary deficit and wall thickening of intramyocardial arterioles in the hypertrophied heart.48 By using isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts as well as a human leukemia monocytic cell line Lekawanvijit et al demonstrated in vitro that indoxyl sulfate has proinflam- matory profibrotic and prohypertrophic effects indicating that indoxyl sulfate might adversely contribute to cardiac remodeling in CKD.34 Furthermore reduction of indoxyl sulfate with AST-120 an oral charcoal adsorbent was accompanied by reduced left ventricular fibrosis and trans- forming growth factor TGF-b and phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B NF-jB protein expression in subtotal- nephrectomized rats in a blood-pressure-independent man- ner.35 Fujii et al also showed that administration of AST-120 leads to reduction of oxidative stress cardiac fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy in a subtotal nephrectomy rat model.36 Taken together the cardiac profibrotic effect of indoxyl sulfate is likely to be driven by the oxidative stress NF-jBTGF-b pathway through NADPH oxidases.ArrhythmiaSudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in dialysis patients accounting for 20 to 30 of all deaths in this population.47 Although a proportion of sudden cardiac death events could be caused by acute coronary ischemia the overall incidence of sudden cardiac death is much greater than the incidence of coronary events49 probably suggesting a primary increase in the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmiasin patients with ESRD.50 Several factors including uremia- specific factors that arise from retained uremic toxins could predispose patients with CKD to a higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias.

Traditional cardiovascular risk factors for the general population such as diabetes mellitus high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are more common in patients with CKD but cannot entirely explain the increased cardiovascular risk.3 Compelling evidence suggests that the uremic milieu itself plays a critical role in the development and progression of CVD.4 Various solutes that would normally be excreted by the kidneys accumulate in patients with CKD.

Additionally Lin et al determined that serum indoxyl sulfate level was a valuable marker in predicting cardiovascular events in patients with advanced CKD.6 Recently Cao et al conducted a prospec- tive study to investigate the relationship between indoxyl sulfate and heart failure in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis.

The results remained significant after adjusting for both conventional and unconventional risk factors.7 In our recent study8 hemodialysis patients undergoing angioplasty for access dysfunction were prospectively enrolled over a 3-year period with 175 and131 of the enrolled patients having arteriovenous graftsAVGs and arteriovenous fistulas respectively.

Aronov et al demonstrated by using high-resolution mass spectrometry an absence or reduced plasma levels of 30 uremic solutes in hemodial- ysis patients with a colectomy compared to those with an intact colon.20 Indeed loss of renal function is not the sole reason for high serum concentrations of these uremic retention solutes.
