It is encouraging that biologically-informed disease subtypes7 and 'precise' disease taxonomies8 have recently been proposed for periodontal disease however re-defining dental caries as a person-level disease in a precise manner and biological terms remains to be done.910 Nonetheless the importance of genomics and other 'omics structures10-13 has been acknowledged as a major opportunity for the oral health community to improve oral health outcomes.

Much more needs to be done however for the realization of precision medicine in the oral health domain.The precision medicine initiativeThe 2015 initiative on precision medicine1-3 articulated a concerted effort of governmental academic and professional stakeholders to accelerate the translation of the new deeper understanding of human health to better care.

dashboards are necessary to support precision medicine pipelines.The fourth pillar At a time when molecular and genomics applications are in the spotlight there is no better opportunity to increase understanding and operationalize the consideration of the social determinants of health in precision medicine.

While aiming to increase providers' genomics and precision medicine literacy equal emphasis must be placed on the humanistic aspects of health care--let us notDivarisPage 3forget that precision medicine is explicit in its consideration of individuals' differences wherever they may originate from.Finally for precision health care to succeed government academic corporate and professional stakeholders must take initiatives to prepare and educate the public for this new era of health care.

For this reason a brief overview is in order regarding the progress of precision medicine or precision dentistry in the oral health domain.Overall precision medicine in the oral health domain is in its infancy.

Precision medicine has been discussed within the realms of periodontology78 pediatrics12 orthodontics14 and oral-maxillofacial surgery.15Viewed from a positive angle there is enormous opportunity and potential for dentistry to realize and benefit from the fundamentals of precision medicine.

precision medicine gives clinicians tools to better understand the complex mechanisms underlying a patient's health disease or condition andto enable clinicians to select and apply effective therapies i.e.

First and foremost the creation of a new taxonomy of human disease.5 The importance of defining biologically molecularly or genetically-defined disease subtypes for otherwise clinically-similar conditions cannot be overemphasized--the cornerstone of precision medicine is naturally the ability to make precise diagnoses based on a mechanistically-informed taxonomy.

Toward precision medicine building a knowledge network for biomedical research and a new taxonomy of disease.

an innovative approach to disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual differences in people's genes environments and lifestylesto help understanddiscover mechanisms underlying health and disease i.e.
