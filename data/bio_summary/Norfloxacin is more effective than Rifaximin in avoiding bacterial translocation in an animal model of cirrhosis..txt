295 published by john wiley  sons ltdwidely used as prophylaxis of infections in patients.7 however its ex- tensive long-term use has led to an increase quinolone-resistant spe- cies in the intestinal lumen78 requesting alternative strategies.89rifaximin rfx is a gut-selective antibiotic against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic flora.1011 rfx reaches high concentrations in the intestinal lumen11 being negligibly absorbed in patients without liver disease12 but absorbed to some degree in pa- tients with advanced cirrhosis.1213 recently rfx has been proposed as an oral alternative antibiotic to nflx to prevent sbp in the absence of systemic side effects14 decreasing the mortality rate and the recur- rence of sbp15 with proven efficacy in a number of gastrointestinal and liver conditions ibo16 he17 sbp prophylaxis18 and recurrent clostridium difficile infection.19 comparable antimicrobial activity was seen between rfx and other antimicrobials for e. coli the activity against c. difficile was comparable to metronidazole and vancomy- cin.12 we have also recently shown that rfx is more effective than nflx against a series of multidrug resistant bacteria in vitro.20the aim of the present study was to compare the effects of nfx and rfx on viable and non-viable bt cytokine synthesis and intestinal flora in rats with ccl4-induced cirrhosis.2  methods  induction of cirrhosismale sprague-dawley rats harlan barcelona spain weighing 100- 150 g were included.

this phenomenon may be explained be- cause rfx changes bacterial function and virulence besides decreasing bacterial population.38intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been repeatedly associated to the risk of developing spontaneous infections in advanced cirrhosis but qualitative changes in bacterial composition have recently been advocated as an additional predisposing factor.39 in this investigationwe have shown that ccl4-induced cirrhosis decreased intestinal mi- crobial diversity in all cirrhotic groups and specifically that firmicutes and proteobacteria phyla were expanded at the expense of the bacteroidetes phylum clearly contracted in abundance.

non-viable bt was significantly reduced in animals receiving antibiotics group i 80 vs 41.9 in groups iiiii p  .05 and was also significantly reduced in animals receiving nflx vs group i 35.3 vs 80 p  .05 figure 2 but it did not reach sta- tistical significance in the case of rfx 50 p  ns.

as shown in the current investigation and in previous studies from our group23 bactdna was detected in two cases with negative culture a phenomenon termed non-viable bt3 and in all biological samples with positive cultures n  6. administration of nflx signifi- cantly decreased the overall presence of bactdna in mlns to 6 of 17 animals 35.3 p  .05 vs group i. similarly to that observed when considering viable translocation rfx decreased the incidenceof non-viable bt not reaching statistical significance 714 50 p  .05. these differences may be explained because nflx but not rfx modified the intestinal microbiome mainly gammaproteobacteria content.

serum cytokine levelsserum levels of tnf-a il-1b and il-6 were significantly lower in rats receiving antibiotics that in rats from group i but not between ii and iii figure 4. tnf-a levels were significantly increased in con- trol ccl4 rats group i tnf-a  34.9 pgml in comparison with group ii tnf-a  9.9 pgml p  .05 and group iii tnf-a  11.4 pgml p  .05. similarly serum levels of il-6 were significantly lower in treated rats than in ccl4 rats 100.2 pgml in group i vs 42.11 pgml in group ii vs 32.53 pgml in group iii p  .05 in both cases.

in this investigation 60 of cirrhotic rats had viable-bt ie culture positive specimens a figure similar to that reported by other authors.531 the incidence of viable-bt was sig- nificantly reduced in animals receiving nflx 23.5 vs 60 p  .05 but not rfx 28.6 vs 60 p  ns vs control animals.

these bacterial phylum are relative increased in the microbiome of cirrhotic patients and prob- ably play a role as causative agents of bt.interestingly long-term nflx and rfx administration to cirrhotic rats did not promote gpc bacterial overgrowth in cecal stools.

different studies have demonstrated that ibo of an organism plays a key role in bt of that organism in this model of cirrhosis in rats.5 the lack of induction of intestinal gpc overgrowth could explain the similar in- cidence of gram-positive bt and sbp in both groups in the current study.this study has some limitations our results may not be extrapo- lated to other experimental models of cirrhosis and ascites and other rfx doses should be tested to confirm our results previous studies in mice had shown a reduction in bt using 30 and 50 mgkg of rfx in an experimental model of colitis.25in conclusion nflx is more effective than rfx in avoiding both vi- able and non-viable episodes of bt in this animal model of cirrhosis probably because of its capacity to reduce pathobionts from intestinal microbiota.
