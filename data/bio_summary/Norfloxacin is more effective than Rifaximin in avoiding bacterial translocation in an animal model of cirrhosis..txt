Different studies have demonstrated that IBO of an organism plays a key role in BT of that organism in this model of cirrhosis in rats.5 The lack of induction of intestinal GPC overgrowth could explain the similar in- cidence of gram-positive BT and SBP in both groups in the current study.This study has some limitations our results may not be extrapo- lated to other experimental models of cirrhosis and ascites and other Rfx doses should be tested to confirm our results previous studies in mice had shown a reduction in BT using 30 and 50 mgkg of Rfx in an experimental model of colitis.25In conclusion Nflx is more effective than Rfx in avoiding both vi- able and non-viable episodes of BT in this animal model of cirrhosis probably because of its capacity to reduce pathobionts from intestinal microbiota.

295 Published by John Wiley  Sons Ltdwidely used as prophylaxis of infections in patients.7 However its ex- tensive long-term use has led to an increase quinolone-resistant spe- cies in the intestinal lumen78 requesting alternative strategies.89Rifaximin Rfx is a gut-selective antibiotic against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic flora.1011 Rfx reaches high concentrations in the intestinal lumen11 being negligibly absorbed in patients without liver disease12 but absorbed to some degree in pa- tients with advanced cirrhosis.1213 Recently Rfx has been proposed as an oral alternative antibiotic to Nflx to prevent SBP in the absence of systemic side effects14 decreasing the mortality rate and the recur- rence of SBP15 with proven efficacy in a number of gastrointestinal and liver conditions IBO16 HE17 SBP prophylaxis18 and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.19 Comparable antimicrobial activity was seen between Rfx and other antimicrobials for E. coli the activity against C. difficile was comparable to metronidazole and vancomy- cin.12 We have also recently shown that Rfx is more effective than Nflx against a series of multidrug resistant bacteria in vitro.20The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of Nfx and Rfx on viable and non-viable BT cytokine synthesis and intestinal flora in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis.2  METHODS  Induction of cirrhosisMale Sprague-Dawley rats Harlan Barcelona Spain weighing 100- 150 g were included.

After 8 weeks of CCl4 administration animals were as- signed into a control CCl4-group Group I n  10 or into two experi- mental groups animals receiving CCl4 plus Nfx Group II n  17 or animals receiving CCl4 plus Rfx Group III n  14.Global survival time time from the first dose of CCl4 until spon- taneous death or sacrifice was significantly longer in animals receivingantibiotics than in animals from Group I 26.4 weeks - 14.7 in Groups II and III combined vs 18.7 - 9.0 weeks in Group I P  .05.

This phenomenon may be explained be- cause Rfx changes bacterial function and virulence besides decreasing bacterial population.38Intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been repeatedly associated to the risk of developing spontaneous infections in advanced cirrhosis but qualitative changes in bacterial composition have recently been advocated as an additional predisposing factor.39 In this investigationwe have shown that CCl4-induced cirrhosis decreased intestinal mi- crobial diversity in all cirrhotic groups and specifically that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla were expanded at the expense of the Bacteroidetes phylum clearly contracted in abundance.

Non-viable BT was significantly reduced in animals receiving antibiotics Group I 80 vs 41.9 in Groups IIIII P  .05 and was also significantly reduced in animals receiving Nflx vs Group I 35.3 vs 80 P  .05 Figure 2 but it did not reach sta- tistical significance in the case of Rfx 50 P  ns.

Six animals presented positive cultures of ascitic fluid three from Group I 39 33.3 1 from Group II 113 7.69 and two from Group III 212 16.6 and in all cases the same bacteria species was isolated in MLNs culture.3.2.2  Non-viable bacterial translocationNon-viable BT was detected in eight animals from group I 80 six from group II 35.3 and seven from group III 50.

Twenty-one rats received CCl4 and were considered as controls Group I 29 rats were allocated in Nfx group Group II and 30 rats in Rfx group Group III.
