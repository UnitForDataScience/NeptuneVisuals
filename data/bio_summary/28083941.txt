The beneficial roles of fungi and viruses are also stressed.

The field will also need to take on the challenging prospect of performing more work in human sub- jects including longitudinal and inter- ventional studies to prove cause-and-effect relationships given that nearly all work to date showing a functional effect of the microbiota has been performed in animal model systems such as germ-free mice with their own limitations.

This special issue of The Journal of Physiology was therefore planned to pull together short Topical Reviews that illustrate the breadth of this emerging field solicited from individuals whose labs have made pivotal contributions to our under- standing.

The goal of this accompanying editorial is to introduce the constituent reviews and underscore common themes.

The remaining articles focus on the gut microbiota but rather than asking how this extensive micro- bial community influences digestive health and disease they summarize evidence to support a role for the gut microbiota in regulating either systemic metabolism Janssen  Kersten 2017 or brain function Dinan  Cryan 2017.

Critical questions to be addressed include Which physio- logical effects of the microbiota in animal models are relevant to human biology Amongst those that are relevant what is the effect size in humans Is it large or very small And will these insights lead to new approaches to prevent treat andor diagnose illnesses that are more efficacious than currently available modalities Over- all it is hoped that the articles included in this special issue will trigger further research into the many ways in whichQC 2017 The Authors.
