The localization of C. jejuni on the Caco-2 cell surface was maintained with LGG pretreatment which coincided with re- duced C. jejuni invasion.Effects of butyrate on HCAR2 and SLC5A8 expression during Campylobacter jejuni adhesion and invasionSteady-state mRNA levels of HCAR2 or SLC5A8 during adhesion or invasion were not altered by pretreatment of Caco-2 mono- layers with butyrate prior to infection with C. jejuni Fig.

A previous study showed that butyrate not only protects against C. jejuni invasion and translocation into Caco-2 cells but also preserves the integrity of the Caco-2 monolayer Van Deun et al.

Since cAMP has profound effects on water and electrolyte absorption in the intestinal tract decreased presence of this receptor caused by pathogenic bacteria could potentially contribute to the exces- sive water and electrolyte losses that occur following infection Field .This study investigated the hypothesis that pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with a probiotic Lactobacillus GG andor butyrate could diminish C. jejuni invasion and maintain expression of a butyrate transporter and receptor.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsSodium butyrate came from Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO.

C. During adhesion C. jejuni im- munoreactive staining was positive on the Caco-2 cell surface however this staining intensity was lost during C. jejuni inva- sion.

Preservation of these butyrate-linked mediators during C. jejuni infection could potentially lessen the diarrheal symptoms of wa- ter and electrolyte losses caused by campylobacteriosis.In conclusion these findings illustrate protective effects of butyrate and LGG during C. jejuni infection.

Liquid cultures of C. jejuni were grown in Brucella or Mueller-Hinton MH broth and cultured in microaerobic en- vironments according to Pajaniappan et al.

These results suggest that the first stages of C. jejuni infection of Caco-2 cells may be minimized by LGG and butyrate pretreatment.Keywords butyrate Lactobacillus GG Campylobacter jejuni Caco-2BACKGROUNDCampylobacter jejuni a gram-negative bacterium is zoonotic pathogenic in humans but a common commensal in birds swine and cattle.

Protection against C. jejuni adhesion by butyrate and invasion by LGG was associated with the presence of HCAR2 and SLC5A8 a butyrate receptor and transporter respectively.Trillions of predominantly anaerobic bacteria reside within the intestine with 90 of species coming from the Figure 3.

.We found that butyrate's defense against C. jejuni was as- sociated with the localization of a butyrate transporter and re- ceptor.
