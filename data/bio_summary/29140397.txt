the functional identity of ilcs is dependent on the cytokines il-12 and il-4 and imbalances towards il-4 result in type 2 pro-inflammatory pathology that has been associated with asthma.59 eosinophil cell survival in peri- pheral tissues requires il-5 and the il-5 concentration is maintained by ilc2 cells.476061 ilcs act as innate immune cells correlated with t cells.62 it has been suggested that while th2 cells are the main source of type-2 pro-inflammatory cyto- kines for atopic ige-mediated eosinophilic asthma ilc2 cells are the main source in non-atopic eosinophilic asthma as ilc2 cells are non-antigen specific.10 the shared roles of ilcs and t cells have been reviewed.62 in a balbc mouse model of allergic airway inflammation t-cell derived il-4il-13 was essential for ige production recruitment of eosinophils and basophils to the lung goblet cell hyperplasia and the develop- ment of airway hyperreactivity whereas ilc2s were recruited tothe lung in the same efficiency in wild-type and il-4il-13 t-cell-specific knockout mice.63 in patients with severe eosino- philic non-atopic asthma ilc2s are thought to be the predo- minant source of type-2 cytokines64 although there is also evi- dence that basophils and mast cells rather than ilcs are the cellular source of type-2 cytokines in chronic asthma.31asthma the microbiome and dietary interventionthe prominent role of the microbiome in human health has become clear over the last decade.1265-68 there is an associ- ation between the reduced diversity in the intestinal micro- biome and allergic disease69 as well as evidence that the use of antibiotics increases susceptibility to allergic airway inflam- mation.70 it has also been shown that asthmatics are more likely to have a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol and low in fiber fruits and vegetables which may promote inflam- mation and contribute to the perpetuation of asthma patho- physiological features.71-73 adherence to a mediterranean-style diet which is high in fiber fruits vegetables and fish is associated with increased fecal short-chain fatty acid concen- trations and prevotella and lachnospira genera74 and has been correlated with a reduction in asthma symptoms in children75 fig.

eotaxins recruit eosinophil cells into the epi- thelium where the eosinophils secrete cationic peptides and reactive oxygen species causing epithelial injury.37-39 eotaxins also mediate the release of il-4 stores from within the eosino- phil granules.40 the expression of each isoform is cell specific with ccl11 being secreted by epithelial cells as well as eosino- phils macrophages lymphocytes fibroblasts and smooth muscle endothelial cells.41 ccl24 and ccl26 are functional homologues that are primarily secreted by epithelial and endo- thelial cells.42 ccl11 transcription is controlled by both the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells nf-kb and signal transducer and activator of transcription6 stat643 and is the initial eotaxin isoform produced whereas ccl26 is predominantly controlled by stat6 and is the late-stage eotaxin remaining present up to 24 h after aller- gen exposure.4344 all three eotaxins bind to the eosinophil ccr3 receptor to attract them to the site of inflammation.41eosinophils like other hematopoietic immune cells are formed in the bone marrow and migrate into the blood where they are a small but stable population.45 eosinophils are responsible for numerous inflammatory processes during parasitic helminth bacterial and viral infections tissue injury tumor immunology and allergic disease.46 ilc2s see section 2.2 are a key source of il-5 required for mediating eosinophil development and survival.547 during allergic airway inflamma- tory exacerbations excess eosinophils in the lung cause damage to the epithelium through the release of cationic pep-sara l. colemansara received a bachelor of science degree in biochemistry from texas tech university in lubbock texas and a master of science degree in molecular nutrition and health sciences from the university of nebraska- lincoln and recently earned her phd in human physiology from massey university in palmerston north new zealand in the fall of 2017. her thesis research investigating procyanidins as modulators of airway inflam-odette m. shawdr odette shaw is a scientist in the food  wellness group of the new zealand institute for plant  food research limited.

macrophages are critical for the development of il-13-driven tissue inflammation and fibrosis by recruiting t-cells which actively maintain the tissue-localized immune responses.51 additionally alternatively activated macrophages have been associated with airway disease.52-54 basophil popu- lations have been implicated as a bridge between the commen- sal-bacterial populations see section 3.1 and allergic inflam- mation because the use of antibiotics increases serum ige con- centrations whereas the depletion of basophil populations reduces the exaggerated immune responses.55 dendritic cells are integral in the crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immunity and involved in the induction of asthma through antigen sampling across the airway epithelium.35 the involve- ment of ige antibodies to benign antigens and the roles of mast cells and b-cells in allergic asthma have been discussed elsewhere.56-58type 2 innate lymphoid cellsinnate lymphoid cells are a recently characterized family of effector lymphoid cells that protect against pathogens and restore the tissue integrity.59 three subsets have been charac- terized based on function development and cytokine pro- duction type 1 ilcs produce type-1 cytokines ifng and tnf type 2 ilcs secrete type-2 cytokines il-4 il-5 il-9 and il-13 and type 3 ilcs produce il-22 il-17 and granulocyte-macro- phage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf.59 during homeosta- sis ilc2s and ilc3s are the predominant subsets thatpromote immune regulation and control tissue homeostasis and repair.

it is typical of infants to be initially colonized with staphylococcus or corynebacterium before stable coloniza- tion with alloiococcus or moraxella.84 the interactions between the host and the airway microbiome train the maturing infant immune system for tolerance through a cycling process invol- ving th2 cells and treg cells and require programmed death ligand 1 pd-l185 however viral infections antibiotic use and daycare attendance can interfere with this developmentand result in airway mucosal dendritic cells with increased expression of the high-affinity ige receptor leading to a greater allergic response.697679dietary intervention to modify the microbiomeevidence supporting dietary intervention that modifies the gut microbiome to improve health is growing.74 high-fiber diets yield a distinct acetate-producing gut microbiome profile in pregnant mice which protected the offspring from developing allergic airway disease through increased in utero acetate exposure86 conversely low bacteroidetes diversity in mothers pre-birth contributed to infants developing ige-associated eczema.82 berry fruit is a rich dietary source of soluble fiber and as previously mentioned it is also a common source ofproanthocyanidins.168788 fruit consumption satisfies two of the three 'p's for gut health probiotics prebiotics and poly- phenols.66 the interaction between polyphenols and the gut microbiome related to human health has been reviewed.656889-94the biological effects of the proanthocyanidin consumptionare clear despite the studies showing minimal absorption of radio-labeled proanthocyanidins with 88-94 being recovered from the gastrointestinal tract or the feces.95 the gut micro- biome has been suggested as the missing link between the poorly absorbed proanthocyanidins and improved health out- comes as a result of their consumption.95 consuming fruit- derived polyphenols to modulate the immune system has been demonstrated in the models of metabolic syndrome where concord grape polyphenol extract95 blackcurrants and blue- berries improved health outcomes that were modulated via the gut microbiome.

eosinophil cell infiltration of the lungs can be predicted in humans most reliably with serum measurements of il-13 and il-5 as well as ccl26.49 various blackcurrant cultivar extracts specifically proanthocyanidin-enriched blackcurrant extracts were shown to inhibit the in vitro production of ccl26 in type-2 cytokine-stimulated human alveolar epithelial cells.101102 apple extracts have also been shown to inhibit the humantable 1 summary of proanthocyanidin-containing fruits and their effects on allergic airway inflammationsourcestructuremodelbiomarkerscitationsappleb-typeproanthocyanidins procyanidins b1 and b2lung epithelial in vitroccl11 ccl26103blackcurrantb-typeproanthocyanidins procyanidins b3 and b4lung epithelial in vitro mouse in vivoccl11 ccl26101 102 and104boysenberryb-typeproanthocyanidins procyanidin b4mouse in vivoinos arginase pro-fibrolytic alternatively activated mph110cranberrya-typeproanthocyanidins procyanidin a2lung epithelial in vitroccl11 ccl26105 and 106grape and grape seedsb-type proanthocyanidinslung epithelial in vitro mouse in vivoil-4 il-13 il-5 lung eosinophil count107-109procyanidin b1lung tissue remodelingfibrosis ifngalveolar epithelial cell production of ccl11 and ccl26 in vitro and the inhibition of ccl11 correlated with increased proanthocyanidin compounds in the extracts.103 in vivo black- currant extracts can inhibit eosinophilia through the reduced production of ccl11 in an ova-induced allergic airway inflam- mation mouse model.104 similarly procyanidin a2 inhibits both ccl11 and ccl26 in type-2 cytokine-stimulated human alveolar epithelial cells.105106 a summary of differentproanthocyanidin-containing fruits and their effects on aller-gic airway inflammation can be found in table 1.a commercially purchased proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract was shown to ameliorate a comprehensive set of biomarkers for inflammation bronchial hyper responsiveness and lung tissue fibrosis in both acute and chronic murine models of allergic asthma.107-109 grape seed proanthocyanidin extracts typically consist of b-linked proanthocyanidins although no specific chemistry was given in these studies.

other t helper-cell subtypes including th9 th17 as well as t regulatory treg cells have also been implicated in inappropriate airway inflammation.2829the lung epithelium and eosinophiliathe airway epithelium is one of the key regulators of allergic asthma pathology.30 allergen exposure initiates the release of key cytokines il-33 il-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp by epithelial cells.

immune cells including eosinophils and the recently characterized type 2 innate lymphoid cells infiltrate into the lung tissue as part of the inflammatory response in allergic asthma.

allergic asthma was traditionally characterized as an eosinophilic airway disorder perpetuated by overactive th2 cells and the overproduction of type-2 pro- inflammatory cytokines interleukin il-4 il-5 and il-13 in response to inhaled allergens.

further supporting this lingonberry supplementation a fruit high in a-type linked proanthocyanidins has been shown to prevent low-grade inflammation in high-fat diet fed mice through increasing the relative abundance of akkermansia and faecalibacterium two genera associated with anti-inflamma- tory activity and a healthy gut.97 deciphering the interplay between the gut microbiome and dietary components will allow for advancements in personalized nutrition.98 the modulation of the lung microbiome by dietary intervention andor polyphenols is still in its infancy and requires further research.proanthocyanidin inhibition of eosinophilia biomarkersproanthocyanidins evolved in plants as an environmental stress-response such as towards uv damage and drought and are biologically active in the context of human health.1699100 many plant-derived food polyphenols have been investigated for their ability to attenuate allergic airway inflammation101 with a recent investigation on the proanthocyanidins' role in inhibiting eosinophilia a hallmark feature of allergic asthma.
