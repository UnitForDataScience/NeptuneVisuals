The functional identity of ILCs is dependent on the cytokines IL-12 and IL-4 and imbalances towards IL-4 result in type 2 pro-inflammatory pathology that has been associated with asthma.59 Eosinophil cell survival in peri- pheral tissues requires IL-5 and the IL-5 concentration is maintained by ILC2 cells.476061 ILCs act as innate immune cells correlated with T cells.62 It has been suggested that while Th2 cells are the main source of type-2 pro-inflammatory cyto- kines for atopic IgE-mediated eosinophilic asthma ILC2 cells are the main source in non-atopic eosinophilic asthma as ILC2 cells are non-antigen specific.10 The shared roles of ILCs and T cells have been reviewed.62 In a BALBc mouse model of allergic airway inflammation T-cell derived IL-4IL-13 was essential for IgE production recruitment of eosinophils and basophils to the lung goblet cell hyperplasia and the develop- ment of airway hyperreactivity whereas ILC2s were recruited tothe lung in the same efficiency in wild-type and IL-4IL-13 T-cell-specific knockout mice.63 In patients with severe eosino- philic non-atopic asthma ILC2s are thought to be the predo- minant source of type-2 cytokines64 although there is also evi- dence that basophils and mast cells rather than ILCs are the cellular source of type-2 cytokines in chronic asthma.31Asthma the microbiome and dietary interventionThe prominent role of the microbiome in human health has become clear over the last decade.1265-68 There is an associ- ation between the reduced diversity in the intestinal micro- biome and allergic disease69 as well as evidence that the use of antibiotics increases susceptibility to allergic airway inflam- mation.70 It has also been shown that asthmatics are more likely to have a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol and low in fiber fruits and vegetables which may promote inflam- mation and contribute to the perpetuation of asthma patho- physiological features.71-73 Adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet which is high in fiber fruits vegetables and fish is associated with increased fecal short-chain fatty acid concen- trations and Prevotella and Lachnospira genera74 and has been correlated with a reduction in asthma symptoms in children75 Fig.

Macrophages are critical for the development of IL-13-driven tissue inflammation and fibrosis by recruiting T-cells which actively maintain the tissue-localized immune responses.51 Additionally alternatively activated macrophages have been associated with airway disease.52-54 Basophil popu- lations have been implicated as a bridge between the commen- sal-bacterial populations see section 3.1 and allergic inflam- mation because the use of antibiotics increases serum IgE con- centrations whereas the depletion of basophil populations reduces the exaggerated immune responses.55 Dendritic cells are integral in the crosstalk between the innate and adaptive immunity and involved in the induction of asthma through antigen sampling across the airway epithelium.35 The involve- ment of IgE antibodies to benign antigens and the roles of mast cells and B-cells in allergic asthma have been discussed elsewhere.56-58Type 2 innate lymphoid cellsInnate lymphoid cells are a recently characterized family of effector lymphoid cells that protect against pathogens and restore the tissue integrity.59 Three subsets have been charac- terized based on function development and cytokine pro- duction type 1 ILCs produce type-1 cytokines IFNg and TNF type 2 ILCs secrete type-2 cytokines IL-4 IL-5 IL-9 and IL-13 and type 3 ILCs produce IL-22 IL-17 and granulocyte-macro- phage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF.59 During homeosta- sis ILC2s and ILC3s are the predominant subsets thatpromote immune regulation and control tissue homeostasis and repair.

IL-33 induces multiple immune cells including Th2 cells basophils mast cells and ILC2 cells to secrete IL-4 IL-5 and IL-13.3132 IL-25 mediates eosino- philic inflammation including airway hyperresponsiveness airway remodeling goblet cell hyperplasia subepithelial col- lagen deposition and angiogenesis in a Th2 cytokine-depen- dent manner.3334 Epithelial TSLP induces OX40 ligand expression in lung tissue-resident dendritic cells resulting inpriming naive CD4T cells toward a Th2 phenotype in lymph nodes.3536Lung epithelial exposure to allergens also stimulates the release of eotaxins a family of chemotactic signaling proteins which mediate eosinophil cell infiltration into inflamed tissue.

We have progressed beyond asthma being defined as a single disease with two simple subtypes5 as clinicians seek to better understand asthma diagnosis and treatment through clustering patients by phenotype6 clinical presentation and the underlying pathophysiological molecular mechanisms.67 Advances in our understanding of immune function in asthma such as the identification of the innate lymphoid cells ILCs89 increased understanding of the functions of T-helper 2 Th2 cells and IgE adaptive immunology10 as well as recent progress in the role of the human microbiome in disease1112aFood and Wellness Group The New Zealand Institute for Plant  Food Research Ltd Palmerston North 4442 New Zealand.

Specifically wewill examine the role of ILC type 2 ILC2 cells in controlling the fate of eosinophils in allergic asthma and explore the role the microbiome has on the progression of allergic asthma and as an avenue for therapeutic intervention.Pathology of allergic asthmaThe established pathology of both allergic and non-allergic asthma involves repeated inflammatory exacerbations of the lung epithelium26 bronchial smooth muscle hyperreactivity4 mucous production27 and lung tissue remodeling resulting in reversible airway obstruction.

Eotaxins recruit eosinophil cells into the epi- thelium where the eosinophils secrete cationic peptides and reactive oxygen species causing epithelial injury.37-39 Eotaxins also mediate the release of IL-4 stores from within the eosino- phil granules.40 The expression of each isoform is cell specific with CCL11 being secreted by epithelial cells as well as eosino- phils macrophages lymphocytes fibroblasts and smooth muscle endothelial cells.41 CCL24 and CCL26 are functional homologues that are primarily secreted by epithelial and endo- thelial cells.42 CCL11 transcription is controlled by both the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells NF-kB and signal transducer and activator of transcription6 STAT643 and is the initial eotaxin isoform produced whereas CCL26 is predominantly controlled by STAT6 and is the late-stage eotaxin remaining present up to 24 h after aller- gen exposure.4344 All three eotaxins bind to the eosinophil CCR3 receptor to attract them to the site of inflammation.41Eosinophils like other hematopoietic immune cells are formed in the bone marrow and migrate into the blood where they are a small but stable population.45 Eosinophils are responsible for numerous inflammatory processes during parasitic helminth bacterial and viral infections tissue injury tumor immunology and allergic disease.46 ILC2s see section 2.2 are a key source of IL-5 required for mediating eosinophil development and survival.547 During allergic airway inflamma- tory exacerbations excess eosinophils in the lung cause damage to the epithelium through the release of cationic pep-Sara L.

We will highlight the potential of dietary proanthocyanidins to impact on allergic asthma and the immune system.IntroductionOur historic understanding of the pathology of asthma has progressed from it being a collection of symptoms dominated by a restricted airflow but with little knowledge of the under- lying causes12 to recognizing it as an inflammatory lung disease34 initially subtyped as either allergic or non-allergic asthma.

Other T helper-cell subtypes including Th9 Th17 as well as T regulatory Treg cells have also been implicated in inappropriate airway inflammation.2829The lung epithelium and eosinophiliaThe airway epithelium is one of the key regulators of allergic asthma pathology.30 Allergen exposure initiates the release of key cytokines IL-33 IL-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin TSLP by epithelial cells.
