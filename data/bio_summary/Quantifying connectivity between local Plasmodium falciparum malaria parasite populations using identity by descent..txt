Importantly where a tradeoff must be made between sequencing effort and sample sizes we show that robust spatial trends can be recovered using 93-SNP barcodes providing a cheap and simple approach to implementing these analyses in the field.ResultsThe genomic data included 1173 single-infection parasite samples genotyped at 93 SNPs  henceforth referred to as barcode data and 178 single-infection parasite samples for which whole genome sequences WGS were available henceforth referred to as WGS data .

As a result despite increasing efforts to collect genomic data for epidemiological surveillance of malaria on local spatial scales methods for making sense of them and guidelines for study design are lacking.On large or continental scales or where recombination is limited P. falciparum genetic data have been usefully employed to identify spatial relationships between parasite populations using standard approaches .

Explicitly spatial meth- ods applied to these data include tests and scans of spatial autocorrelation  which are typically suited to highly resolved geo-referenced data.

to monitor disease transmission  relatedness within multiple- genotype infections  to aid surveillance of antimalarial resistance  and to detect sig- nals of selection .To explore the utility of IBD for estimating connectivity between very local parasite popu- lations we analyzed one of the largest joint data sets of both genotyping and sequencing data collected between 2001-2014 from four Shoklo Malaria Research Unit SMRU clinics on the Thai-Myanmar border .

Those based on WGS data were an order of magnitude larger  but there was no evidence of spatial trends between clinics based on either barcode or WGS data .

This is an important practical insight given the wide availability of historical barcode data and the relative cost-effectiveness and ease of generating barcode data compared to whole genome sequences.

Akin to IBD-based analyses ChromoPainter leverages the wealth of haplotypic information in WGS data but struggles to resolve variation in 93-SNP barcode data for which it was never intended.

Epidemi- ological models parameterized by human mobility data have been used to estimate the spatial spread of pathogens in some cases - but data on human migration are difficult to obtain particularly in sparsely populated areas and in regions near international borders where there are political sensitivities around measuring migration.Analyses of spatial genetic structure are common beyond malaria e.g.

They could thus prove useful as IBS surrogates in spatial studies of other recombining organisms -.In summary we propose that IBD-based relatedness will prove useful in the malaria field and in other infectious disease systems to compare data collected from local sites from areas with more complex topologies and where data are available to compare human and parasitemovement.
