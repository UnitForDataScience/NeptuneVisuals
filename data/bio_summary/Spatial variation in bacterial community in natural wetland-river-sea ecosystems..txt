the water mass movements driven by currents in a coastal environment can change bacterial communities and may increase the number of rare community taxa a previous study suggested that sediments have a higher bacterial diversity than any other type of environment at a global scale the diversity and community composition of bacteria in river sediments are distinct from those in estuary sediments abundance and activity of bacteria in the marine and brackish water zones are distinct due to different freshwater regimes bacterial community composition and diversity in sediments varied with distance from the shallow-water hydrothermal vents of kueishan island these studies suggest that bacterial communities are sensitive to environmental changes and can mediate its community structures in response to these external changes.intertidal and coastal areas have complex water flow- paths within the coastal zone of mixing where freshwater interacts with seawater and where gradients in salinity iron oxygen sulfur nitrogen and other chemicals have been observed in addition a high variability in ph value salinity and concentrations of nutrients which are main controlling factors of bacterial community structure would be exhibited among different habitats.

addition- ally determining the types of sediments that contain more phylogenetic diversity will illustrate more information of bacterial patterns in coastal area.the yellow river delta is a typical coastal wetland and is one of the most active regions of land-river-sea interaction in the world the yellow river yr is the second largest river in china and the sixth largest river in the world in terms of length has the highest suspended particulate matter concentration in the world and the second largest sediment load representing 6 of the estimated global river sediment flux to the sea this suspended sediment contains iron nitrogen and other elements and is potentially important for nutrient accumulation in marine sediment.previous work and our preliminary study have shown that total iron fe ferrous iron feii ferric iron feiii and ammonium nhth4 -n are present in higher concentrationsin the coastal marine sediment than in the estuarine sedimentof the yellow river whereas nitrate no-3 -n concentration is higher in the estuarine sediment than in the coastal marine sediment.

these results show that bacterial community composition is partitioned by ecosystem in the coastal area of the yellow river delta.the alpha diversity of the bacterial community was the highest in river samples shannon indices ranged from 9.51 to 10.4 and chao1 richness varied from 5728 to 6427 otus in the river sediments table in contrast the low intertidal wetland sediments had the lowest shannon indices and chao1 richness ranging from 8.39 to 9.84 and 2849-5556 otus respectively.

based on the lack of shift in the diversity and abundance of bacteria from estuary coastal wetland and oceanic environments and the relationship between bacterial community structure and environmental factors the yellow river delta was proposed as a model system to test our hypotheses.the objectives of this study were i to determine the spatial variation in bacterial community structure as habitats shift from wetland to estuary to marine coastal environments and ii to determine the main biogeochemical factors influencing sediment bacterial community structure along with habitat succession.

notably bacterial diversity and richness at the estuary site yr3 was slightly lower than at the yr1 and yr2 river sites located farther from the river mouth while bacterial diversity and richness at the coastal marine site bhb02 was similar to the river sites and was higher than at the p1 and p2 marine sites located farther from the river mouth.

it has been previously reported that the microbial community in both surface and subsurface soils from tibet are influenced by total carbon and the carbon to nitrogen ratio the total bacterial community structure in a small arctic river was significantly correlated with turbidity but the estuary bacterial community was not significantly correlated with any environmental factor thus bacterial communi- ties in different ecosystems are influenced by different environmental variables.

contrary to our assumption although the microbial community composition differed between the river and marine sediments the community structure was driven bysimilar sediment parameters that is salinity nh4-n and no3-n. in the wetland there was a strong significant correlation between bacterial community and sediment salinity so2- and ph.

previous studies mainly focused on either river to marine environments or intertidal wetland comparison of the bacterial diversity in sediments from freshwater intertidal wetland and marine was revealed for the first time in the pearl river in south china but the correlation between bacterial community structure and environmental factors is unavail- able.

influence of environmental variables on the bacterial community structureto investigate the possible effects of environmental variables on bacterial community structure pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between bacterial community and the measured sedimentary characteristics fig.

together these results strongly indicate that bacterial community structure from all samples are affected by salinity ph and so2- and that salinity is the main factor that plays a significant role in shaping the bacterial community in the wetland river and marine environments.

this study illustrates the bacterial community-environ- mental condition relationships for three types of sedi- ments and offers insights that will improve our understanding of the effect of environmental changes on bacterial community structures in coastal ecosystems.in conclusion analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences revealed differences in bacterial community composition and indicate that community diversity and spatial distribution of bacteria in sediments from a typical coastal area with land-river-sea interaction are determined mainly by biogeo- chemistry and habitat.

these elevated values in sites yr3 and bhb02 may be caused by the river-sea interaction.table 1 physicochemical gradients across all sites located in the intertidal wetlands of the yellow river delta the coastal zone of the yellow river estuary and the bohai sea spatial variation of bacterial communities across wetland estuary and marine environmentsat 97 sequence identity a total of 63149 operational taxonomic units otus were obtained across 39 samples.

diversity and richness were higher in sediments at the mixing site bhb02 near the river mouth than at the other two bohai sea sites but diversity and richness in the estuary yr3 sediments were slightly lower than in the yr1 and yr2 river samples.
