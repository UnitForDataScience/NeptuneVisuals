The water mass movements driven by currents in a coastal environment can change bacterial communities and may increase the number of rare community taxa A previous study suggested that sediments have a higher bacterial diversity than any other type of environment at a global scale The diversity and community composition of bacteria in river sediments are distinct from those in estuary sediments Abundance and activity of bacteria in the marine and brackish water zones are distinct due to different freshwater regimes Bacterial community composition and diversity in sediments varied with distance from the shallow-water hydrothermal vents of Kueishan Island These studies suggest that bacterial communities are sensitive to environmental changes and can mediate its community structures in response to these external changes.Intertidal and coastal areas have complex water flow- paths within the coastal zone of mixing where freshwater interacts with seawater and where gradients in salinity iron oxygen sulfur nitrogen and other chemicals have been observed In addition a high variability in pH value salinity and concentrations of nutrients which are main controlling factors of bacterial community structure would be exhibited among different habitats.

Based on the lack of shift in the diversity and abundance of bacteria from estuary coastal wetland and oceanic environments and the relationship between bacterial community structure and environmental factors the Yellow River Delta was proposed as a model system to test our hypotheses.The objectives of this study were i to determine the spatial variation in bacterial community structure as habitats shift from wetland to estuary to marine coastal environments and ii to determine the main biogeochemical factors influencing sediment bacterial community structure along with habitat succession.

Influence of environmental variables on the bacterial community structureTo investigate the possible effects of environmental variables on bacterial community structure Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship between bacterial community and the measured sedimentary characteristics Fig.

It has been previously reported that the microbial community in both surface and subsurface soils from Tibet are influenced by total carbon and the carbon to nitrogen ratio The total bacterial community structure in a small Arctic river was significantly correlated with turbidity but the estuary bacterial community was not significantly correlated with any environmental factor Thus bacterial communi- ties in different ecosystems are influenced by different environmental variables.

This study illustrates the bacterial community-environ- mental condition relationships for three types of sedi- ments and offers insights that will improve our understanding of the effect of environmental changes on bacterial community structures in coastal ecosystems.In conclusion analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed differences in bacterial community composition and indicate that community diversity and spatial distribution of bacteria in sediments from a typical coastal area with land-river-sea interaction are determined mainly by biogeo- chemistry and habitat.

These results show that bacterial community composition is partitioned by ecosystem in the coastal area of the Yellow River Delta.The alpha diversity of the bacterial community was the highest in river samples Shannon indices ranged from 9.51 to 10.4 and Chao1 richness varied from 5728 to 6427 OTUs in the river sediments Table In contrast the low intertidal wetland sediments had the lowest Shannon indices and Chao1 richness ranging from 8.39 to 9.84 and 2849-5556 OTUs respectively.

TOC Fe and SO2-concentrationBased on the bacterial community dissimilarity between wetland river and marine sediments environmentalFIGURE 6 Redundancy analysis RDA compares the overall bacterial community structure in sediment samples and environmental factors arrows including pH total Fe Fe ammonia NH4-N nitrate NO3-N sulfate SO2- and salinity.

The percentage of variation explained by each axis is shownwere significantly correlated with dominant bacterial community in river sediments and Fe TN and pH were significantly correlated with dominant bacterial community in marine sediments Supporting Information Table S2.

Together these results strongly indicate that bacterial community structure from all samples are affected by salinity pH and SO2- and that salinity is the main factor that plays a significant role in shaping the bacterial community in the wetland river and marine environments.

Bacterial community analysis revealed spatial variation in community structures over habitats.
