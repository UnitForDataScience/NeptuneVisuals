Our data supports the increasing body of evidence showing that HMA sponges are associated with more diverse microbial communities than LMA sponges.Our analysis further shows that microbial communities associated with HMA sponges are not only structurally distinct from those of LMA sponges but also display smaller variation within their microbiomes than their LMA counterparts.

2014 or HMA Easson and Thacker 2014 was revisited and based on the present TEM images documenting large amounts of microorganisms Figure 1 E. formosus was clearly identified as an HMA sponge.Alpha and Beta Diversities in HMA and LMA SpongesRarefaction curves indicated a broad gradient of sampling depths and number of OTUs 16S rRNA gene sequences clustered at 97 similarity obtained for HMA and LMA samples Supplementary Figure 1.

The present study was aimed to compare alpha and beta diversities between HMA and LMA sponge samples to identify differently abundant prokaryotic taxa in HMA and LMA sponge species and to predict the HMA-LMA status of sponges by machine learning.

Distance-based multivariate statistics were performed with PERMANOVA v.1.0.1 implemented in PRIMER v. 6.1.11 PRIMER-E UK with an alpha level of 5.Statistical Analysis of Taxa Abundances in HMA and LMA SpeciesThe detection of microbial taxa that were differentially abundant between HMA and LMA sponges was conducted at the host species level because analysis of microbial diversities indicated that this factor was responsible for a large part of the variation observed see Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4.

It is noteworthy that the host identity explained most of the variation followed by the HMA-LMA status the interaction between geographic region and HMA-LMA status and lastly geographic region alone Table 1.Identification of HMA and LMA Indicator TaxaThe taxa that differed in abundance between HMA and LMA sponges P  0.05 were inspected with phylum class and OTU datasets Figure 4.

They were firstly termed bacterial sponges and non-symbiont harboring normal sponges Reiswig 1981 and later the terms high microbial abundance HMA and low microbial abundance LMA were used Hentschel et al.

HMA sponges were associated with richer and more diverse microbiomes than LMA sponges as indicated by the comparison of alpha diversity metrics.

Bacterial densities in HMA sponges are two to four orders of magnitude higher than in LMA sponges Hentschel et al.

Despite the fact that neither the phylum Cyanobacteria nor the class Synechococcophycideae was enriched in either group the cyanobacterial Otu0000007 was more abundant in HMA sponges while the cyanobacterial Otu0000002 was more abundant in LMA sponges.

in review.All alpha diversity metrics considered in this study showed that HMA sponges are generally significantly associated with richer more diverse microbial communities than LMA sponges.
