To investigate the influence of LC supplementation on piglets' gut microbiome and compare the differences in community composition between LC and antibiotics with ZnO addition we assessed the cecal microbial community by 16S rRNA gene sequencing with three treatments consisting of basal diet CTR group basal diet with low-molecular-weight chitosan LC group and basal diet with antibiotic and ZnO AZ group.

The results showed that three groups were distinctly different in the distributionof microbiota P  0.05 Table 1 indicating that LC and AZ significantly affected the cecal bacterial structure when compared to CTR.Effects of Dietary LC and AZ on the Composition of the Cecal MicrobiotaTwenty-two bacterial phyla were assigned in the LC AZ and CTR groups and 14 of them were shared among them Supplementary Table S6.

Beta diversity analysis showed that community structure was distinctly different among the CTR LC and AZ treatments indicating that either LC or AZ treatment modulated the piglet microbiota.

Heatmap diagrams were plotted in R environment v3.1.2 .Sequence Data Accession NumberRaw paired-end reads were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive of the NCBI accession number SRP104359.RESULTSEffects of LC or AZ on the pH in Cecal SamplesThe cecal pH value in the piglets fed with LC was determined to be 6.19 which was significantly lower than that in the control 6.55 P  0.05.

Instead 148 72 and 108 unique OTUs were identified in CTR LC and AZ groups respectively.Effects of Dietary LC and AZ on Alpha and Beta Bacterial DiversityWe compared bacterial diversity PD and Shannon index and richness observed species and Chao index indices for alpha- diversity.

PD index in the LC group or AZ group was significantly lower than that in the CTR group P  0.05 showing that the bacterial diversity in cecum was decreased by AZ or LC Figure 1B.

About community richness indices Observed species and Chao there was no significant difference between LC and CTR indicating that LC did not affect bacterial richness.

Additionally supplementary LC only decreased the gut bacterial diversity rather than bacterial richness.For beta diversity analysis we examined the relationshipsin cecal microbiome between the control AZ supplement and LC addition using NMDS.

The relative abundance of Desulfovibrio in treatments LC and AZ was significantly lower than that in the control group P  0.05 Figure 1H.Function Prediction of the Microbial Community in the CecumGiven the distinct microbiome changes within the LC and AZ pigs compared to CTR pigs we tested whether the different treatments would lead to functional changes in each microbiome.

In addition LC group significantly increased the abundance of glycan biosynthesis and metabolism whenmetabolism 15 different KO terms metabolism of cofactors and vitamins 9 energy metabolism 8 glycan biosynthesis and metabolism 6 Figure 3 suggesting that the drastically increased Prevotella by LC and AZ played an important function among the intestinal microbiota.
