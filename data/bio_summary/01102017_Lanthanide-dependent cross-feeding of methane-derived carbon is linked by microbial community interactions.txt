3A is the pre- dominant MDH in M. tundripaludum 3132.However we discovered that the presence of the non- methanotrophic methylotroph in the co-culture causes a change in relative expression of the two methanotroph MDHs in the presence of lanthanum and that this change results in the release of methanol into the medium by the methanotroph.In the methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV the affinity for methanol of XoxF-type MDH was much higher than reported for other MDHs with a Km of 0.8 mM 40.

2 B and C.The expression of the methanotroph MxaF-type MDH in thecocultures was unexpected because 30 mM lanthanum was in- cluded in all cultures and recent studies with other methano- trophs have shown that the XoxF-type MDH should be the dominant MDH expressed in the presence of lanthanum 26 27.

26 and this study in pure cultures the amount of lanthanum added was sufficient to repress expression of the genes for the MxaF-type MDH throughout the course of the experiment even in the presence of copper.In both M. mobilis JLW8 and M. mobilis 13 the dominant xoxF gene transcripts also change expression in the coculture as com- pared with the pure cultures.

In the presence of a co-occurring nonmethanotrophic methylotroph the expression of the me- thanotroph XoxF-type MDH decreased and the expression of the methanotroph MxaF-type MDH increased compared with the pure culture grown identically to the cocultures a finding also seen in the RNA-sequencing RNA-seq results Fig.

However in the presence of the nonmethanotroph gene expression of the dominant methanol dehydrogenase MDH shifts from the lanthanide-dependent MDH XoxF-type to the calcium-dependent MDH MxaF-type.

We first con- firmed that in pure cultures of M. tundripaludum 3132 grown identically to the cocultures the XoxF-type MDH is the domi- nant MDH expressed in the presence of lanthanum.We further verified that in pure cultures of the methanotroph different concentrations of lanthanum in the medium lantha- num depletion over time or different O2 levels do not have any notable effect on the gene expression of the dominant MDHs Fig.

In the methanotroph we identified a clear shift in the expression of the two MDH genes in the presence of M. mobilis JLW8 compared with the pure culture Fig.

Error bars indicate the SE n 4 in A n  8 in B and C.cocultures grown without lanthanum increased expression of the MxaF-type MDH occurs in the methanotroph and the co- occurring nonmethanotrophic methylotroph increases in abun- dance Fig.

4A but in the absence of lanthanum methanol and a shift to mxaF gene expression methanol was clearly detected with a concentration of 1.24 mM at the end of the incubation Fig.
