Here we discuss the importance of this industry to the bioeconomy and two of its key factors the synthetic biology approach to research and development RD and the unique nature of the carefully designed stakeholder-inclusive community- directed evolution of the field.Synthetic Biology RD Revolutionising Biotechnologyadvances delivered by synthetic biology are evidence of the support of govern- ments and funding bodies who have also fostered programs that facilitate routes to market and the creation of a thriving het- erogeneous community Box 1 .

In 2016 190 American synthetic biology companies raised US830 mil- lionxxiixxiiiReplacing Traditional Industrial ProcessesThe technological advances brought by synthetic biology have enabled projects delivering high-value products in the traditional biotech sector.

Since its coinage synthetic biology has evolved as an umbrella term defined by a con- ceptual framework that aims toward the rational design of biological systems to attain useful products.

This process results in a more reliable and robust industry compatible with automation and scalability while also upgrading its capabilities to carbon- neutral simplified production systems with a wider range of products .Synthetic biology has become a global enterprise expanding to 40 countries with almost 700 organisations conducting synthetic biology research funded by 530 funding agencies .

The industry is providing a rich pipeline of products with high capitalisation among its players higher flow of funds in the equity market more IPOs than any other industry sector and a larger participationof earlier-stage players all of which is characteristic of a prolific industry .Shaping the BioeconomyThe Influence of Synthetic Biology on the Biotech Market and the BioeconomyDespite its youth synthetic biology already has a significant market stake being valued at US3.9 billion in 2016 growing at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 24.4 and expected to reach approximately US11.4 billion by 2021 .

Overall syn- thetic biology is an innovation platform driving the expansion of the bioeconomy its contributions go beyond research and include the development of social and community-based initiatives facilitating its acceptance and integration by indus- try society governments and markets .Accelerating the RD CycleThe initiatives supporting synthetic biol- ogy prioritised the advancement of enabling technologies Box 2 some of which have advanced the scope of numerous research areas in industry and academia rendering a potential eco- nomic impact of between US700 billion and US1.6 trillion per year by 2025 .

Beyond these technological advance- ments synthetic biology has transformed conventional RD cycles  in the biotech industry by integrating the follow- ing approaches that improve reliability speed and costs i in silico modelling through abstraction to reduce trial- and-error approaches ii public reposito- ries of standardised genetic componentsFigure 1.

Its superior efficacy and precision coupled with its simplicity and low cost US100 has revolutionised the genomic engineering arena and enabled its widespread adoption in research and industry by both trained scientists and amateurs xxviii180TDDIF181TDDIFMathematical Modelling182TDDIFModelling is an elementary tool for the rational design of robust and complex synthetic biology systems.

It enables abstraction and increases the speed and reliability of building synthetic biological devices and systems by reducing the amount of time-consuming expensive and unpredictable wet-lab experiments.

Biotech now has an extensive investor base comprising rec- ognised investor firms including renowned tech firms such as Google Ventures Appendix Axii and Y Combinator xiiixiv thetic biology has more than 20 dedicated business incubator programs supported by industry government or VC firms including LABS Singularity University and IndieBio and RebelBio US and Ireland xv investment has changed with the marked increase in net capital flow and proportion of innovation and early- stage capital strongly supported by cor- porate VC firms implying a structural change in the markets fostering entre- preneurship as evidenced by funding raised by synthetic biology firms .
