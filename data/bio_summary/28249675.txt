the industry is providing a rich pipeline of products with high capitalisation among its players higher flow of funds in the equity market more ipos than any other industry sector and a larger participationof earlier-stage players all of which is characteristic of a prolific industry .shaping the bioeconomythe influence of synthetic biology on the biotech market and the bioeconomydespite its youth synthetic biology already has a significant market stake being valued at us3.9 billion in 2016 growing at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 24.4 and expected to reach approximately us11.4 billion by 2021 .

beyond these technological advance- ments synthetic biology has transformed conventional rd cycles  in the biotech industry by integrating the follow- ing approaches that improve reliability speed and costs i in silico modelling through abstraction to reduce trial- and-error approaches ii public reposito- ries of standardised genetic componentsfigure 1. the synthetic biology biodesign cycle and impacts on stakeholder groups in the product supply chain.box 2. synthetic biology fosters disruptive technological advancesdna sequencingas an outcome of the thousand-dollar genome project next-generation sequencing ngs and third-generation sequencing platforms were conceived .

despite the contraction of themarket in 2016 typical of the cyclic behaviour of the biotech market the ipo window remained open featuring a high proportion of early-stage compa- nies who raised 30 more than pre- money valuations iii funding of biotech remained strong with us vc firms investing approximately us7 billion well above the us4.2 billion historic average while average start-up investment doubled from us7.5 to us15 million per deal ivoverall despite the volatility of the mar- kets the biotech industry has maintained a steady expansion and the national association of securities dealers automated quotations nasdaq biotech index is still performing at 160 of its value 5 years ago.

however significant this valua- tion is conservative because its contribu- tions are not confined to any readily measured biotech industry segment but instead benefit the overall industry.synthetic biology has expanded the bio- tech industry by enabling biotech to be integrated in other industries such as dna data archives v and molecular machines vi industry attracting new players through easy-to-use and inexpensive tools e.g.

a 2016 survey reported over 350 synthetic biology dedicated firms across the usa and the eu in 16 different industries rais- ing us3.3 billion between 2009 and 2015. in 2016 190 american synthetic biology companies raised us830 mil- lionxxiixxiiireplacing traditional industrial processesthe technological advances brought by synthetic biology have enabled projects delivering high-value products in the traditional biotech sector.

here we discuss the importance of this industry to the bioeconomy and two of its key factors the synthetic biology approach to research and development rd and the unique nature of the carefully designed stakeholder-inclusive community- directed evolution of the field.synthetic biology rd revolutionising biotechnologyadvances delivered by synthetic biology are evidence of the support of govern- ments and funding bodies who have also fostered programs that facilitate routes to market and the creation of a thriving het- erogeneous community box 1 .

biotech now has an extensive investor base comprising rec- ognised investor firms including renowned tech firms such as google ventures appendix axii and y combinator xiiixiv thetic biology has more than 20 dedicated business incubator programs supported by industry government or vc firms including labs singularity university and indiebio and rebelbio us and ireland xv investment has changed with the marked increase in net capital flow and proportion of innovation and early- stage capital strongly supported by cor- porate vc firms implying a structural change in the markets fostering entre- preneurship as evidenced by funding raised by synthetic biology firms .

synthetic biology applications are conquering new markets and shaping the bioeconomy by integrat- ing it with industry sectors that are not accounted for in traditional biotech.

the european union eu has estimated that its bioeconomy has a value of s2 trillion although this figure includes activities beyond biotech i481dtfid similarly the uk has estimated its bio- economy to be valued at ps150 billion predicting a growth of ps40 billion over the next decade iipublic and private biotech markets have also expanded with the longest and larg- est expansion in biotech history beginning in 2009 and peaking in 2015. since 2013 more than 224 companies launched on public markets with initial public offer- ings ipos creating a market value of us95 billion.

this process results in a more reliable and robust industry compatible with automation and scalability while also upgrading its capabilities to carbon- neutral simplified production systems with a wider range of products .synthetic biology has become a global enterprise expanding to 40 countries with almost 700 organisations conducting synthetic biology research funded by 530 funding agencies .

overall syn- thetic biology is an innovation platform driving the expansion of the bioeconomy its contributions go beyond research and include the development of social and community-based initiatives facilitating its acceptance and integration by indus- try society governments and markets .accelerating the rd cyclethe initiatives supporting synthetic biol- ogy prioritised the advancement of enabling technologies box 2 some of which have advanced the scope of numerous research areas in industry and academia rendering a potential eco- nomic impact of between us700 billion and us1.6 trillion per year by 2025 .

an increasing reliance on in silico models accelerates innovation and reduces costs .figure i. scientific breakthroughs advances in enabling technologies and milestones that have built synthetic biology as a discipline.enabling sharing of parts that can be reused and optimised for different pur- poses  iii decoupling rd proj- ects from manufacture such as dna synthesis where research efforts and scaled manufacturing can be performed simultaneously by different entities ix and iv automation and scaling x framework advances innovation by pro- viding a common language and infra- structure encouraging collaboration enabling in-parallel work and reducing the dependence on highly trained spe- cialists and expensive time-consuming lab work xifostering investment and entrepreneurshipby adopting this framework biotech projects have become more reliable and feasible endeavours that are more attrac- tive for investment.

in addition the diagnostics indus- try has benefited from synthetic biology tools and has applied them to multiple novel molecular andor microfluidics diag- nostics platforms that are now revolutio- nising the industry.

synthetic biology has furthermore been adopted in the pharma- ceutical industry enabling drug discovery and the creation of more effective safer and cheaper drugs and for vaccine development because it reduces the time for development significantly.
