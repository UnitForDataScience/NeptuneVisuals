Studies have also shown that while normal intestinal microbiota hastened the progression of gastric neoplasia antimicrobial treatment delayed its onset both in H. pylori-infected and uninfected insulin-gastrin INS-GAS mice.In addition H. pylori-free INS-GAS mice colonised with intestinal microbiota developed GC more quickly than germ-free mice.Taken together these findings highlight the potential involvement of microbes other than H. pylori in gastric carcinogenesis.To date the distribution of gastric microbiome in the devel- opment of GC remains largely unclear.

Gut microbiotaSeveral studies have provided evidences that bacteria including members of Proteobacteria Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria phyla can be regularly detected in gastric biop- sieswith gastric microbial dysbiosis associated with GC.In particular chronic Helicobacter pylori infection which causes mucosal inflammation and induces histological changes is recognised as a major risk factor for GC.

We further investigated gastric microbes that could interact with H. pylori across stages of gastric tumourigenesis.

There are inconsistent reports about changes in gastric microbiome compositions across stages of gastric carcinogenesis in terms of microbial diversity and rich- ness.The discrepancy may be due in part to different vari- ables affecting gut microbiome composition such as gender age ethnicity and H. pylori infection.To overcome some of these factors we adjusted OTU abundances for potential confounders including age gender and H. pylori status.

Also for a detailed gastric microbial structure we collected samples from three anatomical gastric positions and demonstrated their similarities in terms of microbial diversity and richness.Interestingly from our species level classifications we observed that 14 of the 21 GC-enriched bacterial taxa are puta- tive known members of the oral microbiome including P. micraP.

Our analysis extended previous works by including progressive stages of gastric cancer--AG IM and GC--and suggests no effect of H. pylori on diversity and richness of gastric microbiome.

Further investigations into the implications of microbiome functional dysbiosis in GC are needed for deeper understanding of gastric tumourigenesis.The relatively high pH of the gastric lumen due to chronic inflammation microbial metabolic products and other factors can contribute to increased growth of extragastric microbes.
