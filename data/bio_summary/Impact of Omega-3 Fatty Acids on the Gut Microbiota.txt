From these findings the importance of the omega-3 connection to the microbiota emerges encouraging further studies.Keywords omega-3 PUFAs DHA EPA gut microbiota dysbiosis inflammation behavioral disordersIntroductionIn the last few years the emergence and growing accessibility of next-generation sequencing NGS technologies have allowed advances in the understanding of the composition and functional activity of the gut microbial community.

In particular gut microbiota changes associated with omega-3 fatty acids are poorly understood.Among the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid EPA C205 and docosahexaenoic acid DHA C226 are the two main bioactive forms in humans.

Also with regards to the link to immunity studies have shown that the supplementation of omega-3 PUFAs provides multiple health benefits against different chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular diseases  rheumatoid arthritis  inflammatory bowel disease IBD  depression  andcancer .Considering the few insights existing in literature in the present review we assessed whether omega-3 PUFAs have an impact on the composition of the human gut microbiota in adults and infants.

Subsequent studies focused more on food and diet impact instead of nutraceutical use of omega-3 PUFAs likely because omega-3 fatty acids integrated in a food matrix can have a higher positive impact on gut microbiota.

The authors explained that difference with the fact that cow's milk contains considerably less omega-3 PUFAs in comparison with infant formula so omega-3 PUFAs can have a dose-response effect in changing the gut microbiota profile .

Some studies have shown that omega-3 PUFAs can modify the intestinal microbiota composition  by increasing the number of Bifidobacteria that decrease gut permeability  and increase the number of Enterobacteria that increase intestinal permeability  allowing increased systemic concentration of LPS and endotoxemia.Studies on the effects of omega-3 PUFAs on microbiota have mainly focused on the major bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in animal models.

indicated that omega-3 PUFA intake in pregnant mice could influence offspring microbiota and immune response through the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 PUFAs.

These findings suggest that the administration of omega-3 PUFAs during embryonic development is important for the proper development of the microbiota and immune system.Studies on mice-transplanted faeces showed that the omega-3 PUFAs can modify the microbiota through the production and secretion of intestinal alkaline phosphatase IAP leading to a reduction in the number of LPS-producing bacteria thus reducing metabolic endotoxemia .
