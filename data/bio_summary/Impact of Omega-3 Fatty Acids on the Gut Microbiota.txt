however mice fed an omega-3-enriched diet showed significantly enhanced cognition and dampened hpa-axis activity and inflammation as well as an improved intestinal epithelial integrity due to a higher abundance of the bifidobacteria genus.this evidence supports the idea of a novel mechanistic hypothesis by which omega-3 pufas exert their beneficial effects on health brain functions and behavior by influencing gut microbiota composition and thus gut-brain axis functionality.table 3. summarized studies investigating the omega-3 effects on microbiota composition in stressed and depressed animal models.studied populationdietsmain outcomesrobertson et al.c57bl6j micecontrol standard chow or omega-3 pufa supplemented diet contained 1 g epa  dha100 g diet o3 oro3 diet leads to an increase of the abundance of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus genera enhances cognition and dampens hpa axis activity.

from these findings the importance of the omega-3 connection to the microbiota emerges encouraging further studies.keywords omega-3 pufas dha epa gut microbiota dysbiosis inflammation behavioral disordersintroductionin the last few years the emergence and growing accessibility of next-generation sequencing ngs technologies have allowed advances in the understanding of the composition and functional activity of the gut microbial community.

in particular gut microbiota changes associated with omega-3 fatty acids are poorly understood.among the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas eicosapentaenoic acid epa c205 and docosahexaenoic acid dha c226 are the two main bioactive forms in humans.

also with regards to the link to immunity studies have shown that the supplementation of omega-3 pufas provides multiple health benefits against different chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular diseases  rheumatoid arthritis  inflammatory bowel disease ibd  depression  andcancer .considering the few insights existing in literature in the present review we assessed whether omega-3 pufas have an impact on the composition of the human gut microbiota in adults and infants.

subsequent studies focused more on food and diet impact instead of nutraceutical use of omega-3 pufas likely because omega-3 fatty acids integrated in a food matrix can have a higher positive impact on gut microbiota.

the authors explained that difference with the fact that cow's milk contains considerably less omega-3 pufas in comparison with infant formula so omega-3 pufas can have a dose-response effect in changing the gut microbiota profile .

therefore as discussed above the omega-3 pufas favor the butyrate-producing bacterial genera whereas a diet rich in saturated fats can depauperate the gut microbiota of these commensal bacteria.table 1. summarized studies investigating the omega-3 influence on human gut microbiota.human studiesstudied populationdietsmethodmain outcomesrajkumar et al.

some studies have shown that omega-3 pufas can modify the intestinal microbiota composition  by increasing the number of bifidobacteria that decrease gut permeability  and increase the number of enterobacteria that increase intestinal permeability  allowing increased systemic concentration of lps and endotoxemia.studies on the effects of omega-3 pufas on microbiota have mainly focused on the major bacterial phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes in animal models.

indicated that omega-3 pufa intake in pregnant mice could influence offspring microbiota and immune response through the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 pufas.

these findings suggest that the administration of omega-3 pufas during embryonic development is important for the proper development of the microbiota and immune system.studies on mice-transplanted faeces showed that the omega-3 pufas can modify the microbiota through the production and secretion of intestinal alkaline phosphatase iap leading to a reduction in the number of lps-producing bacteria thus reducing metabolic endotoxemia .

future studies with clinical trials are needed to analyze the relationship between omega-3 pufas and microbiota.table 2. summarized studies investigating the omega-3 influence on animal and human gut microbiota.studiesstudied populationdietsmain outcomeshildebrandt et al.

these omega-3 pufa benefits on the brain may be due to their ability to modulate gut microbiota composition.to date data are limited showing that omega-3 pufa administration leads to benefits for behavioral disorders by modulating gut microbiota composition the few studies on this subject mostly completed in animal models are summarized in table .

in particular mice born from mothers fed a diet lacking in omega-3 pufas and themselves fed the same diet displayed anxiety and depressive-like behavior as well as a cognitive and sociability impairment compared with those fed an omega-3 pufa-enriched diet.
