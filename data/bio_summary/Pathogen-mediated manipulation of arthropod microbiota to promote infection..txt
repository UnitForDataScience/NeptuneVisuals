In contrast to sP1-injected ticks the 500000 MW dextran was predominantly lo- calized outside gut lumen suggesting that P1 injection of ticks re- duces the thickness of the PM permitting the large-sized dextran beads to pass from the gut lumen through the PM and out of the gut Fig.

phagocytophilum coopts this tick protein to best potentiate its infection in ticks.IAFGP the I. scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein is induced by ticks in the presence of A. phagocytophilum 26 and silencing iafgp impairs A. phagocytophilum colonization of the gut.

A representative uninfected Clean sample is provided Left Middle at low magnification 500x to visualize a dissected gut revealing the outside of the gut O epithelial cells lining the gut E and luminal content L scale bar 50 mm.

D-alanine- treated representative sample taken at low magnification 500x is provided to visualize a dissected gut revealing the outside of the gut O epithelial cells lining the gut E and luminal content L. Scale bar 50 mm.

Similarities in the relative abundance of Enterococci within the tick gut found by microbiome analysis or SEM imaging of tick gut biofilms when treated with D-serine to those during A. phagocytophilum infection or P1 injection of tick guts support the mechanistic action of IAFGP's peptidoglycan binding activity on modulating the tick microbiota.

S7 A-D. Vi- sualization of tick gut biofilms by SEM showed a severe de- preciation in biofilm-like structures associated fibers and matrix material within D-serine-treated ticks compared with D-alanine- treated ticks Fig.

Un- derstanding the interactions between arthropod gut microbiota and the pathogens that ticks transmit in both a positive and negative manner may provide new strategies for controlling and preventing vector-borne diseases.Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligate intracellular path- ogen transmitted by I. scapularis.

scapularis model dis- tinct differences were noted in the relative abundance and composition of the microbiota of ticks feeding on uninfected orphagocytophilum-infected mice indicating that the presence of A. phagocytophilum alters the tick gut microbial community.

Within the rigors of our experimental framework we demonstrate that there are significant variations in the relative abundance of gut microbial genera during A. phagocytophilum coloniza- tion of ticks.

To elucidate the importance of IAFGP in shaping the tick gut microbiota we injected the antibiofilm peptide P1 derived from IAFGP 25 and showed that this improved A. phagocytophilum infection in ticks.
