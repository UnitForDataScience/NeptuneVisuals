TakenNowak et al.Page 3together the stage of HIV disease and the timing and duration of ART may impact the microbiota differently.The objective of this study was to evaluate the rectal microbiota among three groups HIV- uninfected untreated HIV and ART-treated HIV.Materials and MethodsStudy design and PopulationOur cross-sectional rectal microbiota study was nested in the Abuja Nigeria site of the parent cohort TRUSTRV368.

Statistically significant shifts in relative abundance of rectal microbiota for the HIV treated group included a decrease in the most abundant bacteria Prevotella p0.02 and an increase in pathogenic bacteria Peptoniphilus p0.04 Finegoldia p0.01 Anaerococcus p0.03 and Campylobacter p0.03 as compared to the other groups.Conclusions--Untreated HIV infection does not significantly alter the rectal microbiota whereas prior treatment is associated with a shift towards a more pathogenic pattern of microbiota.

While several studies have focused on the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota virtually no data are available from sub-Saharan Africa and only a few studies 9 10 have begun to characterize the rectal microbiota.The rectal microbiota is dominated by 5 phyla Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria ranked in order of abundance.

Another study among HIV-exposed uninfected infants found co-trimoxazole was associated with an increase in blood levels of lipopolysaccharide a marker of microbial translocation and poor gut integrity but not a direct measure of rectal microbiota changes 38.Alternatively HIV treatment itself may negatively impact the rectal microbiota.

Participants with rectal gonorrhea had increased abundance of Prevotella compared to those without gonorrhea median IQR 29.3 16.2-43.1 vs. 22.7 14.2-33.4 p0.05.Nowak et al.Page 5DiscussionNigerian MSM with untreated HIV did not differ in alpha diversity or composition of their rectal microbiota as compared to HIV-uninfected MSM.
