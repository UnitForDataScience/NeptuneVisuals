To assess whether these gene clusters were not only present in these strains but also actively transcribed under conditions of host colonization the authors analyzed publicly available RNA- seq data from stool samples and could robustly identify tran- scripts of at least one NRPS gene cluster in seven of the eight available analyses.Inspection of pyrazinone and dihydropyrazinone biosynthe- sis revealed that all identified NRPS gene clusters harbored a C-terminal reductase domain that catalyzes the release of the synthesized peptide through reduction to a C-terminal alde- hyde.

through a novel experimental workflow Figure 1.4 A set of publically available metagenome analyses from stool samples that is the gut microbiome of healthy individuals was inspect- ed for the presence of non-ribosomal peptide synthase NRPS gene clusters as small molecules play important roles in host- microbiota interactions.2 Strikingly 90 of all analyzed stool samples revealed the presence of a specific 47-membered NRPS gene family that was not identified in other environmen- tal strains this suggested that these gene clusters might be relevant to the niche of the gut microbiome and potentially to interspecies interactions.

Using two different bioinfor- matics analyses the authors determined that roughly 90 of all healthy humans harbored microbes with at least one of the investigated gene clusters thus indicating that the gut NPRPS family is indeed widely distributed in healthy humans.

This hypothesis however raises a question What is the bio- logically relevant and bioactive product of the NRPS assembly line in particular as these compounds are biosynthesized in an anaerobic and thus basically oxygen free environment The authors speculated that the peptide aldehydes might be the real active and biologically relevant compounds as peptide aldehydes are well known protease inhibitors and some chem- ical studies performed by the authors indicated a reasonable stability of this compounds in the gut environment.

These gene clusters were almost exclusively found in anaerobic Firmicutes of the Clostridia class only some were found in Gram-negative Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio.

As is often the case in metagenome-derived data many of the corresponding organisms had never been isolated or characterized therefore sophisticated approaches for detailed functional understanding were required.A set of 14 example gene clusters originating from all four bacterial clades was heterologously expressed in two common laboratory strains that is Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.Prof.
