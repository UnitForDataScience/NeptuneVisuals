EC 2.7.2.1 acetate kinase EC 2.3.1.8 phosphate acetyl- transferase EC 6.2.1.1 acetyl-CoA synthetase EC 2.3.1.

C Expression profiles of representatively selected EC numbers acetate EC 2.7.2.1 CO2 EC 1.2.99.5 converged EC 2.8.4.1.

Though the expression and the methane production rates in R2 recovered steadily from day 21 as the temperature was set up again at day 16 and reached comparable levels as in R1 C.Remarkably the metatranscriptomic reads show that as an adap- tation to the acetic acid accumulation the expression of acet- ogenotrophic methanogenesis related genes is three times higher in R2 compared to R1 at day 21 B C. As previously discussed ex- pression is predominantly carried out by the two acetoclastic archaea Methanosarcina Eu6 and Eu43.

After 10 days of feeding maximal methane production rates 0.37 lg VS in R1 was observed while in R2 the lower temperature led to only medium methane yields 0.15 lg VS day 7 A.

Only the phosphoglucomutase EC 5.4.2.2 the ADP-dependent phosphofructinase EC 2.7.1.146 and the phosphoglycerate mutase EC 5.4.2.11 show an affected regulation at day 7 or 21.

Beside the tremendous expression of the last three reactions where both modules converge EC 2.1.1.86 EC 2.8.4.1 and EC 1.8.98.1 the me- tatranscriptome data show that the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis module is the one found to be higher expressed 852 FPKM in average compared to the acetotrophic module 144 FPKM in average A B marked in red.

The final estimate of the metabolic potential at a given time point was done by summing FPKM values for all enzymes with the same EC number using Genedata Selector 4.5 Analyst addition transformation activity on all genes with EC numbers.

B Fold change between the expression of selected key EC numbers R1 vs. R2 positive fold change means a higher expression in R1 while a negative fold change indicates a higher expression in R2.

They were identified and grouped according to the fol- lowing criteria based on differences in population abundances in Group maize silage - GBs show two times higher shares in R1 and R2 compared to R3 after day 42 and 84 Group slurry GBs show two times higher shares in R3 compared to R1 and R2 at day 42 and 84 Group 35degC GBs show two times higher shares in R2 compared to R1 at day 7 andor 21 Group 41degC GBs show two times higher shares in R1compared to R2 at day 7 andor at day 21 A and B.
