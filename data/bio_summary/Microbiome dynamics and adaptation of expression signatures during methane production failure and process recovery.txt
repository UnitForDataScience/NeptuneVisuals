after 10 days of feeding maximal methane production rates 0.37 lg vs in r1 was observed while in r2 the lower temperature led to only medium methane yields 0.15 lg vs day 7 a. after increasing the temperature to the targeted value on day 16 and the subsequent feeding stop of 9 days in r2 fermentation was restored and methane production reached very quickly a maximum 0.38 lg vs 3 days after refeeding.

c expression profiles of representatively selected ec numbers acetate ec 2.7.2.1 co2 ec 1.2.99.5 converged ec 2.8.4.1. for interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article.while glycolysis is carried out by many dozens of bacteria and thus they can probably balance temperature stress and acidification more easily as a complex community methanogenesis is liable on some specialized archaea.

hence together with the expression results it can be suggested that thebacterial community's acetogenesis is hardly impaired in r2 and that more acetate was produced than the archaeal community was able to consume.by investigating the expression signatures of the archaeal methane metabolism 73 of assigned ec numbers were revealed being expressed over background 40 out of 55. strikingly in light of the irreplaceable relevance for conversion of hydrogen or acetate into methane the rna- seq data highlight that the involved archaeal population comprising only 1-3 of the total biomass shows the most highly expressed pathway that regulates methane metabolism main reactions illustrated in a red fpkm  100000. indeed a comparison between metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads reflecting gene abundances on the one hand and gene expression activity on the other hand revealed a positive correlation on ec quantification.

in contrast to the hardly impaired glycolysis pathway the methane metabolism is significantly influenced with 50 of all ex- pressed ec entities 20 out of 40. essentially at day 7 the reduction of acetate a marked in violet as well as of co2 a marked in red is strongly repressed in r2 compared to r1 b. while a lower growth rate of all detected methanogens in r2 is observed at that time point and might contribute per se to this lower activity  it is also assumed that the low diversity in the archaeal popu- lation makes it more sensitive to environmental disturbances such as temperature stress.

though the expression and the methane production rates in r2 recovered steadily from day 21 as the temperature was set up again at day 16 and reached comparable levels as in r1 c.remarkably the metatranscriptomic reads show that as an adap- tation to the acetic acid accumulation the expression of acet- ogenotrophic methanogenesis related genes is three times higher in r2 compared to r1 at day 21 b c. as previously discussed ex- pression is predominantly carried out by the two acetoclastic archaea methanosarcina eu6 and eu43.

a methane production yields of the three reactors r1-r3 r1 and r2 were continuously fed with maize silage and digestate and temperature was adjusted to 41 degc except for r2 with an initial phase at 35 degc until day 16 and a substrate feeding stop between day 16 and 24 indicated by the dashed line with missing methane yields for r3 only digestate was applied.

only the phosphoglucomutase ec 5.4.2.2 the adp-dependent phosphofructinase ec 2.7.1.146 and the phosphoglycerate mutase ec 5.4.2.11 show an affected regulation at day 7 or 21. as the analytical results confirm starch was still reduced to acetic acid with an accumulation of above 1000 ppm in r2.

beside the tremendous expression of the last three reactions where both modules converge ec 2.1.1.86 ec 2.8.4.1 and ec 1.8.98.1 the me- tatranscriptome data show that the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis module is the one found to be higher expressed 852 fpkm in average compared to the acetotrophic module 144 fpkm in average a b marked in red.

b fold change between the expression of selected key ec numbers r1 vs. r2 positive fold change means a higher expression in r1 while a negative fold change indicates a higher expression in r2.

they were identified and grouped according to the fol- lowing criteria based on differences in population abundances in group maize silage - gbs show two times higher shares in r1 and r2 compared to r3 after day 42 and 84 group slurry gbs show two times higher shares in r3 compared to r1 and r2 at day 42 and 84 group 35degc gbs show two times higher shares in r2 compared to r1 at day 7 andor 21 group 41degc gbs show two times higher shares in r1compared to r2 at day 7 andor at day 21 a and b. group maizefig.

a third rather minor factor and not as prominent as for the diversity development is the process time which is reflected when considering the course of r1 from day 7 to day 84. consequently also a very close convergence of the population of r2 to r1 after being well-adapted and producing high yields of methane in the long term 84 d was observed.

the final estimate of the metabolic potential at a given time point was done by summing fpkm values for all enzymes with the same ec number using genedata selector 4.5 analyst addition transformation activity on all genes with ec numbers.

nevertheless the main pathway is consistently present indicated by coloring the ec re- actions according to the average expression values in r1 and r2 for all time points.

by way of example for the data from day 7 in reactor r1 a pearson correlation coefficient of r  0.73 of all non-methanogenesis and non-glycolysis ec numbers and a slightly lower coefficient of r  0.65 for glycolysis related genes were calculated.
