Despite the development of several small animal models to study ZIKV infection and patho- genesis most of these models lack critical innate immune components and succumb rapidly to ZIKV infection precluding an analysis of the immune response to infection -  .As such the model developed and data presented herein represent an important reference point for the analysis of the immune response to ZIKV infection in adult immunocompetent mice and has uncovered a novel epitope of ZIKV recognized by CD8 T cells.The recent demonstration that the ZIKV NS5 protein is capable of interrupting type I IFN production in human but not mouse cells has led to the suggestion that ZIKV is unable to cause disease in mice .

Taken together these results demonstrate that ZIKV infection induces a T cell response in WT immunocompetent mice that can be tracked using the surro- gate marker approach suggesting that this represents a valid model for the analysis of the overall T cell responses to ZIKV infection.Kinetics of ZIKV Infection in Adult WT MiceAlthough the observed T cell response was strongly suggestive of an active viral infection we sought to determine the kinetics of ZIKV infection by quantifying ZIKV RNA in the spleen at various time points post-infection i.v.

Taken together our data indi- cates that ZIKV infection is able to induce a prototypical antiviral CD8 T cell response in WT immunocompetent mice characterized by the majority of the antigen-specific CD8 T cells developing critical effector functions.Antigen-Experienced CD8 T Cells Recognize an Epitope in the ZIKV Envelope ProteinIn order to provide further validation of the surrogate marker approach in the analysis of the immune response to ZIKV infection as well as to potentially identify ZIKV-specific CD8 T cell epitopes we used the Immune Epitope Database IEDB analysis resource con- sensus tool to predict CD8 T cell epitopes within the ZIKV polyprotein .

Thus ZIKV infection of WT mice induces innate immune cell activation that is dependent upon infection with live virus.The importance of the type I IFN response in ZIKV immunity has been demonstrated clearly by the severe morbidity and mortality of mice lacking IFNAR or both IFNAR and IFNGR in previous models of ZIKV infection -.

Thus due to the magnitude of the current pandemic and the increase in fetal microcephaly associated with infection there is an urgent need to develop experimental models for ZIKV to understand infection tissue tro- pism pathogenesis and the immune response.Previous studies establishing mouse models of ZIKV infection have primarily been per- formed in immunocompromised mice for example via intracranial infection of suckling mice or in mice deficient in the interferon IFN-ab receptor IFNAR or both IFNAR and theIFN-g receptor IFNGR  -.

By tracking the total T cell response using the surrogate marker approach we have identified a novel CD8 T cell epitope in the ZIKV envelope protein that will have important implications for ZIKV immunology and the design and testing of ZIKV vaccine candidates.MethodsCellsVero cells African Green monkey kidney epithelial cells kindly provided by Steven Varga University of Iowa were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum FBS 1 L-glutamine and 1 non-essential amino acids at 37C and 5 CO2.VirusesLow passage p.4 infectious ZIKV PLCalZV Genbank accession KF99378 derived from a ZIKV-infected traveller returning to Canada was kindly provided by the National Microbiol- ogy Laboratory Winnipeg Canada .

Thus ZIKV infection induces a rapid type I IFN response that likely plays a role in limiting viral replication in this model.CD4 T Cells Polarize to a Th1 Phenotype in Response to ZIKV InfectionTo further characterize the nature of the T cell response induced following ZIKV infection we infected mice i.v.

Although there were no significant differences in the propor- tions of antigen-experienced CD4 T cells in response to the various doses of ZIKV we observed a significant reduction in the number of CD11aCD49d CD4 T cells in the mice infected with 105 PFU of ZIKV compared to those infected with 106 PFU .Thus the magnitude of the CD4 T cell response to ZIKV is dependent on the dose of inocula- tion.

This indicates that infection with live virus is required to detect viral RNA in the spleen at the tested time points .Thus our data demonstrates that ZIKV can infect WT immunocompetent mice resulting in the accumulation of viral RNA in the spleen that peaks at 12-24 h post-infection.ZIKV Infection Induces Dendritic Cell and Natural Killer Cell ActivationAs our data demonstrated that ZIKV was able to infect WT mice we next sought to analyze the innate immune response to infection by measuring dendritic cell DC and natural killer NK cell activation.

However analysis of the immune response to ZIKV infection has not been performed to date using these models   .Efforts to evaluate the immune response to ZIKV infection have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of specific ZIKV epitopes which precludes the analysis of antigen-specific T cells using tetramers or peptide restimulation.
