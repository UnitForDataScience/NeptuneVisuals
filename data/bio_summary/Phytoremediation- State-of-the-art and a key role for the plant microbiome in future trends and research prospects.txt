rational plant selection and microbiome engineering to turn the plant from a potential low productivity state to a high-productivity diverse and resilient state with high phytoremediation activity.box 1. plant and microbial contributions during phytoremediationplants contribute to contaminant removal through various ways including pollutant uptake accumulation degradation and detoxification sequestration stabilisation volatilisation and exerting effects on bioavailability of contaminants soil properties and microbial activity sandermann 1994. different biotic and abiotic factors determine the uptake of pollutants as has been described in a review by pilon-smits et al.

examining function and themobilome should be an important component of phytoremediation research.although we focused in this review on the bacterial aspect of pollutant degradation in phytoremediation we opt for a future integration of fungal-bacterial interactions specifically mycorrhiza.in the future the plant microbiome will have a greater importance in plant breeding and engineering strategies in phytoremediation.

thereby it is important to take into account that plant species cultivar selection is an important tool to change microbial communities which can significantly impact phytoremediation outcome and therefore advances in the knowledge of specific plant-microbe interactions are essential.the demand for reduced levels of toxic compounds in the environment and crops the rules for land owners high costs of physical and chemical soil treatments and sustainable land use all favour phytoremediation.
