Ten weeks of coconut water vinegar treatment led to approximate reductions of 17.9 and 8.7 in body weight for CL 0.08 mlkg BW and CH 2 mlkg BW respectively compared to the untreated mice .Serum lipid profile assayIn association with the reduction in body weight the HFD-induced obese mice treated with coconut water vinegar showed a reduction in the levels of serum choles- terol triglycerides and LDL.
