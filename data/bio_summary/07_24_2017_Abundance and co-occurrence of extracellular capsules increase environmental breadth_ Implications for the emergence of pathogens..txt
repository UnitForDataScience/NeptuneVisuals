We aimed at answering the following questions How many capsules are there in prokaryotic genomes Do multiple capsule groups co-occur and if so are there any correlations between capsule groups Which Prokaryotes encode capsules Which are the genetic and life-history traits associated to capsule prevalence What is the environ- mental distribution of Prokaryotes encoding capsules Our results uncovered novel intriguing patterns in the distribution of capsules which have important biological implications and pro- vide new insights into the evolutionary and ecological role of capsules.ResultsCapsuleFinder A tool to mine genomes for extracellular capsulesWe defined independent and customizable models describing the genetic composition and organization of eight groups and subgroups of capsules  based on the literature of the best-described experimental capsule systems -    .

Some capsules are proteic instead of polysaccharidic notably the poly-g-d-glutamate or PGA capsules produced by Bacillus anthracis .To date very few studies have characterized the frequency and diversity of capsules across bacterial phyla presumably because they are difficult to identify.

To understand the role of multiple capsules we queried more than 6700 metagenomes for the presence of species encoding capsules and showed that their distribution varied between environmental categories and within the human micro- biome between body locations.

Species encoding capsules and especially those encoding multiple capsules had larger environmental breadths than the other species.

Group II and III capsules will be jointly referred to as ABC-dependent capsules.

ABC-dependent and synthase-dependent capsules were less frequent nearly 10 each and subgroup CPS3 capsules were the most fre- quent among the latter.

Group IV capsules 8.8 and PGA proteic capsules were rarer 3.1 and .We investigated the presence of capsule systems in all major taxonomic divisions of Bacte- ria and Archaea .

Nevertheless our results show that some groups of capsules have loci of almost invariable sizes all Group IV capsules whereas others showed very significant variation in the number of components especially Group I and ABC see lower slopes in .
