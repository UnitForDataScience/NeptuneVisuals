The baseline pre-dialysis values for IS and PCS were highly vari- able among the 10 subjects in this study Figure 2A comparable to our prior observations in ESRD patients 9 and a larger group of patients with CKD reported by Suchy-Dicey et al.

The gut microbiome was assessed in stool speci- mens sequenced for the 16S rRNA gene targeting the V4 region.

The pre-dialysis mean plasma concentrations of both  IS and PCS were markedly elevated.

The major metabolizers are aerobes mainly Enterobacteria but anaerobes e.g.

The fact that these protein-bound  uremic solutes believed to be toxic are poorly removed by  hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has led to efforts to alter the gut microbiome to reduce IS and PCS production.We here examine the effects of orally administered vanco-  mycin on the plasma concentration of IS and PCS in relation to  changes in fecal microbiome composition in a small group of patients with ESRD undergoing chronic hemodialysis.

The gly- copeptide antibiotic vancomycin is commonly used to treat  Gram-positive infections 18.
