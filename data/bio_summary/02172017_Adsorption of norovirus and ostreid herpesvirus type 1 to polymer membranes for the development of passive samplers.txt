For both NoV GII and OsHV-1 no significant difference was observed between the amount of genome copies on rinsed mem- branes compared to nonrinsed membranes suggesting that virus adsorption was stable.Kinetics of viral adsorption to membranes and adsorption ratesMembranes were exposed for 1 4 24 h and 15 days to sewage contaminated with NoV GII or for 1 4 and 24 h to seawater contaminated with OsHV-1.

For OsHV-1 the adsorption rate did not increase in diluted samples therefore it is suggested that organic material may not readily influence the adsorption of these viruses onto membranes.In conclusion the data presented in this paper clearly show the promise of a variety of membranes as passive samplers for NoV and OsHV-1.

The detection of NoV and OsHV-1 respectively with zetapor and PVDF membranes was found to be more efficient than the direct analysis of sewage and seawater.Conclusions All membranes immersed in contaminated samples adsorbed NoV GII and OsHV-1.

The amount of NoV GII and OsHV-1 on membranes was significantly higher after 24 h of exposure compared with 1 h ofTable 1 Stability of NoV GII and OsHV-1 on the various types of membranesNoV GII log RNA copies per cm2OsHV-1 log genome copies per cm2Without rinsingWith rinsingWithout rinsingWith rinsingPVDF--45 - 01402 - 013 NoV norovirus OsHV-1 ostreid herpesvirus type 1 LDPE low-density polyethylene PVDF polyvinylidene difluoride.exposure P  005 for all types of membrane except gauze and LDPE for NoV GII Table 2.

For the same exposure time no significant difference was observed between the amounts of virus adsorbed on the four types of membranes.Serial dilutions of contaminated samples and adsorption rateThe lowest amount of virus that could be detected by the membranes was determined by exposure to serial dilu- tions of contaminated samples.For membranes exposed for 1 h to diluted stool sus- pensions NoV GII genome copies decreased significantly on the gauze nylon and zetapor membranes between the 10-2 and 10-5 dilutions P  0 5 and also declined sig- nificantly between the 10-1 and 10-5 dilutions for LDPE P  05 Table 3.

2009.The adsorption of both viruses on membranes may be influenced by several parameters however the factors influencing OsHV-1 adsorption on inert surfaces are currently unknown.

For OsHV-1 the increase adsorption observed up to 24 h with zetapor and nylon suggests that they are more appropriate for the OsHV-1 detection.Surprisingly the adsorption rates of NoV GII on mem- branes were increased in all diluted samples and all sample types evaluated stool sewage seawater.

The virus quantifi- cation was carried out by comparison with a standard curve constructed using five OsHV-1 DNA dilutions ranging from 30 to 106 viral genome copies per ll.Calculation of the adsorption rateThe adsorption rate was calculated to compare the adsorption capacity of each membrane.

However other types of membranes may be more efficient in cap- turing viruses than gauze.In order to select a membrane that can be used as a passive sampler we determined whether two viruses NoV and OsHV-1 nonenveloped and enveloped viruses respectively could be passively adsorbed onto various commercially available membranes with different compo- sitions and different physical characteristics.

Con- trol membranes consisted of membranes exposed either to tap water or to seawater negative for NoV and OsHV-1.
