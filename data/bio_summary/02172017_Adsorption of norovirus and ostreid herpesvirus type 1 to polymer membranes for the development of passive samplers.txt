the amount of nov gii per membrane is significantly higher than in sewage for dilution -1 and -2 p  001.for seawater analysis nov gii was detected only in the undiluted and 10-1 dilutions both with membranes and by direct analysis of the water table 4. similar amounts of genome copies were detected on membranes exposed to undiluted and 10-fold dilutions which demonstrates that adsorption is enhanced in samples that are diluted 10-fold adsorption was 39 times higher for sewage samples and nine times higher for seawater table 4. additionally for 10-fold diluted sample the amount of genome copies per membranes is significantly higher than in seawater p  05.for oshv-1 only the ldpe and pvdf membranes were exposed to serial dilutions of seawater samples table 5. the amount of oshv-1 dna measured in ldpe and pvdf extracts decreased significantly with dilution p  05 to p  0001. the amount detected in the pvdf membrane extracts was significantly higher than in the corresponding 200-ll seawater sample p  0001. moreover the amount of oshv-1 dna measured in the pvdf extracts was significantly higher than that of ldpe extracts p  001.discussionthis study is the first to assess the detection of nov gii and oshv-1 using various types of membranes immersed in contaminated water samples.

for oshv-1 the amount of genome copies on the zetapor membrane increased immediately after 4 h of exposure when com- pared with 1 h of exposure p  0001. the amount of nov gii and oshv-1 on membranes was significantly higher after 24 h of exposure compared with 1 h oftable 1 stability of nov gii and oshv-1 on the various types of membranesnov gii log rna copies per cm2oshv-1 log genome copies per cm2without rinsingwith rinsingwithout rinsingwith rinsingpvdf--45 - 01402 - 013 nov norovirus oshv-1 ostreid herpesvirus type 1 ldpe low-density polyethylene pvdf polyvinylidene difluoride.exposure p  005 for all types of membrane except gauze and ldpe for nov gii table 2. after 2 weeks of exposure the amount of rnac of nov gii was higher on zetapor nylon and ldpe membranes compared with 1 h. for nov gii zetapor membrane had the highest rate of adsorption of up to 24 h of exposure while ldpe always had the lowest rate regardless of the time of expo- sure.

for oshv-1 gauze and pvdf displayed the highest adsorption rates with 023 and 017 respectively table 2. for the same exposure time no significant difference was observed between the amounts of virus adsorbed on the four types of membranes.serial dilutions of contaminated samples and adsorption ratethe lowest amount of virus that could be detected by the membranes was determined by exposure to serial dilu- tions of contaminated samples.for membranes exposed for 1 h to diluted stool sus- pensions nov gii genome copies decreased significantly on the gauze nylon and zetapor membranes between the 10-2 and 10-5 dilutions p  0 5 and also declined sig- nificantly between the 10-1 and 10-5 dilutions for ldpe p  05 table 3. adsorption rates were higher for diluted samples with the highest values of 44 109 15 and 18 recorded for gauze ldpe nylon and zetapor respectively.

for both nov gii and oshv-1 no significant difference was observed between the amount of genome copies on rinsed mem- branes compared to nonrinsed membranes suggesting that virus adsorption was stable.kinetics of viral adsorption to membranes and adsorption ratesmembranes were exposed for 1 4 24 h and 15 days to sewage contaminated with nov gii or for 1 4 and 24 h to seawater contaminated with oshv-1.

2008. for oshv-1 the adsorption rate did not increase in diluted samples therefore it is suggested that organic material may not readily influence the adsorption of these viruses onto membranes.in conclusion the data presented in this paper clearly show the promise of a variety of membranes as passive samplers for nov and oshv-1.

for gauze pads the adsorption rate of nov did not increase after one hour of immersion as previ- ously observed fattal and katzenelson 1976. for oshv-1 the increase adsorption observed up to 24 h with zetapor and nylon suggests that they are more appropriate for the oshv-1 detection.surprisingly the adsorption rates of nov gii on mem- branes were increased in all diluted samples and all sample types evaluated stool sewage seawater.

the detection of nov and oshv-1 respectively with zetapor and pvdf membranes was found to be more efficient than the direct analysis of sewage and seawater.conclusions all membranes immersed in contaminated samples adsorbed nov gii and oshv-1.

all sta- tistical analyses were performed with the prism 7 software graphpad la jolla ca usa.resultsstability of virus adsorption onto membranesthe stability of the virus adsorption onto zetapor nylon ldpe pvdf and gauze was tested table 1. to evaluate stability membranes were exposed for 1 h to either sew- age nov gii contamination or seawater oshv-1 con- tamination and were then immersed in milliq water millipore molsheim france for 30 min.

2009.the adsorption of both viruses on membranes may be influenced by several parameters however the factors influencing oshv-1 adsorption on inert surfaces are currently unknown.

the virus quantifi- cation was carried out by comparison with a standard curve constructed using five oshv-1 dna dilutions ranging from 30 to 106 viral genome copies per ll.calculation of the adsorption ratethe adsorption rate was calculated to compare the adsorption capacity of each membrane.

zetapor and pvdf membranes seem to be more adapted to nov gii and oshv-1 detection respectively.significance and impact of the study membranes tested will be used as passive samplers to improve the detection of virus in oyster production areas.

2012. however other types of membranes may be more efficient in cap- turing viruses than gauze.in order to select a membrane that can be used as a passive sampler we determined whether two viruses nov and oshv-1 nonenveloped and enveloped viruses respectively could be passively adsorbed onto various commercially available membranes with different compo- sitions and different physical characteristics.

con- trol membranes consisted of membranes exposed either to tap water or to seawater negative for nov and oshv-1.
