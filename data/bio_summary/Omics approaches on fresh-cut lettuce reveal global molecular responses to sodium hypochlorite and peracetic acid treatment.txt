cophenetic correlation  0.76. three replicates of paa and sh samples are reported for each time point.45 primary metabolism 15 glycolysis 9 cellular organi- zation 9 and stress responses 4 are the most representative groups.the t1 proteomic data set revealed a large number of protein spots 53 decreasing in accumulation in paa conversely at t3 and t6 we observed an increased number of spots over-accumulated in paa corresponding to 30 of the total identified proteins.a large number of identified protein spots belonged to the pho- tosynthesis pathway among them rubisco large subunit trans- ketolase and triosephosphate isomerase passed from a lower accu- mulation at t1 to a higher accumulation at t3 or t6.

mn-superoxide dismutase ii table 2. the protein pattern of mn-superoxide dismutase ii is more peculiar in fact it is accu- mulated at t1 when presumably washing-related oxidative stress takes place in lettuce leaves.noteworthy paa washing affected the accumulation lev- els of a protein related to cell wall degradation xyloglucan endotransglucosylase which displayed an increasing trend from strong down-regulation at t1 to strong accumulation at t3 table 2.microbiota changes in response to different sanitizer treatments during washingquantification of bacterial 16s rrna genes in dna extracted from fresh-cut lettuce was performed by real-time pcr assay.

abc transporters tonoplast monosaccharide transporter tmt2 table 1.proteomic content of fresh-cut lettuce following different sanitizer treatmentsproteomics-based approaches represent one of the most efficient strategies to isolate proteins showing quantitative and qualitative variations.22 the global proteomic changes in fresh-cut lettuce leaves induced by the two different sanitizing treatments sh and paa were studied using 2d-dige technology at t1 t3 and t6 time points fig.

2d-dige gel maps revealed about 3600 protein spots in each sample distributed in the ph range 4 -7.univariate statistical analysis based on the student's t test and one-way anova p 0.05 elaborated using decyder software revealed a total of 65 differentially accumulated protein spots showing a paa vs sh fold change of -1.4 at one time point at least.

the decyder biological variation analysis module bva v 6.5 ge healthcare for multi-gel anal- ysis was used to select differential protein spots according to a statistically significant student's t test and one-way analysis of variance anova p 0.05 a fold change threshold of 1.4 and a protein presence in 80 of the mapped spots.

accordingly stress-related transcripts namely thioredoxin ccs and hairpin binding protein transcripts23 -25 were particularly abundant at t1 and decreased at t3 indicating a strong activation of oxidative responses in the early phases triggered by the paa washing and followed by adap- tation to stress.

sybr green real-time pcr of total bacterial load in lettuce obtained by paa and sh samples at first t1 third t3 and last t6 days of storage.

1. results of total bacterial quantification in fresh-cut lettuce following different sanitizer treatments as performed by real-time pcr assay showed that paa washing resulted in a significant reduction in the total bacterial load at t3 and t6 in comparison with sh treatment fig.

fresh-cut lettuce response to washing procedures is a very complex phe- nomenon involving a number of different metabolic pathways.data analysis highlighted the activation of oxidative stress-related genes and proteins at the early stages of stor- age suggesting the occurrence of stronger oxidative stress responses and a more effective disinfectant action of paa with respect to sh treatment.

such biochemical changes usually occur in conjunction with the hydrolysis of macromolecules for example proteins are hydrolyzed into free amino acids by the actions of several endo- and exopeptidases.30 in this context we observed the up-regulation at t3 of several transcripts involved in protein modification and in protein degra- dation strictly associated with cellular catabolism.

samples were separated on hplc-chip 40 nl trap 75 mm x 43 mm 5 mm c-18sb zx agilent technologies as reported previously.17 an in-house version of mascot soft- ware version 2.5 matrix science london uk was used to identify protein spots against the databases ncbinr taxonomy viridiplantae and plant est september 2014. protein spots identified with at least two distinct peptides and a significant score p 0.05 were validated by comparison among their calculated and experimental mass and pi values.

in this category we also found two transcripts altered at all time points that encodea thioesterase and a lipase family protein which were up- and down-regulated respectively table 1.it is of particular interest that a number of transcripts playing a role in cell wall metabolism were considerably altered and showed an opposite trend between t1 and t3.
