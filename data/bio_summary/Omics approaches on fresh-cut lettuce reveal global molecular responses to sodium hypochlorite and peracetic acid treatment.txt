We followed the widely accepted minimum information about a microarray experiment MIAME guidelines for microarray analysis and verification13 microarray experiments have been deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus NCBI repository Accession Number GSE-89453.Principal component analysis PCA on conditions washing pro- cess and storage time was performed by calculating the stan- dard correlation between each condition vector and each principal component vector using GeneSpring GX Version 7.3 Agilent Tech- nologies.Further statistical testing involving the Student's t test P 0.05 was also performed to identify the differentially expressed genesper time point then the fold change was calculated as the ratio between the signal averages of three replicate PAA-treated sam- ples and three SH-treated samples.These transcripts selected were classified using MapMan software.14Protein extraction and DIGE analysisSoluble proteins were extracted by the trichloroacetic acid TCAacetone extraction method as described previously.15 Three independent extractions were performed for each of the PAA and SH samples at T1 T3 and T6.

Three replicates of PAA and SH samples are reported for each time point.45 primary metabolism 15 glycolysis 9 cellular organi- zation 9 and stress responses 4 are the most representative groups.The T1 proteomic data set revealed a large number of protein spots 53 decreasing in accumulation in PAA conversely at T3 and T6 we observed an increased number of spots over-accumulated in PAA corresponding to 30 of the total identified proteins.A large number of identified protein spots belonged to the pho- tosynthesis pathway among them RuBisCO large subunit trans- ketolase and triosephosphate isomerase passed from a lower accu- mulation at T1 to a higher accumulation at T3 or T6.

The protein pattern of Mn-superoxide dismutase II is more peculiar in fact it is accu- mulated at T1 when presumably washing-related oxidative stress takes place in lettuce leaves.Noteworthy PAA washing affected the accumulation lev- els of a protein related to cell wall degradation xyloglucan endotransglucosylase which displayed an increasing trend from strong down-regulation at T1 to strong accumulation at T3 Table 2.Microbiota changes in response to different sanitizer treatments during washingQuantification of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in DNA extracted from fresh-cut lettuce was performed by real-time PCR assay.

Samples were stored at -80 C until microarrayproteomic and microbiological analyses were performed.RNA extractionFor microarray analysis samples were subjected to RNA extraction using the protocol of Lopez-Gomez and Gomez-Lim.11For each sample under investigation SH and PAA sanitizer treat- ments three independent RNA extractions were carried out per time point T1 T3 and T6 for a total of 18 RNA samples.RNA quality was checked by RNA NanoChip on Bioanalyzer 2100 Agilent Technologies Santa Clara CA USA Fig.

2D-DIGE gel maps revealed about 3600 protein spots in each sample distributed in the pH range 4 -7.Univariate statistical analysis based on the Student's t test and one-way ANOVA P 0.05 elaborated using DeCyder software revealed a total of 65 differentially accumulated protein spots showing a PAA vs SH fold change of -1.4 at one time point at least.

Accordingly stress-related transcripts namely thioredoxin CCS and hairpin binding protein transcripts23 -25 were particularly abundant at T1 and decreased at T3 indicating a strong activation of oxidative responses in the early phases triggered by the PAA washing and followed by adap- tation to stress.

ABC transporters tonoplast monosaccharide transporter TMT2 Table 1.Proteomic content of fresh-cut lettuce following different sanitizer treatmentsProteomics-based approaches represent one of the most efficient strategies to isolate proteins showing quantitative and qualitative variations.22 The global proteomic changes in fresh-cut lettuce leaves induced by the two different sanitizing treatments SH and PAA were studied using 2D-DIGE technology at T1 T3 and T6 time points Fig.

In this category we also found two transcripts altered at all time points that encodea thioesterase and a lipase family protein which were up- and down-regulated respectively Table 1.It is of particular interest that a number of transcripts playing a role in cell wall metabolism were considerably altered and showed an opposite trend between T1 and T3.
