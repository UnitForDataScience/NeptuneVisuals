key to this link is the ability of ilc2 to orchestrate antihelminth immunity via tuning their respon- siveness to their nutritional setting.9  tuft cells and ilc2 a further link between environmental sensing and ilc2 re- sponses was recently put forward by three independent studiesdemonstrating the role of taste-chemosensory tuft cells74 in driv- ing the il-25-dependent expansion of ilc2s in the intestine.75-77 von moltke et al.

these processes occurred independently of commensal bacterial flora suggesting a different mechanism of environmental sens- ing to that utilized by ilc3 to respond to changes in intestinal flora.retinoic acid has a cell-intrinsic suppressive role on ilc2 matura- tion.7 addition of retinoic acid impairs ilc2 development from ilc2 common progenitors in culture and inhibition of retinoic acid signalling increases ilc2 development and cytokine production.

intriguingly blockade of fatty acid oxidation in vitamin- a-deficient mice reverses the usual enhancement of ilc2 il-13 produc- tion afforded by reduced retinoic acid signalling but ilc2 il-5 and il-9 production is unaffected.45 this finding lends further credence to the idea that ilc2 has evolved to selectively maintain il-13 levels during times of dietary stress due to its unique barrier-protective properties.8  the role of brown adipose tissue in ilc2 function brown adipose tissue bat utilizes energy stores and is respon- sible for the physiological response to cold70 driving the use of fat stores in times of poor resources.

thereafter a series of papers published in 2010 described il-13-producing innate lymphoid cells in the mouse.61718 the papers characterized the cells in different biological systems and the three identified populations were initially given different names although all have since been grouped in the ilc2 family.3 ilc2 produces type 2 cytokines in response to local cues including the alarmin cytokines il-25 and il-33.6 the role of ilc2 in defence against helminth in- fection is multifaceted and mediated through production of type 2 cytokines and also by direct interactions with t cells.

via production of il-5 and il-13 ilc2 contributes to key antihelminthic functions including eosinophilia24 and goblet cell hyperplasia.617 the parasite clearance defect in n. brasiliensis-infected mice lacking il-25 and il- 33 receptors can be reversed by adoptive transfer of il-13-producing ilc2.6 importantly il-25 administration alone does not induce worm expulsion in t- and b-cell-deficient rag2--gc-- mice in the absence of ilc2s18 identifying ilc2 as the key il-25-responsive cell in n. brasil- iensis infection.ilc2 plays a further role in helminth infection via interaction with th2 cells.25 mhcii-expressing ilc2s interact with antigen-specific t cells that in turn produce il-2 to encourage ilc2 proliferation and type 2 cytokine production.

indeed the ability of il-13 and il-22--key ilc2 and ilc3 cytokines respectively--to drive goblet cell hyperproliferation and mucus pro- duction during helminth infection4142 is likely to influence bacterial colonization of the intestine.43 furthermore zaiss and colleagues have demonstrated that the ability of helminth infection to modulate allergic asthma is dependent upon changes in the intestinal microbi- ome and particularly an increase in clostridiales species that produce short-chain fatty acids.44 given the importance of fatty acid metabo- lism to ilc2 function45 discussed in section 7 below this may point to an intriguing interplay between helminths ilc2s and the microbiome with ilc2 finely tuning their function to the linked changes in helminth infection status and composition of the microbiome.ilc3 possesses an analogous mechanism to sense and control the microbial environment via il-22 production linked to lipid antigen engagement of surface-expressed cd1d.46 antibody-mediated cross- linking of cd1d on ilc3 is sufficient to induce an il-22 response but engagement of cd1d also acts synergistically with il-23 to further en- hance il-22 production.

this is evidenced by the existence of functionally discrete ilc3 subsets including those that present anti- gen and inhibit microbiota-directed t-cell immunity47 and those that promote antimicrobiota t-cell responses via il-22 production.486  ilc2 and nutrient sensing just as ilc2 and ilc3 acquire signals from the microbiota that help shape their function so ilc2 utilize nutritional sensing to adapt to changes at barrier surfaces.

a similar reliance on fatty acid oxidation for immune cell function during helminth expulsion has previously been demon- strated for alternatively activated macrophages.6768mobilization of fatty acids for use as an energy source is a phys- iological safety net in times of dietary restriction when glucose is scarce.69 it appears that ilcs particularly ilc2 also show an increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation in periods of nutritional shortage.45 the increased ilc2 functionality in vitamin-a-deficient or retinoic acid inhibitor-treated mice is mediated through increased fatty acid acquisition and reduced retinoic acid signalling induces transcrip- tional changes in ilc2 that reflect an increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation.
