Therefore fluctuations in infant gut fungal community composition could play a role in influencing infant's susceptibility to childhood allergies and asthma.The increase in both taxonomic and functional diversity of the infant bacterial gut microbiome in the few months after birthappears to be associated with multiple aspects of the immune system development providing further evidence that the immune system relies on a temporally structured succession of the gut microbiome.

Here we discuss the potential for Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides to be keystone taxa and their role on infant immune system training.BifidobacteriumBifidobacteria are dominant members of the infant gut micro- biome have a large repertoire of genes for the digestion of HMOs   and have been isolated from maternal feces human milk and infant feces   demonstrating how well adapted they are to the transmission routes and growth conditions in the infant gut.

Another microbial species that cause an age-dependent immune effect is the Helicobacter pylori which ameliorated airway hyperresponsiveness more effectively when administered before weaning in two relevant mouse models  although it remains unclear if and when this bacterium colonizes the infant gastrointestinal tract.While age-dependent modulation of the host's immune response can be attributed to specific microbial taxa most studies point to global changes in the microbial community diversity shifts and metabolites of poly-microbial origin as drivers of immune development.

Importantly fermentation of HMOs results in the production of SCFAs   increases secretory immunoglobulin A sIgA production and improves gut microbiome resistance to pathogens  .Breastfeeding also influences the training of the infant immune system through the presence of antimicrobial compounds in the human milk lactoferrin lysozyme and immune effectors sIgA immune cells and cytokines .

is key to improve our understanding of the importance of the infant microbiome for the development of the immune system.The successful identification of the mechanisms linking the infant gut microbiome and immune development depends on our capacity to disentangle the relative effects of multiple factors host genetics environmental factors key actors e.g.

Oral administration of acetate during pregnancy was sufficient for the priming of FoxP3 Treg cells and preventing allergic airway inflammation in the adult offspring  suggesting that in utero exposure to maternal gut microbial metabolites contributes to the development of immune functions in the airways of the offspring.In addition to interactions with the developing immune system a recent study by Kim et al.

Focusing research efforts on understanding the importance of temporally struc- tured patterns of diversity keystone groups and inter-kingdom microbial interactions for ecosystem functions has great potential to enable the development of biologically sound interventions aimed at maintaining andor improving immune system development and preventing disease.Keywords microbiome early-life events immune development microbial ecology diversity keystone taxaiNTRODUCTiONRecent advances in immune-mediated disease research have provided a considerable body of proof revealing the importance of the early gut microbiome for neonatal immune system development and disease pathogenesis see Ref.

Given the influence exerted by these immune functions on widespread tissues and systems it is not surprising that antibiotic-induced immune alterations during early life in animal models aggravate autoim- mune diabetes   allergic lung inflammation   inflammatory chronic colitis  and obesity  .Early-life immune development is also reliant on the actions of a group of bacterial metabolites known as short-chain fatty acids SCFAs.

Rightfully recognizing these structural characteristics has the potential to enable the identification of disturbance thresholds threatening the healthy development of the infant gut microbi- ome and its role in immune system training.AGe-DePeNDeNT iMMUNe SYSTeMDeveLOPMeNTMultiple studies and comprehensive reviews discuss how the maturation of the immune system relies on the exposure to MAMPs -.

The temporal structure of these environmental factors contributes to the identity and dynamics of the infant gut microbiome and plays a role in the immune system training.Prenatal LifeEven before birth fetal immune development relies on microbial products present in the placenta.
