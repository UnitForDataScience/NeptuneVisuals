2 observed a different microbiota between nondialysis CKD patients Flavobacteriaceae bacterium and Listeria monocytogenes and healthy individuals Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Butyrivibriocrossotus.There are several hypotheses that may explain the imbalance of gut microbiota in CKD patients such asExposure to various factors inherent to the disease like malnutrition edema constipation and stress which can reduce intestinal blood flow and transit in the colon thereby triggering atrophy of the intestinal barrier and increasing gut-barrier permeability 415.Increased urea influx from the bloodstream to the intestinal lumen can alter gut microbiota profile which leads to the production of protein-bound molecules through protein fermentation such as indoxyl sulfate IS p-cresyl sulfate PCS and indole-3-acetic acid IAA 3101447.

CKD can be divided into five stages based on the glomerular filtration rate with the first four corresponding to nondialysis CKD 1.Cardiovascular disease CVD is the major cause of death in CKD patients and in addition to the traditional and nontraditional risk factors and situations specific to kidney disease an imbalance of gut microbiota seems to be the new risk factor associated with many complications in these patients 2-4.Gut microbiota act as a 'metabolic organ' that interacts with the host for a mutually beneficial coexistence and has an important role in health and disease 5.

Since that study some nonpharmacological interventions such as the use of prebiotics probiotics or symbiotics a combination of pre and probiotics have emerged as attractive strategies to modify the negative effects provoked by gut microbiota imbalance in these patients 18-25.Prebiotics are currently defined as a selectively fermented ingredient that results in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus conferring benefits upon host health 26.

An exacerbation of ROS production increases the binding between LPS and TLR4 43 establishing a vicious cycle between inflammation and oxidative stress.Gut microbiota in chronic kidney diseaseSeveral authors have shown that CKD patients present alterations in their gut microbiota profiles and gut bar- rier 249-11.

This definition was further improved so that a prebiotic is actually a selectively fermented ingredient that results in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus conferring benefits upon host health 26.To be classified as a prebiotic a food ingredient must be resistant to gastric acidity hydrolysis by enzymes and absorption in the GI tract fermented by gut microbiota and able to selectively stimulate the growth andor activity of gut bacteria that are potentially associated with health and well-being 5859.

All of them occur naturally in many fruits cereals and vegetables and in human milk 2629 as shown in Table 1.The selective prebiotic fermentation by gut microbiota is capable of modulating the composition of colonic microbiota and stimulating bifidobacteria growth 28.

In fact SCFA production favors the maintenance and development of beneficial microbiota and healthy colonic epithelial cells conferring benefits upon the host's well-being and health in general 3066-67.In summary SCFA production through prebiotics fermentation in the distal gut may be a useful and effec- tive tool to modulate gut microbiota and minimize the deleterious effects caused by its imbalance and thereby promote improved host health and well-being.
