in each of the three agricultural sys- tems the bacterial community structure was dominated by proteobacteria mostly gammaproteobacteria relative abun- dance of 61.8  in conventional tillage 59.6  in direct seeding with continuous maize and 58.2  in direct seeding with crop rotation followed by the firmicutes 12.7  in conventional tillage 12.3  in direct seeding with continuous maize and 14.6  in direct seeding with crop rotation and acidobacteria 10.3  in conventional tillage 11.5  in direct seeding with continuous maize and 11.0  in direct seeding with crop rotation.

in each of the three treatments the relative abun- dance of the actinomycetales bacillus firmicutes and flavisolibacter bacteroidetes was significantly higher in the maize plants amended soil than in the unamended soil p  0.01. other bacterial groups that were significantly higher mean of the three treatments in the maize plants amended soil than in the unamended soil were arthrobacter chitinophaga cryocola kitasatospora nocardia ramlibacter and streptomyces p  0.0001. the effect was most obvious just after the application of the maize plants.
