C Base call error rates for read 1 R1 read 2 R2 and merged reads R1R2 following default read quality trimming condition 'Qtrim515' see Materials and Methods.

Note that symbol shape indicates sample type soil sludge1 and sludge2 and symbol colors distinguish unamended and spiked samples across panels C D and E. All data are for primer set 515F806R data for primer set 008F355R are provided in Supplementary Figures S13 and S14.As observed for sample E above several spike-ins ap- peared to be sensitive to varying read trimming settings Figure B which contributed to the reduced correlations between predicted and modeled read counts when more ag- gressive read trimming was applied Figure A.

We then generated three datasets with varying degrees of quality trimming namely 'noQtrim' no qual- ity trimming 'Qtrim515' read trimming by Trimmomatic with options SLIDINGWINDOW515 MINLEN75 and 'Qtrim520' read trimming by Trimmomatic with options SLIDINGWINDOW520 MINLEN75.

Graphics were prepared are provided in the Supplementary Methods.Data availabilityAll raw read data have been deposited in the NCBI sequence read archive SRA under accession number SRA434741 BioProject SRP076838.

The constant relationship between spike-in amount and read count was further evident from the slopes of the negative binomial GLM fits relating read count to spike-in amount 1.08 0.04 Supplementary Table S8.

Spike-in standards ac- counted for 16.5 2.9 of total reads in a given library Supplementary Table S9.As shown in Figure A for primer set 515F806R nor- malized read counts for the 100 spike-in mix were highly consistent with normalized read counts in the spiked en- vironmental DNA extracts.

As shown in Figure A for primer set 515F806R mild read processing 'noQtrim' and 'Qtrim515' yielded strong correlations between ob- served and predicted read counts with a narrow distribu- tion of Pearson's r values among libraries.

Data represent the percentage of reads removed as a result of read processing as compared to read counts in the 'noQtrim' dataset.
