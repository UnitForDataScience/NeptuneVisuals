Thus operating a post carbon removal nitrifying MBBR at conventional to the maximum loading rate does not clearly impact the biofilm characteristics or demonstrate a link to ammonia removal efficiency.The carriers in the B reactors second reactors in series started with the same seeded carriers on the first day of operation as the A train reactors first reactors in series.

The second reactors in series B reactors were fed with the effluent of the A train reactors.

This resulted in NOB AOB ratio in the A reactors ranged from 2.8 to 5.4.The B reactors which were in a starved condition corresponded to an average AOB relative abundance between 1.1 and 5.3 which is significantly lower than the A reactors p  0.001.

The biomass exhibited a higher live fraction of total cells in the high loaded reactors 73-100 as compared to the reactors operated in starvation condition 26-82.

The first two reactors in series A reactors were fed with treated wastewater from the last lagoonFig.

The A reactors first reactors in series had the highest ammonia loading rates throughout the study.Fig.

The biofilm thickness and mass in the A reactors first reactors in series in trains 1 and 2 ran- ged from 54 to 92 mm and 7.7 to 10.6 mgcarrier respectively .

Hence the B train reactors were operated in starvation conditions simulating wastewater treatment systems that intermittently nitrify prior to post carbon removal and secondary settling nitrifying add-on units.All four reactors had a reactor volume of 223 L and were filled with AnoxKaldnes K5 carriers.

In both runs the B reactors were fed 100 effluent from the A reactors.

As such it is likely there was a more efficient mass transfer of oxygen and nutri- ents into the biofilm and potentially a more active biomass.The B train reactors second reactors in series are representa- tive of a system that nitrifies intermittently.
