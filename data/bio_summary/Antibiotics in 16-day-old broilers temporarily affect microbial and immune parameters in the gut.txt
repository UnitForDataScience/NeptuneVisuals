To get insight into the dynamics of the intestinal microbiota and gut morphol- ogy and immunology after antibiotic administration 6 chickens from each group were sacrificed at the fol- lowing time points immediately after completion of the antibiotic administration d 6 midway d 16 and at the end of the experiment d 27.

At 27 d after start of the 5-day antibiotic administration no significant differences were observed in diversity of cecal microbiota in antibiotic-exposed chickens compared to the unexposed chickens.In the jejunal microbiota no significant differences indiversity due to antibiotic administration were observed data not shown.EFFECT OF ANTIBIOTICS ON AVIAN GUT DEVELOPMENT3073Figure 3.

Effect of an antibiotic administration during 5 d at 15 to 20 d post hatch on microbiota diversity in ceca from groups of 6 chickens at 6 16 and 27 d after start of the administration.

Chickens not exposed to antibiotics were taken as control.In addition to the overall diversity of the micro- biota multivariate analysis revealed changes in micro- bial composition in jejunal and cecal content in both antibiotic-exposed groups especially during the admin- istration of antibiotics d 6 after start of administra- tion but also after the antibiotic administration was stopped d 16 after start of administration whereas no significant changes between control and either of the ex- posed groups could be observed at 27 d after the start of the exposure to antibiotics Fig.
