the rates ob- served for degrees of positivity were significantly different be- tween his and control for whole low high  his versus control was 331 versus 2811 p b .001 right-side 210 ver- sus 142 p b .001 and left-side large intestine 121 versus 149 p b .001. in the case of whole muc5ac positivity a significant difference was observed between the his and con- trol groups 100 versus 86.1 p b .05 although degrees of positivity did not differ between his and control.in the c-adenoma category there were no differences in the positive rates for mucs 2 4 5ac or 6 between the his and control groups  and degrees of positivity between his and control were also similar for mucs 4 and 6. concern- ing degree of positivity for muc2 however the rate was sig- nificantly different between his and control in whole low high  his versus control was 5290 versus 324 p b .05 and left-side large intestine 2537 versus 015 p b .005. the results for degree of positivity for muc5ac showed the rate to be significantly different between his and control in whole low high  his versus control was 1236 versus 1410 p b .001 right-side 683 versus 83 p b .05 and left-side large intestine 553 versus 67 p b .001. in the case of muc1 positivity a significant differ- ence was observed between the his and control groups in whole 0.

for muc2 however specimens exhibiting a high  degree of positivity were observed only in the his group and the rates for degree of positivity were significantly different be- tween his and non-his for the whole large intestine low high  his versus control was 204 versus 280 p b .05. as regard muc5ac expression in the his group specimens exhibiting high  positivity were observed in 70.6 of left-side large intestine but in 0 of the right p b .005.in the hpsp category there were no differences in the pos- itive rates for mucs 1 2 4 or 6 between the his and control groups  and the degrees of positivity were also sim- ilar between his and control for mucs 1 2 and 6. in the case of muc4 however specimens exhibiting high  positivity were more frequent than those exhibiting low  in the his group although the reverse was true in control.

degrees of positivity between his and control were also similar for mucs 1 4 5ac and 6. in the case of degree of positivity for muc2 however speci- mens exhibiting high  positivity were more frequent than those classed as low  in the his group although the reverse was true in control and the rates for degrees of positivity were significantly different between his and control in whole low high  his versus control was 09 versus 18 p b .001 and left-side large intestine 09 versus 40 p b .005.in our analysis of the association between mucs expres- sions and immunohistochemical findings for anti-tp antibody mucs 2 4 5ac and 6 did not show any such association .

only muc1 positivity displayed a significant asso- ciation with an absence of so-called fringe formation presence versus absence  0 versus 7.6 p b .01 with an absence of spiral organisms within the mucus 2.9 versus 66.7 p b .01 and with an absence of strongly immunopositive materials within the epithelial layer 2.8 versus 12.8 p b .05 and within the subepithelial layer 3.1 versus 20.0 p b .01 of the intestinal mucosa.

transmembrane mucins cover the apical cell mem- brane of enterocytes and of this type mucin muc4 is expressed in the normal large intestine .human intestinal spirochetosis his one of the zoonoses is caused by colonization by brachyspira spp bacteria within the human large intestine .

among the mucins examined this time in general mucs 2 and 4 are expressed in normal large intestine but mucs 1 5ac and 6 are not.

how- ever the degree of expression of muc4 was increased in whole right-side and left-side large intestine in his versus control.

the results suggest that brachyspira infection or a related change in the microbiome may alter the large intestine mucin expression profile in humans.c 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.introductionmucus which lines and protects the intestine traps and transports debris and bacteria and it also reduces the disclosures none declared.

however the pre- cise pathogenicity of his remains unclear.recently increased mucs 2 and 5ac expressions and de- creased muc4 expression in the mucosa of the large intestine were reported in animal brachyspira infections .

for this analysis large intestines were divided into 2 regions right side from cecum to transverse colon left side from the splenic flexure to rectum.for immunohistochemistry we used the polymer- peroxidase method envisionhrp dako cytomation glostrup denmark on deparaffinized sections from the his and control cases using antibodies for the gel-forming mucins mucs 2 5ac and 6 and the transmembrane mucins mucs 1 and 4. all antibodies were incubated overnight at 4degc.

a further examination of the possible tumorige- netic role of brachyspira should be performed because the nat- ural history of brachyspira infections including the infection period in humans remains unclear.mucins of his133in the abovementioned animal study of the b hyodysenteriae- infected large intestine in which mucs 2 and 5ac expres- sions were increased  the binding capacity of the bacteria to mucus proved to be elevated.

in the large intestine mucus forms a double layer with the inner layer--which is firmly attached to the surface epithelium of the mucosal layer--being devoid of commensal bacteria .

however muc1 can be induced in the large intestine by infection and cancer whereas muc5ac can be induced by infection .mucins of his129figuremorphology and immunohistochemistry in each category.
