Novel polyamine biosynthetic proteins and transporters expected to exist in the tested dominant human gut bacteria.The presence of novel polyamine biosynthetic pro- teins and transporters was predicted from the changes in polyamine concentrations in the culture supernatants and cells and the presence or absence of homologs of known polyamine biosynthetic proteins and transporters.

Furthermore polyamine biosynthesis and transport should be analyzed in dominant human gut bacterial species other than those belonging to the Alistipes Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera  for a comprehensive understanding of polyamine homeostasis in the human intestinal lumen.In the present study we measured polyamine concentration in the cell and culture supernatants of 32 species of dominant human gut bacteria cultured in GAM at different growth phases.

In 4 13 species B. dorei D. formicigenerans R. torques and Blautia han- senii the Spd concentrations in the culture supernatant increased from the growing phase to the stationary phase B. Spd concentrations in the culture supernatants of 10 31 species B. uniformis B. in- testinalis P. merdae P. distasonis R. torques R. obeum Bl.

Therefore identification of new genes for polyamine biosynthesis and transport is indispensable for optimization of polyamine concentrations in human colonic lumen enabled by regulation of genes facilitating polyamine metabolism in gut bacteria.A human gut microbial gene catalog ranking the dominant mi- crobial speciesgenera in the human gut has been described  .

Based on these findings we suggested strategies for optimizing polyamine concentrations in the human colonic lumen via regulation of genes responsible for polyamine biosynthesis and transport in the dominant human gut bacteria.IntroductionPolyamines putrescine Put spermidine Spd spermine Spm are aliphatic amines possessing two or more amino groups.

The number shown before the species name indicates the order of gut bacterial occupancy in a human gut microbial gene catalog .out of the known Spd transport proteins .DiscussionThe presence of novel polyamine biosynthetictransport proteins in the dominant human gut bacteria was determined by integrating bio- synthetic and transport activity for each polyamine -4 and by BlastP analysis .First the presence of novel Put biosynthetic proteins was estimated.

In 3 9 species B. stercoris D. longicatena and R. torques Spm concentration in the culture supernatant increased from the growing phase to stationary phase B.Presence of known polyamine biosynthetic and transport proteins in tested dominant human gut bacteriaThe results of BlastP analysis that determined the presence or ab- sence of known polyamine biosynthetic or transport proteins in the dominant human gut bacteria are shown in .

hansenii increased from the growing to stationary phases B homologs of the known Spd exporter MdtJI were not found  suggesting that a novel Spd exporters is present in these 4 species.In this study we found that cells of 13 species B. vulgatus B. xy- lanisolvens B. intestinalis B. fragilis P. merdae D. longicatena D.formicigenerans R. torques R. obeum R. gnavus Eu.

Based on this criterion 5 16 B. ovatusfinegoldii B. xylanisolvens Dorea longicatena and Ruminococcus lac- taris of the 32 tested species of dominant gut bacteria contained Put in the growing andor stationary phase however the intracellular Put concentration in B. xylanisolvens was very low 0.56 - 0.39 nmolmg protein A.The change in Put concentration was calculated by comparing the Put concentration in the culture supernatant with that originally con- tained in GAM 73.5 - 3.7 mM shown as a gray band in B.

It is possible that these results are due to homeostatic regulation of intracellular poly- amine concentration which is consistent with how E. coli exports Put to the culture supernatant while intracellular Put concentrations remain unchanged .The above estimation of the presence of novel polyamine biosyn- thetic and transport proteins in the tested dominant human gut bacteria is summarized in .
