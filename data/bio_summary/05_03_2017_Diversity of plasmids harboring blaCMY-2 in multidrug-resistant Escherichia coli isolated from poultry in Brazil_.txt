Furthermore 99 143144 of the isolates were also resistant to the non-beta-lactam antibiotics NAL and CIP 97 140144 to LEV 75 108144 to TET 50 73144 to GEN 35 50144 to SXT and 24 34144 to CHL .Thus all 144 isolates were considered MDR not-susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories J.C. Ferreira et al.

The E. coli phylogenetic group D was the most prevalent containing 60 87144 of the isolates 30 43144 were assigned to the phylogenetic group A 6 8144 of the isolates belonged to phylogenetic group B2 and 4 6144 belonged to phylogenetic group B1 .

The same plasmid replicons were later described in isolates from retail poultry meat in the same country in 2013 suggesting the as- sociation between these isolates .

The DNA sequences and translated amino acid sequences obtained were compared with reference sequences from the LAHEY home page .Characterization of plasmid replicon typing and genomic localizationAfter PCR and DNA sequencing isolates carrying pAmpC genes were selected for investigation and characterization of resistance plasmids.

Co- resistance phenotypes are also involved in the maintenance of resistance genes and plasmids in E. coli  thus other antimicrobials frequently used such as fluoroquinolones may also play a role in the selection of MDR isolates in the animal environment .The distribution of phylogenetic groups has been suggested to be related with health status or geographical region of each host species analyzed .

Moreover these plasmids are highly efficient in acquisition and transmission of most resistance genes .The Inc. groups of plasmids identified in this study have been previ- ously associated with CMY-2-producing Enterobacteriaceae worldwide  but never described in isolates from Brazil.

We isolated 144200 72 of E. coli isolates with resistance to cefotaxime and the resistance gene identified was blaCMY-2.

In Brazil blaCMY-2 gene is rarely identified in human clinical isolates   and was never reported in live food-producing animals only in retail poultry meat .The survival of E. coli during antimicrobial therapy can occur by the complex interaction of different mechanisms that confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics at the same time.

Moreover the PCR and DNA sequencing showed that all these isolates carried the resistance gene blaCMY-2.

However in the present work among 144 E. coli isolates carrying blaCMY-2 75 different PFGE-types were found classified within 21 clusters .
