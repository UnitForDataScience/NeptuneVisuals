C Venn diagram depicting the absolute number of genes expressed between C. albicans at 6 h red and 24 h green after adjusting for P value and FDR P  0.01.24 h respectively in response to C. albicans Fig.

Our findings demonstrate that Can- didalysin is a key hypha-associated virulence determinant responsible for the im- munopathogenesis of C. albicans vaginitis.KEYWORDS Candida Candidalysin epithelial cells immunopathogenesis mucosal immunity mucosal pathogens mycology vaginitis vulvovaginalulvovaginal candidiasis VVC caused primarily by the polymorphic fungal patho- gen Candida albicans remains a serious worldwide health concern leading to significant quality of life issues for immunocompetent women 1.

The in vitro and in vivo data presented in this study identify Candidalysin as the crucial virulence factor that drives both C. albicans-induced neutrophil recruitment and vaginal immunopathogenesis.The vaginal epithelial response to C. albicans infection provides new insight into immunopathological signaling.

Surprisingly relatively few genes were strongly 4-fold downregulated in response to fungal challenge at either time point.Gene Ontology pathway and network mapping revealed profiles from C. albicans- infected cells to be consistent with MAPK NF-KB phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PI3KFIG 2 Host signaling pathways predicted to be activated during C. albicans infection of RVE.

The dual-specificity phosphatase 1 DUSP1 gene encoding a regulator of MAPK signaling was also elevated 6.7-fold in response to C. albicans.A number of genes involved in tissue repair wound healing or dampening of active inflammation were also upregulated during C. albicans infection including the genes coding for IL-24 2.3-fold and the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1RN 4-fold 16 17.

Candidalysin a newly discovered peptide toxin secreted by C. albicans hyphae during invasion drives epithelial damage immune activation and phagocyte attraction.

This study demonstrates that a single fungal factor Candidalysin is responsible for inducing vaginal cellular damage and proinflammatory responses during C. albicans infection in vitro and in vivo.

The genes chosen for qPCR were those previously identified as being induced by Candidalysin or C. albicans during in vitro or in vivo challenge Il-6 A Cxcl1 B Cxcl2 C Il-1a D Il-1b E Gm-csf F G-csf G Camp H Defb3 I S100A8 J and Saa3 K. All the genes were internally compared to the Actb housekeeping gene and to mock-infected controls using the DDCT method.

IL-6 were induced by treatment with Candidalysin alone but not during infection with C. albicans.

Mice intravagi- nally challenged with C. albicans strains deficient in Candidalysin exhibited no differences in colonization compared to isogenic controls.
