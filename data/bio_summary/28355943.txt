For instance altered ceramide struc- ture or elevated skin pH have been linked to dominant Staphy- lococcus aureus colonization in the recurrent eczematic lesions of those affected by AE11 S aureus can make up more than 90 of an individual lesion's bacterial composition.1213 Epi- dermal serine proteases such as the membrane-anchored channel-activating serine protease 1 which is also known as Prss8 have been found to be essential for proper formation of the SC in mice knockout of this gene led to improper skin development dehydration and postnatal fatality.14 Defects in any 1 or more of the genes that contribute to the formation of this resilient skin barrier have been pinpointed as prime con- tributors to ADAE of varying severity degrees.

In addition to contrasting findings in terms of the specific bacterial species found some studies have identified no consistent significant differences in the numbers of individual gut bacteria found in ADAE versus control individuals even when utilizing cutting-edge molecu- lar identification techniques.3031 It is worth noting that the overall study of gut microbiota and its link to allergic disease may be more informative if sex differences in study partici- pants are routinely considered as diet has been shown to have sex-specific effects on the gut microbiome.32 In addition to sex consideration the impact of genetically modified foods by mothers who breast-feed developmental effect or in chil- drenadults with ADAE who eat whole foods direct effect on gut microbiota diversity could also yield interesting data.33 The outside-inside mechanistic model of ADAE implicates the epidermal barrier defect as the main promoter of disease in contrast with changes in the gut microbiota.34 The skin barrier disruptions in ADAE have a genetic basis and it is reasonable to propose that these individuals would be more vulnerable to immunogen exposures via the skin particularly by skin microbes.

Multiple studies analyzing the skin microbiome including those that utilized molecular microbial identification indicate that colonizing S. aureus is the dominant microbe found on the skin of individuals with ADAE correlating with disease severity it is not found as the dominant microbe on the skin of patients with genetically characterized primary immu-nodeficiencies who also display ADAE-like lesions.35-37 Association does not always indicate causation as S. aureusdominance may just be a consequence of the disrupted epider- mis.

Loricrin and involucrin are proteins involved in skin barrier integrity and formation whereas S100A11 is a calcium-binding protein whose expression levels are positively correlated with Flg gene expression enhancing keratinocyte S100A11 expression in the presence of increased calcium in turn enhances Flg gene expression in keratinocytes.5051 Furthermore continued research will deepen our genetic understanding about the plethora of different barrier components of the skin epidermis highlighting their importance to patients afflicted with AD AE on an individualized basis.Genetic Implications in ADAEADAE is a profoundly heterogenic disease and many gene alterations have been associated with not only the skin barrier dysfunction but also with the underlying immunological response.

Further- more this protein which in addition to its contribution to epithelial barrier function also displays antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.70 However overall skin structure and proper barrier function is not just about the indi- vidual epithelial cells but how adjacent epithelial cells interact with one another.Studies have shown that defects in tight junctions which connect adjacent cells have been found in biopsied skin sam- ples from patients with AE but not in healthy skin samples.

Specifically claudin-1 a protein encoded by the CLDN1 gene that facilitates epithelial tight junction strength appears to be involved in ADAE as it was found to be significantly reduced in ADAE clinical skin samples but not in healthy or other control skin samples.71 As a result of a defect in tight junction strength environmental antigens have greater access to initiate the pro-inflammatory response that the skin barrier disruption facilitates.

Emollients by helping to reform a barrier in the skin safely soften the skin and help it remain hydrated.117 Emollients also may include supplemental antioxidant and antibacterial components which may aid in treatment specifically by influencing the skin microbiome.118119 Emollient use should be tailored on an indi- vidualized basis but should incorporate as few additives as possible in order to avoid potential allergic reactions to com- ponents such as fragrance.120The overall inflammation aspect of ADAE is typically tar- geted first with topical corticosteroids.

Two models have been proposed to explain ADAE skin pathology the gut microbiome-focused inside-outside model and the outside-inside model concentrating on the disrupted skin barrierskin microbiome.

A 3-month study utilizing emollient treatment in patients with ADAE reduced the amount of Staphylococcus on the skin resulting in symptom reduction in 72 of the study participants molecular identification methods were used to assess the pres- ence of Staphylococcus providing further validation of these results.38 Antibiotic treatments also resulted in a reduction of skin-colonizing Staphylococcus in patients with ADAE corre- lating with a reduction in disease symptoms.39 Unfortunately due to the prevalence of multiple antibiotic strains of S. aureus the usefulness of antibiotics such as mupirocin and methicillin to curtail ADAE symptoms in certain individuals may be short lived.4041 Furthermore studies have shown that modifying the skin barrier from birth via the use of moisturizers can effectively prevent ADAE.

The exact mechanism by which this enhanced moisture exerts its preventative effect is not understood in detail however it is believed that an enhanced skin barrier which prevents allergen penetration into the epidermis is involved.4243 Multiple studies have shown that the strains of S. aureus associated with the clinical skin pathology of patients with ADAE are toxigenic strains including those expressing the T cell activating superantigens staphylococcal enterotoxin C staphylococcal enterotoxin A and toxic shock syndrometoxin-1.4445 These findings further support the abnormal T-cell functions that are known to play a critical role in ADAE such as enhanced IL-4 and IL-13 production which drive TH2 immune responses.4647The outside-inside hypothesis is very attractive due to a study showing the deactivation of the filaggrin gene Flg being linked to as many as 20 of ADAE cases in Northern European populations.
