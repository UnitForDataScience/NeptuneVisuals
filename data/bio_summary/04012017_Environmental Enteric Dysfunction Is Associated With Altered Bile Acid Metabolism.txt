Serum bile acids were measured using stable-isotope liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results--In the overall study population serum cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were lower while glycocholic acid taurodeoxycholic acid glycodeoxycholic acid glycolithocholic acid and glycoursodeoxycholic acid were significantly higher at older ages.

Age was negatively correlated with cholic acid CA and chenodeoxycholic acid CDCA both P  0.0001 and positively correlated with taurodeoxycholic acid TDCA glycodeoxycholic acid GDCA and glycolithocholic acid GLCA all P  0.0001 glycocholic acid GCA P  0.02 and glycoursodeoxycholic acid GUDCA P  0.03.

Independent of age serum taurochenodeoxycholic acid tauromuricholic acid and glycoursodeoxycholic acid were significantly different between 244 children with and 69 children without EED.

GUDCA tauromurocholic acid TMCA TDCA CDCA GLCA and ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA comprised a relatively small portion of total serum bile acids.Serum bile acid concentrations were compared between children with and without EED adjusting for age Table 3.

Deoxycholic acid DCA taurocholic acid TCA taurochenodeoxycholic acid TCDCA and CA were the next most abundant serum bile acids.

Mean SD serum taurine in children with and without EED was 186 57 and 156 50 umolL respectively P  0.0001.Serum bile acid ratios were examined in order to gain insight into bile acid conjugation Table 4.

There were no significant correlations of glycine with any glycine-conjugated bile acid nor of taurine with any taurine- conjugated bile acid.DiscussionThis study suggests that young children with EED have alterations in bile acid metabolism.

If the modest reduction in serum bile acids is reflective of the total bile acid pool higher hepatic bile acid synthesis may be required to compensate for this reduction.There is a paucity of data on serum bile acids as measured by LC-MSMS in children.

The lower serum bile acids in children with EED suggest that these children do not have liver disease at least to the extent that could affect the hepatic extraction of bile acids.The entire bile acid pool passes through the enterohepatic circulation 8-12 times per day and under normal circumstances 3-5 of bile acids are lost in the stool 6 17.
