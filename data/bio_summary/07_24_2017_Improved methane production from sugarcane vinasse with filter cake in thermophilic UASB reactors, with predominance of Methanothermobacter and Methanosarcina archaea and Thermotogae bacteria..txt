the highest concentrations of methane in the biogas occurred in r2 suggesting high hydrolytic and acidogenic activity in r1 with higher tva concentrations b. high volu- metric methane production was obtained in this work reaching levelsup to 4.0 l ch4 l-1 d-1 in r1 and 1.4 l ch4 l-1 d-1 in r2 .in recent studies on anaerobic treatment of sugarcane vinasse with uasb reactors operated under mesophilic conditions reported volumetric methane production of up to0.9 l ch4 l-1 d-1 with an olr of 6.0 g cod l-1 d-1 and obtained values up to 1.4 l ch4 l-1 d-1 with olr of5.9 g cod l-1 d-1.

evaluating methane production by vinasse treatment using a modified uasb reactor observed an optimum olr of 17 g cod l-1 d-1 achieving a specific methane production of0.263 l ch4 g-1 cod added and the system collapsed at an olr of22 g cod l-1 d-1.

the results of the methane production were reported at standard temperature and pressure stp 101.325 kpa 273.15 k.at day 336 of the experiment when the olr in r1 and methane production were higher quantification of the acetic propionic iso- butyric butyric isovaleric and valeric acids of the influent and effluent from uasb reactors was performed by gas chromatography according to the methodology described by .sample information and genomic dna from microorganismsthe genomic dna samples sequenced in the ion torrent were from the sludge collected at the collection points of the reactors p1 to p4 in  located in the uasb reactors r1 and r2 at 340 days of opera- tion in phase v when olr in r1 and methane production were higher.

the ts and vs of the sludge from the collection points in r1 were 113.0 and 73.3 g l-1 p1 29.2 and 17.2 g l-1 p2 30.5 and18.9 g l-1 p3 and 34.8 and 19.9 g l-1 p4 respectively.

the vinasse is constitutes 94-97 water macro- nutrients mainly k ca n mg and s melanoidins and residualamounts of sugar alcohol and volatile components such as chloroform pentachlorophenol phenol and methylene chloride and the amount of these substances depends on the feedstock and the process of ethanol production  .nutrient availability different configurations of anaerobic reactors operational strategies to obtain stability in methane production and quality of biodigested vinasse are other issues that must be solved be- fore widespread production of biogas from vinasse.

in this study the higher volumetric methane pro- duction was probably obtained by means of the thermophilic condi- tions.the temperature may influence biochemical reactions through in- creased reaction rates which would allow the use of shorter hydraulic retention times hrt increasing the degradation of organic solids and the production of biogas  as observed in this study.after 375 days of system operation methane volumetric production markedly decreased d and tvata mean values increased .

we used uasb reactors in a two-stage configuration with olrs up to 45 g cod l-1 d-1 and obtained methane pro-duction as high as 3 l l-1 d-1.

a thermophilic anaerobic treat- ment for vinasse was employed as this effluent exits the distillation process at high temperatures which may influence biochemical reac- tions possibly allowing us to use shorter hydraulic retention times hrt reducing capital costs and increasing the degradation of organicsolids and the production of biogas .the purpose of this study was to evaluate the thermophilic anae- robic conversion of vinasse and the diversity and quantity of bacteria and archaea in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors in two stages with high olr to obtain high methane production.

the large abundance of the genus methanothermobacter has high correlation with the volumetric production of methane kn ptotal and fe in r1 and r2.however the hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanoculleus and the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanosarcina which presented high relative abundance in r1 are considered as ro- bust and effective methane producers occurring in high performance anaerobic digestion processes.
