High volu- metric methane production was obtained in this work reaching levelsup to 4.0 L CH4 L-1 d-1 in R1 and 1.4 L CH4 L-1 d-1 in R2 .In recent studies on anaerobic treatment of sugarcane vinasse with UASB reactors operated under mesophilic conditions reported volumetric methane production of up to0.9 L CH4 L-1 d-1 with an OLR of 6.0 g COD L-1 d-1 and obtained values up to 1.4 L CH4 L-1 d-1 with OLR of5.9 g COD L-1 d-1.

The results of the methane production were reported at standard temperature and pressure STP 101.325 kPa 273.15 K.At day 336 of the experiment when the OLR in R1 and methane production were higher quantification of the acetic propionic iso- butyric butyric isovaleric and valeric acids of the influent and effluent from UASB reactors was performed by gas chromatography according to the methodology described by .Sample information and genomic DNA from microorganismsThe genomic DNA samples sequenced in the Ion Torrent were from the sludge collected at the collection points of the reactors P1 to P4 in  located in the UASB reactors R1 and R2 at 340 days of opera- tion in phase V when OLR in R1 and methane production were higher.

The concentrations of total phosphorus Ptotal K Ca Mg Cu Fe Mn and Zn were determined weekly after acid nitric-OLR organic loading rate g COD L-1 d-1 HRT hydraulic retention time h.contained in the reactors were 49.7 g L-1 TS and 36.1 g L-1 VS R1 and 42.4 g L-1 TS and 29.7 g L-1 VS R2.2.3.

evaluating methane production by vinasse treatment using a modified UASB reactor observed an optimum OLR of 17 g COD L-1 d-1 achieving a specific methane production of0.263 L CH4 g-1 COD added and the system collapsed at an OLR of22 g COD L-1 d-1.

The TS and VS of the sludge from the collection points in R1 were 113.0 and 73.3 g L-1 P1 29.2 and 17.2 g L-1 P2 30.5 and18.9 g L-1 P3 and 34.8 and 19.9 g L-1 P4 respectively.

The vinasse is constitutes 94-97 water macro- nutrients mainly K Ca N Mg and S melanoidins and residualamounts of sugar alcohol and volatile components such as chloroform pentachlorophenol phenol and methylene chloride and the amount of these substances depends on the feedstock and the process of ethanol production  .Nutrient availability different configurations of anaerobic reactors operational strategies to obtain stability in methane production and quality of biodigested vinasse are other issues that must be solved be- fore widespread production of biogas from vinasse.

Units a b L CH4 L-1 reactor d-1 c L CH4 g-1 COD removed.because the volumetric methane production was maintained at lower values and the effluent presented buffering capacity maintaining the pH values of the influent in the range considered optimal for the me- thanogenic microorganisms through effluent recirculation.The average values of specific methane production ranged from0.17 to 0.24 L CH4 g-1 COD removed in R1 and from 0.09 to0.25 L CH4 g-1 COD removed in R2 .

In R2 theTS and VS were 107.2 and 75.1 g L-1 P1 36.5 and 17.0 g L-1 P231.2 and 20.3 g L-1 P3 and 29.1 and 15.0 g L-1 P4 respectively.The extractions of genomic DNA of both sludge samples described above were performed from 0.37 mg of sludge by means of the PowerSoilr DNA Isolation Kit MOBIO Laboratories Inc. stored at-20 degC.

The large abundance of the genus Methanothermobacter has high correlation with the volumetric production of methane KN Ptotal and Fe in R1 and R2.However the hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanoculleus and the acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanosarcina which presented high relative abundance in R1 are considered as ro- bust and effective methane producers occurring in high performance anaerobic digestion processes.

In this study the higher volumetric methane pro- duction was probably obtained by means of the thermophilic condi- tions.The temperature may influence biochemical reactions through in- creased reaction rates which would allow the use of shorter hydraulic retention times HRT increasing the degradation of organic solids and the production of biogas  as observed in this study.After 375 days of system operation methane volumetric production markedly decreased d and TVATA mean values increased .
