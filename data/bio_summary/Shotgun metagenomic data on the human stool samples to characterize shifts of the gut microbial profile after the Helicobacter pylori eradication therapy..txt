pylori eradication it is possible to make assumptions about the reversibilityirreversibility of therapy-related changes.The data can be used to estimate the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in the genetic pool of the gut microbiota after H. pylori eradication therapy.Using this data one can describe the general trends of the microbial composition variation caused by antibiotics and predict possible side effects.The data can be used to detect the genetic markers of dysbiosis and to design a minimally invasive PCR diagnostic system.DataThe data represent the result of metagenomic shotgun-sequencing of human gut microbiota at 3 time points before the H. pylori eradication therapy immediately after 2 weeks of therapy and several weeks after the treatment.

The dataset contains 15 metagenomic samples in raw reads format with 30.4 7 10.7 mln of reads per sample mean 7 SD.These data together with those described in 2 were involved in the study devoted to the gut microbiome changes caused by antimicrobial therapy 1.These data together with those described in were involved in the study devoted to the gut microbiome changes caused by antimicrobial therapy .Detailed description of samples is given in .460E.A.

The presented data on the whole-genome sequencing of the total DNA from stool samples of patients before the start of the eradication immediately after eradication and several weeks after the end of treatment could help to profile the gut microbiota both taxonomically and functionally.

Time point column shows the time of sample collection 1 means at the start of the therapy 2 - immediately after therapy 3 - several weeks after therapy.Experimental design materials and methodsSample collectionFifteen stool samples from 5 patients with symptoms of stomach andor duodenum disease and Helicobacter pylori detected by endoscopy were taken for analysis.

According to the Maastricht V Consensus and recommendations of Russian Gastroenterological Association patients had been prescribed a two-week eradication therapy consisted of amoxicillin 1000 mg bid clarithromycin 500 mg bid and proton pump inhibitors at a standard dose accompanied by bismuth subsalicylate 240 mg bid .

10-20 g of samples were instantly frozen with subsequent storage at -20 degC or were used for DNA extraction immediately after sampling.Total DNA 5 mg from fecal samples was extracted using the Purelink Genomic DNA Extraction KitInvitrogen USA.
