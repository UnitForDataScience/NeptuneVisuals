the presence of such taxa in the ecosystem can be functionally important as they could contribute to biogeochemical processes the findings of the bacterial communities' composition in our study differ from studies of eutrophic lakes and reservoirs partially or totally drained every year similar to other freshwater reservoirs and lakes proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most abundant bacterial phyla in both reservoirs comprising over 90 of total obtained sequences.

evident differences between reservoirs charac- terized quantitative bacterioplankton composition on the other side with 19 of the 100 most abundant otus in sites ck1 and ck2 absent from batak samples and less than 10table 2 sample statistics of read quantity after the main analysis steps and richness and biodiversity indices of 16s rrna gene relative to each samplediversity indices were calculated based on the total number of otus detected in the water samples from batak and tsankov kamak reservoir respectively.reads represented another 12 of bacteria assigned otus from the ck in batak samples.indices based on the otus data were calculated for each site in order to investigate alpha diversity.

the abundance of the actinobacteria in the samples from batak reservoir showed significant positive correlation with total phosphorus concentration based on pearson correlation analysis r  0.964 p  0.05. at all sites the minority of bacterial phyla showed a very high taxonomic diversity being distributed in 23 different classes.figure 3 prokaryotic diversity at the class level in the batak and tsankov kamak reservoirs.

it is the most diverse bacterial group which exists abundantly in mesotrophic and eutrophic water bodies in such conditions it can dominate freshwater lake bacterial communities the distribution of the genera flavobacterium and sediminibacterium in the studied reservoirs proved that there were relatively higher ratios in tsankov kamak reservoir suggesting they might thrive better in such environment.in conclusion this study constitutes the first investiga- tion on the bacterial community composition in bulgarianreservoirs.

and the high heterogeneity in the particle-associated communities the results suggest that differences among the two reservoirs are driven by the environmental parameters topology and hydro- geological characteristics.the taxonomic analysis based on the 16s rrna revealed a rich microbial community in the waters of batak and tsankov kamak reservoirs.

zavarzin and co- workers stated that members of the gammaproteobac- teria group naturally occurring in freshwater environments are probably copiotrophs which could be one of the main reasons for their disproportionate distribution among the studied sites in both reservoirs the presence of actinobacteria in the water samples from batak and tsankov kamak reservoirs was not unexpected since they are cosmopolitan freshwater taxa.

such patterns in the abundance of the major bacterial groups are reported worldwide for a range of lakes despite the variation in hydrology and water chemistry among studied sites cluster analysis based on the genera composition and abundance isolated batak and tsankov kamak reservoirs in separate clusters characterized by a significant spatial heterogeneity of the microbial community supporting information fig.

our results differ from the statements of other authors that typically in such reservoirs the shannon index increase and the dominance index decrease along the direction of the water flow which is caused by the presence of the dominant bacterial taxa in river water the riverine structure of the reservoir absence of typical lacustrine zone possibly lead to short retention time which prevents the formation of distinct bacterial assemb- lages.

chemolithotrophic and chemoheterotrophic microorganisms are considered key players in the decomposition andmineralization of organic matter and energy flow in lakes and reservoirs according to wang and co-workers microorganisms form the foundation of the food web serving as a food source for filter-feeding organisms.large reservoirs are usually situated on major rivers and as a result they receive high water and material loads whichj basic microbiol.

for both reservoirs the within lake variation was smaller than the differences between reservoirs.

materials and methods study sitesthis study was carried out in two morphologically distinct reservoirs located in rhodope mountains bulgaria bothdesignated as heavily modified water bodies in oligotrophic conditions from the mountain and semi-mountain lake types according to the national lake typology the batak reservoir was built in 1959 as a part of a hydroelectric cascade.

analysis of variance anova was applied for the determination of the distribution differences of the identified taxa between samples from batak b and tsankov kamak ck reservoirs.

results physical chemical and biological parameters of the reservoirsthe water columns of the batak and tsankov kamak reservoirs were well mixed and oxygenated table the vertical temperature differences did not exceed 1.5 degc.

of those 1798 otus were detected in batak b reservoir and 1774 otus in tsankov kamak ck samples table a considerable number of otus were sample specific 36 otus for b and 16 otus for ck with 18 from b and 32.3 from ck being presented by less than 10 reads in the dataset of the reservoirs.
