The ergosterol content was significantly increased during the experiment in P and MAP treatment reaching maximum values at 120 and 180 days but decreased at 60 and 150 days compared to NA and M treatments c. The fluctuations in the ergosterol content in both P and MAP treatments are contradictory with the evidence that plant roots through exudates are able to stimulate the soil fungal biomass.

In this treatment the highest PAH degradation values 58 were found which may suggest the combination of root exudates and inoculation of C. laeve provided for favorable conditions that assisted growth of hydrocarbon degraders.Impact of treatments on soil fungal biotaTo assess the influence of the inoculation of C. laeve and maize plants on the soil fungal communities during the PAH degradation the ergosterol content in soil was assayed c. Ergosterol content was increased throughout the incubation period under the NA treatment.

In this study NA was the treatment in which the lowest values of dehydrogenase activity and FDA hydrolysis were recorded in the time frame of the experiment as well as when compared with other treatments a b. Interest- ingly this treatment showed a significant decline in the S 16 PAHs after 180 days  which may indicate that the indigenous microbial communities are adapted and functional to the PAH degradation.

The maize plant-C. laeve association clearly suggests a synergistic contribution and therefore this treatment was the most effective approach in terms of 4 5-6 rings degradation in comparison with other treatments Fig.

The PCA analysis moreover indicated that 60-d M P and MAP treatments and 120-d M treatment were shown to be the less effective treatments de- grading ANT BkF CHR FLU IPY PHE and PYR as revealed their respective position in the left-lower quadrant.

The degradation of the individual 4 rings was also sig- nificantly increased during the soil phytoremediation reaching per- centages of degradation higher to those found in M treatments espe- cially in the case of PYR BaA and CHR Table S6.

The gradually degradation of ACE BbF BaP BghiP and NAP during the microbe-assisted degradation was evidenced in this study as indicated the position of 120-d 150-d and 180-d MAP treatments in the right-lower quadrant Fig.

The content of S16 PAHs reached values up to 109.6 ug kg-1 in MAP treatment whereas in P treatment it was up to 73.9 ug kg-1 Table S7.
