a Recruitment RPKG distribution in marine mesopelagic datasets together with the deep Caspian dataset from 150 m depth.Datasets cover the depths from 150 m to 1000 m n  19 in the mesopelagic layer and they include Caspian Sea 150 m TARA mesopelagic 550-1000 m Aegean Sea 600 m and Marmara Sea 1000 m. b Recruitment RPKG distribution in marine deep datasets in the range of 1500-6000 m n  31 including deep MALASPINA datasets together with the deep sea datasets of the Ionian Sea 3500m and Puerto Rico deep trench 6000 m. The black dots in the box plots are outlier values and the line inside the boxes indicates the median valuewithin the phylum Chloroflexi Supplementary Fig.

To get an overview of the distribution of 16S rRNA reads assigned to Chloroflexi across the global ocean in addition to the Medi- terranean DCM and Deep Caspian  and MALASPINA datasets we also used surface DCM and mesopelagic datasets generated by the TARA expedition .Metagenome assembly and annotationAll three datasets retrieved from depth profile of the Cas- pian Sea 15 m 40 m and 150 m were assembled together using IDBAUD  as described previously .

Marine datasets include Aegean Ionian and Marmara Sea deep datasets and Puerto Rico Trench deep dataset together with three of the deep MALASPINA datasets also used for assembly.

S6 and S7B.However on segregating datasets into mesopelagic up to 1000 m deep 19 datasets and bathypelagic 1500-6000 m 31 datasets a different recruitment pattern is evident.Fig.

Moreover metagenomic fragment recruitment analyzes reveal that highly related SAR202 genomes are prevalent at geo- graphically distant locations from the Mediterranean to the Pacific implying their global distribution as a deep strati- fied cluster with a sizeable contribution to global ocean biogeochemical cycles particularly the sulfur cycle.Material and methodsMetagenomic datasets used in this studyThe metagenomic samples from the Caspian Sea were taken at the peak of stratification in October 2013 at three depths 15 m 40 m and 150 m bottom depth 230 m. Sample collection DNA extraction sequencing and assembly of these datasets are described in more detail in Mehrshad et al.

The Mediterranean DCM datasets the Deep Mediterranean and the MALASPINA datasets were quality trimmed using sickle  default para- meters and assembled using the megahit assembler --k- min 39 --k-max 99 --k-step 10 --min-count 2 .

There are statistically significant differences between the surface- mesopelagic surface-bathypelagic datasets DCM-mesopelagic and DCM-bathypelagic datasets Kruskal-Wallis test P  0.001.

These include two deep datasets from the Eastern Mediterranean Aegean and Ionian Sea and three representative deep datasets from the MALASPINA expedition one each from South Atlantic Ocean Indian Ocean and North Pacific Ocean.

Similar trends were observed in the global ocean where the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum datasets were largely devoid of SAR202 representatives but the deep aphotic datasets showed a far higher abundance for reconstructed MAGs and SAGs of the SAR202 cluster Supplementary Fig.

Filled squares indicate the presence of the pathwaygeneWhile Ae2-Chloro-G1 Ae2-Chloro-G3 Io17-Chloro-G5 recruited more reads in the mesopelagic datasets Io17- Chloro-G1 Io17-Chloro-G8 all MALASPINA genomes and Pac-SCGC-AAA240-N13 recruited even more from the bathypelagic datasets Fig.
