these include two deep datasets from the eastern mediterranean aegean and ionian sea and three representative deep datasets from the malaspina expedition one each from south atlantic ocean indian ocean and north pacific ocean.

to get an overview of the distribution of 16s rrna reads assigned to chloroflexi across the global ocean in addition to the medi- terranean dcm and deep caspian  and malaspina datasets we also used surface dcm and mesopelagic datasets generated by the tara expedition .metagenome assembly and annotationall three datasets retrieved from depth profile of the cas- pian sea 15 m 40 m and 150 m were assembled together using idbaud  as described previously .

despite the distant origin of the genomes from the malaspina datasets they show high recruitment values in almost all available deep bath- ypelagic datasets suggesting the presence of the same spe- cies in widely different geographic areas southern indian ocean south atlantic north pacific ocean.

marine datasets include aegean ionian and marmara sea deep datasets and puerto rico trench deep dataset together with three of the deep malaspina datasets also used for assembly.

moreover metagenomic fragment recruitment analyzes reveal that highly related sar202 genomes are prevalent at geo- graphically distant locations from the mediterranean to the pacific implying their global distribution as a deep strati- fied cluster with a sizeable contribution to global ocean biogeochemical cycles particularly the sulfur cycle.material and methodsmetagenomic datasets used in this studythe metagenomic samples from the caspian sea were taken at the peak of stratification in october 2013 at three depths 15 m 40 m and 150 m bottom depth 230 m. sample collection dna extraction sequencing and assembly of these datasets are described in more detail in mehrshad et al.

similar trends were observed in the global ocean where the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum datasets were largely devoid of sar202 representatives but the deep aphotic datasets showed a far higher abundance for reconstructed mags and sags of the sar202 cluster supplementary fig.

there are statistically significant differences between the surface- mesopelagic surface-bathypelagic datasets dcm-mesopelagic and dcm-bathypelagic datasets kruskal-wallis test p  0.001. apart from the deep mediterranean the high abundance of chloroflexi across different geographical locations in the global ocean and depths in the pacific atlantic and indian oceans reaffirms the deep dark waters of global oceans as their preferred niche supplementary fig.

the malaspina datasets were chosen because they had a high percentage of chloroflexi 16s rrna reads 9-11 supplementary table s1 and also because they repre- sented geographically distant locations south atlantic indian ocean and north pacific.prodigal in metagenomic mode was used for predicting protein coding genes in the assembled contigs .
