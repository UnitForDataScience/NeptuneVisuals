After 4 days of incubation of AM strain and SC cultures the residual concentration of phenanthrene was significantly lower than in CON whereas after 4 days of incubation CON degraded 34 of the phenanthrene supplied and AM strain and SC degraded more than 75 and 99 respectively.Concentration of phenanthrene and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid HNA in AM CON and SC in phenanthrene-supplemented cultures.

AM in phenanthrene cultures to understand the interac- tions among the microorganisms present in the natural consortium during phenanthrene degradation as a sole carbon and energy source in liquid cultures.

The A phenanthrene and B 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid HNA concentrations in AM CON and SC cultures growing in LMM with phenanthrene as a sole carbon and energy source during 15 days of incubation.

A comparative 2-DE analysis of CON was performed to ana- lyze the protein expression profile at different times during phenanthrene degradation in LMM supplemented with 200 mg.l-1 of phenanthrene as a sole carbon and energy source.The soluble protein fractions were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis in a pH range of 4-7 and a molecular weight range of 6.5-200 kDa.

Also a synthetic consortium was constructed and phenanthrene degradation and micro- bial counts were compared to those obtained in CON.After 15 days of incubation degradation of the supplied phenanthrene was higher in the synthetic consortium SC than in AM strain and in CON  and CON was the one with the lower PAH elimination.

Stump and colleagues  reported that competition between a generalist and the processing chain may not maximize final compound productionwhich in our case could be phenanthrene metabolites and hence phenanthrene degradation .PAH degradation genes were found in the scaffold obtained from CON by the functional metagenomics approach and S1P3 showed a significant similarity with a genome fragment from Burkholderia sp.

AM genome.Considering the metagenomic results the fact that in CON the yellow colonies decrease after 7 days of incubation  and that phenanthrene degradation remained constant at the same point of the incubation time  it could be argued that in CON the strainbelonging to Burkholderiales order is involved in the first steps of the phenanthrene degrada- tion pathway.

In the contaminant degra- dation assay the defined consortium not only achieved a major phenanthrene degradation percentage  95 but also showed a more efficient elimination of the intermediate metab- olite.

The opposite behavior occurred in the CON culture where the lowest phenanthrene degradation and the highest HNA accumulation were observed which suggests the pres- ence of positive and also negative interaction in CON.

Our results show the presence of negative interactions between bacterial populations found in a natural consortium selected by enrichment techniques moreover the synthetic syntrophic processing chain with only one microorganism with the capability of degrading phenanthrene was more efficient in contaminant and intermediate metabolite degradation than a generalist strain Sphingobium sp.
