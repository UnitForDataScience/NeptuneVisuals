Acetic acid is thought to be involved in lipid metabolism in liver by directly up-regulating PPARa target genes and thus increase fatty acid oxidation and decrease lipid storage in the liver.49 The concentration of propionic acid and butyric acid was also observed to be higher in the sn2PARA fat-fed group P  0.05 Table 2 compared to the sn2PA group.

Ruminococcus2 belongs to the Ruminococcus genus which might be associated with hyperinsulinaemia45 intestinal permeability and hepatic inflammation.46 Taken together a sn2PA fat diet supplemented with DHA or ARA has potential to defend against bowel disease and maintain gut health by modulating gut microbiota composition.Effect of diets with sn2PA fat alone or in combination with DHA or ARA on faecal SCFA concentrationThe total concentration of SCFA including acetic acid propio- nic acid and butyric acid in the faeces of the sn2PARA diet group was increased by 41.9 in comparison to the sn2PA diet group P  0.0001 and increased by 11.7 in comparison with the sn2PDHA diet group P  0.0001 Table 2.

However the impact of combining PUFA like DHA or ARA with sn2PA fat on lipid metabolism and intes- tinal microbiota compositions has not been well researched.In our previous study we have investigated the impact of sn2PA fats with different percentages of PA esterified at the sn-2 on absorptions of dietary fatty acids and calcium intesti- nal microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid SCFA production.21 This study was conducted as a continuation to investigate how a diet with sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA might influence fatty acid composition in different rat tissues and lipid metabolism in the liver and tostudy the effect of these dietary fat compositions on theintestinal microbiota and their role in SCFA production in the gut.

See DOI 10.1039c7fo00094dtissues.13-5 For example diets rich in SFA caused liver total triacylglycerol TAG accumulation1 whereas MUFA or PUFA tended to decrease liver TAG.45 Previous studies have demon- strated that docosahexaenoic acid DHA C226n-3 and arachi- donic acid ARA C204n-6 play a pivotal role in regulating lipid metabolism including hepatic and serum TAG and total cholesterol content TC.6-8 Therefore different dietary fatty acids can impact people's health positively or negatively through altering lipid metabolism.It is now appreciated that dietary fatty acid intake also influ- ences the gut microbiota community of the host.1 The intesti- nal microbiota consists of trillions of micro-organisms which have co-evolved with the host for a long time.

The results were supported by previous reports including our own work that the type and amount of SCFA in the gut depended on the diet and intestinal bacterial community.2147Acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid are the major SCFA in the gut and regarded as microbial end products from dietary fibre fermentation.48 Among these SCFA the concen- tration of acetic acid was higher in sn2PDHA and sn2PARA groups compared with the sn2PA group P  0.05 Table 2.

Moreover the content of linoleic acid C182 in the liver brain epididymal and perirenal adipose tissues was higher in the sn2PDHA and the sn2PARA groups compared with the sn2PA group P  0.05 Tables S5-S8 which is in agreement with the inhibitory function of DHA and ARA on D6-desaturase function.26 Furthermore the sn2PDHA fat-fed group had a higher content of palmitic acid C160 in epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue P  0.05 Tables S7 and S8 and a lower content of palmitoleic acid C161 in the liver epididymal and perirenal fat P  0.05 Tables S5 S7 and S8 compared with the other two dietary groups.

Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to NAFLD development.2 Increasing evidence has demonstrated that dietary fatty acids such as saturated fatty acids SFA monounsaturated fatty acids MUFA and polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA may play an important role in altering lipid metabolism in differentaInstitute of Food and Nutraceutical Science School of Agriculture and Biology Shanghai Jiao Tong University Shanghai PR China.E-mail bWilmar Shanghai Biotechnology Research  Development Center Co.

Thisobservation indicated that the supplementation of sn2PA fat in combination with DHA or ARA had no impact on rat weightfood consumption and perirenal fat deposition but might favour epididymal fat reduction in rats after 6 weeks of feeding.Effect of diets with sn2PA fat alone or in combination with DHA or ARA on tissue fatty acid compositionThe most striking changes in the fatty acid composition were observed in the liver tissue.
