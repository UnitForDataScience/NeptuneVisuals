in this study aspergillus fumigatus and other species of aspergillus were identified including aspergillus niger aspergillus fla- vus and others.

the prevalence of aspergillus among fungi was the highest at the species level approximately 17 to 61 and the prevalence of aspergillus fumigatus among aspergillus species was from 34 to 50 in the four departments.

the prevalence of aspergillus and the proportion of aspergillus among fungi were calculated as shown in the results revealed that the prevalence of aspergillus among fungi in the ricu reached 61 which represented the highest level observed among all departments.

in the er the prevalence of aspergillus was 17. at the same time the ratio of aspergillus fumigatus among all aspergillus species was calculated.

although the ratio of aspergillus among the total fungi in each department fluctuated in the range of 17-61 the ratios of aspergillus fumigatus among aspergillus spe- cies remained at a relatively fixed level around approximately 34 to 50 in the investigated departments.
