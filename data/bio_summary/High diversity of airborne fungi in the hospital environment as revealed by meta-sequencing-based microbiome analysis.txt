This classification of microbe revealed 163 species of fungi 8 74 species of Archaea 3 1826 species of bacteria 84 and 117 species of virus 5 in the RICU 314 species of fungi 11 106 species of Archaea 4 2170 species of bacteria 77 and 211 species of virus 8 in the SICU 287 species of fungi 14 72 species of Archaea 4 1597 species of bacteria 79 and 60 species of virus 3 in the ERand 235 species of fungi 9 98 species of Archaea 4 2261 species of bacteria 84 and 81 species of virus 3 in the OPD .

The top 10 fungi identified from the four departments are shown in Supplemental Table 4 at the species level showing that the top 10 fungi accounted for highest proportion of all identified fungi.

The relative abundance of the top 10 fungi is shown in Figure S2 revealing that the ratios of Aspergillus fumigatus among all fungi ranked first among all of the identified fungi in the four departments.DiscussionThe practical importance and frequency of airborne hospital-associated infections remain controversial although the rate of this type of infection has increased sharply in recent years.

The prevalence of Aspergillus and the proportion of Aspergillus among fungi were calculated as shown in The results revealed that the prevalence of Aspergillus among fungi in the RICU reached 61 which represented the highest level observed among all departments.

To verify the candidate fungi species the total genomic DNA of the 4 meta-genome samples was prepared as the template for real-time PCR to determine the abundance of fungi.

In particular airborne fungi in hospitals are considered critical pathogens of hospital-associated infections.

However using microbiome sequencing the relative abundance of fungi Archaea species bacteria and viruses was determined.

The distribution characteristics of fungi were investigated using heat map analysis of four departments including theRespiratory Intensive Care Unit Intensive Care Unit Emergency Room and Outpatient Department.

The prevalence of Aspergillus among fungi was the highest at the species level approximately 17 to 61 and the prevalence of Aspergillus fumigatus among Aspergillus species was from 34 to 50 in the four departments.
