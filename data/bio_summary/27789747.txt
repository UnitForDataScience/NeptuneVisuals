Bifidobac- terium counts were significantly higher in groups B1 P  0.05 B2 P  0.05 B3 P  0.01 and B4 P 0.01 than in Con.

E. coliLactobacillusratio in groups B1 P  0.05 B2 P  0.01 B3 P 0.01 and B4 P  0.01 decreased significantly.DISCUSSIONWe found no significant difference in egg production over the entire experimental period.

At wk 20 and 24 groups B1 P  0.01 B2 P  0.05and B3 P  0.05 significantly increased eggshell strength compared with Con.

At wk 16 E. coli counts significantly decreased in groups B1 P  0.01 B2 P  0.01 and B4 P  0.05 compared with Con.

At wk 20 E. Coli counts significantly de- creased in groups B2 P  0.01 B3 P  0.05 and B4 P  0.01.
