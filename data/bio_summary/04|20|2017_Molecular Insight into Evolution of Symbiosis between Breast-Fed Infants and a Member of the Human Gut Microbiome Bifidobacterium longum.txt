longum JCM1217 B. longum  .

Notably B. longum was found to significantly dominate among members of the genus Bifidobacterium in the breast-fed infants C p  0.02 whereas the copy number of the 16S rDNA gene of bifidobacterial speciessubspecies other than B. longum did not differ between the two groups D. The lnbX gene was detected in five breast-fed infant stool samples occupancy of 50 and was pre- sent in only one mixed-fed infant stool sample 17 and its abundance differed significantly between the two groups  E p  0.049.

Our study demonstrates that lnbX plays key roles in the growth of a considerable number of B. longum strains on HMOs and contributes to the persis- tence and survival advantage of members of the B. longum spe- cies complex in breast-fed infants.

provide the structural basis of lacto-N-biosidase LnbX a key enzymatic factor for growth and proliferation of B. longum in breast- fed infants.

Bifidobacterium bifidum possesses a glycoside hydrolase family20 lacto-N-biosidase for liberating lacto-N-biose I from lacto-N-tetraose an abundant HMO unique to human milk while Bifidobacterium longum subsp.

longum has a non-classified enzyme LnbX.

Moreover through genetic studies we show that lnbX is indispensable for B. longum growth on lacto-N-tetraose and is a key genetic factor for persistence in the gut of breast-fed infants.
