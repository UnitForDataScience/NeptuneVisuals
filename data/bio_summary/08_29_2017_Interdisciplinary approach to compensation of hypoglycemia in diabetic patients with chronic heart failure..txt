Management of CHF in the presence of diabetes mellitus and rehabilitation of these patients is a stepwise process where each step should be based on multimodal approach.The existing approaches to multidisciplinary team work represent a foundation for establishing refined principles of team care specifically for diabetic patients with CHF.A series of Live Grand Rounds Presentations and an on- demand CME-certified Webcourse aimed at building a team approach to managing hypoglycemia comorbidities and pa- tient challenges represent the exemplary efforts for helping T2D patients .

Over 80 of T1D patients and nearly of half of T2D patients report hypoglycemia during 1 month .

propose to consider hypoglycemia a counterbalance measure of quality in order to fully optimize and individualize glycemic control in diabetic patients .Implementation of new oral antihyperglycemic drugs of- fers novel treatment opportunities but challenges of managingCHF patients with diabetes persist.

Better understanding of the pathogenesis risk factors for hypoglycemia unawareness and detailed knowledge on new therapies safe for diabetic patients with CHF are needed.The aim of this article is to highlight the multidisciplinary aspects of hypoglycemia challenges in patients with CHF.

Cardiac autonomic neu- ropathy impacts the ability to sense approaching hypoglyce- mia whereas it is vital for patients especially those with high cardiovascular risk to recognize signs of approaching hypoglycemia.Prevalence rates of cardiac autonomic neuropathy are 38 and 44 in 40-70-year-old patients with T1D and T2D respectively .

In turn atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias significantly in- crease mortality in patients with heart failure .Rapid fluctuations in blood glucose make the myocardium electrically unstable and the heart becomes vulnerable espe- cially in patients with preexisting coronary artery disease and autonomic neuropathy .

The study shows that hypoglycemia triggers leukocytosis in healthy control participants and patients with normal hypoglycemia aware- ness but not in patients with impaired awareness suggesting that counterregulatory hormone responses may be pivotal modulators of hypoglycemia-induced proinflammatory mech- anisms.

Among these classes of drugs that have an impact on the endothelium ROCK inhibitors such as Y-27632 and fasudil have shown promising therapeu- tic advantages on cardiovascular diseases including athero- sclerosis and CHF   as well as significant beneficial effects on diabetic endothelial dysfunction of coronary arteries .Studies focused on the role of inflammation and metaflammation in the risks of heart failure diabetes and obesity may integrate therapeutic targets and provide a new tool to evaluate progress of treatment.Thyroid hormones and hypoglycemiaIn patients without diabetes mellitus heart failure can be as- sociated with hypoglycemia and such patients have high in- hospital mortality .

Persons with diabetes who have a sud- den increase in frequency or severity of hypoglycemic epi- sodes not explained by changes in diet physical activity or dosage of glucose-lowering drugs must be evaluated for hy- pothyroidism .Drugs for chronic heart failure and the risk of hypoglycemiaCompared with nondiabetic individuals diabetic patients are less likely to receive efficacious therapies for systolic heart failure perhaps due to the increased rate of adverse reactions andor intolerance to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and the increased prevalence of renal disease in the presence of diabetes .The drugs commonly prescribed to CHF patients comprise angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers ARB beta-blockers calcium channel blockers mineralocorticoid receptor agonists MRA hydralazineisosorbide dinitrate H-ISDN diuretics ivabradine digoxin statins and nitrates.

The users of glipizide or glyburide who require anti-infective treatments are at risk of hypoglycemia .T2D patients receiving polytherapy can develop severe hypo- glycemia associated with levofloxacin .New and emerging therapies with reduced hypoglycemia riskStudies contributing to a better way to address complications of diabetes including the challenges of hypoglycemia are ur- gent which is especially vital for vulnerable CHF patients.
