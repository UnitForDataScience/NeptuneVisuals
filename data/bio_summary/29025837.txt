If so that facili- tates greater exposure to the immune system of dietary antigens and microbiota-derived products which may cause a proinflamma- tory response and stimulate beta-cell autoim- munity in genetically predisposed subjects.Compared with healthy controls subjects with T1D exhibit a less diverse and less stable gut microbiota.A low abundance of lactate and butyrate-producing speciesGroele L et al.

In animals studies using non-obese diabetic NOD mice or a rat model showed that the development of T1D can be prevented or delayed through modulation of the intes- tinal microbiota.Administration of Lactobacillus john- soni N6.2 isolated from BioBreeding diabetes-resistant rats delays or inhibits the onset of T1D in BioBreeding diabetes-prone rats.

For a detailed review of studies evaluating the role of the gut microbiota in these patients see the review by Gulden et al.Microbiota modulation strategiesWith the growing recognition of the role of gut micro- biota in health and disease it has become clear that gut microbiota may be a target for improving outcomes in subjects affected by or at risk for certain diseases including T1D.
