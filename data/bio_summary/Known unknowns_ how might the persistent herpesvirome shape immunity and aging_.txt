of interest in the absence of cmv infection with aging there is no absolute increase in memory t cells in the blood  cmv-specific memory t cell inflation is the result of continued recruitment of t cells into the immune response  although that issue is not fully settled.in contrast to chronic infections where antigen load is high and t cells are driven to functional exhaustion hepatitis c virus hiv reviewed in  the inflated cmv-specific memory t cell populations retain robust effector function for the life of the individual and have been described as 'the last man standing' in the sea of reduced immune responses to other acute pathogens .hsvhsv infection shares many similarities with cmv.

upon subsequent activation of adaptive immunity significant immune pressure is put on the virus and the virus enters into a state of latency within host cells with different herpes- viruses showing different cellular tropisms for latency cmv -- hematopoietic progenitor and myeloid cellslatent reservoirs vascular endothelial cells and epithe- lial cells smolderingchronic reservoirs  hsv and vzv -- sensory neurons  and ebv -- memory b cells .cmv ebv and vzv are strictly species-specific having closely co-evolved with their respective hosts over millions of years.

in human monozygotic twins cmv infection can account for upward of 50 of immune system variability indicating that this virus has a dramatic impact on host biology  between cmv and the immune system lead to an abso- lute accumulation of effector t cells specific for cmv termed memory inflation  one or a few clonal populations occupying up to 25 of the entire cd8 t cell pool in elderly humans .

are some viruses more efficient at reactivation such that ie gene expression leads to fully blown production of infectious virus if the virus cannot sense immune pressure until it commits to reactivation what provokes it to leave latency is this a random and stochastic process or one driven by some change in the host cell does the rate of these micro-reactivations change over a lifespan and does that differ from individual to individual why do individ- uals show such different magnitude of memory t cell inflation do some individuals have more cmv-infected cells a higher latent load so that the odds of reactivation are just higher or is the immune system in some indi- viduals simply better able to keep the virus at bay perhaps using fewer resources for that task lower mem- ory inflation lower antiviral antibody titers some evi- dence of this scenario emerged from the leiden longevity study.

in contrast cmv reservoirs include hematopoietic stem cells myeloid cells vascular endothelial and epithelial cells.

constant immune surveillance and subsequent low-level immune activation and inflam- mation could potentially have dramatic effects on the health of an individual over a lifetime.

consequently fewer studies of immune system aging have found strong correlations between hsv ser- ostatus immune phenotypes and function other diseases or mortality particularly as related to hsv-2.

however what does titer mean do all individuals control cmv with a partic- ular set of immune resources surprisingly very little work has been done looking at global immune responses to cmv within the same individual i.e.

in a longitudinal study of 11 women aged 70-79 most subjects' igg cmv titers remained remarkably stable over 12 years  although a larger sample size is needed to confirm this finding and studies in men should be included as the overall immune system in middle-aged men is much more prominently affected by cmv carriage .conclusionsoverall it is clear that we have many more questions than answers at this moment related to the role of cmv and the persistent herpesvirome in immune aging and health- whitley rj herpes simplex viruses.

upon primary infection of the host the virus enters and rapidly replicates within host cells while the innate immune system tries to limit and control the infection.

punch biopsy images from the genital tract of hsv-1 infected humans demonstrated frequent viral reactivation in the tissue but that resident memory t cells can prevent lesion devel- opment if present at a high enough density if continuous micro-reactivations are occurring through the organism the immune surveillance and highly local- ized cytokine production could produce low level inflam- mation that is not necessarily measurable by the systemic serum cytokine profiling which has been the standard assessment in human subjects and even animal models.

the virome a subset of the overall microbiome large and diverse including viruses that persistently inhabit host cells endogenous viral elements genomically or epigenomically integrated into cells and viruses that infect the other bacterial protozoan fungal and archaeal microbiome phylla.

the virome a subset of the overall microbiome is of enormous size and diversity including viruses that persistently inhabit host cells endogenous viral elements genomically or epigenomically integrated into cells and viruses that infect the other bacterial protozoan fungal archaeal microbiome phylla .

in latency top panel cells harboring virus would predominantly produce latency-associated transcripts red while the few cells attempting to reactivate may also produce lytic viral transcripts green.

there would be little to no antigen presentation by mhc to either circulating memory t cells or tissue-resident memory t cells.
