in most cases operative treatment cannot circumvent the course of cipo and can actually worsen the motility disorder.2 inadequate oral intake recur- rent episodes of obstruction and malabsorption are the main clinical features of cipo with 20 to 60 of patients needing long-term home parenteral nutrition.3 thus the main goals in cipo manage- ment are improvement of intestinal propulsion and maintenance of adequate nutritional status.4 recently the ability to maintain oral feeding was found to be an independent predictor of survival in pa- tients with cipo.2the etiology and cause of cipo are not well clarified.

chronic abdominal pain is defined as an unpleasant sensation that is diffuse and difficult to localize compared with somatic pain.31 gut microbiota dysbiosis luminal dilatation increased intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation may contribute to the de- velopment of visceral hyperalgesia with sensitization of peripheral and central pain pathways.332 visceral hypersensitivity character- izing constipation-predominant ibs patients can be transferred to rats by fecal microbiota.33 in ibs patients alteration of intestinal microbiota has been linked to immune dysfunction and altered neu- rological functions such as reduced pain threshold and increased anxiety suggesting that restoration of normal intestinal homeostasis via fmt may result in symptomatic improvement.34 our results confirmed that fmt delivered through an nj tube may relieve abdominal pain and bloating symptoms in cipo patients.the microbiota plays a key role in the development and promo- tion of normal gut neuromotor function.

because alterations in the intestinal microbiota contribute to cipo we hypothesized that manipulating the gut microbiome through fmt could reverse intestinal dysbiosis and result in resolution of overt cipo.

when impairment of gut motility and transit are severe small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo may occur further contributing to malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.5 sibo may also in turn exac- erbate intestinal dysmotility.67 currently non-absorbable antibiotics eg rifaximin are used to alleviate sibo-associated symptoms.89 this beneficial effect of antibiotics may in part be due altered loca- tion or quality of the patient's gastrointestinal microbiota.10fecal microbiota transplantation fmt is a technique in which intestinal microbiota are transferred from a healthy donor to a patient with altered gut microbiota because of a disease or condi- tion.

chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction cipo is a rare clinical syndrome first reported by dudley et al1 in 1958. cipo is a functional motility disorder characterized by episodic obstruc- tive symptoms in the absence of a mechanical cause.

although the exact mechanism of the effect of fmt remains unclear some research suggests that alleviation of symptoms after fmt is associated with changes in microbial community structure such as restoration of microbial diversity.13because gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to the pathology of cipo we hypothesized that manipulating the gut microbiome through fmt could reverse intestinal dysbiosis and consequently resolve overt cipo.

small intestinal transit time is delayed in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

in cipo the normal antegrade propulsive activity of the intestinal tract is defective thereby resulting in the develop- ment of symptoms such as abdominal pain nausea vomiting and bloating.

because affected individuals are often unable to maintain adequate nutrition and normal body weight cipo is a severe cause of chronic intestinal failure.

abnormalities of smooth muscle cells interstitial cells of cajal intrinsic enteric and extrinsic neural supplies and the central nervous system may all play a role in the pathophysiology of cipo whether separately or in various combinations.23 symptoms can vary depending on which intestinal segment is primarily affected.

treatment with poorly absorbed antibiotics such as rifaximin may improve motility.28 notably antibiotic treatment for sibo may stop diarrhea but can induce a reappearance of constipation leading to worsening of cipo symptoms.5 a recent study showed that antibiotic treatment may decrease the fecal output delay whole gut and colonic transit and reduce spontaneous contractions and the response to acetylcholine in the ileum and colon.29 accordingly the treatment strategies for sibo include not only elimination of pathogenic bacteria but also restoration of normal intestinal bacterial microflora improvement of gastrointestinal motor function control of visceral sensitivity and proper nutritional management.30fmt involves administration of fecal material containing dis- tal gut microbiota from a healthy person donor to a patient with a disease or condition related to dysbiosis or to a patient with altered gut microbiota.

we investigated the efficacy of fmt in the treatment of cipo patients.methodsnine patients age 18-53 years with cipo were enrolled in this prospective open-label study.

traditional surgical procedures are generally unable to correct the digestive dysmotility characteristic of this disease.19a large percentage of patients with cipo require different forms of nutritional support.3 the long-term outcome is often poor for many cipo patients because they cannot maintain their nutritional status.
