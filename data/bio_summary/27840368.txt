In most cases operative treatment cannot circumvent the course of CIPO and can actually worsen the motility disorder.2 Inadequate oral intake recur- rent episodes of obstruction and malabsorption are the main clinical features of CIPO with 20 to 60 of patients needing long-term home parenteral nutrition.3 Thus the main goals in CIPO manage- ment are improvement of intestinal propulsion and maintenance of adequate nutritional status.4 Recently the ability to maintain oral feeding was found to be an independent predictor of survival in pa- tients with CIPO.2The etiology and cause of CIPO are not well clarified.

Chronic abdominal pain is defined as an unpleasant sensation that is diffuse and difficult to localize compared with somatic pain.31 Gut microbiota dysbiosis luminal dilatation increased intestinal permeability and mucosal inflammation may contribute to the de- velopment of visceral hyperalgesia with sensitization of peripheral and central pain pathways.332 Visceral hypersensitivity character- izing constipation-predominant IBS patients can be transferred to rats by fecal microbiota.33 In IBS patients alteration of intestinal microbiota has been linked to immune dysfunction and altered neu- rological functions such as reduced pain threshold and increased anxiety suggesting that restoration of normal intestinal homeostasis via FMT may result in symptomatic improvement.34 Our results confirmed that FMT delivered through an NJ tube may relieve abdominal pain and bloating symptoms in CIPO patients.The microbiota plays a key role in the development and promo- tion of normal gut neuromotor function.

Because alterations in the intestinal microbiota contribute to CIPO we hypothesized that manipulating the gut microbiome through FMT could reverse intestinal dysbiosis and result in resolution of overt CIPO.

When impairment of gut motility and transit are severe small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO may occur further contributing to malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.5 SIBO may also in turn exac- erbate intestinal dysmotility.67 Currently non-absorbable antibiotics eg rifaximin are used to alleviate SIBO-associated symptoms.89 This beneficial effect of antibiotics may in part be due altered loca- tion or quality of the patient's gastrointestinal microbiota.10Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT is a technique in which intestinal microbiota are transferred from a healthy donor to a patient with altered gut microbiota because of a disease or condi- tion.

Although the exact mechanism of the effect of FMT remains unclear some research suggests that alleviation of symptoms after FMT is associated with changes in microbial community structure such as restoration of microbial diversity.13Because gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to the pathology of CIPO we hypothesized that manipulating the gut microbiome through FMT could reverse intestinal dysbiosis and consequently resolve overt CIPO.

Small intestinal transit time is delayed in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction CIPO is a rare clinical syndrome first reported by Dudley et al1 in 1958.

In CIPO the normal antegrade propulsive activity of the intestinal tract is defective thereby resulting in the develop- ment of symptoms such as abdominal pain nausea vomiting and bloating.
