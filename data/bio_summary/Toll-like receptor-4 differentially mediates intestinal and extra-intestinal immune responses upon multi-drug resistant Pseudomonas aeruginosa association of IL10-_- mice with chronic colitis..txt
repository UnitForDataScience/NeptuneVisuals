Hence TLR4-dependent differences in intestinal colonization properties of MDR PA were asso- ciated with genotype-dependent differences in intestinal microbiota compositions of IL10-- mice before peroral PA challenge and subsequently facilitated PA coloniza- tion in TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice.Macroscopic and microscopic sequelae in TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice following peroral association with multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosaWe next assessed potential TLR4 dependent macroscopic and microscopic sequelae upon MDR PA colonization of IL10-- mice.

Even though not considered as being part of the human commensal intes- tinal microbiota intestinal PA colonization is a prereq- uisite of infection later on given that rectally colonized individuals harbored a 15 times higher risk for develop- ment of a PA infection when admitted to an ICU .Of note intestinal PA colonization rates of patients have been shown to increase during hospital stay presumably due to exposure to contaminated surfaces on wards or colonized patients via cross-contamination .

Hence MDR PA could more sufficiently estab- lish within the gastrointestinal tract of TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice.Intestinal microbiota composition before peroral association of TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice with multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosaGiven that the intestinal microbiota composition consti- tutes the physiological colonization resistance prevent- ing the host from opportunistic pathogenic infection  we next performed a comprehensive survey of the commensal intestinal microbiota composition in mice of either genotype by cultural analyses of fecal samples that had been taken immediately before PA challenge.Interestingly TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice harbored up to two orders of magnitude higher numbers of com- mensal enterobacteria and enterococci in their intestinal tract at day 0 p  0.001 and p  0.01 respectively Fig.

Information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying theinteractions between intestinal carriage of MDR PA and host immunity during chronic large intestinal inflammation is scarce however.Methods and results We therefore perorally challenged conventionally colonized TLR4-deficient IL10-- mice and IL10-- counterparts displaying comparably severe chronic colitis with a clinical MDR PA strain.

Whereas the pathogenic potential of PA is well known given its diverse arsenal of virulence factors our knowl- edge regarding the interplay of PA commensal intestinal microbiota and host immunity particularly under con- ditions of intestinal inflammation is scarce however.

Experiments were repeated twice.ResultsIntestinal colonization properties of multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa following peroral association of TLR4 deficient IL10-- miceIn order to address the impact of TLR4 in MDR PA colonization and subsequent intestinal as well as extra- intestinal immune responses in murine IL10-- colitis we perorally challenged 11-14 months old convention- ally colonized TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice and IL10-- counterparts with 109 CFU of a clinical MDR PA isolate by gavage.

This prompted us to study gastrointestinal colonization properties and potential TLR4 dependent intestinal as well as extra-intestinal immune responses upon MDR PA challenge under chronic intestinal inflammatory condi-tions applying the chronic IL10-- colitis mouse model.Conventionally colonized but not germfree or second- ary abiotic IL10-- mice develop chronic large intestinal inflammation due to antigenic stimuli derived from their commensal gut microbiota with progressive aging and are considered a valuable mouse model for human intes- tinal inflammation such as IBD affection the colon .MethodsEthical statementAll animal experiments were conducted according to the European Guidelines for animal welfare 201063EU with approval of the commission for animal experiments headed by the Landesamt fur Gesundheit und Soziales LaGeSo Berlin Registration Numbers G009712 and G003915.

c. Hence apoptotic cell responses upon MDR PA colonization were more pronounced in large intestines of IL10-- mice.Colonic immune cell responses in TLR4 deficient IL10-- mice following peroral association with multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosaWe next addressed whether PA colonization resulted in TLR4 dependent immune cell responses within the intestinal tract.

Recent surveys revealed that intestinal PA detection rates were higher in patients with intestinal inflammatory morbidi- ties including irritable bowel syndrome  or inflamma- tory bowel disease IBD such as ulcerative colitis .

Hence distinct TLR4 dependent pro-inflammatory immune response scenarios following intestinal coloni- zation with MDR PA are mirrored by distinct intestinal and even extra-intestinal i.e.
