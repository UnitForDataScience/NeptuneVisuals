Numerous can- didates as causative agents have been proposed toxins metals pesticides bacteria viruses  various medications and in partic- ular antibiotics nutrients and components secondary to altered gut microbiota.Why Parkinson's disease could be caused by fungi oractinobacteriaa-Synuclein - part of the body's defense mechanismThe characteristic Lewy pathology bodies and neurites in the diseased neurons contain aggregates composed of amyloid fibrils of misfolded variant of the protein a-synuclein a-syn.

Parkinson's disease the hibernating spore hypothesisKetil Berstad  Johanna E.R.

Updated research and the epidemiology of PD suggest that the disease might be induced byenvironmental factors possibly with genetic susceptibility and that a-synuclein probably should beregarded as part of the body's own defense mechanism.

The aim of the present report is to support and revitalize Broxmeyer's hypothesis.Among US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older age- standardized Parkinson disease PD prevalence in White men was approximately twice that in Blacks and in Asians .

Apart fromLewy body dementia and a subset of patients within Alzheimer's disease Lewy pathology LP have until recently been regarded as distinctive of PD not found in other neurodegenerative diseases .Prior to aggregation a-syn exists as a mixture of the nativelyunfolded and partially folded conformations.

The latter being similar to the way in which tubercle bacilli are encapsulated in the lungs and spirochetes seem to be encapsulated by b-amyloid in the brains of patients with Alz- heimer's disease .Studies of families with a history of PD have resulted in the identification of a series of familial mutations leading to EPD e.g.

A53T isrelated to EPD indicates that a-syn in some way is part of thebody's defense mechanism as 'police on patrol' or 'wranglers' .Hence despite misfolded a-syn by itself may induce neurotox-icity and aggravate the disease in a prion-like manner it is most likely an initiating unknown agent and not misfolded a-syn that is the triggering factor and thus the true cause of PD.Transport nervesOne common feature of neurons that contain LP with misfolded a-syn is that they all have long thin axons with a thin or absent myelin sheath.
