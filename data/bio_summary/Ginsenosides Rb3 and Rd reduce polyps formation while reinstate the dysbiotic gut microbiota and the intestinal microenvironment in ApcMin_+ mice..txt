The stearic color is representing significant change in respective group compared to control group - as green color is indicating Rb3 and dark-blue color is indicating Rd group B Showing average relative abundance of all families that significantly enriched or declined with Rb3 treatment.

Similarly the growth of several Lactobacillus species greatly promoted with Rb3 and Rd treatments compare to control group Table .

Bacteroides acidifaciens is a renowned probiotic species that was abundantly detected in Rb3 106 increase and Rd 292 increase treated groups compared to con- trol group.

Especially the abundances of species from genera Butyricimonas Campylobacter Dysgonomonas Fusobacterium and Helicobacter were lower in Rb3 Rd treated mice compared to control group Table .

Thus in this study two purified compounds gypenoside Rb3 and gypenoside Rd of Gp were investigated for the cancer protec- tive effects and the impact on GM in the ApcMin colorectal cancer mouse model.

Contrary to Rb3 treatment we noticed that Rd treatment upregulated mRNA expression of M2 macrophage phenotypic markers such as arginase-1 MR Trem-2 and Ym-1 compared to control group Fig.

Moreover using UniFrac distance analysis weighted and unweighted clear shifts in bacterial composition were observed in the Rb3 Rd treated groups compared to control group Fig.

The unique species detected in the Rd-treated group constituted 1 of the total OTUs in Rd group.

Overall Rd exerted stronger impact than Rb3 on the expression of oncogenic genes displayed in Fig.

Contrary to Rb3 Rd treatment markedly p  0.01 decreased the expression profiles of iNOS and CXCL10 Fig.
