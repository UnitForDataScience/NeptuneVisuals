similarly the growth of several lactobacillus species greatly promoted with rb3 and rd treatments compare to control group table .

bacteroides acidifaciens is a renowned probiotic species that was abundantly detected in rb3 106 increase and rd 292 increase treated groups compared to con- trol group.

especially the abundances of species from genera butyricimonas campylobacter dysgonomonas fusobacterium and helicobacter were lower in rb3 rd treated mice compared to control group table .

overall rd exerted stronger impact than rb3 on the expression of oncogenic genes displayed in fig.

contrary to rb3 rd treatment markedly p  0.01 decreased the expression profiles of inos and cxcl10 fig.

contrary to rb3 treatment we noticed that rd treatment upregulated mrna expression of m2 macrophage phenotypic markers such as arginase-1 mr trem-2 and ym-1 compared to control group fig.

moreover using unifrac distance analysis weighted and unweighted clear shifts in bacterial composition were observed in the rb3 rd treated groups compared to control group fig.

the stearic color is representing significant change in respective group compared to control group - as green color is indicating rb3 and dark-blue color is indicating rd group b showing average relative abundance of all families that significantly enriched or declined with rb3 treatment.

we detected two species from genus campylobacter c. canadensis and c. faecalis and both the species were less abundant in rb3rd treated groups.

shared species are represented as inter-connected strokes and unique species are shown as outward strokes - uniquely present to each group.

the unique species detected in the rd-treated group constituted 1 of the total otus in rd group.

similarly in the rd treated group bacteroidetes is the most abundant phylum whereas proteobacteria is the most diverse phylum with 25 unique species in term of unique species.discussionmore than 150 different types of saponins have been identified for anti-cancer properties.
