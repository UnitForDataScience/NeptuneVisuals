Conversely the transfer of eubiotic gut microbiota slightly affected both the gut microbiota composition and related bacterial metabolic functions of recipient mice which did not show altered markers of hepatic gluconeogenesis on normal chow.Our results show that transferring a dysbiotic gut microbiota may benefit the host proposing to reconsider the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis within the aetiology of metabolic diseases.ResultsTo investigate the metabolic effects of transferring gut microbiota recipient mice never previously treated with antibiotics were used since antibiotics have been shown to dampen dysbiosis-induced dysmetabolism Ellekilde et al 2014 or even to limit the establish- ment of exogenous microbiota Manichanh et al 2010.Metabolic effects of dysbiotic vs. eubiotic gut microbiota transfer in conventional mice fed a normal chow NCTo investigate the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the aetiology of metabolic diseases we transferred the caecal content from high- fat diet-induced obese mice HFD-microbiota hereafter into conventional Conv mice fed a NC Conv  OM HFD OM stands for obese microbiota and we compared this group to mice inoculated with either the vehicle Conv  PBS or an eubi- otic gut microbiota from lean mice Conv  LM LM stands for lean microbiota Fig 1A.

To investigate the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the aetiology of metabolic diseases we inoculated conventional healthy mice with either dysbiotic gut microbiota from diet-induced and obob obese mice or eubiotic gut microbiota from lean mice.We found that transfer of dysbiotic gut microbiota to conven- tional mice acutely reduces markers of hepatic gluconeogenesis during normal chow and protects towards high-fat diet-increased markers of hepatic gluconeogenesis and adiposity together with changes in both gut microbiota and microbiome.

Note that the unmatched age for donor mice in protocol 2 is related to the fact that the major point we wanted to investigate herein is the putative metabolic effect of transferring a dysbiotic gut micro- biota therefore we did not intend to compare donors of protocol 2 against each other.Criteria for the definition of eubiotic vs. dysbiotic gut microbiota Eubiotic vs. dysbiotic gut microbiota were defined according to the amount of bacteria lower in the dysbiotic gut microbiota and their high diversity according to the donor NC vs. HFD-fed mouse Appendix Fig S1F-K.Western blot analysisThe Western blot analysis in liver extracts was performed as previ- ously described Serino et al 2012b.

Non-antibiotic treated 6-week-old conventional C57Bl6 male mice Charles River L'Arbresle France served as recipient mice and were gavaged with 200 ll of either sterile reduced PBS Conv  PBS or 200 ll at 200 mgml caecum suspension of either eubiotic gut microbiota from lean mice Conv  LM or dysbiotic gut microbiota from HFD-induced obese mice Conv  OMHFD once per week for 2 weeks LM stands for lean microbiota and OM stands for obese microbiota.

Overall none of the transfer significantly affected the general architecture of the ileum Fig 3H.These data show that the transfer of neither HFD- nor lean micro- biota plays a major role in the modulation of intestinal systemicand hepatic inflammation excluding the involvement of these processes in the modulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.Analysis of gut microbiota and microbiome in conventional mice fed a NC and inoculated with either a dysbiotic or eubioticgut microbiotaIn the light of the hepatic phenotype observed above and the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis on the liver Dumas et al 2006 Le Roy et al 2013 we investigated the putative changes of the gut microbiota of recipient mice induced by the transfer.AG u t p erm eabilityBSe ru m L P SG o blet cells c o u n t  ile u m 1.

This suggests that this pathway would not totally account for the gluconeogenesis reduction still observed once inoculated mice were fed a 72 HFD.These data show the divergent impact of the two dysbiotic gut microbiota on both gut microbiota and microbiome on NC and 72 HFD.DiscussionIn this study we report that antibiotic-free conventional mice inocu- lated with a dysbiotic gut microbiota from either HFD-induced or obob obese mice unexpectedly show acute lower hepatic gluconeo- genesis on NC and protection from 72 HFD-increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and adiposity.

The diverse gut microbiota harboured by NOD2 KO mice Mondot et al 2012 Denou et al 2015 may limit the aforementioned reduction in hepatic glucose production induced by the inoculation.In general we observed contrasting results compared to the metabolic impact of eubiotic gut microbiota transfer in metabolic syndrome patients Vrieze et al 2012 and of dysbiotic gut micro- biota in axenic mice Turnbaugh et al 2006.

However Actinobacteria taxon was significantly higher in mice receiving the eubiotic microbiota whereas mice inoculated with dysbiotic microbiota showed higheramount of Firmicutes Fig 4B lower panel The full list for clado- grams in Fig 4 is reported in Appendix Fig S4.With regard to the microbiome analysed by PICRUSt Langille et al 2013 at baseline Basal mice displayed some functional divergences Fig 5A-C in accordance with gut microbiota profiles reported above Fig 4A.

This datum is in strong accordance with the higher metabolic modulation induced by the HFD-microbiota throughout the study.The intragroup microbiome analysis reflected the aforementioned changes in gut microbiota with the HFD-microbiota transfer showing the greater impact Appendix Fig S5D-I the control group and mice inoculated with the lean microbiota showed each some overlap Appendix Fig S5D and F with only three microbial pathways signifi- cantly affected Appendix Fig S5E and G. By contrast mice inoculated with the HFD-microbiota showed a distinct separation Appendix Fig S5H suggesting the greater impact of HFD-microbiota when compared to the lean microbiota.
