However more recent stud- ies indicate that IL-25 can be produced by a great variety of cells including eosinophils basophils mast cells macrophages epithelial cells and Tuft cells among others highlighting its importance as an initiator of Th2 responses.

The activity of IL-4 and IL-13 on the structural cells of the lung such as vascu- lar endothelial cells and airway epithelial cells elicits the expres- sion of adhesion molecules chemokines and transforming growth factor TGF-b production.

Although the critical role of antigen-presenting cell interactions with CD4 T cells in the differentiation of naive T cells into type-2 cytokine-producing cells has long been appreciatednew informa- tion is emerging regarding the complex regulation of DC-T cell interactions that result in Th2 immune responses.

In addition to potential nuclear func- tions IL-33 is released primarily from endothelial and epithelial cells and binds its functional receptor on a variety of cells includ- ing mast cells eosinophils and ILC2s.

As the significance of this effect is currently not known further studies are required to unravel the complexities of the contribution of IL-17 to asthma pathogenesis.IL-31IL-31 is constitutively expressed by non-hematopoietic cells such as the lung epithelium and is also selectively produced by activated CD4 T cells skewed towards Th2 cytokine production.

Fibroblast responses to IL-4 and IL-13 contribute indirectly to the lung remodeling that occurs in chronic asthma by eliciting the production of adhesion molecules and chemokines as well as cytokines that then stimulate epithelial cells to secrete TGF-b1.The eosinophilia observed in asthma and allergic diseases is par- tially controlled by the Th2 cytokine IL-5.

More recent studies show that other cell types such as type-2 innate lymphoid cells ILC2s mast cells and eosinophils also produce these type- 2-associated cytokines.

IL-4 and IL-13 also have direct effects on airway smooth muscle cells that may explain the hypercontractility of these cells in the airways of asthmatics.

Both IL-4 and IL-13 increase DC antigen uptake and cell migration into the lymph nodes where they prime naive T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells.

IL-4 promotes and maintains the polarization of Th2 cells through ligating the type I IL-4R whereas IL-13 has no effect on T cells because of their lack of IL-13Ra1 expression.
