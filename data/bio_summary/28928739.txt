Taken together our data show that REG3g-associated Lactobacillus may enlarge MHCII  F480 macrophage pools not only in the LP but also in the PP and spleen.sTaT3 is involved in Lactobacillus NK318.1-Mediated accumulation of MacrophagesTo found a mechanism for how Lactobacillus causes increased macrophages we first compared the gene expression profiles in the Payer's patch aggregated lymphoid nodules in gut LP in GF miceFigUre 3  STAT3 is activated in the gut immune tissues of lactobacillus NK318.1-colonized GF mice.

Other Lactobacillus such as L. reuteri Lactobacillus gasseri Lactobacillus animalis Lactobacillus rham- nosus and Lactobacillus plantarum did not significantly change and were even decreased in huREG3gtgIEC mice Figure S4C inSupplementary Material.

However it is unclear how gut maintains gut macrophages in anti-inflammatory situation andor how to cause accumula- tion of these macrophages in gut tissues.The mounting evidence indicates importance of gut microbiotaimmune cell interactions in immune homeostasis.

These results suggest that REG3g overexpression in gut epithelial cells may affect the composition of gut microbiota.Alterations of gut microbiota may affect the composition of gut immune cells and immune cell subsets  -.

Thus REG3g-associated Lactobacillus-induced anti-inflammatory macrophages in gut tissues may play a role in adipose tissue homeostasis.Keywords reg3g macrophage sTaT3 Lactobacillus gut microbiotainTrODUcTiOnThe alteration of gut homeostasis is often associated with the onset of metabolic diseases such as obe- sity -.

Notablythis strain of Lactobacillus did not affect immune-associated sign- aling pathways in gut epithelial cells  indicating that Lactobacillus NK318.1-mediated accumulation of macrophages were not through gut epithelial cells.

All of these suggest that Lactobacillus NK318.1 may be a bacterium which may enlarge gut anti-inflammatory macrophage pools.To determine whether anti-inflammatory macrophages are really related to REG3g-associated Lactobacillus NK318.1 we next colonized GF mice with Lactobacillus NK318.1.

Thus it is possible that the gut anti-inflammatory macrophages in gut tissues may be induced by gut microbiota andor their metabolitics.

By using human REG3gtransgenic huREG3gtgIEC mice mice we identify one strain of bacteria named as Lactobacillus NK318.1 which may directly modulate the differentiation of gut macrophages and enlarge gutmacrophage pools not only in gut tissues but also in spleen and adipose tissues.

Thus some gut Lactobacillus strains may be critical in maintaining homeostasis of gut macrophages.
