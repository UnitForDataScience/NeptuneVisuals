a p  0.05 compared with mice fed a control diet c p  0.05 compared with mice fed a control diet treated with antibiotics d p  0.05 compared with mice fed a FFC diet treated with antibiotics.Markers of Lipogenesis in LiverThe expression of SREBP-1c mRNA did not differ between the FFC-fed groups and was markedly higher than in the livers of both control groups p  0.05 for FFC and FFC  AB vs. C  AB and p  0.075 for FFC and p  0.072 for FFC  AB vs. C. The expression of ACC was significantly higher in the livers of FFC- and C  AB-fed mice p  0.05 for both and induced by trend in FFC  AB-fed mice p  0.091 when compared to the controls receiving vehicle.

Indeed the protein levels of ZO-1 were significantly higher in the small intestine of FFC  AB-fed mice when compared with mice only fed the FFC diet p  0.05 for FFC  AB vs. FFC.

In contrast the expression of MyD88 mRNA was significantly higher in the livers of the FFC-fed mice than in the controls p  0.05 while expression of MyD88 mRNA in the livers of the FFC  AB-fed mice did not differ from that of both control groups NS for C vs. FFC  AB and C  AB vs. FFC  AB see Figure .Figure 3.

Our data suggest that the development of early diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice at least in part results from alterations of intestinal barrier function.Keywords steatosis NAFLD antibiotics intestinal permeability microbiotaIntroductionWith a prevalence ranging from 2 to 44 in the general European population and 24 among adults in Northern America non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is claimed to be the most common liver disease in the world by now .

Indeed NAS used to determine liver histology and triglyceride concentrations as well as the number of neutrophils in the liver tissue were all significantly higher in the FFC-fed mice when compared to controls p  0.05 for all parameters when compared to controls see Figure .

As expected portal endotoxin levels and the expression of dependent signaling cascades in liver tissue were almost at the level of controls in FFC  AB-fed mice.

However PAI-1 protein levels were significantly lower in the livers of FFC  AB-fed and C  AB-fed mice when compared to FFC-fed mice while expression of Il-1b in the liver was only significantly lower in the livers of C  AB-fed mice than in FFC-fed animals see Table .
