There was also no difference on the 0.05 significance level between BP25-3 and MIX for both TEER and Papp LY.To assess the epithelial barrier-improving effect of butyrate an extra Caco-2 cell assay was performed where supernatant samples spiked with butyrate all spiked samples contained 2 mM butyrate were compared to non-spiked samples.

During butyrate synthesis butyryl-CoA is converted to butyrate by either butyryl-CoAacetate CoA-transferase using acetate as co-substrate or by butyrate kinase after butyryl-CoA phos- phorylation.

The MIX resulted in significantly higher butyrate levels and lower acetate levels compared to BP treatment in microbiota of quiescent CD 18 h and 42 h and active CD 42 h BP25-3 butyrate.

The former is the dominating route for butyrate production by human colon bacteria and it was shown that the supply of exogenous acetate is important to maintain butyrate production.

Patients with CD active and remission were selected as there is a major shift in their butyrate-producing gut microbial community especially in active CD.Supplementation of butyrate-producing bacteria to fecal microbiota of five active and five remissive CD patients resulted in increased butyrate and decreased acetate levels during the 65 h incubation upon supple- mentation.

Relative concentrations of acetatepropionatebutyrate showed inter-individual differences as well and were on average 632410 range 53-69 acetate 19-33 propionate 8-13 butyrate for active CD and 651813 range 49-79 acetate 12-23 propionate 9-22 butyrate for remissive CD microbiota at the end of incuba- tion.

This was especially the case for treatments FP and MIX which resulted in an average increase of butyrate production of 11 active CD and 5 quiescent CD after 18 h. Treatment with BP resulted in higher butyrate levels only in case of active CD after 18 h BP 25-3 and BP 1.20 and after 42 h BP 1.20.

Also treatment with FP resulted in significantly higher butyrate levels compared to BP treatment in case of microbiota of CD in remission 42 h.Mix of butyrate producers results in highest colonization success.

Probiotic treatment with butyrate-producing bacteria has therapeutic potential since these bacteria are depleted in IBD patients and butyrate has beneficial effects on epithelial barrier function and overall gut health.

An alternative approach could be the consumption of butyrate-producing bacteria to increase the in situ butyrate production.
