treatment with l. reuteri modified the metabolic profile of stressed mice to an intermediate profile suggesting that some of the stress associated metabolic alterations may be a consequence of decreased lactobacillus levels while others may be a direct effect of l. reuteri administration 3eii.

f normalized ms peaks of tryptophan -kynurenine pathway metabolites in the sera of naive stressed and l. reuteri treated stressed mice n 3-5 per group 2-way anova p  0.001 mean-s.e.m..to get an insight into the potential mechanism of lactobacillus-supported resiliency we performed untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples to identify if and how metabolites composition was altered after chronic stress.

moreover several studies have shown that inhibiting ido1 activity such as with the small molecule 1-methyl tryptophan has potent effects in ameliorating depressive-like behaviors both in chronic stress and inflammation-induced sickness behavior models.the inhibition of ido1 by lactobacillus-derived ros is likely just one of the mechanisms through which lactobacilli and l. reuteri in particular contribute to host physiology and modulate behavior.

h2o2 summarized in 4a.to further explore this question in our study we verified that cultured l. reuteri produced a significant amount of h2o2 in vitro when compared to e.coli a negative control that does not produce h2o2  t4  208.2 p  0.0001. in addition we also compared the ros production from l. reuteri with that of endogenous lactobacillus in jackson c57bl6 mice l. johnsonii and observed they were comparable and sup.

further studies will be able to determine whether there is indeed a causal relationship between increased intestinal motility and microbiota alteration in the context of stress or rather if the dysbiosis induced during stress causes altered intestinal physiology.we found that the level of kynurenine is increased after chronic stress in a manner dependent on lactobacillus levels.

to determine whether chronic stress can directly affect the microbiota we chose the unpredictable chronic mild stress ucms model to induce despair behavior.

we next measured peroxide levels in the fecal contents of the stressed mice and discovered that h2o2 levels were decreased in the stressed mice more importantly and in agreement with our hypothesis therapeutic administration of l. reuteri significantly raised the level of h2o2 in vivo f2 25 9.907 p  0.0007 4d.
