The samples were obtained from mice without TAI with TAI or treated with miR-34a-5p antagomir following TAI individually.

The samples were obtained from mice without TAI with TAI or treated with miR-34a-5p antagomir following TAI individually.

The observed species and Shannon index analysis showed none significant alteration of gut microbiota in mice after TAI exposure A C however miR-34a-5p antagomir injection changed the enteric bacterial composition at day 3 post irradiation B D. As the genus level top 10 harbored bacteria in irradiated mice with or without miR-34a-5p antagomir injection was different E F. In detail TAI decrease the frequency of Helicobacter and unchanged that of Lactobacillus E Supplementary Fig.

Inter- estingly the hippocampal miR-34a-5p level was about 2.5-fold higher in TAI-challenged mice than those of healthy controls D and appeared to be inversely correlated with the hippocampal expression of Bdnf mRNA E. The decrease of hippocampal Bdnf mRNA and protein expression in TAI-challenged mice was further validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting analyses F G. ELISA and qRT- PCR analyses exhibited that irradiated mice carried higher levels ofTo further elaborate the role of miR-34a-5p in TAI-induced cogni- tive deficits we intravenously injected miR-34a-5p antagomir im- mediately following TAI.

MWM test showed that the escape la- tency to find the platform was continuously lessened from day 1 to day 5 of training for all cohorts H however the mice carried gutmicrobes from donors with TAI exposure spent less sequestered time in the target quadrant comparing with that of control and mice trans- planted gut microbes from irradiated mice with miR-34a-5p antagomir injection I suggesting that gut microbiota might be involved in TAI-impaired cognitive function.DiscussionAs a popular cancer therapeutic approach radiotherapy kills both cancer cells and bystander normal cells thereby remarkably affecting the integrity and function of healthy tissues .

TAI exposure causes up-regulation of miR- 34a-5p and parallel down-regulation of Bdnf.Microarray analysis was performed using small intestine tissues from mice with or without TAI.
