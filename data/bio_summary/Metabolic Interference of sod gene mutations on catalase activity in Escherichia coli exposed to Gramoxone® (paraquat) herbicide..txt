The isoenzyme CuZn-SOD despite its increased activity in response to Gramoxoner in the wt strain had no detectable activity in both mutant strains probably because metal cofactors can interfere in SOD activity regulation.High levels of growth in the presence of Gramoxoner were observed in all studied strains.

In addition the activity of both isoenzymes decreased at 9 h particularly after Gramoxoner exposure.Results in show that CAT activity in the wt strain was greater after 5 h of growth without herbicide exposure than with exposure to Gramoxoner as observed by the band intensity.

In addition the intensity of the band corresponding to HPI was lower after 9 h of growth than after 5 h. However after Gramoxoner exposure despite a band intensity similar to that of the 5 h control there was increased activity at 9 h .

The variation in the activity of Fe-SOD was less pronounced than that of Mn-SOD  and this result agrees with the fact that sodB expression is constitutive and the oxidative stress indices evaluated H2O2  MDA  and cell viability  were similar in the strains DsodA and wt strains.The loss of CuZn-SOD activity in the DsodA and DsodB strains is noteworthy .

This isoenzyme does not respond specifically to Gramoxoner perhaps because it presents a H2O2 feedback inactivation.There was no significant difference p  0.095 to p  1.000 in H2O2 levels between control and Gramoxoner so the increase of H2O2  level and CAT activity at 9 h can be considered normal for a cell in an aerobic growth.

Probably this isoform without feedback inactivation produces high levels of H2O2  and thereby inducing CAT activity as early as 5 h. With the increase in SOD activity of this isoform there is a decrease of CAT activity at 9 h  .

However after Gramoxoner exposure despite a band intensity similar to that of the 5 h control there was increased activity at 9 h demonstrating a response to herbicide toxicity .

Statistical analyses were performed withStata 12 software using factor analysis and the ANOVA test for comparisons between strains treatments and growth periods and using the Bonferroni's correction for the analysis of H2O2 MDA and cell viability.Results and discussionCharacterization of herbicides as stress factors for E. coli K-12Influence of Gramoxoner on bacterial growthIn the present study growth rate H2O2 generation lipid peroxida- tion and cell viability were used to analyze ROS damage to E. coli K-12 caused by paraquat Gramoxoner.

The CuZn-SOD isoform despite its increased activity in response to Gramoxoner  it disappears in the mutant strains probably because of the sharing of same regulatory sequences  and its secondary role in controlling oxidative stress  .

The excess of H2O2 has to be controlled by the increase in CAT activity .In contrast in the DsodB strain there was a major reversal in theCAT activity pattern between 5 and 9 h compared with the other strains examined .
