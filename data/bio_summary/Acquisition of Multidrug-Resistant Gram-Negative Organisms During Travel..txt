herein we review information related to the acquisition of mdros among travelers including deployed personnel as well as potential infectious complications involving wound infections uti pneumonia and travelers' diarrhea.acquisition of mdrosinternational travelinternational travelers particularly those journeying to devel- oping countries may acquire mdros through contact with local food water or individuals as well as antimicrobial pres- sure.2930 a recent study even evaluated the potential role of international airport bathroom door handles in the spread of mdros.31 multiple studies have attempted to clarify these risk factors and show a range of risk factors acquisition rates and duration of carriage.a meta-analysis examined data from 11 prospective cohort studies related to travel and acquisition of multidrug-resistant mdr enterobacteriaceae.29 before travel 1 to 12 of par- ticipants had mdr enterobacteriaceae fecal carriage whereas it ranged from 21 to 51 after travel.

approximately 34 of initially esbl nega- tive travelers acquired esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae during travel with the highest proportion among those who traveled to southern asia incidence of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae of 7.2 per 100 person-days of travel 95 ci 5.9-8.6. independent predictors for esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae acquisition were antibiotic use during travel pre-existing bowel disease occurrence of travelers' diarrhea during travel and immediately after travel and having a meal at street food stalls during travel.

in particular a well-recognized complication is urinary tract infections utis whereas mdr wound infections pneumonia and travelers' diarrhea are also potential outcomes relevant to military health.introductionthe rising frequency of multidrug-resistant organisms mdros worldwide has created challenges for both civilian and military populations.1-9 specifically whether it is treatment for endemic infections or infections complicating nonbattle or battle injuries mdro colonization may negatively affect the patient care of deployed military personnel.

use of b-lactam antibiotics during travel diarrheal episodes being part of an organized tour and visiting either sub-saharan africa or asia were independently associated with mdr enterobacteriaceae acquisition.36 another study found that the proportion of mdr enterobacteriaceae rectal colonization among travelers increased from 8.6 pretravel to 30.5 post-travel.

these regional differences in local antimicrobial resistance rates have been attributed to a wide array of selection pressures including overprescription of antimicrobials in both humans and animals whether veterinary medicine or in growth promotion in animal husbandry and not limited to developing nations.3233six months after return 6 to 24 of travelers retained mdr enterobacteriaceae fecal carriage with travelers to asia maintaining a longer period of fecal carriage than other destinations.

risk factors associated with extended-spectrum b-lactamase esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae acquisi- tion were also assessed in the meta-analysis.29 in particular kantele et al34 found that having an episode of travelers' diarrhea odds ratio 31.0 95 confidence interval ci 2.7-358.1 and use of antibiotics for travelers' diarrhea odds ratio 3.0 95 ci 1.4-6.7 were significantly associ- ated with esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae acquisition.

among returning travelers with esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae 20 retained fecal carriage 6 months after their return.27 travel to north america along with africa and asia has also been associ- ated with acquisition of fecal carriage of esbl-producing enterobactericaeae.37 a recent multicenter study the carriage of multiresistant bacteria after travel combat study examined 2001 dutch travelers and 215 nontravelling house- hold members.

among those who had traveled internationally within 6 months before icu admission 33 were colonized with mdros at admission compared to 6.7 of patients without travel history  p  0.001. further- more 17 of recent travelers were noted to have mdro carriage after icu admission compared to 5 of non- travelers  p  0.001.39 another analysis examining hospital admissions found individuals who traveled internationally within a year had a 10-fold higher rate of mdr gram-negative bacilli carriage primarily esbl-producing e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae compared to nontravelers.40a limited survey examined microbiological colonization of active duty personnel or department of defense beneficiaries who traveled internationally e.g.

one study of international travelers that evaluated gram-positive resistance revealed no evidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus colonization pre- or post-travel within a small cohort of healthy military travelers.41 however the international spread of genetically related mdr gram-positive organisms has been increasingly recognized with advancements in molecular typing as seen with the international spread of the 23f streptococcus pneumoniae serotype originating in spain methicillin-resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.42-45military deploymentdeployed military personnel share many of the same risks as international travelers related to mdro acquisition e.g.

afghanistan isolates 49 susceptible to ampicillin versus 72 of u.s. isolates p  0.01. as there was no significant difference in colonization rates among the deployed military personnel related to their amount of time off-base the source of mdro exposure is unclear.48 as noted earlier with inter- national travelers more data are needed to evaluate the risk of mdr gram-positive colonization within deployed per- sonnel.

among in-theater hospitalization diag- noses the highest proportion was related to battle injury 36 in oef and 21 in oifond respectively followed by nonbattle injury 18 and 19 respectively and diges- tive disorders 11 and 15 respectively.10although battlefield mortality notably declined during oef and oifond an increased proportion of trauma-related infections among combat casualties were observed as a result of the extensive injury severity associated with improvised explosive devices.11-13 these problematic infections had high rates of corresponding morbidity and mortality14-19 and were further complicated by occurrence of multiple pathogens vir- ulent organisms and multidrug resistance.2182021 in additiondeputy medical corps chief medical corps specific branch propo- nent office infectious disease consultant to the army surgeon general brooke army medical center jbsa fort sam houston tx 78234.infectious disease service san antonio military medical center jbsa fort sam houston tx 78234.the views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of brooke army medical center theu.s.

as a result of the increase in mdr colonization and infections isolated from wounded military personnel infection control practices were implemented including active surveillance cultures at hospital admission and preemptive contact isolation of patients.47 during the wars in iraq and afghanistan injury severity was high among com- bat casualties.1819 patients often needed large-volume blood transfusions and sustained traumatic amputations resulting in an immunocompromised state and potential for opportu- nistic infections with mdros.
