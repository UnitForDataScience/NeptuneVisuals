Herein we review information related to the acquisition of MDROs among travelers including deployed personnel as well as potential infectious complications involving wound infections UTI pneumonia and travelers' diarrhea.ACQUISITION OF MDROsInternational TravelInternational travelers particularly those journeying to devel- oping countries may acquire MDROs through contact with local food water or individuals as well as antimicrobial pres- sure.2930 A recent study even evaluated the potential role of international airport bathroom door handles in the spread of MDROs.31 Multiple studies have attempted to clarify these risk factors and show a range of risk factors acquisition rates and duration of carriage.A meta-analysis examined data from 11 prospective cohort studies related to travel and acquisition of multidrug-resistant MDR Enterobacteriaceae.29 Before travel 1 to 12 of par- ticipants had MDR Enterobacteriaceae fecal carriage whereas it ranged from 21 to 51 after travel.

Independent predictors for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae acquisition were antibiotic use during travel pre-existing bowel disease occurrence of travelers' diarrhea during travel and immediately after travel and having a meal at street food stalls during travel.

In particular a well-recognized complication is urinary tract infections UTIs whereas MDR wound infections pneumonia and travelers' diarrhea are also potential outcomes relevant to military health.INTRODUCTIONThe rising frequency of multidrug-resistant organisms MDROs worldwide has created challenges for both civilian and military populations.1-9 Specifically whether it is treatment for endemic infections or infections complicating nonbattle or battle injuries MDRO colonization may negatively affect the patient care of deployed military personnel.

Approximately 34 of initially ESBL nega- tive travelers acquired ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae during travel with the highest proportion among those who traveled to southern Asia incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae of 7.2 per 100 person-days of travel 95 CI 5.9-8.6.

ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae associated UTIs are increasing among civilians in multiple countries includ- ing the United States54-57 however there is the potential that the risk may be additive and relative to increasing rates of community-associated ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.Regarding travelers' diarrhea among deployed military personnel as job performance has been shown to decline with onset of diarrheal symptoms early antibiotic treatment is recommended to mitigate the impact on operational readi- ness.71 Nevertheless a factor to consider is that use of empiric antibiotics to treat travelers' diarrhea may be con- tributing to the increase of antimicrobial resistance among enteric pathogens.72 Susceptibility levels of enteropathogens to previously preferred first-line antibiotics have decreased rendering them less active or ineffective at treating travelers' diarrhea e.g.

Use of b-lactam antibiotics during travel diarrheal episodes being part of an organized tour and visiting either sub-Saharan Africa or Asia were independently associated with MDR Enterobacteriaceae acquisition.36 Another study found that the proportion of MDR Enterobacteriaceae rectal colonization among travelers increased from 8.6 pretravel to 30.5 post-travel.

Of note there remains some controversy regarding applicability of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints which are determined by achievable serum levels for antimicrobials such as rifaximin which are concentrated in the intestine.68Among isolates collected from individuals returning to the United Kingdom after foreign travel 44.4 61.1 84.4 and 81.1 of MDR E. coli isolates were resistant to azithromycin ciprofloxacin co-trimoxazole and doxycycline respectively whereas 93.3 and 92.2 remained susceptible to rifaximin and rifamycin respectively.69 Increased anti- microbial resistance has also been shown in E. coli isolates collected from travelers to North Africa who had a diarrheal episode.

These regional differences in local antimicrobial resistance rates have been attributed to a wide array of selection pressures including overprescription of antimicrobials in both humans and animals whether veterinary medicine or in growth promotion in animal husbandry and not limited to developing nations.3233Six months after return 6 to 24 of travelers retained MDR Enterobacteriaceae fecal carriage with travelers to Asia maintaining a longer period of fecal carriage than other destinations.
