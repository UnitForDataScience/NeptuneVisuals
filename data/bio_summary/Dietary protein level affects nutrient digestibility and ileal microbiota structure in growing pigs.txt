Low-protein diets had no effect on intestinal micro- bial counts but help maintain enteric health in pigs by lowering toxic microbial metabolites such as ammonia Nyachoti et al.

Crystalline amino acids AA were supple- mented to ensure that the diets provided a similar amount of standard ileum digestibility SID of essential AA EAA to meet requirements for pigs recommended by the National Research Council NRC 2012.

The concentrations of formate and acetate in ileal digesta were higher in pigs fed the diet with 14 CP than those fed diets with 16 or 18 CP P  0.01.

In con- trast the concentration of propionate in the ileal digesta was higher in pigs fed the diet with 18 CP than those fed diets with 14 or 16 CP content P  0.02.

Calculated microbial diversity indexes of the samples are shown in Figure 1C and D. The Chao1 and Shannon indexes indicated that species richness and species diversity were higher in pigs fed the 16 CP diet than those fed diets with 14 or 18 CP.Taxonomy-based comparisons of gut microbiota at phylum and genus levels among dietary treatmentsIn order to assess the variance among the three groups as well as between the biological replicates within each group principal component analysis PCA was performed for all microbiota identified in the ileal digesta Fig.

Pigs fed low-protein diets in the current study had a higher CTTAD for DM than those fed control diet which may have resulted from the differences of starch and ether extract content among experimental diets Le Bellego et al.

Dif- ferent CP contents and similar CTTAD for CP among treatments revealed that a smaller quantity of indi- gestible CP was consumed by pigs fed low-protein diets which could inhibit the proliferation of patho- genic bacteria and benefit gut health Ball  Aherne 1987.

This may be responsible for the increase of the CTTAD for GE in pigs fed low-protein diets.
