As dietary protein level reduced the CTTAD of most non-essential AA NEAA and two EAA arginine and histidine decreased linearly which indicating that further reduction of dietary protein would lead to lack of nitrogen for maintaining protein retention Gloaguen et al.

Moderate reduction of protein intake can benefit gut health by enhancing the gut microbial fermentation and SCFA formation.Key words dietary protein level ileal microbiota structure nutrient digestibility pig SCFA.INTRODUCTIONIn recent years gut microbiota have gained a grow- ing interest as an environmental factor that may affect nutrient absorption and intestinal health Portune et al.

Pigs were randomly allotted to one of three dietary treatments of corn-soybean meal contained 14 16 or 18 crude protein CP.

In particular at the phylum level the relative abundance of Tenericutes in ileal digesta decreased as the dietary protein content reduced while that of cyanobacteria increased.

In conclusion ileal microbiota structure was changed by dietary protein content.

Diets containing high content of protein resulted in a significant decrease in fecal cancer- protective metabolites and increased concentrations of hazardous metabolites Hughes et al.

An effective strategy to solve this problem is to limit dietary protein levels which can improve gastroin- testinal health and function and thus contribute to the overall health of humans and other animals.
