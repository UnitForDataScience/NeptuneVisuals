dif- ferent cp contents and similar cttad for cp among treatments revealed that a smaller quantity of indi- gestible cp was consumed by pigs fed low-protein diets which could inhibit the proliferation of patho- genic bacteria and benefit gut health ball  aherne 1987. this may be responsible for the increase of the cttad for ge in pigs fed low-protein diets.

2013. pigs fed low-protein diets in the current study had a higher cttad for dm than those fed control diet which may have resulted from the differences of starch and ether extract content among experimental diets le bellego et al.

2008. in the pre- sent study pigs fed low-protein diets had higher con- centrations of formate acetate butyrate and total scfa which mainly resulted from an increased amount of digestible carbohydrates in low-protein diets.significant interaction was demonstrated between gut microbiota and dietary protein metabolism portune et al.
