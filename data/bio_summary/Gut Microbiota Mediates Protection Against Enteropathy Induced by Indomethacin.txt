Eradication of gut microbiota in indomethacin treated mice caused a worse prognosis.a Experimental scheme shows after indomethacin treated for 24 hours antibiotic cocktail or sterile water was administered IND indomethacin b The survival rate was recorded daily and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis every number besides the dot means the survived mice number c Faecal weight Left and body weight right were recorded daily also every dot represents the mean faecal weight or body weight ofsurvived mice error bars represent SEM repeated two-way ANOVA was used d In the experimental design samples were collected 24 h after 3-day course of antibiotic cocktail or sterile water treatment 12IND means5 mgkg indomethacin e Representative pictures for injury area arrows 5 mice in each group at beginning one in antibiotics treated group died on Day 2 and injury area percentage data every dot represents one mouse f Every dot represents the mean of stool haemoglobin concentration right body weight middle and faecal weight left of each group the error bars represent SEM repeated two-way ANOVA was used n 7 for each group g PCR-based quantification of total faecal bacteria burden and mucosal bacteria burden every dot represents one mouse C.F.U colony forming units h HE pictures show the histological changes during recovery the bottom graph shows real-time PCR analysis of tight junction genes in the small bowel ZO1tight junction protein 1 Cldn1 claudin 1 Ocln occludin Cdh1 cadherin n 7 for each group.

Therefore the same antibiotics by eradicating gut micro- biota made different effects on mice when given before or after indomethacin may indicate that the role of gut microbiota was changed after indomethacin treatment.Indomethacin treatment induced adaptive changes in gut microbiota.

In our experiments we studied how the dynamic changed gut microbiota could influence pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced enteropathy.ResultsAntibiotic depletion of gut microbiota resulted in an increased mortality in indomethacin treated mice.

Though a previous study showed a different gut microbial alteration after indomethacin treatment in mice the present study differs by employing 16S rRNA sequencing on serial samples from the same mouse reducing individual variations to visualize the gut microbial alteration.

These data suggest divergent roles of gut microbiota before and after indomethacin treatment and signify that compositional difference in microbiota may arise after different antibiotic choice and timing to result in varying clinical phenotypes.Antibiotics alone such as penicillin G erythromycin and metronidazole can induce a low grade inflamma- tion in gut after a long time treatment.

Our data provide a strong support for beneficial changes in gut microbiota during the disease development.Here we demonstrated that indomethacin-induced enteropathy is accompanied with alteration in the gut microbiota and the latter in turn attenuate the indomethacin toxicity.

Consistently the expression of factors involved in the recognition of bacteria TLR4 TLR5 and immune response to bacteria TNF-a IL-1b NF-kB and differential markers of macrophage epithelial cell Paneth cell and antimicrobial peptide showed no significant changes in the small bowel of mice after being transplanted with the adaptively changed microbiota .Adaptive changes in gut microbiota protect mice against subsequent indomethacin-induced small bowel injury.

Indomethacin induced microbial alteration did not damage the normal small bowel mucosae.a Experimental scheme IND indomethacin b Body weight and 24 h faecal weight records are shown as mean and SEM c PCR-based quantification of total bacterial burden and relative levels of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes 16S rRNA in small bowel mucosae every dot represents one mouse C.F.U colony forming unitsThe mucus barrier was assessed by mRNA levels of MUC1 MUC2 MUC5 and goblet cells were stained with Alcian blue solution and quantified every dot represents one mouse mean and SD are shownBacterial receptors as TLR4 and TLR5 and inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a IL-1b were detected with real-time PCR NF-kB p65 binding activity and Protein level were checked by ELISA and Western blot with nuclear protein f The immune response factors as macrophage epithelial cells Paneth cell and defensin were detected with differential markers by real-time PCR.

We studied the dynamicchanges in gut microbiota following indomethacin administration in mice and investigated the effects of these adaptive changes on subsequent NSAID-induced enteropathy.
