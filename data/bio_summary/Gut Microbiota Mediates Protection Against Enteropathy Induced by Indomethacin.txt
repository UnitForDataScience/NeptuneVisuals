therefore the same antibiotics by eradicating gut micro- biota made different effects on mice when given before or after indomethacin may indicate that the role of gut microbiota was changed after indomethacin treatment.indomethacin treatment induced adaptive changes in gut microbiota.

in our experiments we studied how the dynamic changed gut microbiota could influence pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced enteropathy.resultsantibiotic depletion of gut microbiota resulted in an increased mortality in indomethacin treated mice.

though a previous study showed a different gut microbial alteration after indomethacin treatment in mice the present study differs by employing 16s rrna sequencing on serial samples from the same mouse reducing individual variations to visualize the gut microbial alteration.

these data suggest divergent roles of gut microbiota before and after indomethacin treatment and signify that compositional difference in microbiota may arise after different antibiotic choice and timing to result in varying clinical phenotypes.antibiotics alone such as penicillin g erythromycin and metronidazole can induce a low grade inflamma- tion in gut after a long time treatment.

our data provide a strong support for beneficial changes in gut microbiota during the disease development.here we demonstrated that indomethacin-induced enteropathy is accompanied with alteration in the gut microbiota and the latter in turn attenuate the indomethacin toxicity.

a gut microbiota depletion model mice were pre-treated with 3-day course of antibiotics faecal transplantation and indomethacin were then given as before b sterile faeces faecal transplantation model bacteria were filtered with a 0.2 mm filter then faecal transplantation and indomethacin were given.

consistently the expression of factors involved in the recognition of bacteria tlr4 tlr5 and immune response to bacteria tnf-a il-1b nf-kb and differential markers of macrophage epithelial cell paneth cell and antimicrobial peptide showed no significant changes in the small bowel of mice after being transplanted with the adaptively changed microbiota .adaptive changes in gut microbiota protect mice against subsequent indomethacin-induced small bowel injury.

we studied the dynamicchanges in gut microbiota following indomethacin administration in mice and investigated the effects of these adaptive changes on subsequent nsaid-induced enteropathy.

after indomethacin treatment significant adaptive changes in gut microbiota were observed including increased abundance of firmicutes and decreased abundance in that of bacteroidetes.

in summary this study identifies adaptive changes in the gut microbiota upon indomethacin administration which can in turn ameliorate further nsaid-induced injury.

we studied the gut micro- bial changes after indomethacin treatment.

after 2 days of indomethacin treatment we observed a distinct change in gut microbiota p  0.003 from principal component analysis 2ab characterized by a decreased propor- tion of bacteroidetes 69 to 56 including porphyrominadaceae bacteroidaceae prevotellaceae rikenellaceae s24-7 and an increased proportion of firmicutes 18 to 25 including ruminoccaceae and lachnospiraceae.
