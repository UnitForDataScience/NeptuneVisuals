In addition taxa from the phylum Chloroflexi andTABLE 1 Mean relative abundance -SD of the speciesphylotypes found in greatest abundance 0.2 in the samples and that differed significantly between chronic periodontitis ChP and periodontal health PH between shallow sites of PH and shallow sites of ChP and among the three probing depth categories in ChP subjectsThe Mann-Whitney MW test was used to determine the significance of differences between ChP and PH groups MW p-value and between shallow sites of PH and shallow sites of ChP  p.05.The significance of differences among different probing depth categories in ChP subjects was determined using Friedman test Friedman p-value.

Two clusters were identified one upper comprising 19 taxa that were in high relative abundance in ChP mostly in deep and moderate sites but also in a few shallow- ChP sites and a second one lower composed by 11 taxa present in high relative abundance mainly in PH and shallow- ChP sites.The comparison between ChP and PH for the relative abundance of the phyla detected is presented in Figure 2.

Interestingly when hierarchical clustering was performed with the OTUs presenting the greatest variance in mean relative abundance between samples the samples were grouped into two main clusters one from PH and shallow-ChP sites and the other from moderate and deep-ChP sites Figure 1.Our data suggested that Spirochaetes phylum and Fusobacterium genus and other taxa not traditionally associated with periodontitis such as the Chloroflexi phylum might be implicated in the initial dys- biosis process associated with periodontal destruction because these taxa were in relative higher abundance in shallow sites of ChP subjectsthan in shallow sites of PH subjects.

Furthermore Spirochaetes and Chloroflexi abundance were higher in shallow-ChP sites than in PH sites p  .05.Figure 4 presents the relative abundance of the 44 genera that differed significantly between ChP and PH p  .05.

In addition Mitsuokella Mogibacterium Peptococcus Pseudoramibacter ChloroflexiG-1 PeptostreptococcaceaeG-3 and VeillonellaceaeG-11 p  .05 were also in higher abundance in shallow-ChP sites than in PH sites p  .05 data not shown.The speciesphylotypes found in greatest abundance 0.2 and that differed significantly between different PD categories and between PH and ChP all sites are presented in Table 1.

Conversely other genera Streptococcus Corynebacterium Cardiobacterium Rothia Capnocytophaga and Veillonella decreased in abundance as the pocket got deeper in ChP subjects.At species-level phylotypes Corynebacterium durum Corynebacterium matruchotii unclassified Neisseria and Streptococcus showed a strong association with periodontal health as their relative abundance was higher in PH than in ChP subjects and in shallow than in moderatedeep sites of the diseased subjects.

The rela- tive abundance of five speciesphylotypes was significantly higher in PH than in ChP while the relative abundance of 31 speciesFIGURE 3 Relative abundance of phyla in the different probing depth categories.

Interestingly in the current study the classical periodontal pathogen T. forsythia and F. alocis increased in abundance from the PH sites of healthy subjects to the shallow moderate and deep-ChPFIGURE 5 Relative abundance of the genera that differed significantly among different probing depth categories.Different letters a b represent significant differences between different probing depth categories Friedman test p  .05.

HOT167 and an unclassified Fusobacterium were higher while unclassified species of Streptococcus Granulicatella and Prevotella were lower in shallow-ChP than in PH p  .05.Overall the community-type pairwise analysis showed a positive correlation between the pairs of species associated with PH or ChP while the co-occurrence seen between health-associated species and periodontitis-associated species was very weak Figure 6.4  DISCUSSION Our results suggested striking differences between the structure of the subgingival communities between moderatedeep and shallow sites of subjects with ChP as well as between PH and ChP.

To identify OTUs at species level with the greatest variance in relative abundance be- tween groups and their co-occurrence in ChP or PH a heatmap and hierarchical clustering with the 30 OTUs presenting the greatest variance in relative abundance log2 transformed counts were done.
