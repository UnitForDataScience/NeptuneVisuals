Chest CT scans were scored by consensus between two experienced consultant radiologists using a Bhalla scoring system.Sputum TestingAdult patients produced a sputum sample at baseline when clinically stable before commencing ivacaftor treatment and at clinic review every 3 months after ivacaftor treatment when the patients were able to expectorate.Blood SamplesBlood samples were collected from all patients in bottles containing sodium citrate with the plasma layer separated and stored at -80oC.

Whether the reduction seen in our study is solely due to a decrease in pulmonary exacerbations observed in our cohort or augmented by potential changes in immune function postrestoration of CFTR function remains to be evaluated given that studies have demonstrated improved neutrophil function after ivacaftor therapy.Given the sustained improvements in chest CT images observed from 3 months after commencement of ivacaftor treatment in particular improved mucous plugging and peribronchial thickening we suggest that enhanced mucus clearance is a key mechanism underlying the increase in lung function and reduction in pulmonary exacerbations observed in patients treated with ivacaftor.

Eight children were too young to receive ivacaftor six patients had already commenced ivacaftor either as part of a clinical trial or on a named patient compassionate use basis two patients were post-lung transplantation and three were undecided as to whether they wished to start treatment.

The growing awareness that patients with CF are at increased risk of certain neoplasms supports using low-dose CT scanning to reduce this risk.There was no statistically significant change in bronchiectasis on chest CT scans after ivacaftor therapy in contrast to a previous smaller study that included adults and children.Our study supports the finding that in established lung damage bronchiectasis is not reversible with CFTR modulatory therapy.

This real-world finding is consistent with the results from a group of patients in the clinical trials that demonstrated a significant reduction in the circulating neutrophil count as well as IL-8 CRP and IgG levels after 24 weeks of treatment.That said another real-world cohort failed to demonstrate a significant change in sputum cytokine levels in patients with CF treated with ivacaftor.

We assessed the effect of ivacaftor using low-dose chest CT imaging.Microbiology studies have suggested subtle changes in the lung microbiome after commencement of ivacaftor thus we assessed the lung microbiota after treatment.

We hypothesized that CFTR modulatory therapy may result in improvement in low-dose chest CT scans circulating inflammatory mediators and changes in the lung microbiota.MethodsAll patients with CF aged 6 years or older with at least one copy of the G551D mutation attending Cork CF Centre began ivacaftor treatment after March 2013 and were followed prospectively for a mean follow- up of 12 months.

All eligible patients received the drug as it was funded by the state and not dependant on health insurance status.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates sustained improvement after ivacaftor treatment across multiple modalities of assessment including multiple clinical parameters ultra-low-dose chest CT imaging blood inflammatory markers and the lung microbiome.

A small study using standard CT imaging protocols before and after 1 year of ivacaftor treatment demonstrated improvement.Low-dose CT scanning has not been used prospectively to evaluate treatment effect.

Changes in other domains of the CFQ-R can be found in e-Tables 1 and 2.Radiological FindingsEighteen adults had low-dose chest CT scanning performed before ivacaftor treatment and after 3 6 and 12 months of treatment with CT findings summarized in .
