These OTUs were then sorted into four groups i OTUs dominant in both Harding and Byron worm samples designated as core OTUs ii OTUs dominant in Harding worm samples onlyiii OTUs dominant in Byron worm samples only iv other dominant OTUs which did not fit into groups i to iii but were included in the 10 most abundant OTUs see the legend to Fig.

The other core OTUs were frequently and abundantly detected in both ice worm and glacier surface samples.The majority of OTUs that were only dominant in either the Harding or Byron worm samples were also abundantly recovered from their corresponding habitat glacier surface samples but were less abundantly detected in the other glacier surface samples Fig.

Core OTUs OTUs accounting for 0.1 of sequences in five or six of the Harding worm samples and also in nine or more of the Byron worm samples including DNA and RNA samples.

Among these bacteria enriched in ice worm samples Mollicutes Arcicella and Herminiimonas phylotypes were abundantly and consistently detected in the ice worm samples these phylotypes constituted the core microbiota associated with the ice worm.

The mean number with SD of the observed OTUs in each sam- ple category was as follows 79-16 Harding worm DNA 546-350 Harding worm RNA 101-44 Byron worm DNA 1105-583 Byron worm RNA 230-160 Harding surface DNA 757-297 Harding surface RNA 116-30 Byron surface DNA and 810-274 Byron surface RNA.

Thus the observed number of OTUs as well as the Chao1 species richness estimate and reciprocal Simpson's diversity index were higher in RNA samples than in DNA samples in any of the worm or glacier surface samples Table S1.

In addition to these dominant OTUs several less abundant OTUs such as three Rickettsiales OTUs OTU21806 OTU13604 and OTU21100 were almost exclusively detected in ice worm samples Fig.

Much OTUs in RNA samples Table S1 may be attributable to the higher activity of minor OTUs which were concealed behind several pre- dominant OTUs in DNA samples Fig.

Entomoplasmatales OTU23265 and Arcicella OTU19485 contributed to the grouping of Byron worm samples and the Harding worm-specific Lachnospiraceae OTU742 correlated with the grouping of Harding worm samples.

Since algal cells are one of the main food sources of ice worms 17 27 Lachnospiraceae members may play an important role in the digestion of algal polysaccharides in the ice worm gut.Several Rickettsiales and Parachlamydiaceae OTUs were also almost exclusively detected in the ice worm samples.
