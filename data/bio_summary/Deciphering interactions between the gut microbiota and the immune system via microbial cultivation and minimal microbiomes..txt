more recent work successfully established a gnotobiotic mouse model colonized with a minimal bacterial consortium producing secondary bile acids180181 however the strains are also not readily available and the impact on immune responses was not investigated.5  conclusions and outlook work in the 1960s first demonstrated the important influence of gut microorganisms on mouse phenotypes.182 today there is a renewed interest in understanding the impact of changes in microbiota com- position eg due to animal housing on immune responses.65183 it is therefore of utmost importance to dissect the effects of specific gut bacteria on the host so we can identify the microbe-host interaction networks that shape the immune system with the ultimate goal of manipulating these interactions for positive health outcomes.

these taxa represent a considerable pool of novel functions some of which may have a profound impact upon the immune system.this review compiles knowledge about the regulation of immune responses by specific members of the gut microbiota with primary focus on studies using cultured microbes as single strains or minimal consortia to investigate specific interactions at local gut mucosal im- mune system and distant body sites.

indeed deple- tion of gut microbes in conventional mice via antibiotic treatment significantly impacts the immune system--it reduces spleen size decreases immune cell numbers and alters expression of genes reg- ulating inflammatory responses and production of antimicrobial fac- tors such that these animals more closely resemble germfree mice than those with a conventional microbiota.2627 cultivation of gut microbes represents an important technique for studying the rela- tionship between this complex ecosystem and its host.

the asf community has been reviewed recently in detail115 and we have listed key studies pertaining to asf-induced immune responses in table 2. although major immune parameters are normalized in asf mice such that they closely resemble their conventionally raised counterparts the limited number of strains in the asf community and the primary rationale for their selection to standardize mouse models prior to in- troduction into barrier production and limit colonization by enteric pathogens explain why not all microbial and host-derived functions are present in asf-bearing mice including th17 cell maturation numbers of iga plasmablasts and the expression of regiii-g.115 the sihumi microbiota represents another consortium of eight strains originating this time from the human gut which harbors metabolic functions not described in asf mice such as mucin or bilirubin conversion.116117 sihumi has been utilized in mouse models of colitis where inflamma- tory scores were mirrored by the production of ifn-g il12-p40 andil-17 by colonic tissue explants and by mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated with lysates from members of the sihumi community118 however additional sihumi-induced effects on the immune system have otherwise not been described.the low complexity of asf and sihumi makes them versatile systems appropriate for testing the impact of colonization by addi- tional strains.

in contrast the major advantage of culti- vation approaches is the ability to characterize microorganisms in great detail perform downstream functional studies and identify specific microbial bioactive compounds and their effects on target cells.30 contratry to frequent introductory statements in the litera- ture that only minor fractions of the mammalian gut microbiota can be cultured cultivation techniques can indeed capture a substantial amount of the bacterial diversity present in the mammalian gut a comparison of thousands of high-throughput amplicon datasets with a catalog of reference sequences from isolates revealed that 35 to 65 of microbial species in the human and mouse gut have repre- sentative strains in culture.31 nonetheless there are still numerousunknown taxa to be discovered.

the latter shortage has been at least ameliorated by recent projects focused on the cultivation of mammalian gut bacteria and the discovery of novel taxa123-125 including our own work that cataloged bacterial strains from the mouse intestine.126 this resource has already been used successfully for the generation of a modular minimal consortium re- ferred to as oligo-mm oligo-mouse microbiota which conferred col- onization resistance against the enteric pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.127 the oligo-mm model opens new avenues for detailed mechanistic studies in gnotobiotes under standardized and close-to-native conditions including effects on immune responses.another recent study pushed the current limits of minimal microbiome-based approaches by colonizing mice with a mixture of 92 cultured bacterial strains.128 the paper focused on describing metabolic functions of the microbiota--their impact on the immune system was not described.

efforts to isolate and identify additional species should be continued or even intensified in the near future especially with respect to efficient taxonomic description of novel taxa184185 and to functional characterization of strains and their impact on immune functions.40 for the latter purpose public accessibility of strains is par- amount for performing mechanistic analyses.186 in future work it will also be important to assess in greater detail the role of gut microorgan- isms other than bacteria in modulating the immune system.research based on the use of minimal microbiomes is now enter- ing an accelerated phase of development.

we may also need to intervene during the host's early life when gut communities are established and the immune system educated.18 finally we should also consider that targeted microbiome modulation could also improve the efficacy of conventional medica- tions intended to augment immune responses.192 these and other microbiome-based interventions that modulate immunity represent an exciting new horizon for biomedical research.acknowledgementsthis work was supported in part by the german research foundation grant no.

the gut microbiota can also metabolize dietary lipids cholesterol and host-derived cho- lesterol metabolites such as steroids and bile acids.143-145 hence gut bacteria have the potential to alter the bioavailability and bioactivities of these compounds and thereby alter corresponding signaling net- works.
