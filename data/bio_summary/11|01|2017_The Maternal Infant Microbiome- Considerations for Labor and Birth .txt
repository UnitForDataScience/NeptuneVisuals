The development of the microbiome begins in utero however factors related to the labor and birth environment have been shown to influence the initial colonization process of the newborn microbiome.

Cesarean320volume 42  number 6NovemberDecember 2017Newborns born via cesarean tend to have a gut microbiome less similar to that of their mother compared with those born vaginally microbes are more likely to include skin and oral microbiota as well as bacteria from operating room environments.birth results in a gut microbiome that is less similar to that of the mother compared with vaginal birth Backhed et al.

Although the relationships between the microbiome and health outcomes are not yet fully understood nurses are unique- ly positioned to provide evidence-based supportive care during labor birth and postpartum as well as provide education to mothers and their families about the adop- tion of health behaviors that may potentially promote healthy initial interactions between the maternal-child microbiome.

1.5 ANCC Contact HoursAbstractThe human microbiome plays a role in maintaining health but is also thought to attenuate and exacerbate risk factors for adverse maternal-child health outcomes.

Studies have shown that there are distinct differences in the microbiome profiles of newborns born vaginally compared with those born by cesarean.

Antibiotic exposure has been shown to alter the microbial profiles of women and may influence the gut microbial profiles of their newborns.Considering that the first major microbial colonization occurs at birth it is essential that labor and birth nurses be aware of factors that may alter the composition of the microbiome during the labor and birth process.

The implications of various activities and factors unique to the labor and birth environment that may influence the microbiome of women and newborns during the labor and birth process e.g.

The collective genomes of these microbes are known as the microbiome.

Medicalization of birth in many developed nations has changed the quality and quantity of contact between mothers and babies altering this initial microbiome composition and formation Backhed et al.
