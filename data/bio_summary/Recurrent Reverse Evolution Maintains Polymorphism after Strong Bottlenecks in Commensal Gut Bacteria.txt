3 and 5 imply that irrespectively of the founder clone being constitutive or regulated in the long run gat-negative and gat-positive poly- morphism is likely to emerge and be maintained in the gut.Microbiota Composition Affects E. coli Abundance but not E. coli Reverse EvolutionThe success of E. coli colonization in terms of population size is variable among mice.

Thus the fitness effects of mutations comprising the first step of adaptation to the gut could be described by a simple distribution where all mutations have similar effect .Here we use an evolved gat-negative single mutant to colonize a new set of mice mimicking a strong transmission bottleneck and ask if the rate of adaptation slows down in this complex ecosystem.

In this mouse model the E. coli that naturally inhabits the mouse gut is killed by the antibiotic whereas the fluorescently labeled E. coli which is streptomycin resistant is able to stably colonize and evolve in the gut.

Remarkably mice with low loads of E. coli  exhibit a microbiota community composition significantly different from mice with high loads of E. coli .

This suggests that there is variation in the concentrations of the unidentified resources that are con- sumed by the gat-negative E. coli.Natural Polymorphism for Galactitol Consumption in Indigenous Enterobacteriacea of Mice and Humans The findings reported here suggest that the gut ecology may favor natural polymorphism for galactitol metabolism in its microbiota.

The gut microbiota affects the densities of gat-negative but not gat-positive E. coli A.

C-D Temporal dynamics of gat- negative and gat-positive E. coli showing that the densities of gat-negative E. coli are lower in mice with the cluster I microbiota C than in mice2886Table 1.

The number of spontaneous gat-positive mutants and total num- ber of cells grown on LB were used to estimate the mutation rate using the maximum likelihood approach as implementedin FALCOR .We measured the mutation rate to reacquire the ability to consume galactitol since this locus was previously demon- strated to be a hotspot for loss of function mutations c. The fluctuation test revealed that the spontaneous rate at which the ancestor of the second colonization gat-negative recovers the ability to consume galactitol is 9.710-9 95 CI 310-9 1.910-8 per generation.

C The third colonization initiated with a gat-positive clone isolated from the second colonization exhibited the reemergence of gat-negative mutants as in the first colonization.gat-positive to gat-negative and 9.710-9 95 CI 310-9 1.9 10-8 for gat-negative to gat-positive see Materials and Methods.

The total load of E. coli was not significantly different across diets v2 4.9 P 0.09 consistent with the main effect of galactitol supplementation being the increase of gat-positive abundance.We then assayed if the composition of the other species in the mouse gut could be altered when adding galactitol to the diet by 16S rDNA metagenomics of the mouse fecal samples.
