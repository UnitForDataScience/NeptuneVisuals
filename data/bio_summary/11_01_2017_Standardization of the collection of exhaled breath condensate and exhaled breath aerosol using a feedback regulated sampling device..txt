Of the 114 samples 57 samples had a 6 min col- lection time while the remaining 57 samples were col- lected over a 10 min sample time.

In this study we compare consistency of EBC volume and pH of samples collected by controlled 'paced' breath- ing using a new instrument with verbal and audio prompts to samples collected by uncontrolled free breathing.

The volume of each sample was measured and samples transferred to a 2 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube for storage in -20 degC freezer until pH analysis.For this initial study we collected 114 samples.
