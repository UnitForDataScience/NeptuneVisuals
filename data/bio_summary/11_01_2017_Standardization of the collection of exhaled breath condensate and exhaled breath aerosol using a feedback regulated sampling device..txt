in contrast for samples collected using the controlled breathing method the mean value was0.71 ml with a range of 0.52-0.82 ml and a coefficient of variation of 0.100. for samples collected for 10 min using the spontaneous breathing method the mean value was 1.62 ml with a range of 1.10-2.19 ml and a coefficient of variation of 0.159 compared to the mean value being 1.20 ml with a range of 1.01-1.63 ml and a coefficient of variation of 0.103 using the controlled breathing method.

with the outlier removed the mean ph of the samples using the spontaneous breathing method for 6 min was 8.29 with a range of 7.8-8.62. with the outlier removed the mean ph of sample sets using the spontaneous breathing method for 10 min was 8.39 with a range of 7.93-8.66.discussionwe have illustrated the implementation of a novel method of controlled cued breathing using a loccioni instrument for standardization of ebc.

the largest volume difference between samples collected in rapid succession from the same subject for spontaneous breathing and con- trolled breathing is approximately 0.6 ml and 0.2 ml respectively.

in this study we compare consistency of ebc volume and ph of samples collected by controlled 'paced' breath- ing using a new instrument with verbal and audio prompts to samples collected by uncontrolled free breathing.

therefore to compare intra- subject variability between spontaneous and con- trolled breathing in samples collected in rapid succes- sion the majority of ebc samples were collected insets of three using an identical sampling method and collection time.

the variability between 10 min samples collected in rapid succession using the loccioni instrument was notably smaller in comparison to the 10 min samples collected in rapid succession using the spontaneous breathing method figure .

in addition variability in sample sets collected on different days was also markedly reduced in samples collected using the controlled breathing method.ph analysis ph of ebc samples is an easily measured biomarker to monitor respiratory acidification which is associated with numerous respiratory illnesses .

of the 114 samples 57 samples had a 6 min col- lection time while the remaining 57 samples were col- lected over a 10 min sample time.

most of the ebc samples 31 of 37 had a ph value considered within the range of normal healthy individuals 7.08-0.69  figures a and b. for the 10 min ebc samples one sample from a subject was slightly below the ph range found in nominally healthy individuals ph6.12 and two samples collected from the same subject approximately 20 min apart had ph values of 4-5 far below the range of healthy individuals.

'paced' breathing with the goal of produ- cing a fairly reproducible tidal volume and frequency typically involves audio visual andor vibratory prompts for the subject we use this interchangeablewith controlled breathing for the purposes of this report.

the respiratory rate for controlled breathing can be programmed from 6 to 16 breaths min-1 and individual breath volume programmed from 100 to 1500 mlbreath which may allow for targeting of air from a specific region within the lung or breathing pattern.

the metronome and individual breath volume feedback mechanisms were not used for the spontaneous breathing samples.subjects remained seated while breathing through the filter without nose clips.

these findings with controlled breathing were obtained without knowl- edge of the variability in tv and freq for eachcollection though the total volume was near the target 100 l which could be improved with software reprogramming.a potential benefit of the 10 min collection time is the decrease in variability in volume or biomarker levels relative to spontaneous breathing due to hyper- ventilation by the subject which typically can occur when the subject first expires into the r-tube mouth- piece and respirguard 303 filter.

in later sam- ple collections the subjects' spontaneous respiratory rate was noted to be considerably closer to the con- trolled breathing rate of 10 breaths per minute possi- bly attributable to acclimation to the controlled breathing rate.
