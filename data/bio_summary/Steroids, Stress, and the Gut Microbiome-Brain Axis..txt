For example mice that overexpress a-synuclein reveal that bacteria within the gut regulate motor deficits and neu- roinflammation.67 Indeed antibiotic treatment ameliorates whereas microbial colonisation with microbiota from PD patients promotesthe neurological phenotype in these mice.67 These clinical and basic studies suggest that the gut microbiota has an important role in the physical impairments associated with PD.With regard to Alzheimer's disease AD a clinical study investigat- ing the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis reveals that cogni- tively impaired patients with brain amyloidosis compared to controls have lower levels of the anti-inflammatory Eubacterium rectale and an increase in the pro-inflammatory EscherichiaShigella.68 In support of these clinical findings altered gut microbiota have been observed in a variety of mouse models of AD.69-71 Furthermore in an APPSWEPS1E9 mouse model of AD changes in the gut microbiota by long-term antibiotic treatment decreases amyloid-b plaque formation.69 Germ-free APP transgenic mice have decreased amyloid-b pathology compared to control mice.70 Moreover colonisation of these germ- free APP mice with the microbiota of conventionally-raised APP miceincreased amyloid-b levels.70 These findings suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can contribute to AD pathology and manipulation of the gut microbial community may offer therapeutic opportunities for AD treatment.There are several mechanisms by which the gut microbiome in- fluences brain function and these work in concert with reciprocal signalling from the brain.72 For example gut bacteria may influence central neurotransmitters by altering systemic levels of precursors of neurotransmitters.73 Moreover neurotransmitters such as serotonin which is involved in pain transmission and affect can be produced by Candida Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp.74-77 Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species have been shown to synthesise and release GABA whereas Bacillus and Saccharomyces species can produce nor- epinephrine.54 These microbially synthesised neurotransmitters can act locally and also cross the mucosal layer of the gut to influence systems in the periphery and potentially the CNS.

Although the dra- matic shift in steroid hormones eg oestrogens and progestins could very well contribute directly to these changes in the gut microbiota it was also suggested that changes in the immune system at the mucosal surfaces could alter the microbiota.33Although gonadal steroids can alter the gut microbiota it appears that in turn the gut microbiome can influence hormone levels.34 In postmenopausal women gut microbiota diversity was positively as- sociated with the ratio of oestrogen metabolites in urine.3536 In mice transferring the gut microbiota of adult males to immature females caused an elevation in testosterone levels and metabolomic changes in recipient females.37 In addition the transfer of gut microbiota from male non-obese diabetic NOD mouse model of type 1 diabetes T1D to the female NOD T1D mice led to increased testosterone metabolic changes and protection against type 1 diabetes which usually shows a strong female-to-male sex bias.37 These studies highlight the recipro- cal connections between sex hormones and gut microbiota.

Indeed a recent study found that Germ-free Swiss Webster mice were less sociable and did not show the typical preference for investigating novel mice found in conven- tionally colonised mice.3 Conventionally colonising these mice at day 21 only partially normalised their behaviour3 suggesting that gut mi- crobiota must be present even earlier for normal social behaviour.Reduced anxiety and depressive-like behaviours as well as changes in the GABAergic system were seen following treatment of mice with Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1.83 Interestingly these behavioural and neurochemical changes do not occur following vagotomy indicat- ing that the vagus nerve is a key route of communication between probiotic bacteria and the brain.83 A recent study showed that faecal microbiota transplantation from depressed patients characterised by decreased microbial richness and diversity to antibiotics-treated re- cipient animals induces a depressive-like phenotype in the recipient animals compared to the control recipient group.51The maternally separated rat model is a model of depression that has been used to demonstrate the role of the gut microbiota in stress- related disorders.93 Maternally separated rats present with behaviours indicative of depression and anxiety had increased systemic immune response and dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota compared to nonsepa- rated controls.93 Furthermore maternal separation reduced swimming and increased time spent immobile in the forced swim test induced changes in central neurotransmitters and enhanced peripheral inter- leukin-6 release.73 However treatment with the probiotic B. infantis reverses these behavioural changes and restores the immune system response and the basal noradrenaline concentrations in the brain- stem of rats undergoing maternal separation.73 Lactobacillus plantarum treatment of mice exposed to early-life stress ameliorated anxiety- and depression-like behaviours balanced the immune response and modulated neurotransmitters related to affective disorders.94 Altered HPA axis activity and gut physiology are retained in germ-free mice that are subjected to maternal separation whereas both anxiety- and depression-like behaviours are not.95 Interestingly the behavioural phe- notype is re-established when germ-free mice are colonised in adult- hood with the gut microbiota from non-maternally separated controlmice but not the gut microbiota of maternally separated animals.

The gut microbiome which consists of the microbiota their genomes and their products can influence brain function through a variety of mechanisms including the production of neurotransmittersand short chain fatty acids SCFAs the modulation of the release of cytokines by immune cells and the vagus nerve.Conversely the brain can influence the gut microbiota via regulation of endocrinesystems eg hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axesStudies using a variety of mouse models of autism support the idea that the gut microbiota is involved in autism.6364 However in the clin- ical studies discussed above it should be noted that causality is diffi- cult to demonstrate given that children with autism often have eating habits different from those of neurotypical children.As reported in clinical studies Parkinson's disease PD is accompa- nied by dysbiosis of the gut microbiome resulting in altered levels of mi- crobes eg Bifidobacteriaceae Christensenellaceae Lachnospiraceae Lactobacillaceae Pasteurellaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae families65 and concentrations of short chain fatty acids.66 Animal models of PD support these findings and have enabled the functional manipulation of the gut microbiota.

These findings suggest a convergence of microbial and host factors.95Bilateral olfactory bulbectomy in mice induces depression- and anxiety-like behaviours in mice which are associated with increased immediate early gene expression serotonin levels gut motility and al- terations in intestinal microbiota profiles.96 Given that similar changes in behaviours motility and microbiota composition were also induced via central corticotrophin-releasing hormone administration it was sug- gest that the altered HPA axis activity functions in this model.96 Both manipulations show the impact of the brain on microbiota composition and indicate that the gut microbiome-brain axis is a two-way street.Although much of the evidence on the role of gut microbiota in stress- related disorders originates from animal models and other basic research studies findings from recent human studies are coming to the forefront.

Email 1  INTRODUCTION Within each human gastrointestinal tract there is an exclusive combina- tion of different communities of organisms including bacteria viruses archaea protozoa and fungi which are collectively referred to as the gut microbiota and outnumber the total amount of human cells in the human body.1 The collection of these microorganisms their genomes and the factors that they produce are all part of the gut microbiome.2 Increasing evidence suggests that these microorganisms actively participate in shaping and maintaining our physiology almost as an extra organ.3The gut microbiota composition is associated with many health ben- efits including the maintenance of intestinal homoeostasis protection against pathogens and appropriate immune responses.45 Conversely many gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease6 are associated with an imbalance in this microbial population.

Furthermore differences in diversity and compo- sition of the microbiota have been linked to extra-i ntestinal diseases ranging from obesity7 and asthma8 to a variety of brain disorders.39-14 The gut microbiota helps break down food and in doing so produces metabolites that can directly influence the physiology of host cells in- cluding brain cells.

An improved mechanistic understanding of how bacterial molecules act on the nervous system could yield improved therapeutics for treating behavioural and neurological disorders.16The human gut microbiota is usually stable and resilient to tran- sient perturbations.17 However microbial composition or activity of the gut can be modified by a variety of factors including internal factors such as hormonal changes or external factors such as diet antibiotics and stress.318 In this review the influence of steroids and stress on the gut microbiome- brain axis is discussed as well as the challenges that face future research in this area.2  STEROID HORMONES INFLUENCE THE GUT MICROBIOTAThere is mounting evidence that steroid hormones can affect the gut microbiota.

In support of steroids influencing the gut bacterial com- munities sex differences have been noted in the composition of the gut microbiota with specific phyla family and genera variances oc- curring with clear effects of gonadectomy and hormone replacement on gut bacteria in rodents.19-21 In mice the sex differences in the gut microbiota observed between males and females are decreased after castration indicating a role for gonadal steroids in modulating the gut microbiota.22 Administering testosterone propionate 1250 mg Journal of Neuroendocrinology.
