Collectively these data suggest that circulating levels of the meta-organismal metabolite TMAO are closely correlated with T2DM risk in humans.Plasma TMAO Levels in Mice and FMO3 mRNA Expression in Men Demonstrate Positive Correlations with ObesityFirst using a systems genetics approach in mice we examined various obesity-related traits and circulating TMAO levels in mice from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel HMDP fed an obesogenic high fat and high sucrose diet Parks et al.

Correlation coefficient r and p value p are indicated for each obesity trait.Correlation between plasma TMAO and body weightCorrelation between plasma TMAO and fat massCorrelation between plasma TMAO and mesenteric fat weightSchugar et al.Page 17Correlation between plasma TMAO and subcutaneous fat weightCorrelations between human white adipose tissue flavin monooxygenase 3 FMO3 mRNA expression and metabolic traits or brownbeige adipocyte marker gene expression n770.

Using a metabolomics platform Miao and colleagues recently showed that mice with selective hepatic insulin resistance liver insulin receptor knockout mice LIRKO have elevated levels of circulating TMAO and a profound upregulation of the TMAO-producing enzyme FMO3 in the liver Miao et al.

In addition to these findings in LIRKO mice dietary supplementation with the FMO3 product TMAO is reported to exacerbate glucose intolerance in high fat diet-fed mice Gao et al.

Collectively these data suggest that knockdown of FMO3 increases energy expenditure and enhances metabolic flexibility under conditions of cold stress.Given that TMAO levels were linked to adiposity across multiple strains of mice Figure 2 we hypothesized that TMAO itself may be directly involved in regulating adiposity.Therefore we set out to determine the involvement of TMAO in the adipose tissue phenotype seen with FMO3 knockdown.

Collectively these data demonstrate that provision of dietary TMAO can reverse a portion but not all of the transcriptional reorganization observed in whiteSchugar et al.Page 7adipose tissue driven by FMO3 knockdown and suggest that future studies should investigate the role of additional FMO3 products or substrates in energy metabolism.Genetic Deletion of the TMAO-Producing Enzyme FMO3 Protects Mice from ObesityTo further examine the role of FMO3 in obesity we examined global FMO3 knockout Fmo3-- mice generated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing Shih et al.

In multiple follow-up studies it has been shown that feeding atherosclerosis-prone mice diets enriched in either distinct nutrient precursors to TMA synthesis or TMAO itself enhances atherosclerotic CVD and thrombosis potential by altering host cholesterol metabolism and platelet hyper-reactivity Koeth et al.

In parallel ASO-mediated inhibition of the TMAO producing enzyme FMO3 protects mice from atherosclerosis Shih et al.

More recently inhibition of the microbial enzymes responsible for generating TMA from choline thereby reducing TMAO levels was shown to similarly inhibit atherosclerosis in mice Wang et al.

Across the different inbred strains represented in the HMDP circulating levels of TMAO were positively associated with body weight fat mass mesenteric adiposity and subcutaneous adiposity Figure 2A- D. Given the observed associations between TMAO and obesity across the diverse inbred strains of mice we next set out to determine whether expression of FMO3 which encodes the TMAO-producing enzyme was differentially expressed in the adipose tissue of overweight or obese humans.
