various microbial metabolic activities work together in a critical role in human and animal health via supplying nutrients including vitamins short chain fatty acids and energy to maintain daily metabolism cummings et al.

1998 zoetendal et al.

don has been shown to induce anorexia emesis and oxidative damage rotter et al.

1996 maresca 2013. for example it has been demonstrated that don levels above 3 mg kg-1 elicited persistent negative effects on feed intake and weight growth in pigs prelusky et al.

1994. short-term negative effects of don on feedintake and weight gains in pigs table 1 as well as a moderate impact on pig's intestinal microflora have also been observed wache et al.

the results demonstrated a significant increase in the bacteroidesprevotella group and a significant decrease in escherichia coli saint-cyr et al.

besides lower chronic concentrations of don could still be detected in food and food stuff tardivel et al.

2015 which is mainly absorbed in the intestine rotter et al.

the 3-15-adon may not be directly absorbed by intestinal epithelial cells iec and requires deacetylation bygut microbiota or by luminal intestinal enzymes before their absorption ajandouz el et al.

2016. therefore gut microbiota plays a crucial role in detoxifying don as well as in unmasking masked don such as 3a-15a-don ajandouz el et al.

some studies on pigs showed not only transient negative effects of don on feed intake and weight gains but also a persistent effect on feed intake and weight growth for up to 8 weeks don levels above 3 mg kg-1 feed prelusky et al.

1994 wache et al.

2. for instance the evolutionary conflict between the host and microbiota may lead to food cravings and cognitive conflict with regard to food choice alcock et al.
