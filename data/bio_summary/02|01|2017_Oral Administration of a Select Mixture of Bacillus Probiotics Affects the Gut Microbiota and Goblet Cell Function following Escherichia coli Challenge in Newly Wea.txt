in brief on the day of weaning day 0 the pigs were divided into five groups of six animals per group and each group received a different treatment as follows i cont group oral administration of sterile physiological saline ii etec group oral administration of sterile physiological saline and oral challenge with f4 etec 1 x 1010 cfuday iii ldbe group oral administration of low-dose probiotic mixture 3.9 x 108 cfuday and oral challenge with f4 etec iv mdbe group oral administration of moderate-dose probiotic mixture 7.8 x 108 cfuday and oral challenge with f4 etec and v hdbe group oral administration of high-dose probiotic mixture 3.9 x 109 cfuday and oral challenge with f4 etec.clinical examinations.

however susceptibility toward etec f4abac is not governed only by the muc4 gene in pigs since positive adhesion of f4abac etec occurs in more than 30 of pigs of genotype muc4 that are supposed to be etec f4abac receptor negative i.e.

the mdbe pigs who received oral administration of a moderate-dose probiotic mixture 7.8 x 108 cfuday and oral challenge with f4 etec and hdbe pigs who received oral administration of a high-dose probiotic mixture 3.9 x 109 cfuday and oral challenge with f4 etec also showed a rectal temperature of 40degc at 72 h after e. coli challenge while the cont pigs and ldbe pigs who received oral administration of a low-dose probiotic mixture 3.9 x 108 cfuday and oral challenge with f4 etec still had a normal rectal temperature after e. coli challenge.

in contrast fecal coliform counts decreased in mdbe piglets 12 days after bls mix pretreatment compared with that in cont p  0.021 or etec p  0.010 pigs .on day 15 1 week after f4 etec challenge lactobacillus counts in the ileal contents from hdbe pigs but not ldbe or mdbe pigs were lower than those from cont or etec pigs p  0.005 and p  0.006 respectively .

however the number of ileal gcs was lower in etec pigs than in cont pigs p 0.027 whereas the number of gcs in mdbe pigs was higher than that in either cont or etec pigs p  0.049 and p  0.001 respectively.compared with that in either cont or etec pigs the expression levels of muc2 p 0.003 and p  0.001 respectively and atoh1 p  0.047 and p  0.015 respectively mrna in the ileum of mdbe pigs were upregulated .

subtilis mixture bls mix were orally administered to muc4-resistant piglets for 1 week before the f4-expressing etec strain f4 etec challenge.

the rectal temperature of etec group pigs who received oral administration of sterile physiological saline and oral challenge with f4 etec 1 x 1010 cfuday and of mdbe and hdbe pigs remained higher than that of cont p  0.039 p  0.041 and p  0.003 respectively and ldbe p  0.010 p  0.013 and p  0.001 respectively pigs until 144 h after challenge.the effects of oral administration of different doses of bls mix on diarrhea scores of newly weaned pigs before and after e. coli challenge are shown in fig.

during week 1 prior to the e. coli challenge 2 pigs each in the cont and hdbe groups and 1 pig each in the etec and mdbe groups exhibited naturally acquired severe diarrhea lasting for 1 day due to weaning environmental psychological and dietary stress however only 1 pig in the ldbe group had mild diarrhea by day 4. during week 2 1 pig in the etec group and 2 pigs in the mdbe group exhibited mild diarrhea lasting for 1 day following e. coli challenge.

when presented as pig-days with diarrhea no difference in incidence of diarrhea was found among the 5 groups table s1.in the first 2 weeks following the challenge the average daily weight gain and feed intake were lower in etec pigs than in cont pigs p  0.011 and p  0.018 respectively but there were no differences in average daily weight gain in the ldbe mdbe or hdbe pigs compared with the cont pigs and the average daily feed intake was higher in the ldbe mdbe and hdbe pigs than in the etec pigs table s2.characterization of the colonic microbiota of pigs.

pcoa1 based on unweighted unifrac distances accounting for 26.89 of totalvariance predominantly reflected f4 etec and high-dose bls mix treatment-related changes in the colonic microbiota composition as pcoa1 separated hdbe and etec pigs from cont ldbe and mdbe pigs .

at the phylum level the proportion of proteobacteria in the colonic microbiota of hdbe but not ldbe or mdbe pigs was higher than that of cont pigs p  0.040. the abundance of tenericutes was lower p  0.006 in etec pigs even in pigs pretreated with bls mix.the clostridia as a phylogenetic class was abundant in the colonic microbiota and the proportion of clostridia species in mdbe and hdbe but not ldbe pigs was lower p  0.018 and p  0.043 respectively than that in etec pigs .

the genus lactobacillus was enriched in mdbe pigs compared with that in etec pigs p  0.034. the ldbe pigs had a higher abundance of clostridium than did cont or etec pigs p  0.041 and p  0.023 respectively.

viable bls mix spores in feces from cont and etec pigs remained culture negative until the end of the experiment on day 14.prior to f4 etec challenge hdbe pigs had lower p  0.011 fecal lactobacilluscounts 7 days after bls mix pretreatment than cont pigs .

subtilis mixture bls mix were orally administered to piglets of genotype muc4 that are supposed to be f4-expressing enterotoxigenic escherichia coli strain f4 etec f4abac receptor negative i.e.
