The conflict between usage of classical antibiotics and plant origin antimicrobial agents has recently been in the limelight.Aim The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of amoxicillin metronidazole and green coffee extract loaded onto GTR membrane against periodonto-pathogens.Materials and Methods Pure form of amoxicillin metronidazole and green coffee extract were obtained.

To further evaluate the efficacy of green coffee extract higher concentrations of extract should have been tested for the present study.The present in vitro study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 1 amoxicillin 1 metronidazole and 1 green coffee extract loaded onto GTR membrane against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis.

The results of the study 29 concluded that chlorhexidine showed better results as compared to green coffee extract while 20 and 15 concentration of green coffee extract showed antimicrobial activity against P. intermediaP.

Green coffee extract showed no zone of inhibition against both the bacterial species.Conclusion Loading of commercially available antimicrobial agents onto GTR membrane can prevent its bacterial colonization leading to better treatment outcomes for periodontal regeneration.Keywords Amoxicillin Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Green Coffee extract Metronidazole Porphyromonas gingivalisINTRODUCTIONIt has been well established that oral infections particularly perio- dontitis are associated with aerobic and anaerobic microbiota.

The GTR membrane was allowed to soak in the concentrated solution for 15 minutes and was dried for five minutes.Microbial AssayAgar disc diffusion method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of GTR membrane coated with 1 amoxicillin solution 1 metronidazole solution and 1 green coffee extract solution respectively in vitro.

The present studyshowed negative results with green coffee extract showing no antimicrobial property against both the bacterial species.

As green coffee extract showed negative results hence higher concentrations of the extract should have been tested for their efficacy by loading onto the GTR membrane.

Whereas neither metronidazole nor green coffee extract showed any level of significance against A. actinomycetemcomitans using Mann- Whitney U test.

This is one of its kind studies in which green coffee extract was loaded onto the GTR membrane to evaluate its antimicrobial activity against A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis.Amoxicillin belongs to the family of b-Lactam antibiotics 15.

contrasted the antimicrobial activity of 0.2 chlorhexidine mouthwash and different concentrations of green coffee extract against P. gingivalis P. intermedia F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans 29.
