The commensal microbiota is of crucial im- portance for the host as it plays a role in shaping the immune system inducing protective immune responses providing the host with essen- tial nutrients and vitamins aiding in the digestion of indigestible food components and competing with pathogens for the same niches.1 The mucosal epithelium mounts multiple innate immune mecha- nisms that function at mucosal sites to promote barrier function and maintain host-microbial homeostasis.2 The resident intestinal micro- biota also induces robust adaptive immunity that includes induction and differentiation of CD4 T cells intestinal epithelial lymphocytes IEL and B cells.3 In this review we will discuss recent developments in the interplay between the intestinal microbiota and the adaptive immune system with particular focus on the induction of systemic anti-microbial IgG responses the function of microbial-induced mat- ernal antibodies and microbial-specific T-cell immunity.This article is part of a series of reviews covering Microbiome-Immune System Interplay appearing in Volume 279 of Immunological Reviews.2  MUCOSAL ANTIBODY INDUCTION BY MICROBIOTAIgA is the dominant antibody isotype found at mucosal surfaces and is transported across the epithelium into the intestinal lumen by binding to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor pIgR expressed by intes- tinal epithelial cells reviewed in4.

Intestinal IgA is rapidly induced by microbial colonization of germ-free mice and this IgA shows speci- ficity to the intestinal microbiota.5 Sequencing of fecal microbiota coated with IgA has demonstrated that there are a range of microbial taxa that are bound by IgA and IgA binding may identify the bacte- rial taxa that stimulate the immune system.6 Microbiota found in the small intestine appears to be highly coated with IgA whereas much of the colonic microbiota is uncoated7 indicating that induction of the majority of intestinal IgA likely occurs in the small intestine.

Interestingly Tfh cells can sense microbiota-derived extracellular ATP through the P2X7 recep- tor which leads to their death.11 Tfh cell numbers and intestinal IgA levels are increased in P2rx7-deficient mice which leads to changes in the microbial composition and an altered host metabolism.12Although IgA is the dominant antibody at mucosal sites mice lacking Trp53 bp1 a DNA damage-response protein were found to harbor B cells undergoing active class switch recombination CSR to IgD in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue NALT and the mesen- teric lymph nodes MLN leading to elevated serum IgD levels.13 The intestinal microbiota was important for driving the IgD response as elevated IgD was absent in Trp53 bp1-- germ-free mice and serum IgD showed specificity to the intestinal microbiota.

These data demonstrate the existence of a critical window in early life where microbial stimulation is required to induce immune regulation.4  SYSTEMIC IGG ANTIBODY INDUCTION BY MUCOSAL MICROBIOTADespite compartmentalization of live bacteria to the mucosal system intestinal colonization of germ-free mice leads to an increase in all systemic antibody isotypes with the exception of IgE.14 Under homeostatic conditions these systemic IgG antibod- ies did not appear to show specificity to the intestinal microbiota although anti-commensal IgG can be induced when there is loss of compartmentalization and subsequent systemic penetration of microbes.15 However using more sensitive assays several recent studies have demonstrated that intestinal colonization with com- mensal microbiota can lead to induction of systemic IgG with low affinity anti-microbial specificity and this has functional conse- quences for the host.

demonstrated that naive healthy mice housed under specific pathogen free SPF conditions developed anti-commensal IgG antibodies under steady state.17 Using high through-put flow cytometry of the microbiota termed mFLOW by the authors serum IgG2b and IgG3 were shown to bind specifically to the fecal microbiota and this was confirmed by im- munofluorescence.

In both studies the functionality of these anti-commensal IgG antibodies was demonstrated to be of particular importance when they were of maternal origin see below in the section on microbiota and maternal antibodies.Nunez and colleagues also recently demonstrated the presence of systemic IgG that bound to fecal microbiota during homeostasis.18 As with the previous studies these IgG were not natural antibodies and the majority were of IgG3 and IgG2b isotypes although anti- commensal IgG1 and IgG2c were also detected albeit at lower lev- els.

In mice maternal SIgA provided through the milk can prevent translocation of commensal bacteria to the MLN through a mecha- nism that does not depend on anti-commensal specificity.20 Maternal SIgA has also been shown to strengthen the mucosal barrier and in- fluence the microbiota composition of the suckling newborn.21 More recently maternal antibodies induced by the commensal microbiota have also been shown to impact development of the neonatal im- mune system with both inhibitory and stimulatory effects.

This study indicates that the initial education of the neonatal immune system begins with the maternal microbiota whereby transfer of maternal microbial metabolites to the neonate in utero and during lactation functions to protect the offspring and prepare it for colonization with its own microbiota following birth.

Over the last several years it has become clear that such reciprocal interactions between the microbiota and the immune system play a crucial role during health and disease.23 Recent attention has focused on the ability of the microbiota and individual species within it to modulate the CD4 T-cell compartment by induc- tion of different defined CD4 T-cell subsets.24FIGURE 1 Microbiota-mediated modulation of intestinal CD4 T cells and models to assess their antigen-specificity.

While Th17 cells are virtually absent in germ-free mice they can be found in colo- nized mice at various levels depending on the microbiota composition anatomical location and immune status.33-36 Not all members of the microbiota have the capacity to induce Th17 cells.
