Interestingly antibiotics frequently used as prophylaxis against infection in patients with haematological malignancy - trimethroprim sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxa- cin - are also the strongest activators of the SOS response .

These findings suggest that selective killing of commensal anaerobes occurs with certain chemotherapeutics allowing the expansion of potentially pathogenic enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae.DNA Damage Activates the Bacterial SOS Response to Drive 126TDDIFDe NovoMutationMany chemotherapeutic agents are likely to increase mutagenesis in bacteria and the emer- gence of de novo antimicrobial resistance by activating the bacterial SOS response.

The formation of DNA cross-links is a strong inducer of the SOS response in bacteria and mitomycin C is frequently used as a positive control in SOS responses studies .

Therapies that restore the gut micro- biota following chemotherapy or antibiotics could provide a means to break this cycle of infection and treatment failure.Antimicrobial Resistance in Cancer Patients A Lethal Combination Bloodstream infections are a major threat to the lives of patients with cancer causing death in approximately 10 of patients .

For example activation of the SOS response by mitomycin C increases the transcription of genes necessary to transfer the SXT element that encodes resistance to multiple antibiotics in Vibrio cholerae .

Although the pathogen blooms were mediated by infection-induced inflammation certain types of chemotherapy may cause similar blooms of Enterobacteriaceae .Antibiotics That Mirror Chemotherapeutic DNA Damage Cause 126TDDIFDe NovoAntibiotic Resistance in an SOS-Dependent MannerMany antibiotics including penicillins and cephalosporins have been shown to activate the SOS response .

Quinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin inhibit bacterial topoisomerase II and IV resulting in double-stranded breaks in bacterial DNA that trigger of the SOS response directly .

We propose a model in which chemotherapy contributes directly to the emergence of antimi- crobial resistance in cancer patients through both the disruption of the commensal gut microbiota and by driving bacterial mutagenesis and horizontal gene transfer.Gut Pathogens An Important Cause of Sepsis in Cancer PatientsCancer patients not only have a high mortality from individual episodes of sepsis but suffer disproportionately from sepsis compared to the general population .

The authors theorised that the imbalance in the thymidine nucleotide pool may act synergistically with the SOS response to increase the mutagenic response to these drugs .

These studies are difficult to interpret as most patients received antibiotics either during or just before chemotherapy.
