the offspring of these gestationally colonizeddams were then compared with offspring that were born to dams that were maintained germ-free throughout pregnancy.effect of gestational colonization on offspring immunityas a first approach to assess the effect of maternal microbiota on the immune system of the offspring we screened various innate and adaptive immune cell populations in primary and secondary lymphoid organs and in the intestinal tissue of the newborn off- spring using flow cytometry.

transfer of serum from an e. coli ha107- primed wild type mouse but not from an e. coli ha107-primed antibody-deficient mouse to a preg- nant germ-free dam induced similar changes in the offspring immune system as gestational colonization.but how can maternal antibodies contribute to these immune changes in the offspring there are 2 possibilities i mucosal priming of the mother during pregnancy significantly increases the concentration of immunoglobulins in the serum and the higher con- centration of antibodies reaching the offspring may exert direct changes in the immune system of the off- spring or ii specific antibodies may bind bacterial products retain them in the maternal organism and deliver them across the placenta or into the milk.

explic- itly microbiota-specific antibodies are able to bind bac- terial fragments leading to a better retention of microbiota-derived metabolites in the maternal organ- ism and hence a more efficient transport of these across the placenta and into the maternal milk thereby pre- paring the offspring for immunological challenges after birth .retrospectthe work we published in 2016and the additional considerations we describe here contribute to the understanding of the critical window of opportuni- ties which describes the importance of microbial influences on the host immune system happening early in life.not only does postnatal colonization play an important role in setting the immune pheno- type of the newborn child but molecular signals origi- nating from the microbiota of the mother which can reach the offspring in utero via the placenta and post- natally through the breast milk significantly contrib- ute to the microbial shaping and setting up of the neonatal immune system.

while adaptive immune cells such as b and t helper cell subsets were unal- tered in the offspring of gestationally colonized mice compared with the offspring of germ-free control mice we detected significant changes in the innate immune compartment.specifically small intestinal nkp46c type 3 innate lymphoid cells ilc3s and intestinal f480c cd11cc mononuclear cells imncs in the small and large intestine were increased in rela- tive and absolute numbers.

all together these results suggest that some of the multi- parametric effects of maternal microbiota on intestinal immune education of the offspring could be driven by bacteria-derived ahr ligands.the involvement of maternal antibodies in maternal microbiota-dependent imprinting of the neonatal immune systemit is well known that antibodies are transferred from the mother to her offspring to equip the child with passive immunity and protection.immunoglobu- lin g is transferred via the placenta in mice and humansand taken up from the milk via the duode- num until about postnatal day 12 in mice.iga is mainly secreted into the maternal milk.given our observation that a transfer of signals from the mater- nal microbiota most probably occurs both in utero and during lactation we hypothesized that maternal antibodies were involved in this process.

metabolites from the intestinal micro- biota of the mother resulting from transient gestational coloniza- tion of the dam are transferred to the offspring antenatally via the placenta and postnatally through the maternal milk and induce immune maturation of the offspring intestinal mucosa such as an increase in nkp46c type 3 innate lymphoid cell ilc3 and in intestinal mononuclear cell imnc numbers.

only if the offspring was born and raised by a transiently colonized mother the effect on the new- born immune system was complete.

we confirmed the functional ahr ligand effect by showing that the uptake of a purified ahr ligand indole-3-carbinol by germ-free dams during pregnancy was sufficient to recapitulate the immune phenotype observed in the offspring following gestational colonization.

however delivering the priming signal before gesta- tion was insufficient to contribute to the maturation of the offspring immune system.

while we were able to dem- onstrate the importance of the maternal microbiota in preparing the offspring for the event of colonization in its first days of life it now remains to show the con- sequences of this effect in adulthood if we colonize the offspring after birth.disclosure of potential conflicts of interestno potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.acknowledgmentss.c.g-v. is holder of a long-term fellowship from the euro- pean molecular biology organization.

in addition the commensal microbiota has been shown to efficiently mature the host innate and adap- tive immune systems both at mucosal sites and gener- ally in the body.

elegant models using germ-free mice have illustrated the important role of themicrobiota in the development of immunity and other body systems.indeed in the absence of microbiota intestinal iga production and t helper cell differentia- tion are strongly diminished secondary and tertiary lymphoid organs lymph nodes peyer's patches and isolated lymphoid follicles are underdeveloped and the innate immune system is hyporeactive.the birth of a newborn child is a tremendous life event.

the maternal microbiota drives early postnatal innate immune development.

a long believed dogma stated that immune maturation is mainly shaped through postnatal endogenous coloni- zation of the offspring.this is of course predicated on the knowledge that the developing fetus is sterile and not yet colonized by microbes.

the effects of commensal colonization of the mammalian body on the host immune system have been elegantly demonstrated by the specific coloniza- tion of germ-free mice.
