Transient abstention from breastfeeding around the time of RV vaccination did not increase the efficacy of RV vaccination .Transplacentally Acquired Maternal RV Specific AntibodiesStudies from Nicaragua  India  and South Africa  demonstrated that mother's RV-specific IgG levels before RV vaccination of their infants was negatively associated with infants' seroconversion after RV vaccination.

More extensive data are required to answer the question of whether the expression of particular HBGAs of infants will determine their susceptibility to RV infections and interfere with the uptake of RV vaccines.Outlook and Future ResearchA number of health conditions by which infants in low income countries differ from children in high income countries have been recognized as being important for the outcome of RV and other microbial infections and of vaccination with one of the licensed RV vaccines.

In India a human bovine natural reassortant vaccine consisting of the 116E RV strain G9P811 originally isolated from asymptomatically infected neonates in India was found to have an efficacy of 49-55 over two years against severe RV disease  i.e.

Colonisation of gn piglets with LGG and Bb12 increased the immune response to RV vaccine leading to 'immune homeostasis' strengthened the tight junctions of ileum epithelium and resulted in less viral shedding and decreased diarrhea after RV infection compared to non-colonized piglets.

The response to RV vaccination is decreased in children presenting with biomarkers of EE .Passive Transfer of Maternal AntibodiesRotavirus Antibody Transferred to Infants in Breast MilkData from Africa  Europe  and the USA  did not show significant differences in RV vaccine efficacy which depended on RV-specific antibodies passively transferred by mother's breast milk.

Specific diarrhea prevention programs supply of nutrients and micronutrients such as vitamins combined with RV vaccination have been shown to be beneficial.There are still many aspects requiring further research such as the mechanisms by which micronutrients affect the immune system the multifactorial influences of the gut microbiome ondisease severity and vaccine take a more detailed characterization of environmental enteropathy the influence of host genetics on disease severity and outcome of vaccination and further development of RV vaccines.There is great optimism that recent achievements in basic virology will contribute to progress in these topics.
