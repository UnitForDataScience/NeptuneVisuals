over the last few years the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases esbls has increased signif- icantly for enterobacteriaceae such as klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli  .moreover the increasing use of carbapenems for the treat- ment of infections involving multidrug-resistant bacteria has led to a rapid international dissemination of carbapenemase- producing enterobacteriaceae cpe  .
