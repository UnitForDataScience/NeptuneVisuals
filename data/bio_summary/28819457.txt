The urinary proteome of T1D patients revealed increased abundances of several lysosomal proteins that correlated with elevated HbA1c values.

The incidence of T1D is now twice as high among children as it was two decades ago and 10 to 20 times more common than 100 years ago 1-5.

The prevalence of T1D in Americans under age 20 rose by 23 percent between 2001-2009 www.jdrf.org www.searchfordiabetes.org.

The evidence is emerging that environmental factors such as viral infections 9 and perturbations of physiologically normal gut microbiota play important roles in disease onset 10 11 12.

The gut functions as an immune organ to protect us from ingested potentially pathogenic bacteria and the billions of microorganisms in it play a role in regulating the immune system 13.

The interplay of the latter with genetic and non-genetic factors resulting from inflammation 15 suggests a more complex etiologydriving T1D pathogenesis 16.Animal studies have shown that the gut bacterial composition differs significantly at the time of diabetes onset compared to healthy controls 13 17.

The human gut microbiome may be altered at the time of T1D onset due to autoimmune processes and years after T1D onset due to suboptimal insulin treatment and frequent hypo- andor hyperglycemic states in patients thus contributing to adverse long-term health outcomes 19 20.

The aberrant hemoglobin glycation appears to be linked to frequent exposure of this protein and other cellular macromolecules to high glucose levels.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial DCCT and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study EDIC assessed median HbA1c levels for an intensive therapy cohort treated with insulin over 6.5 years 28.

The luminal surface of proximal TECs has densely packed microvilli allowing the cells to resorb and excrete proteins at a high capacity.
