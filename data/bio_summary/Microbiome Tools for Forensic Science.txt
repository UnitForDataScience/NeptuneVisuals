The application of microbiome technologies for forensic science is particularly exciting because of the potential for a systems biology approach to the complex ecology of decom- position and the human microbiome as they relate to forensic science.

Whether the resulting big data sets are microbial taxa counts or small molecule counts they can be analyzed using predictive computational modeling approaches such as machine learning .Here we discuss recent advances in microbiome and metabolomics approaches and how they are being applied in innovative ways to challenging problems in forensic science.Microbiome DataMicrobiome studies generally focus on bacteria but microbes are found in all three domains of life bacteria Archaea and Eukarya Additionally viruses are sometimes considered part of the microbiome.

These projects include research investigating the recovery of skin microbes and metabolites from different material types and time periods and research investigating the effects of different occupations on skin microbes.The skin microbiome is highly individual to the extent that two people's hands can differ by more than 80 in terms of the types of microbe found therein .

The chemicals foundon the skin originate from personal lifestyle hygiene andor beauty products medication diet  host cells and microbes including molecules that are metabolized by skin microbiota .Due to its superb sensitivity  MS has an important role in forensic science by characterizing the chemical composition of trace evidence collected in crime investigations.

Several research groups have demonstrated the excellent potential for using microbiome data to estimate the PMI  locate clandestine graves  and link people to objects or spaces via their skin microbes .

Advances in DNA sequencing and computational approaches have led to recent breakthroughs in the use of microbiome approaches for forensic science particularly in the areas of estimating post- mortem intervals PMIs locating clandestine graves and obtaining soil and skin trace evidence.

The study of microbiomes has enormous potential for forensic science because microbes are ubiquitous and particular communities of microbes are often associated with specific processes or environments.

An approach integrating microbiome and metabolomic data will improve our ability to accurately predict changes and link people with objects or locations which are key to the practical utility of biological data for the criminal justice system.

The combination of metabolomics and microbiome approaches allows for a better under- standing of the relationships between metabolites and microbes by revealing the chemical milieu in which the microbes and the influence of personal lifestyle on microbial communities and the metabolites they produce or process.Estimating Time since Death with Microbiome Data Death investigations often include an effort to establish how long the deceased has been dead which is not only referred to as the PMI but can also be reported as 'time since death' or 'last known alive'.

Additionally microbiome studies of decomposing humans are possible because of anthropological research facilities which accept human donor bodies for forensic science research.
