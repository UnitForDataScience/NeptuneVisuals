Subsequently the LC-MS data were preprocessed using XCMS software as has been described  R script used for data pre-processing is provided in Additional file The data were normalized to the ion intensity of the internal standards debrisoquine and 4 Nitrobenzoic acid and weight of the fecal pellet.Computational analysis of metabolomics dataNormalized LC-MS data were employed for all down- stream analyses.

We found an increase in plasma levels of phosphatidic acid PA and lyso PA metabolites thatare known to activate pro-inflammatory mTOR signaling directly data not shown On the other hand untar- geted metabolomics data suggest that the metabolic turnover of the gut ecosystem was substantially altered for low radiation doses including a number of spectral features with dose-dependent abundance and potential host metabolic impact leukotriene B4  phenyl acetic acid - sulfocholyl taurine and the L- tryptophan metabolites quinaldic acid and kynurenic acid  Regardless these observations only provide indirect evidence of host-microbiome interactions and therefore additional studies will be required to fully characterize the crosstalk between host-derived signals and the observed dose-dependent responses to radiation reported here.Alternately we employed metabolic network modeling to delineate the association between gut microbial ecology and the collective host-microbiome metabolic output after irradiation.

The overlay of total ion chromatograms showing chromatographic reproduci- bility and mass error using mixture of standards metmix is detailed in Additional file  Figure S4.All initial analyses were performed with putative anno- tated metabolites however a subset of significantly dys- regulated metabolites was subsequently confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry see The UPLC-QTOF raw data files were converted into NetCDF format Network Common Data Form using the data bridge function incorporated in the MassLynx software Waters Corp Milford MA.

Additional ordination and discriminant analysis was performed by means of dis- tance-based redundancy analysis db-RDA using the vegan package in R. Negative binomial statistics were employed to identify differentially abundant taxa and classify them in groups with similar abundance pro- file with increased detection sensitivity for rare taxa.

The preceding findings were recapitulated from the results of linear discrimin- ant analysis LDA effect size LEfSe analysis Additional file Table S3 and Additional file Figure S1.

To this end we employed metabolic net- work modeling - to estimate the community-wide metabolic output of our inferred metagenomes and com- pared these predictions with the abundance of metabo- lites validated using tandem MS in our LC-MS dataset.We mapped our inferred metagenomes and metabolite-putative annotations to a reference set of en- zymatic reactions retrieved from the KEGG database and implemented a modeling framework based on Community-Based Metabolite Potential CMP scores These scores were used as a surrogate for the rela- tive capacity of the inferred metagenome to produce or deplete the metabolite and enabled us to identify a set of well-predicted metabolites by direct comparison to ac- tual metabolomics data see s. Strikingly we found that  30 of the mapped compounds were classi- fied as well predicted Mantel p value and FDR q value 0.01.

However the long-term clinicalconsequences of such functional shifts in the host are largely unknown and will probably be a function of the duration of this transient state and the stability of the altered microbiota.Perturbations in the metabolome of mice exposed to low- dose high LET radiationNext we hypothesized that irradiated samples could be characterized by the differential abundance of specific metabolic products and that some of the metabolic perturbations would correlate with the changes ob- served in the gut microbiome.

Moreover the individual or collective contribu- tion of microbial taxa to specific metabolic pathways has been established in numerous settings However the functional redundancy of the gut microbiome and the complex interactions along the host-microbiome axis can result in a separation between microbial compos- ition and overall metabolic turnover  We have shown above that high LET radiation induces 1 signifi- cant changes in the fecal microbial composition con- comitant with a shift in its predicted functional potential and 2 shifts in the combined host-microbiome meta- bolic output.
