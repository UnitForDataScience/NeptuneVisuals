subsequently the lc-ms data were preprocessed using xcms software as has been described  r script used for data pre-processing is provided in additional file the data were normalized to the ion intensity of the internal standards debrisoquine and 4 nitrobenzoic acid and weight of the fecal pellet.computational analysis of metabolomics datanormalized lc-ms data were employed for all down- stream analyses.

the overlay of total ion chromatograms showing chromatographic reproduci- bility and mass error using mixture of standards metmix is detailed in additional file  figure s4.all initial analyses were performed with putative anno- tated metabolites however a subset of significantly dys- regulated metabolites was subsequently confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry see the uplc-qtof raw data files were converted into netcdf format network common data form using the data bridge function incorporated in the masslynx software waters corp milford ma.

additional ordination and discriminant analysis was performed by means of dis- tance-based redundancy analysis db-rda using the vegan package in r. negative binomial statistics were employed to identify differentially abundant taxa and classify them in groups with similar abundance pro- file with increased detection sensitivity for rare taxa.

still our data show for the first time that even small doses of high let radiation constitute a challenge to the functional resilience of the gut ecosystem.conclusionsour integrative analysis underscored several points firstly there were robust changes in ecological commu- nities harboring the gut microbiota as a consequence ofhigh let exposures 16 o secondly these changes seem to shift the equilibrium towards an increase in op- portunistic pathogens with a concomitant decrease in normal microbiota upon irradiation finally these changes were predicted to induce functional shifts in metabolism both at the level of the predicted enzymatic potential of the perturbed microbiome and of the metab- olome.

microbiome functional shifts and phylotype-level contri- butions to functional shifts were obtained using the fishtaco framework input for fishtaco included a pre-computed otu-ko table from the picrust analysis output from musicc and otu relative abun- dances.

multivariate analysis to determine the effect of the ex- perimental factors on bacterial composition beta diver- sity analysis showed that both time after exposure time hereafter and total dose dose hereafter have a signifi- cant impact on bacterial community structure p values 0.005 and  0.001 respectively anosim nonparamet- ric test on unweighted unifrac distances additional file table s1.

fishtaco deconvolves each functional shift in pairwise case vs. control compar- isons into four different modes 1 case-associated taxa driving functional shift taxa over-represented in cases with enzymatic activity in pathway 2 case-associated taxa reducing functional shift taxa over-represented in cases but with no enzymatic activity in pathway 3 control-associated taxa driving functional shift taxa over-represented in controls with no enzymatic activity in pathway and 4 control-associated taxa reducing functional shift taxa over-represented in controls with enzymatic activity in pathway.

therefore our integrative approach supports the notion that microbiome-mediated changes in the metabolite milieu could play a key role on host- microbiome interactions post-radiation.functional resilience is an important quality of the mi- crobial ecosystem  and can be altered by metabolic cues - bacterial phage activation  and other heterologous competitive relationships - our analysis of predicted functional shifts allowed us to evaluate the impact of specific microbiome compos- itional variations.

the preceding findings were recapitulated from the results of linear discrimin- ant analysis lda effect size lefse analysis additional file table s3 and additional file figure s1.

we found an increase in plasma levels of phosphatidic acid pa and lyso pa metabolites thatare known to activate pro-inflammatory mtor signaling directly data not shown on the other hand untar- geted metabolomics data suggest that the metabolic turnover of the gut ecosystem was substantially altered for low radiation doses including a number of spectral features with dose-dependent abundance and potential host metabolic impact leukotriene b4  phenyl acetic acid - sulfocholyl taurine and the l- tryptophan metabolites quinaldic acid and kynurenic acid  regardless these observations only provide indirect evidence of host-microbiome interactions and therefore additional studies will be required to fully characterize the crosstalk between host-derived signals and the observed dose-dependent responses to radiation reported here.alternately we employed metabolic network modeling to delineate the association between gut microbial ecology and the collective host-microbiome metabolic output after irradiation.

however the long-term clinicalconsequences of such functional shifts in the host are largely unknown and will probably be a function of the duration of this transient state and the stability of the altered microbiota.perturbations in the metabolome of mice exposed to low- dose high let radiationnext we hypothesized that irradiated samples could be characterized by the differential abundance of specific metabolic products and that some of the metabolic perturbations would correlate with the changes ob- served in the gut microbiome.

in particular a significant fraction of highly vari- able features 284 out of 331 were regulated for the lowest dose 0.1 gy and 152 features were statistically significant at this dose only.the identities of significantly dysregulated metabo- lites were confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry see we again observed several classes of features with moderate or no response for the highest dose employed e.g.
