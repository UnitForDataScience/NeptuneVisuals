based on the maximum temperature threshold limit it reaches during the fermentation process daqu is usually classified into three types low-temperature daqu 45 to 50degc medium- temperature daqu mt to daqu 50 to 60degc and high-temperature daqu 60 to 65degc .

temperature dynamics significantly correlated p  0.05 with the quick succession of mt-daqu microbiota in the first 12 d of fermentation while the community structure was rela- tively stable after 12 d. then we explored the effect of temperature on the mt- daqu community assembly.

here we first correlated temporal profiles of microbial community succession with environmental variables temperature moisture and titratable acid- ity in medium temperature daqu mt-daqu throughout fermentation.

this type of bio-heat enrichment rapid temperature increase sustained high temperature and gradual cooling of daqu has also been shown in the microbial community succession in composting and ensiling  .

meanwhile microbial metabolites formed during the fermentation process of daqu may be further converted as intermediates of end flavor components in the baijiu fermentation or dissolve in the final product which is referred to in practice as daqu aroma .the industrial daqu production process usually involves four stages i watering grinding and mixing of raw materials e.g.

in the third stage of the daqu production process once the temperature of daqu bricks reaches a threshold limit craftsmen open the windows of the fermentation room to improve its ventilation.

to explore the effect of temperature on the shaping of functional micro- biota daqu bricks after 4 d of fermentation at the core temperature of 52.5 - 0.8degc were moved to two temperature-controlled fermentation rooms 37degc and 50degc.

on the day 12 of fermentation the temperature in the center of daqu in the t37 group was- 0.5degc while that in the t50 group was 56.4 - 0.4degc.multivariate analysis based on bray-curtis distance matrices showed that bacterial and fungal community structures between the t37 and t50 groups were significantly different p  0.05 see fig.

besides temperature it stands to reason that the acidity and humidity of daqu bricks are also highly correlated with the succession of the fungal community p  0.05 .

in phase i-2 many thermotolerant microorganisms survived in the mt-daqu that could directly participate in the fermentation of grains during the production of baijiu and vinegar they could also secrete various enzymes such as a-amylase glu- coamylase proteases xylanase cmcase and 3-glucosidase  to transform starches and proteins to unique flavors .artificially lowering the temperature in the fermentation room to 37degc resulted in a decrease of the internal temperature of daqu on day 12 46.7 - 0.5degc that was correlated with the decrease of relative abundances of thermotolerant taxa including bacillus thermoactinomyces and thermoascus and .

the results confirmed that the bio-heat produced within daqu bricks was associated with the composition and function of daqu microbiota.

further studies are needed to explore the effects of other intrinsic and extrinsic factors and their interactive effects on the shaping of functional daqu microbiota.to conclude our study revealed that bio-heat was produced within daqu bricks in the first 4 d of fermentation concomitant with rapid microbial propagation.
