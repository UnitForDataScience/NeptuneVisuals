unless otherwise stated pmc11 was incubated at25 nm in 50 ml of pbs ph 7.4 5 mm dtt 0.1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta 1 mm cacl2 and 0.1 chaps at 25 degc with the activity measurement initiated by introduction of increasing amounts of ac-vltk-amc from 400 pm to 400 mm.

pmc11 was incubated at 25 nm in the presence of decreasing amounts of ac-vltk-aomk 5 mm to 10 nm in a reaction buffer consisting of pbs ph 7.4 5 mm dtt 0.1 mm edta 1 mm cacl2 and 0.1 chaps and incubated for 30 min at 37 degc.

ht-29 cell pellet aliquots were thawed and lysed by sonication qsonica q700 sonicator with cup horn attachment temperature 4 degc amplitude 40 time 10 min pulse 10s on 20 s off in 200 mm bicine ph 8.0 0.1 triton x-100 2 mm 4- 2-aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride aebsf 10 mm edta and 10 mm chloracetamide.

after this incubation further protease inhibition was performed for 30 min at 37degc with gentle rocking using 200 mm e64 2 mm aebsf 10 mm edta 0.1 triton x-100 and 10 mm chloracetamide.

the beads were washed and n-terminal peptides were isolated by 1.4 mm tev protease in 50 mm tris ph 8.0 0.5 mm edta and 5 mm dtt at 30 degc overnight.

cells were immediately harvested and resuspended in ice cold 100 mm tris ph 8.0 100 mm nacl and 10 mm imidazole buffer a and subjected to 3 cycles of lysis by microfluidization microfluidics.

proteinused for crystallography was treated with tev protease 1 mg tev per 15 mg of pmc11 and dialyzed overnight at 4 degc in 20 mm tris ph 8.0 150 mm nacl and 0.5 mm tris2-carboxyethylphosphine tcep.

pmc11 was reloaded over a 5 ml ni-nta column pre- equilibrated with 20 mm tris ph 8.0 150 mm nacl and 0.5 mm tcep.

citrate ph 4.0 citrate ph 5.0 phosphate ph 6.0 phosphate ph 7.0 orphosphate ph 8.0 50 mm nacl and 0.1 3-3-cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio-1-propanesulfonate chaps with and without 10 mm dtt  or 5 mm cacl2 .

pmc11 pmc11c179a control or buffer control were incubated at a final concentration of 5 nm in 10 mm phosphate ph 8.0 50 mm nacl and 2 mm dtt with two pools of 114 synthetic peptides.

reversed phase chromatography was performed with a c18 column beh130 1.7 mm bead size 100 mm x 100 mm.

dtt 20 mm was used to quench the chloracetamide reaction before the n- terminal labeling reaction with 1 mm biotin-abu-tev-esterand 1 mm subtiligaseperformed for 2 h at 25 degc.

an analytical column was prepared from 100 mm fused silica pulled to a 5 mm tip by a micropipette puller sutter instrument company model p-2000.this column was then pressure loaded with 10 cm of 3 mm aqua c18 resin.lc-msms.

this protein was incubated at 5 mm with 50 nm active wt pmc11 in a reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm buffer i.e.

cells were harvested or subcultured every 3 days at a ratio of 15 into 150 mm x 25 mm cell culture dishes.
