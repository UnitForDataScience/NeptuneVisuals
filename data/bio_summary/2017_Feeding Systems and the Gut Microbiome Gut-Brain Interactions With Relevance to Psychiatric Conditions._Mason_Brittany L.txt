germ-free mice allowed to develop in the absence of microbiota displayed stress-inducedhyperactivity of the hpa axis suggesting that the microbiota has a regulatory role in stress processing and indeed inoculation with bifidobacteria early in life restored the hpa axis to normal functioning.stress can induce changes in gut microbiota populations with decreased lactobacilli and bacteroides and increased clostridium.probiotics can prevent or reverse stress- induced changes in animal models both physiological hpa-axis activity central and peripheral inflammation increased intestinal permeability and neurotransmitter brain and plasma concentrations and behavioral immo- bility in the forced swim test.these studies present convincing evidence that the gut microbiota are impor- tant physiologic regulators however humans are athinness or interpersonal distrust in an.

the gut microbiota may therefore be contributing to psychiatric illnesses through numerous pathways.gut microbial contributions to psychiatric illnessesowing to the strong integration between the gut and the cns the gut microbiota is gaining attention as a modulator of psychologic processes and mental health.environmental and dietary stress has been shown to affect the population of gut microbiotabut a better understanding of stress and microbiota interactions has developed in recent years and indi- cates some areas which are pertinent to psychiatric illnesses.

new opportunities to modulate existing gut microbiota using probiotics could be novel targets for clinical interventions.psychosomatics 2017 58574-580key words gut microbiota eating disorders appetite stress depression.feeding and emotional expressionconsuming food is a primary way that humans interact with the environment and is vitally important for both physical and mental health.

growing understanding of how integrated bacterial lifeis in the body has shown that gut bacteria regulate basic physiologic processes and are implicated in various disease states and contribute to regulation of mood.responses to stress have effects on feeding behavior and mood and the regulation of the stress response by the gut microbiota could contribute to the dysfunction seen in patients with psychiatric illnesses.

thus the direct interactions between these feeding hormones and mood have implications for psychiatric illnesses particularlythose that have disrupted feeding behavior as a key component of the illness.the stress responsein relation to psychiatric disorders the term stress is normally used to denote the experience of psycholog- ical stress.

an increasingly important component that determines the status of the gut and the signals that are transmitted to the brain is the gut microbiota.the gut microbiotabacteria viruses eukaryotes and archaea make up the gut microbiota with microbial communities thriv- ing both on and inside the human body with specific sites possessing their own distinct microbial commun- ities.the community of bacteria residing in the gi tract includes 1013-1014 total microorganisms predo- minated by two phyla firmicutes and bacteroi- detes.the gut microbiota plays an integral part in the digestive and metabolic systems of its hosts living together and building a community within the gut deriving synergistic function from each other.

the gut microbiota is a known modulator of intestinal permeability and can be modulated to improve intestinal barrier integrity in humans.therefore changes in the gut microbiota could result in reduced intestinal permeability andallow for the effects of gut dysbiosis to reach more of the body including the brain through the peripheral circulation.

changes in both serotonin and 5-hiaa its main metabolite in the hippocampus of germ-free mice compared to conventionally-raised mice indicated that simply being colonized by gut microbiota in early life could affect important mood-regulating neurotransmitters a find- ing which was not changed by colonization of gut microbiota later in development.short-chain fatty acids are directly involved in regulating the expression of feeding hormones including glp-1 and ghrelin which have been implicated as mood regulators.

of note studies indicate that inoculation with particular microbiota can transmit physiological and behavioral phenotypes of the donor to the recipient further implicating microbiota in a direct regulatory role in mammalian physiology.additionally there are novel bioactive bacterial products that contribute to gut regulation and may affect mood in ways that are only beginning to be understood.

therefore changes in gut microbiota either as a consequence of maladaptive feeding behaviors or as a direct contributor to these behaviors are an interesting area of further study for these patient populations.depression and anxietydifferent host and the specific interactions between humans and microbiota may not follow the same patterns as in rodent hosts.

it is therefore key to understand how these relationship function in humans and particularly in psychiatric illnesses.anorexia nervosathe starvation state in an presents a particularly challenging environment for the gut microbiota and study of the gut microbiota's role in an is currently limited.

the pathways linking homeostatic and hedonic feeding systems in brain to gastrointestinal inputs the stress response via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis and the gut microbiota are detailed here.

stress also has significant effects on the gi system including effects on gastric secretion mucosal permeability barrierfunction and gut microbiota.

bifidobacteria was able to reduce physiologic stress cortisol response and psychological anxiety in healthy humans.a recent systematic review of clinical studies using probiotics primarily lactobacillus and bifidobacteria species to affect mood found reason- able support that probiotics could positively affect depressive and anxious symptoms though it is still unclear which probiotics are most effective or which patient populations may be most helped by these interventions.clinical implicationsit is clear that the gut microbiota contributes to regulation of feeding systems and likely has significant effect on the regulation of mood.

following stress many people have a shift in their eating behavior with some eating more and some eating less but there is a noted shift to prefer highly palatable foods independent of the level of overall stress-induced food intake.women with either highor low emotional eating behavior were subjected to the trier social stress test and those who were emotional eaters showed a more pronounced cortisol response and failed to reduce their levels of ghrelin after eating implicating insufficient ghrelin suppression in their behavioral eating response.chronic activation of the hpa axis has wide- ranging effects including alterations in glucose metabolism the promotion of insulin resistance the deposition of abdominal fat and the subsequent overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system.
