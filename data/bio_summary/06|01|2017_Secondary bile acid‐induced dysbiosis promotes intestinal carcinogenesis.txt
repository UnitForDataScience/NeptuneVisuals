However it is challenging to determine the causality between changes of gut microbiota and intestinal tumorigenesis.For many years a high level of deoxycholic acid DCA a secondary bile acid in the intestinal lumen mostly induced by a high dietary fat intake was proposed as a potential pro- carcinogenic agent.9-11 Persistent and repeated exposure ofintestinal epithelium to abnormally high concentrations of DCA appears to induce DNA damage and genomic instabili- ty.12 Several epidemiological studies have highlighted the cor- relation between high physiologic levels of DCA and incidence of CRC1314 although the mechanisms remain elusive.The crosstalk between bile acids and gut microbiota has been established both of which have been studied extensively in intestinal carcinogenesis.15 DCA can be generated from cholic acid by 7a-dehydroxylating bacteria in association with a high-fat diet and is implicated in causation of CRC.1617 In turn studies have shown cholic acid-diet has significant impact upon the community structure of gut microbiota.18-20 However the mechanisms of how gut micro- biota and DCA affect intestinal tumorigenesis remain to be clarified.Our previous study has shown that DCA accelerated the progression of the intestinal adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence under the hereditary background of Apc mutation.16 Here we provide evidence that DCA-mediated intestinal dys- biosis has a crucial role in promoting intestinal tumorigenesis and show that imbalanced gut microbiota impair the intesti- nal barrier function modulate the cytokines and chemokines expressing in the tumor microenvironment and ultimately promote intestinal carcinogenesis via activation of Wnt sig- naling.

Interestingly the composition shift of the gut microbiota observed in DCA-treated Apcmin1 mice was simi- lar to that seen in individuals with a western diet.4243The antimicrobial activity of bile acids was first described in the last century44 although the action of bile acids on typ- ical intestinal bacteria has often been examined in vitro.4546 Previous studies have shown the mechanisms underlying the bactericidal action of bile acids through membrane dam- age.4447 The bactericidal activity of bile acids corresponds to its hydrophobicity which increases its affinity for the phos- pholipid bilayer of the bacterial cell membrane.48 Among bile acids DCA is most toxic for example inclusion of 1 mmolL DCA in growth medium severely can inhibit the growth of many intestinal bacteria including Clostridium per- fringens Bacteroides fragilis lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.46 Therefore it is reasonable to propose that DCA may partici- pate in alteration of the composition of the gut microbiota.

The concentration of FITC-dextran in serum was determined by comparison to the FITC-dextran standard curve.Measurement of deoxycholic acid DCATo exclude the potential role of residual fecal DCA in intesti- nal tumorigenesis liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LCMS was used to detect the concentration of fecal DCA as described previously.22 The DCA concentration in each group was calculated based on the peak areas.Fecal microbiota transplantation FMTDuring feces transfer experiments fresh stool pellets from DCA-treated and -untreated mice followed by 2-weeks' wash- out of DCA were suspended in reduced PBS 0.1 g1 mL homogenized centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min and the super- natant was collected.

Then we draw ait offers genetic advantages mimicking human intestinal ade-noma-adenocarcinoma sequence.40 More importantly a pre- vious study has reported that wild-type mice with a 0.2 DCA supplemented diet developed colon cancers in 45 of mice after 10 months.41 And the level of DCA in feces from DCA diet mice was significantly higher than that from con- trol diet mice 4.6 vs. 0.3 mgg dry weight.9 Similarly in our study the level of fecal DCA in the DCA-treated mice was much higher than the Control group.

P  0.05  P  0.01  P  0.001.Diversity and concentration estimators Shannon and Simpson showed that DCA supplementation significantly increased the value of the Simpson concentration index and decreased the value of the Shannon diversity index sugges- ting that DCA altered diversity in the microbiota.

S1b.Fecal microbiota from DCA-treated Apcmin1 mice promoted intestinal tumorigenesisTo exclude the role of residual fecal DCA before FMT experiments were performed shown in Figure 3a and the concentration of DCA in feces was detected.

b To exclude the role of fecal DCA in intestinal tumorigenesis liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LCMS was used to analyze the fecal DCA con- centrations from DCA group before and after wash out period and control group.

Hence the microbiota of fresh fecal samples from DCA-treated or -untreated donor mice were transplanted to recipient Apcmin1 or wild-type C57BL 6J mice transfer of feces from DCA-treated donors to Apc- min1 mice FMT-D group n 5 12 transfer of feces from DCA-untreated donors to Apcmin1 mice FMT-C group n 5 8 transfer of fecal microbiota from DCA-treated donors to wild-type C57BL6 J mice WD-FMT group n 5 6.Importantly tumorigenesis was transmitted to Apcmin1 mice after the FMT from DCA-treated donors but not to C57BL6J mice.

Furthermore the transfer of feces from DCA- treated mice markedly altered the microbiota community at the species level by reducing butyrate-producing microbiota Clostridium-leptum Eubacterium-corprostanoligenes Rumi- nococcus-flavefaciens and Lachnospiraceae-bacterium-COE1 as shown in Figure 4d.Transfer of feces from DCA-fed Apcmin1 mice induces intestinal low grade inflammationInflammation is a hallmark of cancer which contributes to the development of approximately 15 of malignancies.32 We found that transfer of feces from DCA-treated donorsFigure 5.
