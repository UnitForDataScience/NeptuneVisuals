The elevated levels of 2-PY and 4-PY the end products of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism have previously been reported in urine of DIO mice  and genetically obese dbdb mice .

For example Jung and coworkers reported significantly higher levels of trigonelline in mice fed HF diet compared to those in mice fed high-carbohydrate diet .

Furthermore vildagliptin reduced fumarate levels also whereas no significant changes were seen with liraglutide treatment in the current study Collectively all of the above-mentioned alterations may indicate the downregulation of TCA cycle induced by both therapies which is in agreement with reported upregulation of TCA cycle in HF diet-fed mice .The treatment with liraglutide significantly decreasedtaurine levels compared with the untreated HF diet-fedincrease in hexanoylglycine might be a consequence of upregulated b-oxidation.

Thus anTable 4 Significant correlations between metabolites and biochemical or biometric parameters either as absolute values or as relative values organ weightbody weight ratio all significantly affected by liraglutide treatment in DIO mice.The table shows the results of Pearson's correlation expressed as correlation coefficients with respective significance P  0.05 P  0.01P  0.001 - no significant correlation.2-PY N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide 4-PY N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide BW body weight Per perirenal adipose tissue SCAT subcutaneous adipose tissue SCCAs short-chain carboxylic acids Tot total fat.alternative explanation of decreased 2-PY and 4-PY levels in our study may also lie in the improvement of diabetes compensation per se.The reduced levels of trigonelline which also belongs to the family of nicotinamide metabolites were strongly correlated with body weight glucose and leptin levels measured after liraglutide treatment.

The mice were housed under controlled conditions at a constant temperatureof 22 - 2degC relative humidity 45-65 and fixed daylightcycle 0600-1800 h with 5 mice per cage.

After 13 weeks of HF feeding the average body weight of mice used for theexperiments was 51.14 - 0.56 g which is approximatelytwice the weight of the age-matched lean mice.At this point the mice were divided into two groups with 10 animals per group and placed into separate cages with free access to the HF diet and water.

The results obtained from both tests were overlapped and allowed us to determine theTable 1 Biometric biochemical and hormonal parameters either as absolute values or as relative values organ weight body weight ratio in mice treated with liraglutide vs control mice on high-fat diet at the end of the experiment.The data are presented as the mean- s.e.m.

However the problem is rather comprehensive as the highest level of hexanoylglycine in Boulange study was observed in mice non-responsive to HF diet.In summary our study has revealed numerous metabolic effects induced by liraglutide treatment in mice with diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Boulange and coworkers found increased levels of hexanoylglycine after feeding with HF diet compared with mice fed a low-fat diet  .
