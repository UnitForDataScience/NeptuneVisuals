furthermore vildagliptin reduced fumarate levels also whereas no significant changes were seen with liraglutide treatment in the current study collectively all of the above-mentioned alterations may indicate the downregulation of tca cycle induced by both therapies which is in agreement with reported upregulation of tca cycle in hf diet-fed mice .the treatment with liraglutide significantly decreasedtaurine levels compared with the untreated hf diet-fedincrease in hexanoylglycine might be a consequence of upregulated b-oxidation.

thus antable 4 significant correlations between metabolites and biochemical or biometric parameters either as absolute values or as relative values organ weightbody weight ratio all significantly affected by liraglutide treatment in dio mice.the table shows the results of pearson's correlation expressed as correlation coefficients with respective significance p  0.05 p  0.01p  0.001 - no significant correlation.2-py n1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide 4-py n1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide bw body weight per perirenal adipose tissue scat subcutaneous adipose tissue sccas short-chain carboxylic acids tot total fat.alternative explanation of decreased 2-py and 4-py levels in our study may also lie in the improvement of diabetes compensation per se.the reduced levels of trigonelline which also belongs to the family of nicotinamide metabolites were strongly correlated with body weight glucose and leptin levels measured after liraglutide treatment.

interestingly vildagliptin treatment in our previous study did not have any effect on trigonelline levels   suggesting that its changes might be specific for the treatment with liraglutide.

however the problem is rather comprehensive as the highest level of hexanoylglycine in boulange study was observed in mice non-responsive to hf diet.in summary our study has revealed numerous metabolic effects induced by liraglutide treatment in mice with diet-induced obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

the treatment with liraglutide also significantly decreased fasting glucose leptin and triglyceride levels and it also tended to reduce blood insulin levels .one mouse from liraglutide-treated group had not survived till the end of the experiment therefore this group consists of only 9 animals.results of nmr-based metabolomicsuntargeted analysis visualization of the data through pca did not detect any outliers data not shown.

therefore these changes will not be further discussed.two-week treatment with liraglutide significantly decreased urine levels of nicotinamide metabolites 2-py n1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide 4-py n1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide and trigonelline compared with the control group on hf diet.on the contrary the concentrations of glycine derivatives dimethylglycine and phenylacetylglycine were significantly increased along with the levels of both creatinine and creatine.

the elevated levels of 2-py and 4-py the end products of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism have previously been reported in urine of dio mice  and genetically obese dbdb mice .

for example jung and coworkers reported significantly higher levels of trigonelline in mice fed hf diet compared to those in mice fed high-carbohydrate diet .

the differences between the control and treated group were considered significant at p  0.05.nmr-based metabolomicssample collection urine samples for nmr-based metabolomics were collected twice after 13 weeks on hf diet before the start of liraglutide treatment and subsequently at the end of the experiment after 2 weeks of treatment.

it resulted in eleven metabolites significantly affected by the treatment .in the region between 0.8 and 2.40 ppm the statistical analyses revealed several resonances around 0.85 1.30 1.60 and 2.30 ppm where intensities significantly increased as a result of liraglutide treatment.

to this end we explored the effect of 2-week liraglutide treatment in c57bl6 male mice with obesity and diabetes induced by 13 weeks of high-fat diet using nmr spectroscopy to capture the changesin urine metabolic profile induced by the therapy.
