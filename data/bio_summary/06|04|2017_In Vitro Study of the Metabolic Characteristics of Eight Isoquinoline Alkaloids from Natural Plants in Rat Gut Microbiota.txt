The proposed metabolic pathway of tetrahydropalmatine is shown in Figure B.Identification of Dauricine Metabolites in Rat Intestinal BacteriaThree metabolites together with dauricine were detected by comparison with the blank sample Figure C. The metabolites were marked as M7-M8 according to their HPLC retention times and EICs.

The metabolites of dauricine M7-M8 showed good response in positive ion mode.Owing to the presence of two nitrogen atoms in the structure of dauricine the parent drug and metabolites more easily formed a double-charged ion in positive ion mode therefore the parent drug tR  11.9 min had an M  2H2 at mz 313.1673 2.

The binding modes of compounds to the enzyme were chosen to further optimize the docking conformation according to their binding free energy.ConclusionsIn this study an accurate selective and sensitive method LCMSn-IT-TOF was developed to determine the metabolites of eight isoquinoline alkaloids this method was successfully used for online analysis of the in vitro metabolites in the intestinal flora in our study.

Eight medicinal isoquinoline alkaloids from natural plants were cultured anaerobically with rat gut microbiota and an LCMSn-IT-TOF technique was used to identify the resulting metabolites.

Palmatine tetrahydropalmatine dauricine and tetrandrine containing nitro-hexatomic isoquinoline rings could be easily transformed by the intestinal flora in vitro and a total of nine demethylated metabolites were detected.

This work illustrated that gut microbiota were important in the metabolism of isoquinoline alkaloids.Keywords isoquinoline alkaloids gut microbiota metabolites docking 14a-demethylase LCMSn-IT-TOFIntroductionHuman gut microbiota represents a complex community of vast and diverse microorganisms that reside in the digestive system and contain a hundred times more genes than our own human genome .

These enzymes can interact with drugs and generate many metabolites that differ from those that are generated by other host organs  which indicates that the intestinal flora has a good metabolic capacity.

HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization ESI--ion trap-time of flight mass spectrometry LCMSn-IT-TOF was employed to identify and characterize the metabolites.
