the metabolites of dauricine m7-m8 showed good response in positive ion mode.owing to the presence of two nitrogen atoms in the structure of dauricine the parent drug and metabolites more easily formed a double-charged ion in positive ion mode therefore the parent drug tr  11.9 min had an m  2h2 at mz 313.1673 2. the ms2 spectrum of dauricine had fragments at mz 297.6498 2 m - 32 da and ms3 spectrum had fragments at mz 290.6039 2 m - 32 da - 14 da mz 282.1284 2 m - 32 da - 14 da - 16 da.m7 tr  11.4 min showed a quasi-molecular ion of m  2h2 at mz 306.1574 2 and the ms2 spectrum had fragments at mz 290.6376 2 m - 32 da mz 282.1292 2 m - 32 da - 16da.

the metabolites of tetrahydropalmatine m5-m6 showed good response in the positive ion mode.the parent drug tr  13.5 min had an m  h at mz 356.1867. the mass spectral data of the parent drug and metabolites are listed in table .m5 tr  12.6 min had an m  h at mz 342.1662 based on the mz value of m5 which hada loss of a ch2 from tetrahydropalmatine it was obtained from demethylation of the parent.m6 tr  11.8 min had an m  h at mz 328.1471. the mz value of m6 was 14 da lower than that of m5 and 28 da lower than that of the parent drug which indicated that m6 was formed by loss of two ch2 groups from the parent drug or a ch2 group from m5 via a demethylation reaction.in summary the two metabolites of tetrahydropalmatine that were detected in the rat intestinal bacteria incubation system were generated by the loss of one or two ch2 groups through demethylation reactions.

compared with the fragmentations of the parent drug mz 313.1673 2 it was suggested that the mz value of m7 mz 306.1574 2 was 14 da lower which indicated that m7 was formed by the loss of a ch2 group from the parent drug.the isomers m8-1 tr  12.6 min and m8-2 tr  14.8 min both had m  2h2 peaks at mz299.1083 2. the ms2 spectrum had fragments at mz 283.6370 m - 32 da and the ms3 spectrum had fragments at mz 268.1075 m - 32 da - 14 da - 16 da.

in contrast no metabolites of the other four isoquinoline alkaloids in intestinal microflora were detected in this study.figure 1. the chemical structure of eight isoquinoline alkaloids palmatine tetrahydropalmatine dauricine tetrandrine sinomenine homoharringtonine harringtonine and galanthamine.identification of palmatine metabolites in rat intestinal bacteriafour metabolites together with palmatine were detected by comparison with a blank sample figure a. the metabolites were marked as m1-m4 according to their hplc retention times and extracted ion chromatograms eics.

in this study we present eight medicinal isoquinoline alkaloids palmatine tetrahydropalmatine dauricine tetrandrine sinomenine homoharringtonine harringtonine and galanthamine as research topic to demonstrate the significance of drug metabolism by gut microbiota.the eight isoquinoline alkaloids have a wide range of pharmacological activity.

an accuracy error threshold of 20 ppm was set as a limit to the calculation of possible elemental compositions.table 2. hplc analytical conditions of eight isoquinoline alkaloids.compoundstime minmobile phaseflow rateabmlmin-1detection wavelength nmcolumn temperature cmolecular docking between eight isoquinoline alkaloids and 14a-demethylasediscovery studio client software v16.1.0.15350 was used to compute the possible interaction of eight isoquinoline alkaloids on 14a-demethylase whose crystal structures are available in the protein data bank .

the proposed metabolic pathway of dauricine is shown in figure c and the mass spectral data of dauricine and its metabolites are listed in table .identification of tetrandrine metabolites in rat intestinal bacteriasimilar to dauricine tetrandrine which eluted at 12.9 min contained two nitrogen atoms and formed a double-charged ion in positive ion mode had an m  2h2 at mz 312.1678 2.two metabolites together with the tetrandrine were detected by comparison with the blank sample figure d. the metabolites were marked as m9 according to its hplc retention times and extracted ion chromatograms eics.

after mixing the cultures were incubated under anaerobic conditions n2 atmosphere at 37 c for 60 min and the culture solution containing intestinal bacteria was collected.sample preparationthe sample preparation of the eight isoquinoline alkaloids for the in vitro metabolism experiment was as follows two milligrams of each compound palmatine tetrahydropalmatine dauricine tetrandrine sinomenine homoharringtonine harringtonine and galanthamine was weighed and dissolved in 1 ml methanol.

the metabolites of dauricine m9 showed good responses in positive ion mode.m9-1 tr  10.5 min and m9-2 tr  12.0 min were isomers both had a quasi-molecular ion of m  2h2 at mz 305.1561 2. their molecular weights were 14 da less than that of tetrandrine which suggested that they were obtained by the loss of one ch2 group from tetrandrine.in summary the two metabolites of tetrahydropalmatine that were detected in the rat intestinal bacteria incubation system were generated by the loss of one ch2 group through the demethylation reaction.

our present study revealed that gut microbiota will be an important factor for an improved understanding of metabolic mechanism for these isoquinoline alkaloids in vivo.in this study eight isoquinoline alkaloids either with a hexatomic ring or with a heptatomic ring were incubated anaerobically with rat intestinal bacteria.

based on the results we obtained preliminary knowledge of a possible metabolic pathway for these isoquinoline alkaloids in intestinal flora in vitro subsequently we performed a computer-assisted docking analysis of the initial step of the metabolism reaction catalyzed by the sterol 14a-demethylase and indicated that the biotransformation of the isoquinoline alkaloids potentially related to the chemical structure with hexatomic ring of the parent drugs.

the results will therefore provide partial evidence to further explore the clinical efficacy of drugs from the aspect of gut microbiota.results and discussionto investigate the metabolism of isoquinoline alkaloids figure  palmatine tetrahydropalmatine dauricine tetrandrine sinomenine homoharringtonine harringtonine and galanthamine in gut microbiota we incubated all the compounds with colonic material.

thus the computational results were validated by the in vitro experiments palmatine tetrahydropalmatine dauricine and tetrandrine could be easily transformed to demethylated metabolites but the other four isoquinoline alkaloids could not undergo the biotransformation suggesting that demethylase cyp51 might be an important bacterial enzyme in these reactions and cyp51 or other metabolic enzymes with similar functions might exist in the gut microbiota.
