The results for all 531 known metabolites contributing to each pathway are shown in Supplemental Table 7.A few additional metabolites were among the most stronglyassociated metabolites P  0.0005.

Effects of dietary sodium on metabolites the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DASH-Sodium Feeding StudyAndriy Derkach1 Joshua Sampson1 Justin Joseph12 Mary C Playdon1 and Rachael Z Stolzenberg-Solomon11Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics National Cancer Institute NIH Rockville MD and 2Department of Chemistry Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond VAABSTRACTBackground High sodium intake is known to increase blood pres- sure and is difficult to measure in epidemiologic studies.Objective We examined the effect of sodium intake on metabolites within the DASH Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial- Sodium Trial to further our understanding of the biological effects of sodium intake beyond blood pressure.Design The DASH-Sodium Trial randomly assigned individuals to either the DASH diet low in fat and high in protein low-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables or a control diet for 12 wk.

Metabolon grouped the metabolites into 9 chemical classes amino acids carbohydrates cofactors and vitamins energy me- tabolites lipids nucleotide metabolites peptides and xenobiotics and metabolic subpathways based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes classifications 7.

Additional analyses on unknown metabolites detected 2 statistically significant metabolites Plin  1025 that were highly correlated to g-glutamyliosoleucine and g-glutamylleucine Supplemental Table 6 no metabolite detected in 50 of participants was significant at Q  0.1.The most strongly associated pathway was the fatty acid group in which the short-chain fatty acid isovalerate decreased and the lipids butyrylcarnitine and valerylcarnitine increased with sodium reduction.

Three xenobiotic metabolites increased with low sodium intake within the benzoate metabolism pathway including 4-ethylphenysulfate which reached Bonferroni signifi- cance Plin  5.85 3 10210 other significant metabolites in this pathway included 4-methylcatechol sulfate and O-methylcatechol sulfate.

The strongest associations were observed in the fatty acid food plant component benzoate methionine and tryptophan pathways with metabolites that mostly increased with the low-sodium intervention and metabolites in the g-glutamyl amino acid pathway that decreased with sodium restriction.

Although speculative it is possible that compared with high sodium intake sodium restriction decreases g-glutamyl transferase activity via reduction of oxidative stress and accounts for the significantdecreases in g-glutamyl amino acid metabolites we observed.Metabolites within the tryptophan metabolism pathway par- ticularly indole-related metabolites significantly increased with sodium restriction.

More research is needed to understand how sodium intake impacts tryptophan-related metabolites 4- hydroxyophenylpyruvate and the biochemical relation between these metabolites.A few additional metabolites that changed with sodium re- striction deserve mention.

Finally an experimental study that explored differences in metabolites owing to genetic variation in Dahl SS rats compared with normotensive consomic SS.13 rats showed that 23 metabolites differed P  0.05 between the 2 animal groups 42.

Although they were not subsequently validated with pure compounds the methods used to identify metabolites in our study are based on a multiple orthogonal criteria linkage to a unit mass spectral library built from authentic stan- dards which has been shown to accurately identify metabolites 6 43.
