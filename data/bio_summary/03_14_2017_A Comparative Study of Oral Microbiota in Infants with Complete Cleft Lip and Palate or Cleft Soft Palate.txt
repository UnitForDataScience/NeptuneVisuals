Early oral health maintenance program in patients with CLP should be reinforced.Further research on early oral microbiota of patients with oral clefts and its effect on later infectious diseases of the oral cavity especially dental caries and periodontal diseases is needed.Conflicts of InterestAll participating authors of this study have no conflicts of interest.AcknowledgmentsThe authors are grateful to Professor Wojciech Kro'l who initiated the project enabled conducting microbiological tests and had substantial contributions to the conception of the study.

The frequency of the occurrence of the remaining bacteria changed insignificantly Table .DiscussionThe study presents the prevalence of oral microbiota in several-day old newborns with CLP and CSP and changes in microbial population during the infant predental periodprior to surgical procedure which has not previously been described in the literature.The prevalence of nonpathogenic commensal oral bac- teria i.e.

These conditions are favourable for the development of a diverse ecosystem based on the interactions between bacteria and the host environ- ment The early oral microbiota occurring within several hours following delivery is composed of viridans streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius S. salivarius which are commensals permanently colonising the oral cavity  Along with other bacteria they participate in the formation of a colonisation cascade that determines future indigenous microbiota   .Congenital orofacial malformation affects the structure and functions of the oral cavity thereby significantly modi- fying its characteristics As a result such malformations may exert influence on the microbiota of the environment.

A significant part of the oral microbiota in the early neonatal period originates from the mother and istransient population of microorganisms consisting of intesti- nal bacteria in neonates born naturally The resident microbiota in this period depends mainly on external factors including gestational age mode of delivery type of feeding the length of hospital stay following delivery and general condition  The complex structure of the oral cavity with its numerous recesses the mucosal folds of the palate and the invaginations of the cheeks and tongue creates niches with different pH values local oxygen concentrations redoxstates ionic compositions buffer capacities hydration access to saliva and mechanical interactions.

Dys- morphia of the oral cavity in patients with this malformation affects the dorsal part of the oral and nasal cavities which are characterised by significantly reduced communication compared to CLP 16.Previous studies have confirmed that patients with oro- facial cleft are at increased risk for the development of caries and periodontal diseases compared to noncleft children  .

The majority of streptococci collected from the palate and the tongue showed abundant growth in both CLP and CSP group.-haemolytic streptococci were not found in CLP or CSP group subjects in the neonatal period.

The development of the microbiota in CLP subjects was characterised by a significant increase in the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria.This paper is dedicated to the memory of colleague and friend Professor Wojciech Kro'l who recently diedIntroductionThe oral cavity which remains sterile throughout prenatal development becomes a diverse ecosystem colonised by numerous microorganisms during the first hours following delivery.
