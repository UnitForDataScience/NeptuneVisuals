one genetic mutation filaggrin mutation has been identified as a strong risk factor for ato- pic dermatitis as this mutation is strongly related to loss of skin bar- rier function.910 filaggrin mutation is generally present among approximately 50 of patients with atopic dermatitis compared to 10 in the general population and cases with filaggrin mutations tend to have an earlier onset.9in parallel with the increase in atopic dermatitis the use of antibiotics has increased markedly and is now at the highest level as the statens serum institut in denmark started to monitor the use in 1995.11 maternal use of antibiotics in pregnancy influences the maternal microbiome and hence the very early colonization of the child's own microbiome during pregnancy birth and breast-feeding in early life.2 perinatal and post-natal exposure to antibiotics has almost consistently been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis in both human and murine models.12-17 however evi- dence for a role of prenatal antibiotic exposure is scarce inconsis- tent and does not take timing of exposure into account.1018-21 four studies found an increased risk of atopic dermatitis among children exposed to prenatal antibiotics and one study found no associa- tion.18 furthermore one study found an indication of an additive effect from prenatal antibiotic exposure and caesarean delivery on atopic dermatitis at 1 year of age.22the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the associa- tion between prenatal antibiotic exposure and atopic dermatitis among children at 18 months taking the timing of exposure in preg- nancy mode of delivery and maternal atopy into account.

chal- lenged the results in a registry-based study investigating maternal antibiotic use in 80 weeks before and after pregnancy among 910 301 mother-child pairs.4041 the study showed a similar association with maternal antibiotics in the 80 weeks before and after pregnancy inde- pendent of antibiotics in pregnancy and the authors concluded that maternal propensity for infections due to insufficient immune function is may be the underlying link between prenatal antibiotics and off- spring asthma.41 these findings argue against the hypothesis that the association between prenatal antibiotics and atopic dermatitis acts through the microbiome of the mother during pregnancy birth and breast-feeding.

investigated antibiotics in the 3rd trimester only and found no association with atopic dermatitis at 3 years of age among 411 children in the prospective clinical study copenhagen study on asthma in childhood.10 however none of the studies mentioned above investigated the effect of prenatal antibiotics and offspring atopic dermatitis in atopic and non-atopic mothers934  separately.

discussion  main findingsamong children born by atopic mothers use of prenatal antibiotics was associated with increased odds of atopic dermatitis if antibiotics were used in all three trimesters.

conducted a cross-sectional study of 24 690 children in the united kingdom and found that prenatal antibiotics were associated with atopic dermatitis in a dose-response-related manner.32 in line with our findings the study showed the effect from prenatal antibiotics to be strongest after exposure to 2 prescrip- tions.32 sariachvili et al.

this finding is in support of the hypothesis that reduced intestinal microbiota diversity during the first months of life may be linked to subsequent allergic diseases including atopic dermatitis.tabl e 4 odds ratios or for maternal-reported atopic dermatitis according to prenatal antibiotic exposure adjusted for prenatal smoking socio-economic status and older siblings stratified by maternal atopy and mode of deliveryamaternal atopymaternal self-reported asthma hay fever food allergy or ezcema.b1st-2nd trimester was defined gestation wk 0-29.c3rd trimester was defined gestation wk 30-birth.however as the indication for prescription of antibiotics is infec- tion and other potentially serious conditions this study will often not justify that use antibiotics is abandoned.

found that the association between prenatal antibiotics and atopic der- matitis persisted even after adjustment for post-natal antibiotics.19 our study did not take post-natal antibiotics and indirect antibiotic exposure through breast-feeding into account.
