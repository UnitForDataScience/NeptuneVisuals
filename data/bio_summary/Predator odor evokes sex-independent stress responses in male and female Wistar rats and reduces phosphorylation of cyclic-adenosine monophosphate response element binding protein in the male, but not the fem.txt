tmt exposure activates the hpa axis and increases peripheral blood glucose in both male and female ratsanimals exposed to tmt exhibited significantly increased corticosterone in male t7.0 with correction 5 4.14 p  .01 and female t14 5 2.35 p  .05 rats compared with same sex dmso-exposed animals table 1. tmt exposure also increased blood glucose in male t14 5 2.41 p  .05 and female rats t14 5 2.84 p  .05 compared with same sex control animals exposed to dmso table 1. these results show that tmt exposure evokes a stress response with similar activation of the hpa axis and hyperglycemia in male and female wistar rats.
