In contrast pCREB relative to b-tubulin was not affected by TMT exposure in the female DG t14 5 0.19 p 5 0.85 CA3 t14 5 0.87 p 5 .40 or CA1 t14 5 1.32 p 5 .21 hippocampal subregions Figure 2B.

TMT exposure did not affect PKA substrate immunoreactivity in the DG t14 5 1.47 p 5 .16 CA3 t14 5 0.08 p 5 .94 or CA1 t6.46 with Welch's cor-rection for unequal variance 5 1.57 p 5 .16 subregions of the female hippocampus Figure 3B.

EXPERIMENT 1 BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO TMT AND HIPPOCAMPUS SIGNALING Experimental conditionsOn the day of exposure male n 5 16 total and female n 5 16 total rats were randomly assigned to either environmental control n 5 8 each MF or TMT exposure groups n 5 8 each MF.

In contrast TMT exposure selectively increased pERK relative to total ERK in the female DG t8.86 with correction 5 3.27p  .01 but had no effect in the CA3 t14 5 0.47 p 5 .65 or CA1 t14 5 0.57 p 5 0.58 subregions of the hippocampus Fig- ure 2D.

Both control and TMT-exposed groups learned the task in a similar amount of trials t13 5 1.32 p 5 .21 Figure 5B with comparable accu- racy t13 5 0.74 p 5 0.47 Supporting Information Figure 2A and latency t13 5 0.79 p 5 .44 Supporting Information Figure 2B.Twenty-four hours following acquisition animals were tested for performance on the water plus-maze.

During the test session DMSO and TMT-exposed animals exhibited similar numbers of correct trials t 13 5 0.41 p 5 .69 Figure 5C number of errors t13 5 0.31 p 5 .76 Supporting Information Figure 2A and latency to escape t7.70 with correction 5 1.55 p 5 .14 Supporting Information Figure 2B.

TMT-exposed male t8.21 with correction 5 5.76 p  .001 and female t8.69 with correction 5 4.51 p  .01 rats also exhibited reduced preference for the side of the arena containing TMT Table 1 as a function of time male FTMT3time 560 5 4.30 p  .01 female FTMT3time570 5 5.49 p  .001 Figure 1EF.

Expression of phosphorylated S180 Jacob relative to NeuN expression was unaffected by TMT exposure in the dorsal t5.30 with correction 5 1.71 p 5 .14 and ventralt10 5 1.74 p 5 .11 hippocampus Supporting Information Figure 1B.

TMT exposure did not affect freezing epi- sodes FTMTtrial114 5 0.39 p 5 .54 or duration FTMT3trial114 5 0.36 p 5 .56 Supporting Information Figure 2C during contextual re-introduction.

Both male FTMT3time560 5 11.86 p  .001 and female rats FTMT3time570 5 8.63 p  .001 exhibited changes in hori- zontal crossing as a function of time with increased activity during the first 10 min of TMT exposure and decreased activity relative to controls after10 min of exposure Figure 1CD.
