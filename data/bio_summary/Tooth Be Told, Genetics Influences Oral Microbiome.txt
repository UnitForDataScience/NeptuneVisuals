2017 demonstrate that choline metabolism by gut bacteria plays a signif-icant role in modulating host access to this resource Romano et al.

Whether increased abundances of the heritable taxa at other body sites associate with health rather than disease is another open question.Given that a sizeable proportion of common oral microbe abundances are heritable the next question is which host genes genetic variants and physiolog- ical processes potentially underlie thisheritability Human saliva and mucosal surfaces contain a number of molecules encoded by the host genomes that likely play a role in the process including mucins immune compounds enzymes and taste receptors .

observed to be associated with host genetic variation are now reported as heritable by Gomez et al.

2017 hypothe- sized that the bacterial strains able to couple nitrate respiration with choline usage could bear an evolutionary advan- tage in the inflamed gut as previously sug- gested Winter et al.

For example are the non-bacterial members of the oral microbiome such as Candida albicans which is an indicator of oral health also heritable Do the heritable oral bacteria identified in children remain heritable in adults How do modern oral hygiene practices affect estimates of heritability Would oral microbiomes collected from populations that do not regularly visit dentists or use toothpastes with anti-community.

Would the heritability of gut microbe abundances be higher in children than in the current estimates from adultsAnother difference between gut and oral sites is the relationship of heritable taxa to the rest of the microbialCell Host  Microbe 22 September 13 2017 a 2017 Elsevier Inc. 251Cell Host  MicrobePreviewsFigure 1.

Additionally in saliva from the HMP study genus Leptotrichia was associated with genetic variants on chromosome 15 while in the twin study a Leptotrichia OTU is highly heritable h2  0.54.The role of the host genetics in deter- mining oral microbiomes seems to differ from its role in the gut the most well- studied body site to date.

2017 demonstrate that choline-utilizing gut bacteria compete with their host for this essential resource calling for a systematic consideration of gut microbial composition for personalized diet recommendations.Choline is an essential nutrient abundant in diet especially in high-protein-contain- ing food such as eggs red meat soy beans and wheat germs.

To test this hypothesis they developed a gnotobiotic model consisting of adult germ-free mice associated with a simplified gut micro- biota composed of five bacteria common in the human gut that are unable to metab- olize choline and added either a wild-type choline-consuming E. coli CC ora cutC knockout DcutC non-choline consuming mutant strain CC-.

Following ingestion some dietary choline is transformed by the gut microbial enzyme choline trimethylamine TMA lyase into TMA and acetaldehyde.
