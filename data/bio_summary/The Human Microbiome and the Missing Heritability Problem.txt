It follows that estimates of heritability of weight gain in familial studies may seriously overestimate the role of human genetics heritability up to 90 compared to 2 in GWAS and in accordance to our hypothesis probably such heritability arises from linear genetic effects of the microbes that are shared in such families.We suggest that most estimates of the heritability of BMI and other human phenotypes will be significantly improved if the similarity between microbial composition and function is taken into account.To make this paper self-contained we first reviewed the role of the microbiota in physiology.

After this categorization of each microbial genefunction for each individual the effect size can then be calculated asx- - uCONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTSTo summarize the ideas presented in this paper we consider human weight as an example of a trait where both human and microbial genetics are key factors to understand the missing heritability problem.

Since h2estimates the linear contribuition ofphenotype using human genotypes obtained from GWAS gjirepresents the ith genotype of the jth individual with values.gji0 1 2 depending on the jth individual being homozygous for the major allele 0 heterozygous 1 orgenetic microbial components to the heritability of a phenotypeit can be directly added to the heritability calculated through GWAS.

Nonetheless heritability calculations that only consider human genetic variables may lead to incomplete results as there is a close relationship between our genetics and our microbial communities.THE GENETIC CONTEXT OF OUR MICROBIAL COMMUNITIESThe human body does not only provide a relatively stable and rich environment for its microbes but also affects their composition and behavior.

This high personalization suggests a deep relationship between human genetics and microbial composition supporting the idea that phenotypic resemblance within individuals may come not only from human genes but also from microbial ones.
