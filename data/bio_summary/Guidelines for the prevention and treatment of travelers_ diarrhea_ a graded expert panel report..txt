Qualifying Remarks Caution should be exercised in provision of rifaximin as empirical therapy of moderate diarrhea in regions or itineraries in which high risk of invasive patho- gens are anticipated.Loperamide may be used as adjunctive therapy for moderate to severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation high level of evidence.Loperamide may be considered for use as monotherapy in moderate travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation high level of evidence.Therapy in severe travelers' diarrheaAntibiotics should be used to treat severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation high level of evidence.Azithromycin is preferred to treat severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation moderate level of evidence.Fluoroquinolones may be used to treat severe nondysenteric travelers' diarrhea Weak recommendation moderate level of evidence.Rifaximin may be used to treat severe nondysenteric travelers' diarrhea Weak recommendation moderate level of evidence.Single-dose antibiotic regimens may be used to treat moderate or severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation high level of evidence.Follow-up and diagnostic testingMicrobiologic testing is recommended in returning travelers with severe or persistent symptoms or in those who fail empiric therapy Strong recom- mendation lowvery low level of evidence.Molecular testing aimed at a broad range of clinically relevant pathogens is preferred when rapid results are clinically important or non-molecular tests have failed to establish a diagnosis ungraded.

We offer the follow- ing definitions to consider post-infectious FBD and IBS in the returning traveler.Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome PI-IBS and Functional Bowel Disease PI-FBD PI-IBS or PI-FBD are diagnosed by Rome III or Rome IV criteria after a bout of TD in a traveler without pre-travel gastrointestinal disease where the evaluation for microbial etiologies and underly- ing GI disease is negative.ProphylaxisAntimicrobial prophylaxis should not be used routinely in travelers Strong recommendation lowvery low level of evidence.Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be considered for travelers at high risk of health-related complications of travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation lowvery low level of evidence.Bismuth subsalicylate BSS may be considered for any traveler to prevent travelers' diarrhea Strong recommen- dation high level of evidence.When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated rifaximin is recommended Strong recommendation moderate level of evidence.Fluoroquinolones are not recommended for prophy- laxis of travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation low very low level of evidence.Summary of the EvidenceThere is strong evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials RCT that depending on compound and destination antimicrobials demonstrate prevention of classically defined TD in about 58 to 88 of travelers.By contrast studies demon- strating the benefit of antimicrobials in primary or secondary prevention of long-term health consequences that have been strongly linked to TDsuch as irritable bowel syndrome react- ive arthritis and Guillain-Barre' syndrome are absent.

Acute diarrhea antibiotic treatment recommendationsaAntibiotic regimens may be combined with loperamide 4 mg first dose then 2 mg dose after each loose stool not to exceed 16 mg in a 24 hour period.bIf symptoms are not resolved after 24 hours continue daily dosing for up to 3 days.cUse empirically as first line in Southeast Asia and India to cover fluoroquinolone resistant Campylobacter or in other geographical areas if Campylobacter or resistant ETEC are suspected.dPreferred regimen for dysentery or febrile diarrhea.eDo not use if clinical suspicion for Campylobacter Salmonella Shigella or other causes of invasive diarrhea.Therapy in Severe Travelers' DiarrheaAntibiotics should be used to treat severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation high level of evidence.Azithromycin is preferred to treat severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation moderate level of evidence.Fluoroquinolones may be used to treat severe nondy- senteric travelers' diarrhea Weak recommendation mod- erate level of evidence.Rifaximin may be used to treat severe nondysenteric travelers' diarrhea Weak recommendation moderate level of evidence.Single-dose antibiotic regimens may be used to treat moderate or severe travelers' diarrhea Strong recom- mendation high level of evidence.Summary of the EvidenceThe decision to treat TD with non-specific anti-diarrheal medi- cations andor an antimicrobial agent is based on assessment of the severity of illness and the effects it will have on the traveler's activities and plans.

The panel was made up of 15 voting members with support from 3 non-voting members.Identifying and Reviewing the EvidenceKey Questions and Systematic Search The GOC developed a list of key clinical questions based on their knowledge of prac- tice gaps among practitioners managing cases of TDShould antibiotic prophylaxis be considered for some trav- elers and if so what traveler characteristics should prompt consideration of prophylaxis and with what agentsWhat diagnostic modalities should be employed in travelers with diarrhea andor persistent abdominal symptomsGiven growing recognition of MDR colonization in return- ing travelers how should travelers be directed with respect to 1 expectant management 2 Over-the-counter OTC agents for symptom management 3 antibiotic use or 4 seeking care during travelIn the context of MDR acquisition how can providers clearly and effectively convey the risks and benefits of TD treatment including acute and chronic consequences and community risks when counseling on antibiotic use while travelingHow does our knowledge and potential manipulation of the microbiome in the setting of TD influence practice rec- ommendations or future researchQuestions were formulated as explicit or implicit PICO ques- tions population of interest intervention comparison and out- come or related contextual questions which inform the PICO questions.

Qualifying Remarks No studies have been published as of yet which show that using these tests improves patient outcomes.Additional consensus statements ungradedThere is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of commercially available prebiotics or probiotics to prevent or treat travelers' diarrhea.Studies are needed on changes in the gut microbiome in travelers with and without diarrhea to clarify the benefits and harms of current and novel preventive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.There is an incrementally increasing association between travel travelers' diarrhea and antibiotic use with the acquisition of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Until such studies are conducted an evidence-based recommendation for their use cannot be made.Additional Consensus StatementsThere is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of commercially available prebiotics or probiotics to pre- vent or treat travelers' diarrhea ungraded.Studies are needed on changes in the gut microbiome in travelers with and without diarrhea to clarify the bene- fits and harms of current and novel preventive diagnos- tic and therapeutic approaches ungraded.There is an incrementally increasing association be- tween travel travelers' diarrhea and antibiotic use with the acquisition of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Email These authors contributed equally to the development and drafting of this clinical practice guideline.Editorial decision 8 March 2017 Accepted 10 March 2017AbstractBackground Travelers' diarrhea causes significant morbidity including some sequelae lost travel time and oppor- tunity cost to both travelers and countries receiving travelers.

Studies have also evaluated various antibiotic regimens in com- bination with loperamide and randomized controlled trials RCT demonstrate improved efficacy compared to antibiotics alone when evaluating duration of post-treatment symptoms and clinical cure.While a number of guidelines are currently available which dis-cuss recommendations around prevention management and treat- ment of travelers' diarrhea-new data are emerging which may have an impact on recommendations provided to travelers.

Qualifying Remarks Emergence of resistance to this class of drug though without strong evidence of clinical failure outside of SE Asia combined with the potential for adverse dysbiotic reduction in diversity of intestinal microbiota and musculoskeletal consequences contribute important uncertainties to the risk- benefit assessment and underlie a non-unanimous GRADE of this recommendation.Azithromycin may be used to treat moderate travelers' diarrhea Strong recommendation high level of evidence.Rifaximin may be used to treat moderate travelers' diarrhea Weak recommendation moderate level of evidence.
