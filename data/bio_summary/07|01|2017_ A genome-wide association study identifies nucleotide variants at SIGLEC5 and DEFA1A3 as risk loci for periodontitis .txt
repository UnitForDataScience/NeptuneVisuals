The poten- tial impact of population stratification as well as the overall significance of the GWAS results were evaluated using quantile- quantile plots and genomic inflation factors k.Selection of SNPs for validation and replicationWe selected SNPs to validate their association with CP which complied with the following criteria in the combined AgP case- control sample  combined P value GER th NL Pmeta  10-5 unadjusted for MDS components we preassigned this signifi- cance threshold as being indicative of suggestive evidence of as- sociation with disease   Pmeta  Pger and Pmeta  Pnl  SNPs within strong linkage disequilibrium LD r2  0.8 in 1000GP3-EUR show association with AgP Pmeta  10-3 in the combined sample.

SNPs  500 kb distance to each other among the remaining SNPs were clumped into linked loci and the SNP with the lowest P value was kept.Imputed genotype information was lacking in the validation cohort of CP for seven SNPs and we attempted to replace theseseven with the best surrogates based on linkage disequilibrium LD using genotypes of the European reference population EUR of 1000 genomes.

To compensate this we replaced four missing lead SNPs that were tested in AgP-GER-NL and CP by neighboring SNPs with strong or complete LD based on genotypes of the EUR ref- erence population SNPs rs1380780 rs17340482 rs4791202 rs747804 were replaced by rs1380781 r214 1 rs4970469 r214 0.97 rs10238400 r214 0.9 and rs13283964 r214 1 respectively.

SNPs rs4970469 nearest genes NUDC and TRNP1 and rs10238400 nearest genes RPL10P11 and GNAI1 were genotyped on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System at the ICMB CAU Kiel on 384-well plates using TaqMan assays hCV3230478 and hCV11216204 respectively Thermo Fisher Scientific USA as recently described .The Turkish GWAS controls N 14 489 were genotyped on HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip human array Illumina USA as described before .Quality control and filteringPrior to the GWAS analysis we applied several quality control QC steps on the GER and NL AgP cases and controls using the software PLINK v1.07  which reduced the number of SNPs and individuals as shown in the detailed summary of the QC and filtering steps in Supplementary Material Table S4.

Then the imputation of ungenotyped SNPs was carried out for the re- sulting haplotypes using the 1000G Phase 3 data and Impute v2 .Association testing and meta-analysisAssociations of SNPs with AgP in both GER and NL were tested with SNPTEST v2.5.2 using an additive model with 1 degree of freedom with the binary variables sex and smoking status never smoked 14 0 ever smoked14 1 as covariates .

Accordingly no conclusion on a potential role for the etiology of CP can be drawn for these SNPs.Replication in a Turkish AgP sampleWe replicated the associations of the 15 SNPs which were vali- dated with CP in an additional AgP case-control sample of Turkish descent Supplementary Material Table S1.

However the ORs of multiple SNPs was consistent with ORs in the discovery and resulted in stron- ger associations after pooling with the AgP discovery sample and .Meta-analysis of all samplesThe final meta-analysis included all AgP samples and the CP validation samples.

We now expand the GWAS in a sample of 896 AgP cases and 7104 controls from Germany GER and The Netherlands NL validated the most sig- nificant associations in a GWAS of 2211 German CP cases and 1817 controls  and replicated the variants that were shared be- tween AgP and CP in an independent AgP sample from Turkey 220 cases 550 controls.

After the QC steps we retained 502332 intersecting autosomal SNPs in 680 cases and 3973 controls in GER and 554855 intersecting autosomal SNPs in 171 cases and 2607 controls in NL.
