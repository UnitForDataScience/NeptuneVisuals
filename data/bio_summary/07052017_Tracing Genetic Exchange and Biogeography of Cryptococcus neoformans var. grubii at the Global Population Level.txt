To examine the distribution of the alleles within VNB we first identified 445193 alleles private to VNB present in at least one VNB isolate and no VNI or VNII isolates.

For VNI ancestry sites these isolates had very different genotypes with Ftc260-1 most closely re- lated to a diverse set of African isolates in VNI whereas both Bt125 and Bt131 are more closely related to highly clonal clades of VNI isolates Figure S2 A C and E. Similarly for a separate phylogenetic analysis of VNB ancestry sites Bt125 and Bt131 were placed within the VNBII subclade of VNB while Ftc260-1 was placed in VNBI Figure S2 B D and F. This supports that these three hybrids originated from very different genotypes of VNI and VNB parental isolates.Diploid isolates and genome plasticityAs noted above a total of 24 sequenced isolates displayed heterozygous SNP positions across the genome.

The highest average chromosome FST value is 0.874 between VNI and VNII isolates while the average chromo- some FST values of VNI-VNB and VNB-VNII are 0.595 and 0.707 respectively Table 4.To further examine the evolutionary history of the novel South American VNB isolates we subdivided VNB into four subclades VNBI-South America VNBI-Africa VNBII-South America and VNBII-Africa and calculated alleles unique to each subclade and shared across VNB groups or geography Materials and Methods.

Therefore despite VNB showing signals of more ancient migration while VNI shows signals of recent migration both demonstrate genetic substructure according to geography.Recombination between and within lineagesThe basal branching of Brazilian VNB isolates revealed in the phylogenetic analysis suggested that South America could be a global center of C. neoformans var.

Other South American VNB isolates WM 1408 and V17 donated strongly to specific lineages WM 1408 to VNII and VNB while V17Table 4 Pairwise population genetic statistics between the lineages of C. neoformans var.

grubii diploid isolates Table S3 diagnostic SNPs for VNB and VNII were present exclusively in the respective groups and called for all VNB VNII and 100 VNI isolates.

Diagnostic SNPs for VNI were present exclusively in VNII and VNB and called for all VNB VNII and 100 VNI isolates.Population genetic measures including nucleotide diver- sity p fixation index FST and Tajima's D were calculated using popGenome Pfeifer et al.

We subdivided VNB into four clades VNBI- South America VNBI-Africa VNBII-South America and VNBII-Africa and calculated the number of those private alleles unique to each clade present in that one clade and no others and shared across VNB groups or geography pre- sent in the two compared clades but no others.

For VNI and VNB both clinical and envi- ronmental isolates were included with 25 VNI isolates orig- inating from avian guano or trees and 8 VNB isolates from trees or other environmental sources Table S1.
