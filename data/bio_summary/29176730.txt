This absence of cause-effect linkage has prevented more targeted studies of mechanical vectors compared to biological vectors for which host-microbe associations have been intensively analysed12.In this study we have investigated 116 microbiomes by whole-genome shotgun WGS sequencing of 63 samples of blowflies of the species Chrysomya megacephala and 53 individual houseflies of the species Musca domestica describing the complexity of the pan-microbiomes of both mechanical vectors at the species level.

The number of OTUs assigned to species level by each method is summarized in the Venn diagram in Figure S10 cutoff of 500 reads assigned per bacterial species and intersection of OTUs detected by all three methods is given in Table S7.

The outer ring summarizes the total number of reads assigned to each bacterial species analysed values in grey whereas the relative abundance of reads present in the fly hosts is represented inthe innermost ring by orange housefly and blue blowfly bars.

The blowfly datasets contained approximately 70 million reads per sample control excluded and the housefly data- sets had approximately 45 million reads per sample Table S1 for an average of reads per sample.

The non-host sequence reads used for metagenomic analyses are available under NCBI BioProject ID PRJNA385554.The resulting non-host filtered metagenomic datasets were analysed with three separate methods i align- ment of the translated reads against the non-redundant NR database using rapsearch264 ii alignment of reads against a customized prokaryotic genomic database using dbAssign and iii alignment of short-read datasets against specI representative genomes34.

See Figure S4 for alpha-diversity indices.richness analysis showed an average number of 551 - 373 bacterial species for blowflies and 228 - 157 bacterial species for houseflies using rapsearch2 Figure S5 and 37 - 22 OTUs for blowflies and 42 - 20 OTUs for house- flies using dbAssign Figure S5.

Three species are associated with insects including different species of the endosymbiont Wolbachia spp.

Figure shows occurrence and abun- dance of the 33 microbial species identified by all of the bioinformatics methods Table S7 used in this study and for all fly samples collected showing host-specific species as well as the shared microbiome of both the housefly and the blowfly.

Part of the microbiome is shared by both fly species environment-acquired and part is species specific host-selected.

Nevertheless a significant shared microbiome comprising approximately half of the bacterial species crosses the host species boundary and is present in the microbiomes of the two carrion-flies.
