The results of the study indicate that the metabolite classes of LHG extract in normal and t2D human intestinal microbiota are nearly the same.However oxidation and isomerization reactions of LHG extract were relatively less present in normal human intestinal bacteria as compared with those in t2D human intestinal bacteria.

The differences of metabolites of LHG extracts in t2D and normal human intestinal bacteria are shown in .Considering the close relationship between intestinal bacteria and t2D the metabolic difference of LHG extract in t2D and normal human intestinal bacteria was investigated first.

However oxidation and isomerization reactions of mogroside type compounds were less common in normal human intestinal bacteria as compared to those in t2D human intestinal bacteria.In this paper a study of in vitro biotransformation of LHG extract by t2D and normal human intestinal microbiota was conducted.

One was used in the dilution of the medium and normal human fecal microbiota shown in D and the other was used in the dilution of LHG extract and the medium as shown in E. The transformed LHG sample by normal human intestinal microbiota is shown in F. Comparing thiswith the control of medium and fecal microbiota  D 10 prototype components compounds 1 6 7 10 12-15 20 and 23 were identified and 12 metabolitescompounds 2 3 8 9 16-19 24 25 27 and 29 were detected.

It was also noted that the concentration of 11-deoxymogroside V in normal human intestinal microbiota was relatively low compared with that of t2D human intestinal microbiota.Metabolic pathways of mogroside type compounds by t2Dhuman intestinal microbiota were proposed as shown in C. In total 16 metabolites compounds 2 4 5 8 9 11 1618 19 21 and 24-29 were derived from original mogroside type compounds.

Structures in blue indicate major LHG triterpenoids in the original LHG extract.ering the transformation from glycosides to aglycone we proposed that b-D-glucosidases contributed to the process of deglycosylation of LHG extract in both t2D and normal human intestinal bacteria.

Hence it was necessary to illuminate the biotransformation of mogrosides from LHG extract by human intestinal bacteria in the pathological state of t2D.In this paper an in vitro biotransformation study of mogrosides by normal and t2D human intestinal microbiotacalories and are also reported to have antidiabetic activity.

It was evident that theoxidation and isomerization reactions of LHG extract were more prevalent in t2D human intestinal bacteria than they were in normal human intestinal bacteria.
