Whereas retinoic acid RA is described to induce T reg cell development in the presence of IL-15 RA was shown to rapidly trigger mucosal DCs to release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p70 and IL-23 inhibiting pT reg cell differentiation while promoting differentiation of Th1 cells and cytotoxic T cell function These effector T cell sub- types can then induce tissue damage in response to luminal antigens as in gluten intolerance responses observed in celiac disease patients The reported plasticity of the T reg cell lineage duringinflammatory or tissue-specific responses does not result in instability of the Foxp3-dependent T reg cell program in non- lymphopenic settings as suggested by fate-mapping strategies using dual reporter strains Nevertheless studies performed under lymphopenic or inflammatory set- tings raised the possibility that uncommitted T reg cell pop- ulations preferentially pT reg cells lose Foxp3 and in some cases even differentiate into effector T cells K These studies suggest that some level of instability or plasticity can exist even in committed T reg cell populations.

Al- though differentiation of mature immune cells into activated effector cells is generally associated with a reduction in their plasticity potential 1.During primary immunization or infections activated effector T cells differentiate into memory T cells with distinct phenotypes plasticity and functions depending on which lymphoid or nonlymphoid tissues they seed Tissue-resident memory TRM T cells rep- resent a recently identified T cell population that resides in nonlymphoid tissues without recirculating and with a dis- tinct core gene signature TRM cells are derived from effector T cell precursors and can be recruited to several tissues particularly barrier surfaces even in the absence of overt inflammation albeit inflammatory processes can significantly increase TRM cell differentiation from effector T cell precursors or recruit- ment to sites such as skin epidermis vaginal epithelium lung airways salivary glands and ganglia Upon migration to the tissue environment T cells are subject to cues that can promote remarkable plasticity and functional specialization.

These sensing molecules must convey luminal information to neighboring immune cells such as IELs and lamina pro- pria cells as well as to systemic sites Such IEC-sensing mechanisms arecoupled to their role in food absorption metabolic activities and in their maintenance of surface barriers Indeed recent studies uncovered the impact of microbiota during gestational and preweaning periods in the activation and differentiation of IECs and lamina propria cells These effects appeared to be at least in part mediated by breast milk- and placenta-derived microbial metabolite-bound an- tibodies which can be directly sensed by IECs or by underlying lamina propria cells including B cells and ILCs These pathways operate at a critical timeframe between birth and weaning by boosting resistance mechanisms against pathogens as well as regulating excessive activation in intestinal immune cells  Therefore physiological cues derived from the gut lumen at specific life stages support the developmental fitness of the mucosal immune system.The epithelial layer is separated from the underlying lamina propria by a thin membrane of collagen basement membrane.Together the lamina propria and the epithelium harbor the vast majority of immune cells in the body although the cell populations occupying each layer are strikingly dis- tinct In addition it is also reported that the T cell repertoire differs strongly between the lamina propria and the epithelium Consistent with their innate-like phenotypeTCRgd and TCRab tIELsexpress restricted oligoclonal T cell repertoires not only in thegut but also in the skin Intestinal TCRgd tIELs express Vg7 or Vg5 depending on the nomenclature used although their ligands are not known and this population seems to be influ-enced by dietary metabolites found in cruciferous vegetables aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands rather than microbiota antigens Li The TCR repertoire of double neg-ative DN IELs CD8aa is also oligoclonal and naturally occurring DN IEL TCRs are sufficient to induce IEL differ- entiation when transgenically expressed in developing T cellsIn contrast the repertoire of colonic lamina propria T reg cells is polyclonal and shows little if any overlap with the repertoire of naive or effector CD4 T cells found at the same location or with other peripheral T reg cells Likewise the repertoire of intestinal Th17 cells differs significantly from that of other intestinal T cells Whereas colonic commensals such as Clostridium spp.

This feature is particularly re- markable in CD4 pIELs CD4-IELs which induce postthy- mic down-modulation of the T helper lineage commitment transcriptional factor ThPOK which is preceded by the in- duction of both T-bet and Runx3 the latter a CD8 lineage commitment transcription factor This epithelium-specific regulation of T cell lineage transcription factors results in a broad suppression of programming associated with mature CD4 T cells includ- ing expression of co-stimulatory molecules T helper cyto- kines and T reg cell-associated transcription factor Foxp3 The exact mechanisms by which CD4 T cells un- dergo such drastic functional adaptation toward the IEL pro- gram remain to be defined.

A positive reg- ulator of the cytotoxic activity of IEL populations is IL-15 a cytokine produced by a wide range of cells including epithe- lial stromal and several myeloid cell populations J IL-15 is up-regulated in several chronic inflam- matory diseases acting both as a local danger signal that pro- motes Th1 cell-mediated immunity and as a co-stimulatory signal to effector cytotoxic T cells J In contrast to CD8aa expression which increases the TCRactivation threshold of IELs IL-15 reduces it hence promot-ing their lymphokine-activated killer LAK activity Whereas physiological levels of IL-15 contribute to the de- velopment of intestinal T cells and provide a complementary stress signal to trigger protective CTL functions during in- tracellular infections uncontrolled IL-15 production during inflammation can result in T cell-mediated disruption of theepithelial barrier and promote disorders such as celiac dis- ease An analogous process was described in the skin epidermis and lung where intra- tissue modulation of T-bet expression allowed for continu- ous expression of CD122 IL-15Rb by CD103TRM cellspromoting effector function and IL-15-dependent survivalIn contrast to both skin and lung TRM cells as well as to CD8aa IELs virus-specific CD8ab TRM cells were reported to be maintained within intestinal mucosa independently of IL-15 Thisobservation may indicate that IL-15 dependence may vary not only according to the anatomical location but also to the nature of tissue-resident lymphocytes.In summary the epithelial milieu tightly adjusts the phenotype of its resident lymphocytes as evidenced by the strikingly similar gene programs acquired by intestinal IELs irrespective of their T cell receptor or co-receptor expres- sion lineage or subtype Although an understanding of the physiological roles played by IELs or their role in controlling pathogen invasion and intesti- nal inflammation still requires further studies several lines of evidence point to their function in maintaining the epi- thelial cell barrier and responding to pathogens These studies highlight examples of T cell adaptation to the single-layered intestinal epithelium a uniquely challenging location for both resistance and tolerance given its close prox- imity to the highly stimulatory gut lumen.Tissue-dependent immune regulation of T reg cellsT reg cells are also prone to tissue conditioning and represent a noteworthy example of late adaptation to specific environ- mental signals.

Hence mice carrying T-bet-deficient T reg cells develop severe Th1 inflammation including lymphade- nopathy and splenomegaly whereas other responses are still kept in check KAdditionallyT reg cell-spe- cific ablation of Stat3 a key transcription factor for Th17 cell differentiation results in uncontrolled Th17 inflammation in the intestine However ablation of transcription factors IRF4 or GATA-3 which are required for Th2 differentiation in T reg cells results in selective and spontaneous development of allergic and Th17 responses at mucosal tissues and skin Conversely conditional deletion of Rorc associated with Th17 develop- ment in T reg cells results in increased mucosal Th2 immu- nity suggesting that during inflammation T reg cell sensing of the tissue milieu might reestablish equilibrium by regu- lating additional arms of the immune system Both T reg cells and T reg cell-in- ducing signals can also be overturned by certain signals from inflamed tissues.

Using the tamoxifen-inducible Foxp3-driven Cre recombinase strain to fate-map bona fide T reg cells we confirmed previous reports that T reg cells show stable Foxp3 expression over time in all tissues examined including the intesti- nal lamina propria The only exception to this rule was observed in the intestinal epithelium where we found that roughly 50 of former T reg cells physiologically lose Foxp3 over a period of 5 wk in a microbiota-dependent manner These former T reg cells de- veloped an IEL phenotype including acquisition of Runx3 and loss of ThPOK Perhaps one of the clearest demonstrations of tissue adaptation of T reg cells was reported recently in a transnuclear mouse strain generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer from a single pT reg cell.

Rapid TGF-b-dependent up-regulation of the integrin aEb7 CD103 which binds to E-cadherin on epithelial cells by memory precursor effector CD8 T cells was shown toregulate accumulation of TRMs in the intestinal epithelium Induced expression of certain cell sur- face molecules such as CRTAM class I MHC-restricted T cell-associated molecule and 2B4 a NK-related receptor may also be important in the accumulation or maintenance of T cells in the gut epithelial layer Adaptation to the intestinal epitheliumIntraepithelial lymphocytes IELs primarily reside at the epithelial layer of mucosal surfaces and skin displaying both innate and adaptive characteristics IELs comprise a heterogeneous group of lymphocytes in- cluding cells considered TRM and innate lymphoid cells and are characterized by high expression levels of activation mark- ers such as CD69 gut-homing integrins NK-inhibitory and activating receptors such as Ly49 and KIR families cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTL-related genes such as Granzyme B and antiinflammatory or inhibitory receptors like LAG-3 Another common characteristic of IELsis the surface expression of CD8aa homodimers which can bind both to classical MHC-I and to epithelial cell-associatednonclassical MHC-I molecules  Similar to Foxp3-expressingT reg cells IELs can be divided into peripheral p or thymict IELs depending on their origin and process of differenti- ation.

Similar to other T cell subsets pT reg cells acquire tissue-homing capacity during their differentiation or activation Recent studies indi- cated that highly suppressive breast tumor-infiltrating T reg cells shared a gene program similar to T reg cells from nor- mal breast tissue but not to other peripheral activated T reg cells Mechanisms employed by pT reg cells to prevent or suppress overt inflam- mation vary depending on the target tissue.

The in- stability of the T reg cell lineage within the intestinal epithe- lium may represent an important modulation of regulatory activity that is coordinated by this particular environment However a specific role for CD4-IELs in cyto- lytic responses against intracellular pathogens or in trigger- ing inflammation remains to be defined An interesting possibility is that these potentially cytotoxic CD4 T cells could play a crucial role in the immune responses against viral infections tropic for MHC-II target cells including HIV-1-infected human CD4 T cells or viruses that managed to escape conventional cytotoxic CD8 T cell-dependent surveillance including cytomegalovirus and HIV-1 itself K Nevertheless the observation that tissue sensing of particular environmental cues such as dietary or microbiota metabolites results in coordinated immune reg- ulation represents an important step in the understanding of diseases triggered by uncontrolled inflammation.Gut imprinting on antibody productionTissue adaptation of B cells in the gut mucosa also involves cross talk between these cells and the luminal factors influenc- ing their differentiation.
