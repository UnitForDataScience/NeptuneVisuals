Blocking immune checkpoints cy- totoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 CTLA-4 and programmed cell death-1 PD-1 promotes effector T cell activation and proliferation allowing enhanced cellular immunity.

Drug-induced hepatitis rarely presents with cirrhosis or rosette formation which are prevailing findings in autoimmune hepatitis .The predominant role of CTLA-4 in suppressing T cell func- tion is demonstrated by CTLA-4-- mice that develop a se- vere lymphoproliferative disease with multiorgan infiltration and tissue destruction .

The purpose of this review is to address luminal gastrointestinal and hepatic com- plications associated with a new class of anticancer drugs immune checkpoint inhibitors CPIs and focuses on the iden- tification evaluation and management of the complications associated with this class of drugs.Recent Findings It is now recognized that immune checkpoint inhibitors are frequently associated with luminal GI side ef- fects such as diarrhea and enterocolitis and hepatic complica- tions such as hepatitis.

The 2q33 gene encodes the CTLA-4 recep-tor and CT60 GG alleles have been associated with reduced CTLA-4 expression on the T cell surface.

Defective CTLA-4 function is associated with exaggerated T cell responses and subsequent inflammation in the intestinal mucosa that leads to the devel- opment of IBD.

Upon T cell activation CTLA-4 is also expressed on the surface and com- petes with CD28 for binding B7 ligands.

Because thefragilis polysaccharide capsule is known to induce IL-12- dependent TH1 immune responses these immunogenic bac- teria show potential to act as anticancer probiotics .Certain microbial species play an important role in main- taining mucosal tolerance by promoting T regulatory cell ex- pansion or stimulating anti-inflammatory cytokines.

While colitis associated with CPIs to some extent mimics that found in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease the complex interplay of genes the environ- ment the immune system and the microbiome make it diffi- cult to fully differentiate these conditions clinically.
