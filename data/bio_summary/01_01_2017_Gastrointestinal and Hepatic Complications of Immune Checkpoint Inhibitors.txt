nivolumab was initially approved for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma follow- ing ipilimumab administration 2014 and then later for non- small cell lung cancer nsclc and advanced renal cell car- cinoma 2015. pembrolizumab was approved in 2015 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma as well as nsclc .although ctla-4 and pd-1 receptors play an inhibitory role with respect to effector t cells they paradoxically play an important stimulatory role in regulatory t cells .

the purpose of this review is to address luminal gastrointestinal and hepatic com- plications associated with a new class of anticancer drugs immune checkpoint inhibitors cpis and focuses on the iden- tification evaluation and management of the complications associated with this class of drugs.recent findings it is now recognized that immune checkpoint inhibitors are frequently associated with luminal gi side ef- fects such as diarrhea and enterocolitis and hepatic complica- tions such as hepatitis.

drug-induced hepatitis rarely presents with cirrhosis or rosette formation which are prevailing findings in autoimmune hepatitis .the predominant role of ctla-4 in suppressing t cell func- tion is demonstrated by ctla-4-- mice that develop a se- vere lymphoproliferative disease with multiorgan infiltration and tissue destruction .

blocking immune checkpoints cy- totoxic t lymphocyte antigen 4 ctla-4 and programmed cell death-1 pd-1 promotes effector t cell activation and proliferation allowing enhanced cellular immunity.

both the exacerbations and iraes were easily managed by standard treatment algorithms and the incidence of iraes was similar to that reported in previous clinical trials .a patient with stage iv melanoma and preexisting ulcera- tive colitis developed grade 3 colitis following a first dose of ipilimumab.

the 2q33 gene encodes the ctla-4 recep-tor and ct60 gg alleles have been associated with reduced ctla-4 expression on the t cell surface.

ipilimumab is currently approved by the us food and drug administration for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and nivolumab and pembrolizumab are both fda approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.

although these therapies have proven successful in treating melanoma non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcino- ma up to two thirds of patients experience widespread immune-related adverse events iraes.

while colitis associated with cpis to some extent mimics that found in idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease the complex interplay of genes the environ- ment the immune system and the microbiome make it diffi- cult to fully differentiate these conditions clinically.

targownik and bernstein found the risk of developing new cancers to be increased with the use of tnf inhibitors however this risk should be carefully weighed against the short-term risks of gi perforation and death from ipilimumab- induced colitis .treatment with corticosteroids has also been recom- mended for severe hepatitis associated with the use of checkpoint inhibitors.

defective ctla-4 function is associated with exaggerated t cell responses and subsequent inflammation in the intestinal mucosa that leads to the devel- opment of ibd.

cpi- induced hepatitis is most often associated with a pattern of hepatocellular injury with panlobular hepatitis.
