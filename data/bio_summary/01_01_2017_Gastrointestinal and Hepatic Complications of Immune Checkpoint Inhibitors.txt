Drug-induced hepatitis rarely presents with cirrhosis or rosette formation which are prevailing findings in autoimmune hepatitis .The predominant role of CTLA-4 in suppressing T cell func- tion is demonstrated by CTLA-4-- mice that develop a se- vere lymphoproliferative disease with multiorgan infiltration and tissue destruction .

Blocking immune checkpoints cy- totoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 CTLA-4 and programmed cell death-1 PD-1 promotes effector T cell activation and proliferation allowing enhanced cellular immunity.

The 2q33 gene encodes the CTLA-4 recep-tor and CT60 GG alleles have been associated with reduced CTLA-4 expression on the T cell surface.

The purpose of this review is to address luminal gastrointestinal and hepatic com- plications associated with a new class of anticancer drugs immune checkpoint inhibitors CPIs and focuses on the iden- tification evaluation and management of the complications associated with this class of drugs.Recent Findings It is now recognized that immune checkpoint inhibitors are frequently associated with luminal GI side ef- fects such as diarrhea and enterocolitis and hepatic complica- tions such as hepatitis.

Although these therapies have proven successful in treating melanoma non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcino- ma up to two thirds of patients experience widespread immune-related adverse events irAEs.

Nivolumab was initially approved for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable melanoma follow- ing ipilimumab administration 2014 and then later for non- small cell lung cancer NSCLC and advanced renal cell car- cinoma 2015.

Upon T cell activation CTLA-4 is also expressed on the surface and com- petes with CD28 for binding B7 ligands.

Because CTLA-4 has even higher affinity for these ligands the co-stimulatory signal is eliminated and the lymphocytes are arrested in G1 of the cell cycle.
