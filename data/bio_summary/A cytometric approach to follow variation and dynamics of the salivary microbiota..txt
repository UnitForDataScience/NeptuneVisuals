All dynam- ics of an oral community can be illustrated representing the direction of the evolution of samples over time  D. The sim- ilarity or dissimilarity of a defined group of samples is mirrored by the deviation between all points of this group  E. Conse- quently larger deviations between points represent high dissimi- larity between samples.

Four samples were collected within 8 h time points 0 h 5 min 2 h and 8 h. All gates of all samples were used to compare the similarity of the samples.

It must be valid for all samples within the setup of samples that needs to be evaluated together.

Hence concerning saliva samples the measured OTU level richness within one sample was described to be high but samples of different sub- jects shared similar organisms .

The ellipsoids show standard deviations of samples collected at baseline continuous line and samples collected after the stress influence broken line.

The bacterial cell counts of saliva samples were found to vary between 3.0 x 107 and 6.2 x 108 cells per sample and subject in undisturbed environments.

The collec- tion of saliva samples was conducted in accordance to the stan- dardized spitting method protocol by Navazesh 1993 .

After 10 min incuba- tion time on ice and division into 2-3 aliquots the samples were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and afterwards stored at -80 degC.
