Second we examine the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of infection among cancer patients to include the impact of the gastroin- testinal microbiota on epithelial integrity and immune responses during cancer treatment and how this may play into bacterial translocation and thus infection.

An increased knowl- edge of the interplay between potential pathogens protective commensals and the host immune system may facilitate the development of novel biomark- ers or therapeutics that could help ameliorate the toll that infections take during the treatment of cancer.Infections during Cancer TreatmentInfections are among the gravest threat to patients being treated for cancer with multiple studies finding infection to be one of the leading causes of death in patients with a wide array of malignancies .

We believe that advances in the characterizing of the entire microbial components of the microbiome will facilitate a better understanding of interkingdom interactions that influence infection and the full range of pathogens that affect the cancer patient in the near future see Outstanding Questions.Bacterial bloodstream infections BSIs are particularly common in the neutropenic patient as a result of a combination of epithelial damage due to chemotherapy and immunosuppression .

In general staphylococcal infections originate from vascular catheters whereas the GI tract is the source of infection for the other organisms shown in .

Thus extensiveknowledgeofthe roleofthe taxonomic groups in infectious complications and future real-time monitoring of the microbiome has the potential to enhance patient outcomes reduce the risk of infection and improve treatment strategies in the cancer setting .The Role of the Microbiome in Mucosal Barrier Disruption and FunctionIt is thought that most infections occur via bacterial translocation across mucosal barriers during radiation and chemotherapy in cancer patients particularly in scenarios of impaired colonization resistance and intestinal domination by pathobionts .

However it was shown that antibiotic treatment impairs RegIIIg expression leaving mice susceptible to infections suggesting a potential mechanism by which the high antibiotic administration to cancer patients may result in subsequent infection .Another common theme among recent publications is the microbiota-dependent effect of modulation of immune responses through microbial metabolites like short-chain fatty acids SCFA.

Thus cancer patients who lack microorganisms involved in immunological processes or lose them as a result of chemotherapy or antibiotics may be particularly susceptible to infectious complications.Possible Microbiome-Based Solutions to Mitigate Infections in the Cancer PatientIn addition to providing mechanistic insights into infections it is hoped that therapeutic modulation of the microbiome could be used to reduce the risk of infection.

Given the highly susceptible nature of cancer patients to a range of infections these patients may serve as an excellent model for advancing knowledge of how commensal microbiota impact the risk of infection.

Recent studies have solidified our understanding that commensal microorganisms or the microbiome can prevent colonization and subsequent infection by pathogenic bacteria .

Similarly mortality rates from BSI in the cancer patient vary depending on the group and infection types studied but can reach50 for highly resistant organisms in the setting of neutropenia .The major causes of BSI in the cancer patient are shown in .
