glucagon acts on the liver by stimulating the camp-pka-creab signaling pathway and increasing the hepatic production of kisspeptin.nutritional and genetic models of insulin resistance- lacking kiss1 gene present augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion gsis and improved glucose toleranceand provide insights on the role of kisspeptin on glucagon regulation of insulin secretion.insulin-like growth factor binding proteins igfbps play a central role in insulin signaling and are expressed in a widespreadinhibits insulin secretionin a k -dependent manner.theeffects of leptin on b-cells may be indirect and further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of its action.adipsin was among the adipokines identified early and observed to be reduced in obesity and diabetes.

however it is becoming evident that curiously asians easily develop insulin resistance and diabetes without morbid obesity.thus therapeutic strategies that protect and enhance 'functional b-cell mass' are essential to promote appropriate glycemic control and to potentially cure diabetes in asian populations.considerable effort has been invested to progress our under- standing of the complex intracellular signaling mechanisms and pathways that regulate human b-cell function and mass including those that modulate insulin secretion islet cell replication apoptosis dedifferentiation autophagy and endoplasmic reticu- lum er and oxidative stress.

glp-1 and gip are among the most famous incretins.gip and glp-1 are released from intestinal k and l cells respectively in response to glucose and lipids and improve gsis.glp-1 stimulates insulin secretion in response to glucose and also acts on a-cells through glucagon like peptide 1 receptor glp-1r to inhibit glucagon secretion.interestingly ablationof glp-1r in b-cells does not disrupt glp-1 effects on insulin secretion suggesting that glp-1 acts on b-cells through a neuronal mechanism.variants in the gip receptor gene locus have been associated with higher susceptibility for t2dbut its mechanism of action in b-cells are complex.transgenic mice lacking glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor selectively on b-cells present with decreased gsis in response to meals but preserve their insulin sensitivity.nonetheless b-cells lacking glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor are more susceptible to apoptosis and exhibit lower expression of t-cell specific transcription factor-1 from tcf7 gene.tcf7 has been relatively recently reported to be decreased in diabetic rodent islets and in t2d islets and suggested to be important for the anti-apoptotic effects of gip.although incretins stimulate insulin secretion in response to nutrients decretins act by inhibiting insulin secretion in fasting conditions.
