A 20-year observational study of patients with uncomplicated hepatic steatosis concluded that 1.2 of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients developed cirrhosis compared to 22 of alcoholic fatty liver disease patients85.CLINICAL PRESENTATIONalcohol withdrawal can be a life-threatening when patients develop delirium tremens seizures coma and cardiac arrest.

Although comparable rates of any alcohol use are reported in patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic liver disease the risk of heavy drinking appears much higher in alcoholic liver disease patients158.

Mechanisms of the synergistic hepatotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse in patients with hepatitis C include altered cell-mediated immunity increased oxidative stress increase viral replication hepatic steatosis and inflammatory response from iron accumulation62.Studies on viral hepatitis and chronic heavy alcohol use are mostly in patients with hepatitis C. Mecha- nisms of pathogenesis can also be applied to hepatitis B patients.

The innate immunity is impaired in patients with progressive liver dysfunction contributing to multi-organ failure seen in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.

Alcohol induced liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C is dose-dependent and exhibited patients who ingest 30-40 g daily68.

The duration of pre-transplant abstinence does not appear to correlate with post- transplant survival160 however studies for long term follow-up of the graft in patients transplanted for alcoholic hepatitis with continued alcohol abuse requires further investigation.Mathurin et al161 reports the results of a multicenterEuropean trial which carefully selected corticosteroid refractory AH patients whom were deemed to have a low risk of recividism after liver transplantation.

Exploration of maximal medical management with microbiota modification immune modulation liver regenerative factors farnesoid X receptors FXRs caspase inhibitors and extracorporeal liver assist device ELAD may be promising for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who do not have other options.

Based on a systematic review there is no difference in early alcohol use in patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease vs non-alcoholic liver disease at 6 mo 4 vs 5 and 12 mo 17 vs 16.

Limitations to the study include small sample size n  9 and short follow-up period median 765 d162.A three-year pilot by Lee examined 2 groups of patients selected to receive a liver transplant Severe alcoholic hepatitis as the first episode of liver decom- pensation vs alcoholic cirrhotics with  6 mo of abstinence.

A phase 2 clinicaltrials shows obeticholic acid improved insulin sensitivity and markers of liver inflammation in patients with diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
