Colonization of recipient mice with microbiota from H. polygyrus-infected or control mice reproduces the microbial composition of the donorThe results are 16S rRNA gene sequence data from fecal pellets of recipient mice that are colonized with microbiota from control Cont-F and H. polygyrus-infected Hp-F donor mice.

A clear distinction in the relative abundance of the most dominant species in the recipient mice was also detected between mice that were colonized with control microbiota and microbiota from helminth-infected mice Figure 2c.

Colonization of mice with microbiota from helminth infected donor mice results in down-regulation of C. rodentium-induced colonic anti-microbial responsesColon tissues were collected from mice colonized with Cont-F and Hp-F with and withoutC.

To determine whether this effect might be caused by helminth-inducedalterations in the gut microbiota we used bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare the stool microbiome composition of control and helminth-infected mice in two independent experiments consisting of 3 mice per group.

Our next set of experiments directly tested the impact of the worms on the gut microbiota by deworming some of the infected mice using ourpublished methods which can effectively clear the worms 27 and comparing the gutmicrobiome composition of helminth-infected mice with and without worm present in the gut.

Balbc mice whose gut flora had been depleted by means of a previously reported antibiotic regimen 28 were colonized with microbiota mixture of cecal colonic and fecal contents from either control or H. polygyrus-infected mice.

The recipient mice received 3 microbiota transfers over the course of a week.We first confirmed that the microbiota of the recipient mice reproduced the gut flora of their donors.

The results showed a clear difference in microbiota composition between the two groups of recipient mice at the genus level as evidenced by an increase in Bacteroides and decrease in Clostridum and Lactobacillus in mice colonized with microbiota from helminth-infected donors Figure 2a and b.
