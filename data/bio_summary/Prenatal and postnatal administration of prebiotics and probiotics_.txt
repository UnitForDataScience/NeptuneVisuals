Although these trials utilized differing doses and probiotic strains it appears that doses of 109 microbes per day are more beneficial than lower doses that combinations of probiotics may have advantages over single organisms and that probiotics are more effective in premature infants receiving human milk than formula .Safety of prebiotics and probioticsThe safety of probiotics and prebiotics has been extensively reviewed.

Additionally probiotics have been shown to decrease high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  a marker of inflammation associated with adverse maternal conditions such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes.Bacterial vaginosis is another target for probiotics with com- bined benefits of restoring the vaginal microbiota after or in place of antibiotic treatment and decreasing the vaginal pH to an opti- mum value.

One meta-analysis showed an 81 reduction in genital in- fections with oral probiotics but data were inconclusive on whether this would decrease preterm labor .

Perhaps even more compelling are several meta-analyses which have shown that administration of probiotics during pregnancy prevents atopic dermatitis in children   and a large cohort study showing that probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria during pregnancy decrease eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis in children .

A recent meta-analysis of these studies concluded that probiotics decrease the risk of NEC and death but not sepsis  .

Administration of enteral prebiotics probiotics and synbiotics during pregnancy lactation and postnatal life appears to be a safe and feasible method to alter the maternal and neonatal microbiome thus improving pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies linking probiotics to improved glycemic control have been mixed.
