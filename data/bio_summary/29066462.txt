1c-e. these effect is known to be driven by theactivation of the lxr-srebp1c pathway in the liver 31. it is also known that dietary8cholesterol suppresses mitochondrial state3 respiration in steatohepatitis viajnk110 22 34. therefore we challenged cyp8b1 and cyp8b1-- mice with the12-week hcd regimen and measured various metabolic parameters.cyp8b1-- mice are resistant to metabolic impairment induced by a long-termhigh cholesterol dietat the start of the feeding study cyp8b1-- mice already had lower bodyweights compared with cyp8b1 mice fig.

these data indicate that cyp8b1-- mice are resistant to the deleterious effectssuch as the blunting in mitochondrial respiration and reduction in locomotor activityseen in cyp8b1 mice indicating that cyp8b1 deletion prevents the onset ofmetabolic derangements associated with steatohepatitis.cyp8b1-- mice are protected from hepatic steatosis in response to hcd the12-week hcd regimen induced hepatic steatosis and led to a progressive increasein the levels of circulating cholesterol c. interestingly c levels remainedsignificantly lower in cyp8b1-- mice starting from week 4 of hcd feeding onwarduntil the end of the 12-week study fig.

the levels of mature srebp2 were increased along with the transcript levelsof its target gene hmgcr indicating that cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver ofcyp8b1-- mice is higher owing to reduced intestinal absorption fig 4k-l table 1.cyp8b1-- mice are not protected from hepatic steatosis and fibrosis inresponse to a methionine and choline-deficient diet to investigate whethermechanisms other than the repression of dnl could be involved in the protection ofcyp8b1-- mice against steatosis we challenged cyp8b1 and cyp8b1-- mice with adiet deficient in methionine and choline mcd diet.

in mice obstruction of bile flow causes small intestinalbacterial overgrowth which can be reversed by oral administration of bile acids 12.supplementing the diet with 2gkg of ca also leads to phylum-level alterationscausing a 41 increase in firmicutes representing ca as one of the bile acids thatalters the composition of gut microbiota 15. excessive dietary cholesterol has beenrecently linked to increased gut permeability and inflammasome-dependent intestinalinflammation and submucosal myeloid cell accumulation 27. therefore wehypothesized that the absence of ca in cyp8b1-- mice and the reduction in intestinal14cholesterol absorption might alter the composition of gut microbiota of cyp8b1--mice.microscopicallyweobservedsubmucosalaccumulationofinfiltratinglymphocytes in the jejunum of cyp8b1 mice but not in those of cyp8b1-- mice fig.8a.

it is therefore clear thatdnl is repressed in the liver of cyp8b1 knockout mice but whether mcas candirectly mediate such repression remains a subject of further investigation.challenging mice with a mcd diet represses the release of vldl-lipoproteinsleading to steatosis 32. the release of vldl lipoproteins measured on mcdfeeding was significantly higher in cyp8b1-- mice.

cholic acidca is the predominant 12a-hydroxylated bile acid that regulates hepatic lipidmetabolism and its circulating levels are negatively correlated with insulin resistance.abolishing ca synthesis via the genetic disruption of the enzyme sterol 12a-hydroxylase cyp8b1-- leads to a resistance from diabetes and hepatic steatosis.here we show that a long-term stimulation of hepatic lipogenesis leads to a severeimpairment in overall metabolic and respiratory function in control mice cyp8b1but strikingly not in cyp8b1-- mice.

here we show that the inhibition of cyp8b1affects hepatic lipid accumulation and overall metabolic function by repressing dnland gut-microbiota homeostasis.materials and methodsanimals and dietswe have previously reported the generation and maintenance of cyp8b1-- mice on ac57bl6ntac genetic background 18. in brief cyp8b1- mice were purchasedfrom the university of california davis knockout mouse project komp repositorycyp8b1tm1kompvlcg.

cyp8b1 control and cyp8b1-- knockout mice were4obtained by breeding cyp8b1- mice 18. our study used male and female miceaged 3-6 months.

2f-h. the rer of cyp8b1 mice did not show a typical diurnalrhythmicity that remained low across all circadian phases suggesting that cyp8b19mice depend typically on fat as a preferred energy substrate in contrast to cyp8b1--mice fig.

hepatic steatosis was prominent incyp8b1 mice with the percent of cross-sectional liver area covered by steatosisaveraging 10.9 compared with only 4 p0.0002 in cyp8b1-- mice fig.

3ij.10cyp8b1-- mice have a suppressed hepatic dnl and reduced intestinal lipidabsorption since the upregulation of dnl is the major mechanism by which dietarycholesterol induces steatosis 31 we investigated hepatic lipogenic gene andprotein expression in cyp8b1 and cyp8b1-- mice.

4c-f. additionally thetranscript levels of acetyl-coa carboxylase alpha acaca fatty acid synthase fasand sterol-coa desaturase 1 scd1 three key enzymes involved in dnl weredownregulated fold change 1 vs 0.49 0.43 and 0.61 p values 0.04 0.04 and 0.02respectively in the liver of cyp8b1-- mice table 1. the relative transcript levels ofsrebp1c were repressed fold change 1 vs 0.58 p0.04 in cyp8b1-- compared withcyp8b1 livers table 1. these data indicate that hepatic dnl is downregulated incyp8b1-- mice.
