Values are mean-SE.

Therefore we challenged Cyp8b1 and Cyp8b1-- mice with the12-week HCD regimen and measured various metabolic parameters.Cyp8b1-- mice are resistant to metabolic impairment induced by a long-termhigh cholesterol dietAt the start of the feeding study Cyp8b1-- mice already had lower bodyweights compared with Cyp8b1 mice Fig.

These data indicate that Cyp8b1-- mice are resistant to the deleterious effectssuch as the blunting in mitochondrial respiration and reduction in locomotor activityseen in Cyp8b1 mice indicating that Cyp8b1 deletion prevents the onset ofmetabolic derangements associated with steatohepatitis.Cyp8b1-- mice are protected from hepatic steatosis in response to HCD The12-week HCD regimen induced hepatic steatosis and led to a progressive increasein the levels of circulating cholesterol C. Interestingly C levels remainedsignificantly lower in Cyp8b1-- mice starting from week 4 of HCD feeding onwarduntil the end of the 12-week study Fig.

The levels of mature SREBP2 were increased along with the transcript levelsof its target gene Hmgcr indicating that cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver ofCyp8b1-- mice is higher owing to reduced intestinal absorption Fig 4K-L Table 1.Cyp8b1-- mice are not protected from hepatic steatosis and fibrosis inresponse to a methionine and choline-deficient diet To investigate whethermechanisms other than the repression of DNL could be involved in the protection ofCyp8b1-- mice against steatosis we challenged Cyp8b1 and Cyp8b1-- mice with adiet deficient in methionine and choline MCD diet.

Therefore wehypothesized that the absence of CA in Cyp8b1-- mice and the reduction in intestinal14cholesterol absorption might alter the composition of gut microbiota of Cyp8b1--mice.Microscopicallyweobservedsubmucosalaccumulationofinfiltratinglymphocytes in the jejunum of Cyp8b1 mice but not in those of Cyp8b1-- mice Fig.8A.

Cholic acidCA is the predominant 12a-hydroxylated bile acid that regulates hepatic lipidmetabolism and its circulating levels are negatively correlated with insulin resistance.Abolishing CA synthesis via the genetic disruption of the enzyme sterol 12a-hydroxylase Cyp8b1-- leads to a resistance from diabetes and hepatic steatosis.Here we show that a long-term stimulation of hepatic lipogenesis leads to a severeimpairment in overall metabolic and respiratory function in control mice Cyp8b1but strikingly not in Cyp8b1-- mice.

Cyp8b1 control and Cyp8b1-- knockout mice were4obtained by breeding Cyp8b1- mice 18.

2C.In a separate cohort of mice body composition of individual mice wasexamined in the 11th week of the HCD feeding regimen using EchoMRI after whichthe animals were housed in metabolic cages for three nocturnal cycles.

The RER of Cyp8b1 mice did not show a typical diurnalrhythmicity that remained low across all circadian phases suggesting that Cyp8b19mice depend typically on fat as a preferred energy substrate in contrast to Cyp8b1--mice Fig.
