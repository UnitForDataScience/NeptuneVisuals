the role of gut microbiota on each of these areas is addressed in the following paragraphs moreover a summary of the currently recognized epigenetic mechanisms associated with specific gut microbiota profiles is provided in .modulation of immune response and development of immune-mediated diseasesgut microbiota plays a key role in the development of immune response since the early phases of life by activating specific pathways of molecular signaling it supports the maturation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue  promotes the conversion of cd4 t-cells into t-regulatory cells  and influences the bal-ance between t-helper 1 and 2 which is known to have significanteffects on the development of allergic diseases .

on the contrary evidence from animal studies has shown that maternal zinc supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a lower degree of dna methylation in gut cells which in turn can have an anti-inflammatory effect on the intestinal mucosa .in sum these findings suggest that specific dietary interven- tions at key time points of fetal development can lead to different and unintended long-term consequences on health and disease.vitamin d and its effect on fetal epigenetic programming at the placental interfacechanges in vitamin d metabolism have been associated with altered methylation patterns in placental tissue with a possible influence on pregnancy outcome and on the development of great obstetrical syndromes .after oral ingestion vitamin d3 undergoes hepatic and renal hydroxylation being thus converted in its biologically active form 125-dihydroxyvitamin d3 which enters the cells and combines with the retinoid receptor forming a heterodimer that binds to vitamin d-responsive genes and regulates their transcription and translation .the placenta has a functional vitamin d endocrine system expressing vitamin d receptors and allowing the local conversion of vitamin d in its active form .

however further studies are needed to elucidate epigenetic modifications of genes relevant to visceral pain in relation to gut microbiome  and its influencers during the early phases of life.in sum according to the abovementioned evidence a thor- ough understanding of how the microbiome-gut-brain axis operates during infancy may provide not only useful insights into early neurocognitive development with possible translational applications but also a greater awareness on the several modifi- able factors influencing the establishment of infant microbiome during the first 1000 days of life and their crucial long-term effects .therapeutic and preventive implications of early interventions on gut microbiotaevidence on epigenetic programming by gut microbiota may be interpreted to form a basis for a hypothesis according to which detrimental epigenetic modifications and consequently the development of disease might be prevented by modulating microbial contact in early life.

postnatal intestinal colonization in turn determined by maternal flora mode of delivery early skin-to-skin contact and neonatal diet leads to specific epigenetic signatures that can affect the barrier properties of gut mucosa and their protective role against later insults thus potentially predisposing to the development of late-onset inflammatory diseases.

the aim of this review is to outline the epigenetic mechanisms of programming and development acting within early-life stages and to examine in detail the role of maternal and neonatal nutrition microbiota composition and other environmental factors in deter- mining epigenetic changes and their short- and long-term effects.keywords epigenetic regulation fetal programming overnutrition undernutrition micronutrients human milk microbiome disease originintroductionfollowing the so-called developmental origins hypothesis introduced by barker and osmond 30 years ago  and based on early developmental plasticity the environmental influence on health and disease has been progressively explored over the last decades.raimondi f and loverro g 2017 epigenetic matters the link between early nutrition microbiome and long-term health development.front.

during this time interval via epigenetic changes early nutrition can play a key role in developmental programming thereby possibly influencing the individual susceptibility to the later development of cardiovascular diseases obesity diabetes and other non-communicable chronic conditions.according to recent evidence the microbial colonization begins far before birth particularly the microbial flora from amniotic fluid placenta and maternal gut can support the devel- opment of a prenatal microbiota - that is likely to have aninfluence on the developing embryo and fetus.

although preliminary data currently available on the role of epigenetic in the determination of long-term health and disease look promising however most of the underlyingmechanisms still need to be clearly elucidated.this review aims to provide a complete overview on the complex interactions between early nutrition microbiome and epigenome during the early phases of human development summarized in  examining current evidence in detail and shedding light on the complex epigenetic processes that have been identified so far.effect of maternal nutrition on pregnancy epigenetics and fetal programmingthroughout their lifespan humans are exposed to several environmental hazards nevertheless the effects of these expo- sures may take decades for their phenotypic expression.

as the one-carbon metabolism depends upon dietarytable 1  main antenatal factors associated with epigenetic modifications in the offspring.methyl donors dna methylation can be influenced by nutrition during early life this process involves a large number of enzymes with methyltransferase activity cofactors including choline methionine vitamins b6 and b12 zinc betaine and dietary micronutrients acting as methyl donors -.folic acid is a well-known one-carbon donor for dna meth- ylation and synthesis its role is crucial during early postnatal development when rapid cell growth and proliferation take place.

vitamin b12 deficiency on the other hand can result in global hypomethylation as along with folic acid this micronutrient is involved in the synthesis of methionine and s-adenosyl methionine donors commonly required for the maintenance of dna methylation patterns .there is growing evidence that optimal dietary intakes of choline which is involved in one-carbon transfer or methyla- tion pathways as folic acid support a successful completion of fetal development .

particularly its deficiency during intrauterine life and childhood may contribute to alter promoter methylation resulting in an immune dysregulation that could contribute to the development of chronic inflamma- tory diseases  and to increase cardiovascular risk .

a possible interference between availability of vitamin d at the maternal-fetal interface hypermethylation of key placental genes involved in vitamin d metabolism and placentation can be hypothesized however further studies are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms.lcpufas intakes and dna methylationlong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential components of human diet known for their beneficial effects on health growth and development.

on the other hand fish oil supplementa- tion in animal models has been associated with decreased global dna methylation in the liver persisting for two generations lowered blood lipid concentrations increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity  however the path- ways involved still need to be completely elucidated.epigenetic effects of maternal undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancygrowth and development during fetal life and early childhood are greatly influenced by macronutrient intakes during pregnancy suggesting the importance of an adequate maternal diet in this crucial phase.

one of the molecular phenotypes associated with iugr rats is a decreased expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox factor-1 pdx1 a key transcription factor regulating pancreatic development  similar findings have also been observed for the muscular glucose transporter glut4 .low-protein regimens at conception or during pregnancy bring additional evidence on the noxious epigenetics effects of maternal nutrition deficiency on the offspring health in animal models a protein-restricted maternal diet has been associated with impaired immune response  increased sensitivity to oxidative stress  metabolic abnormalities and glucose dys- homeostasis .the dutch winter study provides a bright example on how famine during early and mid-gestation can lead to metabolic dysregulation later on in life having been associated with hyper- glycemia higher incidence of coronary heart disease a more atherogenic lipid profile disturbed blood coagulation increased stress responsiveness and obesity .

in primates a maternal high-fat diet has been reported to modulate protein deacetylase activity and to modify fetal surtuin 1 sirt1 histone which is a likely mediator of fetal epigenome and metabolome in the setting of maternal obesity .as for maternal obesity in further animal models it has been correlated with increased pancreatic beta cell mass and excessive insulin secretion  that in the long-term can predispose to the development of diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease in the offspring .eventually of great interest is the effect of nutrition on micror- nas mirnas which reciprocally interact with other epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modification and dna methylation in order to modulate the expression of target genes .
