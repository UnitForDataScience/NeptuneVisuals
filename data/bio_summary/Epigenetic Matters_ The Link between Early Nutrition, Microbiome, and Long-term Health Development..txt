However further studies are needed to elucidate epigenetic modifications of genes relevant to visceral pain in relation to gut microbiome  and its influencers during the early phases of life.In sum according to the abovementioned evidence a thor- ough understanding of how the microbiome-gut-brain axis operates during infancy may provide not only useful insights into early neurocognitive development with possible translational applications but also a greater awareness on the several modifi- able factors influencing the establishment of infant microbiome during the first 1000 days of life and their crucial long-term effects .Therapeutic and Preventive implications of early interventions on Gut MicrobiotaEvidence on epigenetic programming by gut microbiota may be interpreted to form a basis for a hypothesis according to which detrimental epigenetic modifications and consequently the development of disease might be prevented by modulating microbial contact in early life.

Although preliminary data currently available on the role of epigenetic in the determination of long-term health and disease look promising however most of the underlyingmechanisms still need to be clearly elucidated.This review aims to provide a complete overview on the complex interactions between early nutrition microbiome and epigenome during the early phases of human development summarized in  examining current evidence in detail and shedding light on the complex epigenetic processes that have been identified so far.eFFeCT OF MATeRNAL NUTRiTiON ON PReGNANCY ePiGeNeTiCS AND FeTAL PROGRAMMiNGThroughout their lifespan humans are exposed to several environmental hazards nevertheless the effects of these expo- sures may take decades for their phenotypic expression.

As the one-carbon metabolism depends upon dietaryTABLe 1  Main antenatal factors associated with epigenetic modifications in the offspring.methyl donors DNA methylation can be influenced by nutrition during early life this process involves a large number of enzymes with methyltransferase activity cofactors including choline methionine vitamins B6 and B12 zinc betaine and dietary micronutrients acting as methyl donors -.Folic acid is a well-known one-carbon donor for DNA meth- ylation and synthesis its role is crucial during early postnatal development when rapid cell growth and proliferation take place.

A significant correlation among maternal and neonatal nutrition  antenatal  and postnatal antibiotic exposure  and later metabolic outcomes is also well- known and a recent meta-analysis of epidemiological studies has shown that the risk of childhood obesity is significantly increased in infants born by CS even after correcting for maternal weight .Similar metabolic effects have been associated with early aber- rant profiles of gut microbiota - thus suggesting that the impact of microbial contact on metabolic maturation is most profound during early life and healthy metabolic development depends on interactions with healthy microbiota.

The role of gut microbiota on each of these areas is addressed in the following paragraphs moreover a summary of the currently recognized epigenetic mechanisms associated with specific gut microbiota profiles is provided in .Modulation of immune Response and Development of immune-Mediated DiseasesGut microbiota plays a key role in the development of immune response since the early phases of life by activating specific pathways of molecular signaling it supports the maturation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue  promotes the conversion of CD4 T-cells into T-regulatory cells  and influences the bal-ance between T-helper 1 and 2 which is known to have significanteffects on the development of allergic diseases .

Of interest the observed protective effects were heritable by the second-generation offspring and were also transmitted to other hosts via gut microbiota transfer suggesting the presence of underlying epigenetic mechanisms .Long-term Metabolic effects of early Aberrant MicrobiotaThe association between early antenatal and perinatal factors and metabolic profile later in life has been largely established.

Postnatal intestinal colonization in turn determined by maternal flora mode of delivery early skin-to-skin contact and neonatal diet leads to specific epigenetic signatures that can affect the barrier properties of gut mucosa and their protective role against later insults thus potentially predisposing to the development of late-onset inflammatory diseases.

The aim of this review is to outline the epigenetic mechanisms of programming and development acting within early-life stages and to examine in detail the role of maternal and neonatal nutrition microbiota composition and other environmental factors in deter- mining epigenetic changes and their short- and long-term effects.Keywords epigenetic regulation fetal programming overnutrition undernutrition micronutrients human milk microbiome disease originiNTRODUCTiONFollowing the so-called Developmental Origins hypothesis introduced by Barker and Osmond 30 years ago  and based on early developmental plasticity the environmental influence on health and disease has been progressively explored over the last decades.Raimondi F and Loverro G 2017 Epigenetic Matters The Link between Early Nutrition Microbiome and Long-term Health Development.Front.

During this time interval via epigenetic changes early nutrition can play a key role in developmental programming thereby possibly influencing the individual susceptibility to the later development of cardiovascular diseases obesity diabetes and other non-communicable chronic conditions.According to recent evidence the microbial colonization begins far before birth particularly the microbial flora from amniotic fluid placenta and maternal gut can support the devel- opment of a prenatal microbiota - that is likely to have aninfluence on the developing embryo and fetus.

On the other hand fish oil supplementa- tion in animal models has been associated with decreased global DNA methylation in the liver persisting for two generations lowered blood lipid concentrations increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity  however the path- ways involved still need to be completely elucidated.epigenetic effects of Maternal Undernutrition and Overnutrition during PregnancyGrowth and development during fetal life and early childhood are greatly influenced by macronutrient intakes during pregnancy suggesting the importance of an adequate maternal diet in this crucial phase.
