it is unclear whether prebiotics or probiotics alone or in combination can correct gut microbiome dysbiosis in the elderly and manifest in clinical outcomes that improve their health and well being.the number of prebiotics that have been evaluated in human clinical studies is limited but includes inulin gal- actooligosaccharides fructooligosaccharides and xylooligo- saccharides e. there have been few clinical studies in elderly adults to determine if digestion resistant starch could be an effective prebiotic to modulate the gut microbiome in a beneficial way.the primary objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the impact of daily consumption of msprebioticr a digestion resistant starch over 3 months on the gut microbiome in the elderly  70 years age eld and test for differences compared to mid-age 30e50 years age mid canadian adults.materials and methodspower analysis and sample sizefor the randomized placebo controlled study design and using the outcome measures described in the study protocol the statis- tical power analysis indicated that a total sample of n 20 in each group would have power 0.80 to detect a cohen's f effect size 0.33. this effect size was selected under the hypothesis that moderate differences 0.50 s.d.

so what is the explanation for improved gut health when there is an increase in bifidobacteria in the gut a number of studies have shown notsurprisingly that the gut microbiome is complex and interactive.

3. alpha diversity metrics of gut microbiome of elderly eld and mid-age mid adults at baseline and at week 14there were no significant differences in alpha diversity metrics for the microbiome of elderly eld 2 70 years and mid-age mid 30e50 years groups at baseline a. at week 14b there were statistically significant treatment differences for both eld and mid cohorts on msprebioticr compared to placebo padjusted 14 0.013 for shannon and padjusted 14 0.004 for inverse simpson.

the study coordinator and study nurse were responsible for enrolling participants and assigning them to placebo or study product based on the list of computer generated randomized numbers.

in both eld and mid cohorts there was a statistically sig- nificant increase in bifidobacterium after 12 weeks of msprebioticr consumption compared to the eld and mid cohorts consuming placebo.table 1comparison of gut microbiome phyla and genera in mid-age mid versus elderly eld at baseline.to better understand the bifidobacteria changes related to msprebioticr shows the breakdown of the various bifido- bacteria species at baseline compared to after 12 weeks of consuming either placebo or msprebioticr.

however there was a statistically significant difference in the alpha diversity plots for the shannon p 0.0131 and inverse simpson plots p 0.0036 for eld and mid cohorts on msprebioticr compared to the placebo at the end of the study .shows the relative abundance of different phyla and the most abundant twenty genera within the four cohorts at the end of the study.

there are conflicting reports regarding exactly which microbiome changes account for changes in health but there is agreement that the gut microbiome is altered.
