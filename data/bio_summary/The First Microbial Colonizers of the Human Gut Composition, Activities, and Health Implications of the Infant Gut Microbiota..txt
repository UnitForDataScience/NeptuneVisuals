Nevertheless bifidobacteria are typically found in large amounts in infants particularly breastfed infants and thus are considered a key member of the infant gut microbiota    .Notably despite the large variability at the intraindividual level during the period from initial assemblage of the infant gut microbiota to the establishment of an adult gut microbiota the infant gut microbiota can be classified into six main types FIG 8 The infant gut core microbiota.

In this context only a relatively small number of opportunistic pathogens are considered to be members of the gut microbiota residing unperturbed within the enteric host microbiota and becoming a health threat to the host only when the gut ecosystem is disturbed and the gut microbiota homeostasis becomes disrupted see below.The gastrointestinal microbiota composition may be affected by a number of environmental parameters such as pH oxygen levelsredox state availability of nutri- ents water activity and temperature enabling various populations to thrive and exert different activities while interacting with their environment including that of the human host .The abundant and diverse members of the human gut microbiota exert critical roles in the maintenance of human health by assisting in the breakdown of food substances so as to liberate nutrients that would otherwise be inaccessible to the host by promoting host cell differentiation by protecting the host from colonization of patho- gens and by stimulatingmodulating the immune system.

Finally we discuss the relevance of key microbial players of the infant gut microbiota in particular bifidobacteria with respect to their role in health and disease.KEYWORDS microbiome microbiota infants metagenomics virome bifidobacteria gut commensals probiotics gut microbiotaINTRODUCTIONGeneral Features of the Infant Gut Microbiotahe human body harbors trillions of microbial cells whose coordinated actions are believed to be important for human life.

Each panel displays the protocol for shotgun sequencing of the high-abundance bacterial target and their corresponding tracing in mother and infant gut microbiota samples.scenario in other primate and nonprimate mammals where bifidobacteria were shown to be commonly transmitted from a mother to her offspring and where the mother's milk represents an important means to drive such events .One may argue that bifidobacteria despite their decline following weaning persist following their initial transfer to the infant gut and are then maintained at very low levels in the adult gut to be ultimately transferred to the next generation .

This genetic repertoire is part of the unique core genome of members of the B. bifidum species  providing an intriguing case of coevolution of a human gut commensal to the human intestine where glycans produced by the host act as a carbon and energy source for the establishment and survival of certain bifidobacterial species within the human gut .Interestingly among the bifidobacterial communities that reside in the gut of human infants and adults certain species are present such as Bifidobacterium breve which possess carbohydrate breakdown capabilities toward both dietary and host- derived glycans .

This short-chain fatty acid is considered a beneficial product of the gut microbiota as it displays anti- inflammatory features and influences glucose and energy homeostasis and increases insulin sensitivity .Specific members of the genus Streptococcus also form part of the core infant gut microbiota and are among the first established bacteria in the infant gut where they can be identified within the first 24 h following birth  .The genus Collinsella.

The predation of bacterial populations by these phages is believed to play an important role in shaping the bacterial community structure of the gut  .An aberrant gut microbiota in early life may cause an imbalance between resident gut bacteria which in turn may result in incorrect immune system maturation with consequences in later life .

In this regard a better understanding of the interactions between the bacterial gut community and its associated virome is necessary in order to devise strategies to positively influence gut microbiota development in a newborn andor restore an anomalous gut microbiota to a normal one.Compared to bacterial microbiome investigations the study of the virome is still in its infancy .

This observa- tion indicates that phages impact bifidobacterial establishment and prevalence in the gut and suggests that these phages may enter the lytic cycle thereby modulating bifidobacterial colonization of the gut and their relative abundance in the gut .These findings therefore support the notion that the virome plays a role in influ- encing the bacterial microbiome composition and establishment necessitating the introduction of community-scale genetic approaches for further analyses .

autochtho- nous origin as well as knowledge of the molecular basis of their health-promoting effects .Future probiotic interventions directed to prevent andor counteract gut microbiota dysbiosis may necessarily involve next-generation probiotic bacteria which may include classical probiotic bacteria belonging to the Bifidobacterium or the Lactoba- cillus genus yet may also consist of other microbial groups of the infant core gut microbiota.It is expected that investigations of the infant gut microbiota will be central to understand human health and disease.
