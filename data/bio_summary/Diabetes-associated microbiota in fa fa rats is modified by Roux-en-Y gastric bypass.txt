here we studied the gut microbiota of fafa rats along the length of the intestine and investigated the following i how themicrobiota varies between diabetic fafa rats and nondiabetic fa rats along the length of the intes- tine ii whether changes in the gut microbiota in fa fa rats can be normalized by rygb andor djb andiii how the altered microbiota from different locations in the intestine contributes to glucose metabolism.materials and methodssurgically treated ratsthe five groups of rats used in the surgery experi- ments fa fafa sham-operated fafa rygb-treated fafa and djb-treated fafa rats have been described in an earlier study to assess differences in glycemic control .

also showed a similar pattern in all the intestinal segments investi- gated but its abundance was dramatically reduced in sham-operated fafa rats compared with unoperated fa rats not affected by djb compared with sham surgery and dramatically increased in rygb-treated compared with sham-operated fafa rats .within bacteroidetes the most abundant species that differed across the groups of rats were b. vulgatus and bacteroides acdifaciens f. the abundance of these species was reduced in sham- operated fafa rats compared with unoperated fa rats in the duodenum not affected by djb compared with sham surgery and increased in rygb-treated com- pared with sham-operated fafa rats and the differ- ences were most pronounced in ileum among proteobacteria e. coli also increased in the jejunum ileum and colon in rygb-treated compared with sham-operated fafa rats g.thus rygb surgery in fafa rats promoted changes in the microbial composition along the length of the intestine in particular a dramatic reduction in the abundance of lactobacillus species and an increase in bacteroides species resulting in a microbiota compo- sition similar to that of unoperated nondiabetic fa rats.

these changes compared with sham surgery were not observed following djb in fafa rats.transplanting the ileal microbiota does not transfer the metabolic phenotype of fafa ratsas rygb had the largest effect on the microbiota in the ileum we transferred the ileal microbiota of sham- and rygb-operated fafa rats to germ-free mice to investigate whether the ileal microbiota directly contributes to the metabolic phenotype of these rats.

here we used fafa rats as a model of impaired glucose tolerance to investigate whether i the microbiota varies between fafa and nondiabetic fa rats ii the microbiota of fafa rats is affected by rygb andor djb and iii surgically induced microbiota alterations contribute to glucose metabolism.

rygb- but not djb- treated fafa rats exhibited greater microbiota diversity in the ileum and lower l. animalis and l. reuteri abundance compared with sham- operated fafa rats in all intestinal segments and their microbiota composition resembled that of unoperated fa rats.

these results suggest that differences in cecal microbiota composition between the sham- versus rygb-operated rats could con- tribute to the improved metabolic phenotype of rygb-operated rats.taken together our results showed that the microbiota composition of diabetic fafa rats along the length of intestine was significantly altered by rygb but not by djb and resembled the microbiota composition of fa rats.

microbiota with low bacterial diversity may be less adapted to metabolize complex carbohy- drates resulting in lower fat gain and improved glucose tolerance.in contrast to mice colonized with ileal microbiota mice colonized with cecal microbiota from sham- operated rats showed worse glucose tolerance com- pared with recipients of cecal microbiota from rygb-treated rats.

the abundance of the phylum proteobacteria was sig- nificantly higher in the jejunum of unoperated fa rats and rygb-treated fafa rats compared with sham-operated fafa rats 3a.by comparing the relative abundance of genera across the five groups of rats and along the length of the intestine we showed that lactobacillus was the predominant genus in all the intestinal regions in unoperated fafa and sham-operated and djb-treated rats supplementary figure s2.

to investigate the functional role of rygb-associated microbiota alterations we transferred microbiota from sham- and rygb-treated fafa rats to germ-free mice.

finally by microbiota transfer to germ-free mice colonization with the cecal but not the ileal microbiota of rygb-treated fafa rats partially transferred the phenotype of improved glycemic control to recipient mice.an association between lactobacillus species and blood glucose levels has previously been noted in humans.
