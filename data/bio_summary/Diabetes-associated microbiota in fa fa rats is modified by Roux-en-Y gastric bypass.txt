Here we studied the gut microbiota of fafa rats along the length of the intestine and investigated the following i how themicrobiota varies between diabetic fafa rats and nondiabetic fa rats along the length of the intes- tine ii whether changes in the gut microbiota in fa fa rats can be normalized by RYGB andor DJB andiii how the altered microbiota from different locations in the intestine contributes to glucose metabolism.Materials and methodsSurgically treated ratsThe five groups of rats used in the surgery experi- ments fa fafa sham-operated fafa RYGB-treated fafa and DJB-treated fafa rats have been described in an earlier study to assess differences in glycemic control .

Glucose tolerance in response to an OGTT was impaired and fat gain was higher in the RYGB recipients compared with the sham recipients Fie.Transplanting the cecal microbiota transfers the metabolic phenotype of fafa ratsTo investigate whether the microbiota in the cecum which has a higher biomass and is more metabolically active compared with the ileal microbiota of fafa rats directly contributes to the metabolic phenotype ofthese rats we transplanted the cecal microbiota of sham- and RYGB-operated fafa rats into germ-free mice and colonized the mice for 2 weeks.Alpha diversity was lower in the cecum of recipients of cecal microbiota from sham- versus RYGB-operated fafa rats 5a.

Significance was established at Po0.05.ResultsComposition of the gut microbiota of fafa rats is modified by RYGB but not by DJBFasting glucose and insulin levels in the five groups of rats used in this study unoperated fa unoperated fafa sham-operated fafa RYGB-treated fafa and DJB-treated fafa have previously been reported both variables were significantly higher in unoperated fafa rats compared with fa rats at 17 weeks of age and were normalized in fafa rats that underwent RYGB but not in those that were sham operated  4.

also showed a similar pattern in all the intestinal segments investi- gated but its abundance was dramatically reduced in sham-operated fafa rats compared with unoperated fa rats not affected by DJB compared with sham surgery and dramatically increased in RYGB-treated compared with sham-operated fafa rats .Within Bacteroidetes the most abundant species that differed across the groups of rats were B. vulgatus and Bacteroides acdifaciens f. The abundance of these species was reduced in sham- operated fafa rats compared with unoperated fa rats in the duodenum not affected by DJB compared with sham surgery and increased in RYGB-treated com- pared with sham-operated fafa rats and the differ- ences were most pronounced in ileum Among Proteobacteria E. coli also increased in the jejunum ileum and colon in RYGB-treated compared with sham-operated fafa rats g.Thus RYGB surgery in fafa rats promoted changes in the microbial composition along the length of the intestine in particular a dramatic reduction in the abundance of Lactobacillus species and an increase in Bacteroides species resulting in a microbiota compo- sition similar to that of unoperated nondiabetic fa rats.

These changes compared with sham surgery were not observed following DJB in fafa rats.Transplanting the ileal microbiota does not transfer the metabolic phenotype of fafa ratsAs RYGB had the largest effect on the microbiota in the ileum we transferred the ileal microbiota of sham- and RYGB-operated fafa rats to germ-free mice to investigate whether the ileal microbiota directly contributes to the metabolic phenotype of these rats.

Here we used fafa rats as a model of impaired glucose tolerance to investigate whether i the microbiota varies between fafa and nondiabetic fa rats ii the microbiota of fafa rats is affected by RYGB andor DJB and iii surgically induced microbiota alterations contribute to glucose metabolism.

Principal coordinate analysis PCoA plot using unweighted UniFrac distances of gut microbial communities separated either by b intestinal segmentc surgery or d as in c but divided according to intestinal segment in fa n  4-5 fafa n  4-5 sham-operated fafa n  5 DJB- treated fafa n  5 and RYGB-treated fafa n  5-6 rats.

e Bacteroides vulgatus f Bacteroides acidifaciens andg Escherichia coli in duodenum jejunum ileum and colon of fa n  4-5 fafa n  4-5 sham-operated fafa n  5 DJB-treated fafa n  5 and RYGB-treated fafa n  5-6 rats.

RYGB- but not DJB- treated fafa rats exhibited greater microbiota diversity in the ileum and lower L. animalis and L. reuteri abundance compared with sham- operated fafa rats in all intestinal segments and their microbiota composition resembled that of unoperated fa rats.

These results suggest that differences in cecal microbiota composition between the sham- versus RYGB-operated rats could con- tribute to the improved metabolic phenotype of RYGB-operated rats.Taken together our results showed that the microbiota composition of diabetic fafa rats along the length of intestine was significantly altered by RYGB but not by DJB and resembled the microbiota composition of fa rats.
