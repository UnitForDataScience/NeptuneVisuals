While normal rats were rectally administered with normal saline at equivalent instead of TNBS 55.Experimental procedures24 hours day 1 after induction of colitis all the rats were randomly assigned to six groups five rats were chosen in each group Normal group N receiving normal saline at equivalent and received intragastric administration ig saline during treatment TNBS model group M receiving ethanol vehicle with TNBS TNBS  saline Sulfasalazine group PP receiving SASP 0.5 gkg TNBS  SASP Chrysanthemum polysaccharides CP high middle and low dose treatment group HP MP LP receiving CP 200 mgkg TNBS  HP 100 mgkg TNBS MP and 50 mgkg TNBS  LP respectively.

The OTUs network-based analyses showed that samples from LP MP and PP were more closely related to N compared to HP and M Figure 3 which suggested that samples among LP MP and PP possessed higher similarity than that among HP and M. The above analyses would provide supports for the hypothesis that different treatment factors were selective pressures on microbiota and play key roles in the protective effects on TNBS-induced colitis.Comparison of the gut bacterial community among different treatment groupsIn this study notable differences in richness and diversity of intestinal microflora among the different treatment groups were observed.
