In Table 1 the ACE Chao1 Shannon and Simpson indexesin the TNBS group were much lower than those in the normal control group which were dramatically risen by Chrysanthemum polysaccharides treatment p0.01.

Using 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis of content samples from the normal group TNBS-induced colitis and sequential Chrysanthemum polysaccharides treatment groups we observed that profiles of predominant bacteria changed persistently.

The OTUs network-based analyses showed that samples from LP MP and PP were more closely related to N compared to HP and M Figure 3 which suggested that samples among LP MP and PP possessed higher similarity than that among HP and M. The above analyses would provide supports for the hypothesis that different treatment factors were selective pressures on microbiota and play key roles in the protective effects on TNBS-induced colitis.Comparison of the gut bacterial community among different treatment groupsIn this study notable differences in richness and diversity of intestinal microflora among the different treatment groups were observed.
