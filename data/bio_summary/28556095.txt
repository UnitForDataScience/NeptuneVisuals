Finally in the DAPH Daphnia microbiota treatment water-rinsed ephippia were placed in wells supplemented with a homogenate of whole adult Daphnia with a normal microbiome as in Sison-Mangus et al.

Thus given that the dia- pausing stage is a recurring phase of the life cycle of Daphnia during which there is potential for host and essential symbionts to become decoupled we think that the process by which Daphnia benefit from bacteria is better understood as an open system Wong et al.

The carriage of bacteria in or on ephip- pia might have ecological consequences even if it does not result in the maintenance of specific partnerships--Daphnia and bacteria from a source environment might co-disperse resulting in occa- sional patterns of co-occurrence that could be detected with meth- ods being developed in microbial biogeography Falush et al.

The beneficial effects of microbiota on Daphnia likely extend beyond general improvement of health and additionally encompass specific services like degradation of dietary proteins and polysaccha- rides Callens et al.

The marginally significant effect of exposure to Acidovorax on hatching rates at warmed temperature and the improvement in survival and growth Acidovorax-exposed animals suggest that bacte- ria internal to ephippia may be beneficial to Daphnia even if they are not sufficient on their own for normal functioning or always viableFIGURE 5 Relationships of ephippia-associated bacteria to bacteria found in lab-reared adult Daphnia in a previous study OTUs shown in black font.

For statistical analysis see Table 4previously found at high abundances in adult Daphnia Figure 5 Qi et al.

Sampling and plating water from the bottles of animals exposed to ephippia-associated bacteria Experiment 2 showed that the bacteria initially carried on the animals could also persist in the external me- dium suggesting that the bacteria associated with ephippia are not necessarily dependent on Daphnia but are rather in flux with the en- vironment similarly to observations in Drosophila Blum et al.

Similarly closely related strains of Limnohabitans bacteria appear to vary in their colonisation ability and effects on Daphnia fitness Peerakietkhajorn Kato et al.
