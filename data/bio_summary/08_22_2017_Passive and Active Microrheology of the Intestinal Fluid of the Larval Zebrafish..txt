The latter was found to be 16 nm larger than the sin- gle-frame estimate as expected as it accounts for both uncertainty within individual images and vibration across image frames.To relate D to the fluid viscosity h we used the Stokes-Einstein-Suther- land relation D kBT 6pha  where kB is Boltzmann's constant T is temperature and a is the particle radius.

Using this method we are able to introduce a vol- ume of fluid small enough that it does not visually displace mucus from the gut as seen by mucus autofluorescence but carries with it the desired tracer particles.

values of mucus viscosity that are 5 times larger than that of water with a slight enhancement in germ-freeDISCUSSIONFrom both passive and active in vivo microrheological mea- surements of the larval zebrafish gut we find responses that are well described by viscous fluid models with a negligible elastic response from intestinal mucus.

The rheological properties of intestinal mucus have therefore been the subject of many investigations thus far limited to in vitro studies due to the difficulty of measurement in the natural context of the gut.

Third and most importantly recent studies have specifically characterized larval zebrafish intestinal mucus identifying mucin gene types labeling intestinal mucins and perturbing mucus secretion .

For example in contrast to measurements of reconstituted mucus that report a lowering of viscosity by Helicobacter pylori  other studies report an increase in mucus viscosity followingH.

Together these and other data suggest that animal species developmental stage mucus type and possible in vitro preparation artifacts have major impacts on mucus rheology a more thorough understanding of which calls for considerable effort.Our own work is motivated especially by the utility of larval zebrafish for studies of the vertebrate microbiome and past work has shown that bacterial motility in the intes- tinal space can be a major determinant of community composition .

For the low Reynolds number system of a colloidal par- ticle in a fluid a field oscillating as bdtTh14 b0exp12iut will result in a particle orientation of qdtTh 14 q0duThexp12idut th fTh.

Additionally a ferrite core elec- tromagnet is mounted to one side of the sample such that when supplied with a current the orientation of the field is tilted to an angle b with respect to vertical.

Using this expression the frequency dependence of a particle's response to an oscillating field can yield a measure of the surrounding fluid's viscosity.
