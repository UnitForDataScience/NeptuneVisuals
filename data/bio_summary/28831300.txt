The colonies appeared ochre non-haemolytic motile spore forming and were 1 mm in size.

The cells were Gram-positive cocci-shaped with a 1-mm diameter.

The strain did not show catalase or oxidase activity.

The strain Marseille-P3441 had a 16S rRNA gene sequence identity of 95.53 with Blautia glucerasea strain JCM 17039 NR113231 the phylogenetically closest species with standing in nomenclature .

The simi- larity was 98.65 which led us to putatively classify Marseille- P3441T as a new member in the Lachnospiraceae family of the Clostridiales order of the phylum Firmicutes .

The colonies appeared beige non-haemolytic motile non-spore forming and were 2 mm in size.

The cells were Gram-positive rod-shaped and ranged from 5 mm and 0.7 mm.
