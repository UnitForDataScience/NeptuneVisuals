These include antibiotics to eliminate bacteria pro- or pre-biotics to introduce or encourage growth of bacteria and fecal microbial transfer to theoretically replace the entire bacterial community.132 None of these strategies is completely effective but all are in current use.Antibiotics have been used to target pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract often with the unintended consequences of also targeting commensal bacteria.133 The gut bacterial community composition is disrupted by antibiotic administration but short-term treatment with narrow spectrum drugs usually leads to transient changes.134 However longer-term treatments or use of broad-spectrum drugs can broadly or permanently change the composition of the gut bacterial community in unintended ways and potentially contribute to disease.135 Thus it is unlikely that treatment with traditional antibiotics will be sufficient to achieve the desired changes to gut microbes.Messer et al.Page 13Pro- and pre-biotics have also been used to manipulate gut bacteria.

They would also be expected to promote colonization by desirable bacteria and exclude bacteria likely to have detrimental effects on the established bacterial community or the host.Competition in the gut bacterial community occurs between bacteria generally considered to be commensal and between commensal bacteria and true pathogens.4344 Contests between commensals and pathogens are referred to as commensal exclusion or colonization resistance and encompass a number of competitive interactions for physical attachment sites and resources.

In general anti-bacterial factors are concentrated in the areas closest to the intestinal epithelium and are produced in response to host detection of bacteria through a number of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms.7677 These mechanisms have been extensively reviewed elsewhere so this discussion will focus on some notable bacterial mechanisms for evasion of host anti-bacterial defenses.Stable colonization requires that bacteria avoid expulsion from a niche by host defenses.

One strategy employed by bacteria to evade host anti-bacterial defenses is modification or modulation of cell surface structures detected or targeted by the host.7879 Antimicrobial peptides are family of proteins produced in the intestinal epithelium which rapidly kill or inactivate microbes.80 Killing by antimicrobial peptides can be evaded by Gram negative bacteria through modification of their lipopolysaccharides LPS to decrease the electronegativity on their cell surface which renders them resistant to the electrostatic attraction of positively charged antimicrobial peptides.81 Gram positive bacteria can modify the lipoteichoic acids that make up their cells walls to make themselves resistant to antimicrobial peptides.82 Another strategy used by bacteria to evade host defenses is molecular mimicry.

This includes Faecalibacterium prausnitzii which can tolerate oxygen at the mucosal interface due to an extracellular electron shuttle utilizing flavins and thiols.34 Other bacteria such as B. fragilisMesser et al.Page 5and Clostridium acetobutylicum have developed molecular switches that allow them to survive under fluctuating oxygen levels.3536 Oxygen concentrations also sometimes define bacterial co-occurence between microaerophiles that consume oxygen and strict anaerobes that cannot grow in its presence.37 This is thought to be a factor in bacterial succession during the initial colonization of the naive infant gut.Finally bacteria must be able to reproduce and the progeny must re-colonize the intestine or colonization by a given organism will be short-lived.

Pickard et al 2014 demonstrated that systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide increased mucosal fucosylation which was in turn associated with enhanced fucose- dependent host tolerance of an enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium.75 Considered together these data suggest that carbohydrates are an important currency of host-microbe exchanges the complexity of which we are only just beginning to appreciate.Bacterial specific host factors that affect bacterial colonization--In addition to its non-specific antibacterial defenses the host epithelium also has a number of specific antibacterial defenses that help to determine which microbes are able to colonize and survive within the GI tract.

This has been shown through mono-association of germ free mice with B. thetaiomicron which directly upregulates expression of host epithelial fucosyltransferase mRNA.72 Glycans can also serve as attachment sites as is the case when the E. coli fimbrial protein FimH interacts with mannose residues on host surfaces to facilitate bacterial attachment.7374 Finally host protein glycosylation can influence host immune responses to microbes.

Microbes from the environment or those from another eukaryotic host both have the potential to colonize the GI tract.Environmental bacteria are well adapted to conditions in the external environment while host-associated bacteria must exit one host and survive in the external environment long enough to be re-internalized by a second host.

This means that understanding the role of gut bacteria in human disease will require development of disease paradigms that are very different from those that explain infectious disease and Koch's postulates will need to be re-imagined for these studies.108 There are certainly some bacteria that are obligate pathogens but many more have the potential to promote or prevent disease in certain contexts.It is also becoming increasingly obvious that interactions between a host and its microbes not just the presence or absence of specific bacteria are important in the pathophysiology of diseases related to gut bacteria.

This is supported by the finding that humans have huge inter-individual variability in their gut microbiomes with regard to both diversity and abundance by16S amplicon sequencing and metagenomics.92-94 This variability is likely a product of genetics and environment since even monozygotic twins are not identical in their fecal microbiomes.94-96 It also means that the gut bacterial community has host specificity and functions that make it akin to an organ system.The unique nature of the individual human gut bacterial community also means that gut bacterial communities in model organisms are very different from their human counterparts.
