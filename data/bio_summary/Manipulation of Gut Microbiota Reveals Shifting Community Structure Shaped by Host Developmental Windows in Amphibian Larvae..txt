In con- junction with the ontogenetic sampling of wood frogs donor wood frog larvae at GS 27 were com- pared to green frog controls and green frogs inocu- lated with wood frog guts 2 weeks after hatching at GS 27.Experiment 2 aimed to test how host development influenced transplant colonization and community dynamics of gut microbiota in wood frogs here homogenized bullfrog guts were added to sterilized wood frog eggs.

W. Warne et al.shifts in gut microbiomes we tested the hypotheses that microbiota differed among species and that microbiota transplants between species would pro- vide insight into the factors influencing amphibian microbiome colonization community composition and stability.MethodsAnimal collectionsWe collected wood frog and green frog egg masses as well as bullfrog larvae as an inoculate source from local wetlands by permit from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources NH15.5778.

Green frog eggs were exposed to a gnotobiotic protocol fol- lowed by inoculation with either homogenized larval wood frog guts halved-circle and arrow green frog egg jelly gray circle or unmanipulated control white circle green frog larvae were sampled at Gosner stage 27 2 weeks after hatching.

Green frog larvae inoculated with homogen- ized green frog eggs  halved circle also exhibited shifts in gut microbiota diversity relative to unmanipulated larvae  open circle.

Fusobacteria had the highest relative abundance in bullfrog larva collected from local ponds at Gosner stage 38 whereas control wood frog and green frog larvae were hatched in pond water that included pond debris in the lab and fed the same rabbitManipulation of gut microbiota and amphibian larvae791Fig.

We compared the gut microbiota of larval wood frogs Lithobates Rana sylvaticus green frogs L. clamitans and bullfrogs L. catesbeianus at varied developmental stages from the egg through metamorphosis to the unfed juven- ile frog stage.

All larvae were fed pow- dered rabbit pellets and turtle food ad libitum for 1 week and then whole rabbit pellets thereafter.Experiment 1 aimed to test the potential for gutmicrobiota transplant in green frogs here homogen- ized wood frog guts collected from GS 27-30 larvae were added to the sterilized green frog eggs.

In Experiment 2 control wood frog larvae and wood frog larvae inoculated with bullfrog guts were sampled within 24 h of hatching GS 26 2 weeks after hatching at GS 27 and at prometamorphosis-GS 35.

For experiment two we analyzed the stages separ- ately in order to compare bullfrog donors to the swapped treatment.ResultsGut microbiota varies with host development and speciesDiversity of the gastrointestinal microbiota GIM in larval wood frogs varied across ontogeny as indicated by PCoA of weighted UniFrac data .

Larval green frogs collected as eggs and sampled at stage 27 2 weeks after hatching had gut microbiota distinct from wood frogs at the same stage PERMANOVA comparison of green frogs and wood frogs at stage 27 F 8.36 R2 0.54 P  0.0001 n 8 despitesimilar lab rearing conditions and food  open circle.Experiment 1 test of gut microbiota transplant in green frogsDifferences among species allowed for a test of the potential to transplant gut microbiomes.
