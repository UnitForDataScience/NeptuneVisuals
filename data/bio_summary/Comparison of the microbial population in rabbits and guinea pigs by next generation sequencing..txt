Here we present a comparison between the bacterial community of faecal samples from the rabbit and the community of another caecotrophagic species the guinea pig to com- pare samples collected from different species of domesticated caecotrophagic animals as well as samples collected from different regions of the digestive tracts of rabbits living in the wild.ResultsIn total 450544 high quality sequences were obtained from the 12 faecal samples 6 rabbits and 6 guinea pigs which clustered into 811 unique operational taxonomic units OTUs 396 were only found in rabbits 301 were only found in guinea pigs and 114 were found in samples from both species.

A Mann-Whitney test  of the entire populations present in the rabbit and guinea pig faecal samples also showed significant differ- ences P0.05 between bacterial species present in the two different animals.Hence although six different phyla could be identified only two of them were present Fir- micutes and Bacteroidetes in relatively large numbers in all animals with Fibrobacteres also present at a high level in one of the guinea pigs.Percentage of each phylum present in fresh faecal samples collected from domesticated rabbits and rectal samples collected from wild rabbits together with the percentage of sequences which could not be classified within a particular phylum.doi10.1371journal.pone.0165779.g002Comparison of faecal samples from domesticated rabbits and rectal samples from wild rabbitsThe range of phyla detected was very similar to that seen in the comparison between the domesticated rabbit and guinea pig faecal samples Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Tenericutes being detected.

Of these phyla most OTUs were identified within one of three cate- gories Bacteroidetes 32.3 in rabbits and 67.3 in guinea pigs Firmicutes 29.0 in rabbits and 9.3 in guinea pigs and unclassified bacteria 36.2 in rabbits and 21.6 in guinea pigs.In total 203 OTUs were classified as being from the phylum Bacteroidetes.

In addition to the density of Bacteroidetes in guinea pigs being approximately double that of the rabbits the number of OTUs specific to guinea pigs 136 OTUs was higher than the number of rabbit- specific Bacteroidetes 20 OTUs or those found in both species 47 OTUs.

As with the Bacteroidetes the Firmicutes OTUs that were found in samples from both species showed a higher abundance in one species than the other again typically 100-1000 times higher in the preferred species.

Total number of OTUs detected in each sample group.doi10.1371journal.pone.0165779.t001Percentage of each phylum present in fresh faecal samples collected from domesticated rabbits and guinea pigs together with the percentage of sequences which could not be classified within a particular phylum.doi10.1371journal.pone.0165779.g001Comparison of domesticated rabbit and guinea pig faecal samplesIn addition to a number of chloroplast and unidentified sequences six different phyla of bacte- ria were identified within the sequences Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Fibrobacteres Firmi- cutes Proteobacteria and Tenericutes.

Thus although the Bacteroidetes are present in samples from both species there seems to be a sub-set within this phylum which is specific to or at least over-represented in either the guinea pig or rabbit.The other major phylum detected comprised the Firmicutes.

Instead each animal had a few proteobacterial OTUs often with one OTU being more abundant than others although the OTU which was most abundant varied between animals irrespective of species.Actinobacteria were found in faecal samples from both species and although they were at low abundance in both species they were more abundant in rabbits 0.8 than in guinea pigs 0.06.

However unlike the observations of  where sequences from Firmicutes were the most abundant group in adult animals the rabbits here show a relatively even split 51 Bacteroidetes and 45 Firmicutes and the guinea pigs show that the majority of identifiable sequences are from Bacteroidetes 86.

Although there are 47 OTUs which are present in faecal samples from both species it is worth noting that in all cases the OTU is seen as more abundant in one species than the other typically 100-1000 times higher in the preferred species.
