it is likely that in the present study the use of a single high dose of amoxicillin for newborn piglets prevented or treated the early umbilical infections occurring immediately after birth and therefore the prevalence of umbilical hernias was lower in treated piglets at the age of nine weeks.

however body weights of pigs with different defects were not significantly different regardless of the types of hernia or abscess at nine weeks .the average daily weight gain of the non-defective pigs between weeks four and nine was greater in the ant groups n  405 compared with the con groups n  415 lsmeans - se 497.5 gd - 5.0 vs. 475.3 gd - 4.9 p  0.01. mean - sd of the average daily gain between weeks four and nine in pigs was 432.1 gd - 91.1 for an umbilical hernia n  6385.7 gd - 210.4 for an umbilical abscess n  3 361.9 gd - 90.2 for an inguinal hernia n  6 and 460.7 gd - 105.9 for an inguinal abscess n  4.the piglet mortality ratios in the con group were higher than those in the ant group dur- ing the first week of life ls means - se 7.5 - 0.7 vs. 4.7 - 0.7 and between birth and fourth week 10.5 - 1.0 vs. 6.9 - 1.0 p  0.05 for both .

they were screened for the presence of mcr-1 gene using pcr but yielded negative results.discussionthe administration of amoxicillin for new-born piglets had no effect on the prevalence of her- nias and abscesses in umbilical area of pigs until four weeks and in inguinal area until nine weeks of age.

the means of changes - sd in size of the defects between four and nine weeks of age from the 19 pigs were as follows umbilical hernias n  6 9.3 cm - 8.8 umbilical abscesses n  3 4.5 cm - 4.3 inguinal her- nias n  6 6.0 cm - 3.6 and inguinal abscesses n  4 - 1.1 cm - 6.0.body weight and mortalityaverage body weight measured from a total of 820 non-defective pigs was 8.2 kg - 1.8 and 25.3 kg - 4.6 at the age of four and nine weeks respectively.

the prevalence of umbilical hernias or abscesses did not differ between the groups at four weeks of age butit was higher in the con group than in the ant group at nine weeks of age 2.3 vs. 0.7 p  0.05. numbers of inguinal hernias and abscesses did not differ between the groups at four or nine weeks of age.

a creep feeding diet ne 11.0 mjkg cp 19.0 for the nursery piglets was provided after 14 days of birth until weaning.the umbilical area of newborn piglets was not disinfected after birth.

consequently we aimed to investigate the effects of a single amoxicillin treatment of newborn piglets on the prevalence of hernias and abscesses in the umbilical and inguinal areas until the age of nine weeks.

this could indicate that esbl encoding genes are not present in the farm microbiome.conclusionscontrary to the hypothesis of the study administration of one dose of amoxicillin during the first day of life decreased the prevalence of umbilical hernias and abscesses at nine weeks of age and the need to treat the piglets for leg problems.

the ant group when it compared with the con group increased the weight gain between four and nine weeks of age ls means - se 497.5 gd - 5.0 vs.475.3 gd - 4.9 p  0.01 and decreased piglet mortality 19.5 - 1.0 vs. 6.9 - 1.0 p  0.05 and the need to treat the piglets for leg problems 3.4 - 0.3 vs. 1.9 - 0.3 p  0.01 but not for other diseases by the age of four weeks.

porcine umbilical hernias are mainly due to incomplete closure of the umbilical cord after birth which is caused by genetic variability in musculature of the navel cord or infection of the umbilical stump or both  .
