It is likely that in the present study the use of a single high dose of amoxicillin for newborn piglets prevented or treated the early umbilical infections occurring immediately after birth and therefore the prevalence of umbilical hernias was lower in treated piglets at the age of nine weeks.

The means of changes - SD in size of the defects between four and nine weeks of age from the 19 pigs were as follows umbilical hernias N  6 9.3 cm - 8.8 umbilical abscesses N  3 4.5 cm - 4.3 inguinal her- nias N  6 6.0 cm - 3.6 and inguinal abscesses N  4 - 1.1 cm - 6.0.Body weight and mortalityAverage body weight measured from a total of 820 non-defective pigs was 8.2 kg - 1.8 and 25.3 kg - 4.6 at the age of four and nine weeks respectively.

The ANT group when it compared with the CON group increased the weight gain between four and nine weeks of age LS means - SE 497.5 gd - 5.0 vs.475.3 gd - 4.9 P  0.01 and decreased piglet mortality 19.5 - 1.0 vs. 6.9 - 1.0 P  0.05 and the need to treat the piglets for leg problems 3.4 - 0.3 vs. 1.9 - 0.3 P  0.01 but not for other diseases by the age of four weeks.

The prevalence of umbilical hernias or abscesses did not differ between the groups at four weeks of age butit was higher in the CON group than in the ANT group at nine weeks of age 2.3 vs. 0.7 P  0.05.

The occurrence ratio of umbilical or inguinal hernias abscesses or both was not signifi- cantly different between the ANT and CON groups palpated at four weeks.Out of a total of 6451 pigs palpated at nine weeks umbilical hernias abscesses or both were found from 30 0.5 17 barrow and 13 female 43 0.7 20 barrow and 23 female or 22 0.3 13 barrow and 9 female pigs respectively.

They were screened for the presence of mcr-1 gene using PCR but yielded negative results.DiscussionThe administration of amoxicillin for new-born piglets had no effect on the prevalence of her- nias and abscesses in umbilical area of pigs until four weeks and in inguinal area until nine weeks of age.
