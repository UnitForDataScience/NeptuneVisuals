Occludin tight junction protein was also down-regulated in hypoxia group thus confirming mucosal barrier injury occurs with hypobaric hypoxia exposure.In our unpublished study Zonulin a tight junction protein was found to increase in serum with exposure to hypobaric hypoxia of 25 000 ft suggesting that intesti- nal barrier permeability increases with hypobaric hypoxia exposure.

Also transcrip- tome studies on humans show that genes for immune and inflammatory responses are affected by high altitude which is itself associated with AMS..High-altitude-induced mucosal barrier dysfunction.Exercise as a model of stress and mucosal immunity.Probioticsprebiotics and role in betterment of GITimmunity problems at high altitudeAltitude-induced GI tract problemsHigh-altitude-induced alteration in mucosal.Gastrointestinal infection at high altitudeimmunity.Immunomodulators improvinghigh-altitude-induced problems with gut immunity and mucosal barrier dysfunctionAn important branch of adaptive immune response that is mostly vulnerable to invading pathogens and infec- tions is mucosal immune system.

As intestinal barrier dysfunction can lead to vari- ous intestinal infections and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome MODS thus TLR4NF-kB signalling path-way can be understood better as a therapeutic target.In another study on rabbits exposed to simulated high altitude of 4000 m in hypobaric hypoxia cham- ber haemorrhagic shock was induced in the treatment group against the control group and it was confirmed that haemorrhagic shock at high altitude induces mucosal barrier injury.

Rhodi- ola which is a traditional medicine to overcome physical stress in Tibet was used to alleviate the effects of hypoxia on rearing of Broiler chickens and decreased the mortality rate.Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia at 7000 m for 3 days in animal decompressionchamber and it was concluded that hypobaric hypoxia can cause intestinal barrier injury and cause increased bacterial and endotoxin translocation.

It was found that Gln could improve mucosal barrier regulated the microbial diver- sity of intestinal barrier which were found to be affected by hypobaric hypoxia environment.

Major mucosal systems present in human body and comparison of intestinal barrier under normal oxygen levels sea level and high-altitude conditions.LPS on the other hand is an endotoxin which induces intestinal inflammation and intestinal tight junction per- meability.

represents major mucosal systems in humans and diagrammatic comparison between intesti- nal barrier at sea level and high altitude.Exercise as a model of stress and mucosal immunityExercise being a very popular stress model there are some studies in which humans are made to exercise at high alti- tude to see its effect on mucosal immunity.In a study to check the effect of acute hypoxic exer- cise on endurance-trained males subjects were cycled for 75 min at normoxic environment as well as simulated hypobaric hypoxic environment equivalent to 2000 m in decompression chamber.

As M cells have the capacity to deliver antigens directly to the mucosal immune initiation sites they have been recently studied to develop and improve strategies for mucosal vaccines.Intestinal barrier is a single layer which is selectively permeable to nutrients water and electrolytes and pre- vents the entry of invading harmful pathogens.It sep- arates intestinal lumen from the lamina propria.

The study was carried out in simu- lated hypobaric hypoxia at 4872.9 m 55 KPa air pressure for 30 days 8 hday and the density of total aerobes was found to decrease significantly in contrast to total anaer- obes whose density was increased significantly.In another study epithelial barrier of large intestine was seen to be damaged by hypobaric hypoxia of 30 days 8 hday at 55 kPa air pressure 4872.9 m approx.. Large intestinal microbial populations were found to be manip- ulated and considered to be the cause of this damage and subsequently the cause for systemic infection.Faecal samples of seven mountaineers who went to high altitude above 5000 m in a 47-day expedition showed that potential pathogenic bacteria of gamma subdivision of Proteobacteria and Escherichia coli increased.

There- fore changes in the intestinal microbiota composition may be involved in high-altitude-induced immunological challenges.Mucosal barrier injurydysfunctionMany studies support the fact that high altitude has shown to cause non-functioning of mucosal barrier.
