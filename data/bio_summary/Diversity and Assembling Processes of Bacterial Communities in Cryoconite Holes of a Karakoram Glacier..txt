Further studies are therefore needed to gain insight into the processes assembling the microbial communi- ties of cryoconite in temperate mountain glaciers the geo- graphical variation in the structure of bacterial communities living in these environments and the potential impact of sur- face bacterial communities on glacier mass balance  .In this study we aimed at contributing to filling this gap of knowledge by describing the structures of the microbial com- munities of 30 cryoconite holes sampled on Baltoro Glacier Karakoram and by investigating the ecological processes explaining the spatial diversity of these bacterial communities.

Cryoconite holes were therefore naturally spatially clustered with groups of holes close to one another on flat areas on ridges well separated from those in other flat areas on the same or on a different ridge.We sampled cryoconite from holes in four separated areas Fig.. Due to difficulties in moving on the surface of Baltoro holes in different areas were samples on different days Fig.. Areas 1 2 and 3 were sampled on 29 and 30 June and 1 July respectively while area 4 was sampled on 9 July 2013.

Importantly to the best of our knowledge microbial communities of cryoconite holes on Karakoram glaciers have been investigated in one previous paper only .Materials and MethodsStudy Area Field Methods and Environmental DataCryoconite holes were sampled on the surface of Baltoro Glacier close to Gasherbrum Base Camp GBC approximate coordinates 35deg41'07'' N 76deg38'52'' E Fig..

In this study we investigated the structure of bacterial communities of cryoconite holes of Baltoro Glacier a large 62 km in length and 524 km2 of surface glacier of the Karakoram by high- throughput sequencing of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene.

We found that Betaproteobacteria dom- inated bacterial communities with large abundance of genera Polaromonas probably thanks to its highly versatile metabo- lism and Limnohabitans which may have been favoured by the presence of supraglacial lakes in the area where cryoconite holes were sampled.

Variation in bacterial communities among different sampling areas of the glacier could be ex- plained by divergent selective processes driven by variation in environmental conditions particularly pH which was the only environmental variable that significantly affected the structure of bacterial communities.

The functionality and chemistry of down-valley systems can therefore be influenced by the metabolic activities present in cryoconite holes that can enrich meltwater in organic matter and nutrients  .Cryoconite holes on low-latitude mountain glaciers show different features from those on polar glaciers mainly because glaciers on low-latitude mountains generally flow faster and are subject to larger diurnal temperature fluctuations than po- lar ones .

In addition contrasts in the microbial ecology of cryoconite holes seem to exist not only between polar and Alpine glaciers  but also among cryoconite holes on dif- ferent mountain glaciers.

Baltoro surface in the GBC area is characterized by a high superficial roughness with undula- tions of about 10-20 m. Cryoconite holes occurred in flat areas on ridges while small supraglacial lakes often occurredFig.1 Distribution of the 30 cryoconite holes sampled on Baltoro Glacier.
