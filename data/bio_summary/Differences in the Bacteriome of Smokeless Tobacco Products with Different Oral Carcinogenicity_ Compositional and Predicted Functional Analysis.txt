In the current study we characterize the species composition and predict the functional attributes of the bacterial community in ST products with different carcinogenicity namely samples of American moist snuff Swedish snus Sudanese toombak and Yemeni shammah.Materials and MethodsSmokeless Tobacco Products--DNA ExtractionEleven ready-to-use ST products were included in the study as follows four brands of American moist snuff coded as A1-A4 three brands of Swedish snus coded as S1-S3 a sample of Sudanese toombak SuT and samples of three types of Yemeni shammah namely black yellow and green shammah BS YS and GS respectively.

Secondly the high quality reads were aligned using Needleman's method to SILVA reference alignment  and those with bad alignment reads with start and end positions different than those of the majority of the reads were removed.

Finally the remaining reads were cleared of chimeras with Uchime  using the self-reference approach in which each read is checked against reads with higher abundance in the same sample .Taxonomy Assignment AlgorithmThe high quality non-chimeric reads were classified to the species level employing the BLASTN-based algorithm illustrated in Figure .

The relevance of these differences particularly with respect to nickel and cadmium to oral carcinogenesis warrants further investigation.Keywords bacteria bacteriome carcinoma microbiome mouth smokeless snuff tobaccoIntroductionSmokeless tobacco ST refers to forms of tobacco products that are used without burning.

Stacked bars showing the relative abundance of bacterial phyla identified in each of the ST products.The genus-level bacteriome of each of the ST samples is presented in Figure .

Using the alternative classification pipeline Wang's method a significant proportion of the reads in some samples were unclassified at the genus level however for reads that returned genus-level taxonomies the results were comparable to that obtained by the BLASTN pipeline See Supplementary Figure S3.Figure 6.

The samples were then randomly subsampled to obtain equal number of reads across samples based on the sample with lowest read count rarefaction.

The number of phyla per sample ranged from one to three for the Yemeni samples three to five for the American and Sudanese samples and eight to 10 for the Swedish samples Supplementary Table S1.
