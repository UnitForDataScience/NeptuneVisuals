the gut faecal samples showed significantly more diversity and richness of the microbiota than the mucosal samples table 1 and samples of lm and mam were significantly different figure 1a and b.study populationwe investigated 64 samples from 32 subjects with fgids 14 with diarrhoeapredominant ibs 14 with functional dyspepsia fd and 4 with other diseases.

differences in the stool and mucosal microbiota were examined and a correlation network analysis was performed.resultsthe microbiota of faecal samples was significantly more diverse and richer than that of the mucosal samples and the lm and mam populations differed significantly.

however recent studies have shown that the microbial compositions of the luminal microbiota lm and the mucosa associated microbiota mam differ suggesting that these two distinct microbial populations play different roles within the intestinal microbiota ecosystem2.

faecal samples representing the luminal niche are examined in most studies of the intestinal microbiota because their collection is simple.

bacteroidetes 44.7 and firmicutes 42.2 were the most represented phyla in lm samples followed by proteobacteria 8.5 whereas proteobacteria 56.6 was the most represented phylum in mam samples followed by firmicutes 20.2 and bacteroidetes 12.7 p  0.05 figure 2.dong ln et al .

therefore mam samples may reflect a stronger relationship with the host.deep sequencing showed that more than 95 of the sequences in all stool and mucosal samples belonged to the three most popular bacterial phyla consisting of firmicutes bacteroidetes and prote obacteria.
