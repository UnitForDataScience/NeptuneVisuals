TLR Toll-like receptor.Examination at the genus level showed that the relative abundance of Escherichia-Shigella Streptococcus Clostridium sensu stricto1 Sphingomonas Acinetobacter Brevundimonas and Enhydrobacter was significantly greater in samples of MAM than in LM samples whe reas abundance of Bacteroides Faecalibacterium Incertae sedis Subdoligranulum Pseudobutyrivibrio Megasphaera Parasutterella Akkermansia Alistipes and Lachnospira was significantly lower in samples of MAM than in LM samples P  0.05.expression characteristics of mucosal TLR2 and TLR4 We measured the mRNA expression of TLR2 3.7394 - 0.43514 and TLR4 5.3866 - 0.33556 in all samples and expression of TLR2 was significantly and positively correlated with that of TLR4 r  0.492 P  0.004 Figure 3.Correlation between gut microbiota and TLR4expressionRegardless of phylum class or order level no bacterium was correlated with expression of TLR4 in LM samples.At the phylum level Firmicutes was inversely and significantly correlated with TLR4 expression in MAM samples r  0.4676 P  0.0070.

The gut faecal samples showed significantly more diversity and richness of the microbiota than the mucosal samples Table 1 and samples of LM and MAM were significantly different Figure 1A and B.Study populationWe investigated 64 samples from 32 subjects with FGIDs 14 with diarrhoeapredominant IBS 14 with functional dyspepsia FD and 4 with other diseases.

Differences in the stool and mucosal microbiota were examined and a correlation network analysis was performed.RESULTSThe microbiota of faecal samples was significantly more diverse and richer than that of the mucosal samples and the LM and MAM populations differed significantly.

Furthermore MAM samples were taken from a distinct location in the colon whereas LM samples displayed the whole intestinal microbiota.

However recent studies have shown that the microbial compositions of the luminal microbiota LM and the mucosa associated microbiota MAM differ suggesting that these two distinct microbial populations play different roles within the intestinal microbiota ecosystem2.

Bacteroidetes 44.7 and Firmicutes 42.2 were the most represented phyla in LM samples followed by Proteobacteria 8.5 whereas Proteobacteria 56.6 was the most represented phylum in MAM samples followed by Firmicutes 20.2 and Bacteroidetes 12.7 P  0.05 Figure 2.Dong LN et al .

Therefore MAM samples may reflect a stronger relationship with the host.Deep sequencing showed that more than 95 of the sequences in all stool and mucosal samples belonged to the three most popular bacterial phyla consisting of Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Prote obacteria.

The faecal samples displayed significantly greater bacterial diversity and richness than the mucosal samples as in the studyA correlation analysis was performed between the two bacterial populations at the phylum class order family and genus levels and the expression of TLR2 and TLR4.

In the present study Faecallibacterium from LM samples was negatively correlated with the expression of TLR2 and Faecallibacterium from MAM samples was negatively correlated with the expression of TLR4.
