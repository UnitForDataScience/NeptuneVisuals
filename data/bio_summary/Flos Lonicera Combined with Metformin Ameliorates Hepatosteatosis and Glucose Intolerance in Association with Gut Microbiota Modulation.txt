The flavonoid content of FL analyzed by aluminum chloride reaction method was 109.3 u gmg.Combination of FL and MET Treatment Reduced the Liver Weight Improved Hepatic Histology and Suppressed Hepatic Lipid Deposition in OLETF RatsAlthough the body weight of OLETF rats did not change significantly in response to the treatment with FL and MET combination FLMET Figure 1A both the absolute and relative weights of liver of the animals in FLMET group butnot in MET group were significantly lower compared to OLETF rats Figures 1BC.As expected HE histological staining revealed the normal structural integrity of liver in LETO group and hepatic steatosis arrows in OLETF group Figure 1D.

The immunoblots were washedthree times in TBS buffer and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h. The immunoblots were washed twice.

The rats in LETO groups seven animals were also treated with water.

The serum HDL-C level increased in OLETF rats when exposed to FLMET or MET Figure 2B but not significantly.

The liver TG content was significantly decreased in OLETF rats when treated with either FLMET or MET Figure 2F.Combination of FL and MET Influenced the Hepatic Protein ExpressionTo investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the preventive action of MET and FLMET against fat deposition we measured the phosphorylation or expression levels of hepatic AMPK SREBP-1c ACC and HMGCoA reductase the key proteins involved in lipid metabolism and homeostasis Figure 2G.

The results revealed a time-dependent decrement in fasting serum glucose level up to 1 h post-insulin treatment which in the OLETF rats was most pronounced in FLMET group followed by MET group Figure 3A.

The area under curve AUC of IPITT glucose in OLETF rats decreased significantly in response to treatment with both MET and FLMET while AUC of FLMET group was significantly lower than the MET group Figure 3B.

The AUC of OGTT glucose in OLETF rats insignificantly but markedly decreased in response to both MET and FLMET Figure 3D.

Taxonomic comparison of the gut microbiota is demonstrated as follows LETO vs. OLETF A FLMET vs. OLETF B and MET vs. OLETF C. Circular cladograms depicting the LEfSe results are as follows LETO vs. OLETF D FLMET vs. OLETF E and MET vs. OLETF F. The alpha value for the factorial Kruskal-Wallis test is 0.05 and the threshold on the logarithmic LDA score for discriminative feature is 2.0.were significantly lower in both the MET and METFL groups compared to OLETF rats.

Taxonomic comparison of the gut micobiota as follows LETO vs. OLETF A FLMET vs. OLETF B and MET vs. OLETF C. The alpha value for the factorial Kruskal-Wallis test is 0.05 and the threshold on the logarithmic LDA score for discriminative feature is 2.0.Figure S5  Prediction of relative abundance of major metabolism functions in the rats of different experimental groups as indicated using PiCRUSt bioinformatics software package.
