Similar to the role of GPR43 signaling in the gut to yield the gut homeostasis cytokine IL-18 GPR43 signaling in peripheral immune cells resulted in NLRP3 activation and cleaved IL-1b 116 and this contributed to gouty arthritis.Metabolite Sensors and Treg Cell BiologyTo date three main receptors--GPR43 GPR109A and GPR35--have been shown to influence the number or function of peripherally derived Tregs also known as induced Tregs.

Studies using double- or triple-receptor knockout mice should answer some of these questions around redundancy.We argue that the beneficial effects of administering metabolites such as SCFAs or niacin topatients with inflammatory diseases relate to the normal and continuous role of these metabolites in maintaining gut homeostasis.

As most of these metabolites and their GPCRs produce biological responses in cells upon agonist stimulation it is hard to believe that common metabolites such as SCFAs and LCFAs will not also affect Treg cell biology in some way particularly in the gut where these metabolites are at their highest concentrations.

For example indole-3-aldehyde binds to aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR allowing its interaction with AHR nuclear translocator ARNT to promote gene transcriptionincluding the gut homeostasis cytokine IL-22.on nonimmune cells such as in the gut epithelium through promotion of gut homeostasis and pre- vention of exposure to bacteria or their products.

However these receptors are also expressed by cells of the adaptive immune system including T and B cells 11 15 20 GPR43 GPR84 and GPR35 as well as regulatory T cells Tregs 21 GPR43 and others see below.

However in contrast to normal NOD mice we noted that HAMSA diet only partially delayed diabetes progression in NOD.Gpr43-- mice and these mice had less infiltrated islets compared to normal chow-fed NOD.Gpr43-- mice.

Additionally functional metagenomics revealed that the bacteria- synthesized metabolite N-acyl-3-hydroxypalmitoyl-glycine commendamide is a potent agonist of GPR132 in humans 89.Many GPCRs appear to bind fatty acids such as the well-characterized family of eicosanoid receptors including leukotriene GPCRs leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotriene receptors that bind products of arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid metabolism derived from diet.

Determining the precise role of MCFAs versus GPR84 in food allergy should be a topic for future studies.The role of other metabolite-sensing receptors in food allergy models has not been reported but given the relevance of dietary metabolites to the mucosal immune system they are likelyinvolved in food allergy.

For instance on epithelial cells activation of GPR43 can promote inflammasome activation IL-18 secretion and enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity and wound healing 29.Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of inflammasome activation and produc- tion of IL-18 for gut epithelial integrity and gut homeostasis.
