In this context AhR activation by uremic toxins may be linked to these com- plications in CKD 8 9.Taking into account the new evidence about AhR and the importance of understanding the impact of AhR acti- vation in CKD patients this review aims to discuss how uremic toxins can play a role in the modulation of inflam- mation and oxidative stress via AhR activation.Aryl Hydrocarbon ReceptorAhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in the biological detoxification of ligands.

In fact exposure to uremic toxins has emerged to explain cardiovascular events overall mortality and renal failure progression 6 32.Among uremic toxins those derived from tryptophan metabolism are particularly of importance because they are associated with cardiovascular toxicity and more- over have been shown to be potent AhR ligands 33.

However studies using cell culture and animal models provide evidence that indolic uremic toxins especially IS induce AhR activation.AhR Activation Trough Tryptophan Metabolism-Derived Uremic ToxinsUremic toxins derived from tryptophan metabolism such as IS and IAA are able to activate the AhR-complex pathway through direct binding which in turn induces the nuclear translocation of AhR complex-ligand uremic toxins.
