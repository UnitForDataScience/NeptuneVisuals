In this context AhR activation by uremic toxins may be linked to these com- plications in CKD 8 9.Taking into account the new evidence about AhR and the importance of understanding the impact of AhR acti- vation in CKD patients this review aims to discuss how uremic toxins can play a role in the modulation of inflam- mation and oxidative stress via AhR activation.Aryl Hydrocarbon ReceptorAhR is a ligand-activated transcription factor involved in the biological detoxification of ligands.

In fact exposure to uremic toxins has emerged to explain cardiovascular events overall mortality and renal failure progression 6 32.Among uremic toxins those derived from tryptophan metabolism are particularly of importance because they are associated with cardiovascular toxicity and more- over have been shown to be potent AhR ligands 33.

However studies using cell culture and animal models provide evidence that indolic uremic toxins especially IS induce AhR activation.AhR Activation Trough Tryptophan Metabolism-Derived Uremic ToxinsUremic toxins derived from tryptophan metabolism such as IS and IAA are able to activate the AhR-complex pathway through direct binding which in turn induces the nuclear translocation of AhR complex-ligand uremic toxins.

This review discusses current data that sup- port a link between AhR activation and uremic toxins from gut microbiota in CKD.c 2017 S. Karger AG BaselIntroductionThe aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR was discovered as a mediator of the toxic responses of halogenated aro- matic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons such as 2378-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD which has carcinogenic and teratogenic effects 1.

In this context tryptophan metabolism-derived uremic tox- ins such as indoxyl sulfate IS indole-3-acetic acid IAA and indoxyl-b-D glucuronide IDG are recog- nized as endogenous AhR ligands 3 4 and thus can trig- ger AhR activation.Uremic toxins cannot be excreted in urine in chronic kidney disease CKD patients or efficiently eliminated by common dialysis modalities thus they accumulateE-Mail c 2017 S.

As a result tryptophan metabolism-derived uremic toxins are able to activate AhR and therefore chronical- ly stimulate oxidative stress and inflammation 4.

Thus uremic toxins have been suggested as a potential missing link between CKD and CVD once higher cardiovascular risk in these patients cannot be suf- ficiently explained by classic factors.

This ob- servation has considerable physiological relevance due to the presence of high concentrations of these toxins in CKD patients and the association of AhR with vascular disease 2 3.Figure 1 illustrates the mechanism of AhR activation by uremic toxins.Uremic Toxins Derived from Tryptophan MetabolismUnder normal conditions the human gut microbiota performs several activities essential to the body 20-22.

Putative mechanism of aryl hydrocar- bon receptor AhR activation by uremic toxins derived from tryptophan metabolism.

Like others AhR agonists the uremic toxins from tryptophan metabolism enters in the cell through an or- ganic anion transporter OAT and binds to AhR complex which is activated and then translocated into the nucleus.
