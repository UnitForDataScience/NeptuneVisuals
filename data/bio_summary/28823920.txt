Endophytic bacteria previously isolated from reed plants have shown the ability to promote growth of their host and to contribute to CBZ metabolism.In this work a horseradish Armoracia rusticana hairy root HR culture has been used as a plant model to study the interactions between roots and endophytic bacteria in response to CBZ exposure.

When autoclaved HRs were inoculated with endophytic bacteria this metabolite was also detected suggesting that enzymes for GSH conjugation and successive degradation of CBZ are also present in bacteria Fig.

Higher removal rates were observed when HRs were inoculated with the endophytic bacteria Rhizobium radiobacter 21 and Diaphorobacter nitroreducens 10.

Hence it points to plausible applications for the elimination of recalcitrant compounds such as CBZ from wastewater in CWs.c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.IntroductionInteractions between rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria and plants were first studied by Lorenz Hiltner.

Plant-associated bacteria can directly mediate the degradation of organic pollutants by activating specific catabolic genes In addition they can aid plants to cope with stress resulting from exposure to xenobiotics even though they might be devoid of enzymes involved in appropriate catabolic routes.

In recent years hairy root HR cultures have been used as 0304-3894c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.a model for the potential of different plant species to remove envi- ronmental pollutants Only now we start to use them as tools to study bacteria-plants interactions in response to xenobiotic stress Endophytic bacteria harboring both of these qualities catabolic genes and plant growth promoting traits can establish successful and durable mutualistic relationships with their hosts certainly because they do not have to compete with the dense popula- tions of microorganisms present in different soil compartments Endophytes capable of degrading xenobiotics have been isolated in recent years.

However in tomato and cucum- ber metabolism has been scrutinized with 1011-CBZ-epoxide and 1011-dihydro-1011-dihydroxy-CBZ as major metabolites Endophytic bacteria previously isolated from Phragmites aus- tralis exposed to CBZ were used for this study.

These bacteria have been shown to support plants during xenobiotic stress conditions by promoting their growth andor by directly degrading the par- ent compound Additionally we have established a hairy root HR culture from A. rusticana plants that allows us to investigate the metabolism of different organic xenobiotics in plant roots in a rapid manner This work aims to apply this horseradish HR culture as a model to study uptake and metabolism of CBZ in plant roots as well as interactions between roots and endophytic rhi- zobacteria in response to CBZ exposure.

Changes in CBZ uptake and its metabolic pathways when plant roots were assisted by endophytic bacteria are observed and discussed.Materials and methodsPlant material and culture conditionsHR cultures of horseradish Armoracia rusticana had been obtained previously by transformation of nodal segments by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A4 HRs were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks filled with 100 mL of full-strength Murashige and Skoog medium Duchefa Biochemie bv.
