Five days after faecal microbiota transplantof pooled human studies failed to identify these changes in bacterial phyla with only minor reductions in microbial diversity and richness seen.3637 Nevertheless obese and lean metabolic phenotypes in mice can be transmitted via FMT Figure 2B3839 a process more dependent on microbiota than genetics Figure 2C as FMT from identical twins discordant for obesity still led to transmission of the lean or obese phenotype in mice.40 Co-housing the two groups where mice ate each other's faeces led to alean phenotype hypothesised to be due to re-invasion of specific Bacteroidetes into obese mice.40 In a recent study in patients with metabolic syndrome FMT from a lean donor improved insulin sensitivity in just six weeks an effect in part driven by increased butyrate-producing gut bacteria.41Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseIn addition to the microbiota changes of obesity alterations in gut bacteria in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis NASH are associated withintestinal bacterial translocation leading to increased delivery of lipopolysaccharides free fatty acids and other toxins directly to the liver from the portal vein.42 Furthermore patients with NASH have a greater abundance of the Escherichia family of bacteria a group that ferments carbohydrates and produces endogenous ethanol.43 This leads to increased alcohol levels peripherally a possibleco-factor in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease.

Dysbiosis meaning a maladaptive imbalance of the microbiome is associated with many common diseases and is a target for therapy.ObjectivesThis article provides an overview of the gut microbiome in health and disease highlighting conditions such as Clostridium difficile infection inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with which dysbiosis is associated.

In addition to direct actions on the gut mucosa and enteric nervous system manychemical mediators produced by the gut microbiome enter the blood stream and communicate with distal organs such as the brain heartAs our knowledge of the microbiome increases we are likely to better understand the complex interactions that cause disease and develop new and more effective treatments for many common conditions.and liver.4Microbiome in healthAlthough there is no standard definition of a healthy gut microbiome important characteristics are a microbiome with high levels of diversity stability resistance to stress-related change antibiotics infections immunosuppression and a high level of redundancy of metabolic pathways.5The developing gut microbiomeHistorically the gut in utero was perceived as a sterile environment however emerging evidence suggests microbial contact begins prior to birth from maternal microbiota.6 More extensive colonisation begins at birth and during delivery from protective vaginal microbes such as Lactobacillus.

Our knowledge of the human gut microbiome in both health and disease has expanded rapidly in the past 10 years driven by increased availability and reduced cost of gene sequencing.3 This has provided compelling evidence of the gut microbiome's vital role in normal metabolism nutrition immune function physiology and prevention of disease.

Information about treatments that affect the gut microbiome including probiotics and faecal microbiota transplant are discussed.Discussionrillions of bacteria viruses fungi archaea and eukaryotic organisms live within the human gastrointestinal tract and make up what is collectively called the gut microbiome.

Babies delivered via caesarian section and those not exclusively breastfed however may be colonised byskin and hospital-acquired bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Acinetobacter leading to a microbiome that is initially less diverse and less healthy.67 These infants seem more susceptible to developing asthma allergic rhinitis diabetes and coeliac disease.8 The developing gut microbiome in the first year is similar to that of the mother but is soon influenced by a variety of factors includingdiet feeding habits and surrounding environment.9 The mature gut microbiome is established between the ages of one and three years and thereafter is relatively stable.

Early exposure to a variety of bacteria provides a kind of training for the immune system such thatnormal protective responses occur to commensals and appropriate inflammatory responses occur with exposure to pathogens.Conversely reduced microbial diversity and exposure early in life can lead to an immune system that over-reacts to antigens predisposing to autoimmune and allergic disease.14Microbiome and diseaseMany gastrointestinal diseases have been associated with alterations in the gut microbiome as have metabolic disorders liver disease certain neurological and mood disorders arthritis and immunological conditions.15 Dysbiosis meaning an imbalance ormaladaptive state of the microbiome is found in almost all of these conditions although whether this is cause or effect in most cases has not been established.

Often known asprebiotics examples of these foods include cereal grains asparagus leeks artichokes legumes cabbage and kale.12 Gut microbiotacan also communicate with the central nervous system through multiple pathways including the vagus nerve hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis the production of neurotransmitters or their precursors including serotonin tryptophan gamma-aminobutyric acid dopamine l-dopa and noradrenaline and via hormones such as cortisol ghrelin leptin and glucagon-like peptide -1.13Protective immune functionsNormal gut microbiota are our first internal line of defence against pathogens and toxins protecting the body against disease in tandem with the host immune system.
