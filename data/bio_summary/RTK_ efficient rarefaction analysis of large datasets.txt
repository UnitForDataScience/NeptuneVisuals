vegan  QIIME  mothur  these often work poorly for very large datasets because of memory requirements processing limitations and program design see Supplementary Material which requires custom parsing scripts and the use of special hardware to do rarefactions.

Here we present the rarefaction toolkit RTK which can perform fast rare- faction on very large datasets comprising millions of features even on a laptop computer computes estimates of ecological diversity and pro- vides appropriate visualizations of the results.ImplementationRTK is implemented in C thth11 with an optional R interface having two principal run modes 'memory' and 'swap' the latter using tempo- rary files to reduce memory footprint.
