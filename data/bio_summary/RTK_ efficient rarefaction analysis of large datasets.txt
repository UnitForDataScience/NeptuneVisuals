here we present the rarefaction toolkit rtk which can perform fast rare- faction on very large datasets comprising millions of features even on a laptop computer computes estimates of ecological diversity and pro- vides appropriate visualizations of the results.implementationrtk is implemented in c thth11 with an optional r interface having two principal run modes 'memory' and 'swap' the latter using tempo- rary files to reduce memory footprint.

time and memory consumption of our implementation is consistently below that observed using mothur vegan or qiime for the same purpose.

we also reanalyzed two metagenomic datasets termed guinea pig gut  and tara from tara oceans   using publicly available gene count matrices see supplementary table s1 for statistics.

our software is designed for ease of use operating at least 7x faster than existing solutions despite requiring 10x less memory.
