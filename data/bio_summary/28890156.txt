We found even greater cell death in the absence of a microbiota GF pups had higher cell death density in the CA1 oriens than CC mice F1 39  23.79 p  0.0001 with no significant effect of age F1 39  0.08 p  0.78 and no microbiota status-by-age interaction F1 39  3.43 p  0.07 A-C.In the ARC a brain region that receives metabolic information from the gut and plays an important role in the control of food intake   we found an effect of microbiota status F1 41  9.00 p  0.005 but unlike the PVN and CA1 oriens AC3 cell density was reduced in GF mice D-F. We also identified a significant effect of age F1 41  11.81 p  0.002 with more cell death at P3 than at P0 with no microbiota status-by-age interaction.We also analyzed the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypotha- lamus SCN and found no effect on cell death in this region not shown.

The interaction was due to a modest 12 but significant p  0.04 increase in the number of transitioning microglia in GF mice with no effect on other mor- phologies C.The maternal microbiota does not alter fetal brain cytokine expression cell death or microglial colonizationOur findings that brain cytokine levels cell death and micro- glial labeling were affected by microbiota status on the day of birth raised the question of whether these effects might be due to the maternal microbiota and already be present in utero.

While there was no effect of microbiotastatus on the expression of IL-10 F1 76  0.18 p  0.67 A expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines was markedly sup- pressed in the neonatal GF brain IL-1b was reduced by 87 F176  11.38 p  0.002 B and TNF-a by 90 compared to CCmice F1 76  11.06 p  0.002 C. There was also an 83 reduction in mean IL-6 expression in GF mice but this did not reach significance F1 76  3.68 p  0.06 D. There was no effect of age or microbiota status-by-age interaction for any of the cytokines analyzed.The absence of a microbiota does not grossly interfere with developmental neuronal cell deathWe next examined whether the microbiota influences perinatal neuronal cell death which peaks in many forebrain regions around the time of birth .

The presence and direction of the effect differed by region which may explain why differences in cell death are not identified in analyses of gross brain regions.The absence of a microbiota increases microglial labeling in whole hypothalamus and in hypothalamic and hippocampal subregionsIn gross analyses of large brain regions we found no effect of microbiota status on Iba1 labeling in the septum or hippocampus but increased labeling in the hypothalamus of GF mice F1 39  10.99 p  0.002 .

Although technically challenging it would be interesting to determine whether neonatal vagotomy prevents the changes in cell death observed here in GF mice.The microbiota and patterns of microglial colonizationOne possible mechanism for how the microbiota might alter developmental cell death considered here was via effects on micro- glia.

There was a main effect of age on cell death density in the hypothalamus and hippocampus F1 45  8.95 p  0.005 F1 40  6.30 p  0.02 respectively with morecell death at P3 than at P0 but this was not significant in the sep- tum .The microbiota alters cell death in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in a subregion-specific mannerThe hypothalamus and hippocampus are heterogeneous struc- tures with subregions serving different functions containingFig.

Quantita- tive analyses of large brain areas confirmed this observation we found no main effect of microbiota status and no microbiota status-by-age interaction on cell death density in the septum hip- pocampus or hypothalamus .

This suggests that the microbiota may independently affect cell death and microglial labeling.Effects of the maternal microbiotaDifferences between GF and CC mice were already present on the day of birth which suggested that the microbiota may exert effects on brain development in utero.

However effects of the microbiota on adult brain physiology and behavior have been reported in a variety of species including Corresponding author at PO Box 5030 Atlanta GA 30302-5030 USA.E-mail address A. Castillo-Ruiz.humans  .One approach to address the question of the effects of the microbiota on perinatal brain development is to examine neonates born into germ-free GF conditions because any role of microbial exposure would be absent in these animals.

Differences in cytokine expression between brain regions have been described  so we cannot assume that all brain regions of CC and GF mice show differential cytokine expression at birth.The microbiota and patterns of cell deathNeonatal GF mice had higher levels of cell death than CC mice in the PVN and CA1 oriens lower levels in the ARC and no change in the SCN.
