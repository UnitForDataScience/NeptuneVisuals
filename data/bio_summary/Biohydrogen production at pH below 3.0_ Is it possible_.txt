As stated by  this mechanism also can play a relevant role in non- methanogenic mixed cultures through hydrogen transfer be- tween hydrogen producers and consumers limiting sustainable hydrogen production due to homoacetogenesis.

The non-necessity of adding alkalizing agents and the successful H2 production under very acid conditions demonstrated in this study open a new field of investigation in biological hydrogen production by dark fermentation towards a more sustainable and feasible technology.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The 95 confidence level was adopted for all tests.Theoretical calculations of the percentage of acidified sucrose and of hydrogen yield by the different metabolic routesThe simplified stoichiometric equations Equations e were used to calculate the molar ratio between sucrose consumed and acids produced sucroseacid and between hydrogen gas and acids produced H2acid.

Evolutionary distances were based on the Kimura model  and tree reconstruction on the Neighbor-Joining method with bootstrap values calculated from 500 replicate runs.Results and discussionVolumetric hydrogen production rate and biogas composition shows the volumetric hydrogen production rate VHPR and effluent pH of the FB UG and UF-1 reactors.

Although the ethanol-acetate pathway yields less hydrogen than the acetate-pathway Equation  the hydrogen yield could be 4.0 mol of H2 per mol of sucrose consumed which is in the range achieved in the UF-2 reactor considering sucrose as substrate.

Since the maximum achieved hydrogen yield with the pure culture of E. harbinense  was higher than the theoretical yield depicted in Equation Section  it is probable that this bacterium is able to produce hydrogen and ethanol by pathways other than ethanol-acetate fermentation.

Proposed model to explain changes in the UF-2 reactor that led to increased H2 production.Table 5Comparison of hydrogen production in continuous acidogenic reactors using sucrose as substrate.Reactor typeOLR - gCOD L-1d-1 Effluent pH Temp - 0C H2 in biogas -  VHPR- mL H2 L-1h-1 HY - mol H2 mol-1 sucrose Ref.a The reference conditions adopted were 25 0C and 1 atm.drastic reduction or cessation of hydrogen production by dark fermentation at pH values below 4.5e4.0  .

The FB UG and UF-1 reactors presented volumetric hydrogen production rates VHPR of 95 - 69 45 - 37 and 54 - 32 mLH2 L-1h-1 respectively and H2 yields HY of 1.5 - 0.80.8 - 0.6 and 1.2 - 0.7 molH2 mol-1 sucroseconsumed respectively.

The foregoing notwithstanding usual H2 yields are lower due to the utilization of the substrate in a variety of pathways that produce less or no H2 and for biomass growth also due to microbial H2 consumption.Environmental pH plays a crucial role in hydrogen yields.
