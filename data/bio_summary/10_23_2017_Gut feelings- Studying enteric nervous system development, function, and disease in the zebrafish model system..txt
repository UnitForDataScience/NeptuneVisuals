Developing new imaging analysis approaches in combination with optogenetic tools or calcium imaging approaches will be important technical advances to better understand ENS function as well as what goes awry with regard to gut motility and other ENS functions in Zebrafish models of ENS diseases.Regulation of Zebrafish ENS DevelopmentRecent studies have identified different genes and signaling path- ways that play a role in ENS development Fig.

From the work in mammals it is to be expected that also in the Zebrafish ENS there will be different types of enteric glia with diverse functions however as enteric neurons are only present in one layer in Zebrafish they may not show an equally complex spatial distri- bution as in the mammalian ENS.The Zebrafish model is uniquely suited for in vivo analysis of gut motility parametersThe ENS controls different functions of the gut importantly-- together with the mesodermally derived interstitial cells of Cajal--the regulation of gut motility Furness 2006.

In this review we will discuss key points of Zebrafish ENS development genes and signaling pathways regulating ENS development as well as contributions of the Zebrafish model system to better understand ENS disorders.

Specifically it will cover the different steps of ENS development in Zebrafish genes and signaling pathways that regulate ENS development and how the Zebrafish model has aided work and understanding of the molecular basis of ENS diseases.

Zebra- fish larvae overexpressing pbcab show complete loss of enteric neurons similar to intestinal aganglionosis in HSCR patients suggesting that there potentially are other Meis proteins or other factors that Pbx4 might interact with during ENS development Uribe and Bronner 2015.The GdnfRet signaling pathway Sox10 and Phox2bb are highly conserved signaling factors in ENS developmentThe glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor GDNFRET proto- oncogene RET signaling pathway and the transcription factors sex-determining-region Y-box 10 SOX10 and paired-like homeobox 2b PHOX2B play an important role during ENS development in vertebrates Shepherd and Eisen 2011 Lake and Heuckeroth 2013.

2017.Future DirectionsEven though the regulation of early steps of ENS development are relatively well understood later steps of ENS development remain poorly characterized in particular how the differentiation of enteric neurons and glia cells from enteric stem cell popula- tions is regulated.

Learning the types of EPCs pre- sent in the ENS will also help to develop therapeutic strategies to repair enteric neuropathies with degenerative or developmental selective loss of particular types of enteric neurons.ENS development is also regulated by signals from surrounding tissueOther tissues such as the developing gut and surrounding mesen- chyme also play a role in ENS development.

It will be interesting to determine the location and distribution of enteric stem or pro- genitor cells that remain in the ENS potentially even until adult- hood to support the ongoing growth of the ENS in Zebrafish.

Zebrafish has thus been used to test the effect of drug compounds on ENS development to find com- pounds that could contribute to HSCR penetrance in predisposed children.A recent large-scale drug screen found different components that affect ENS development and led to fewer enteric neurons especially in the distal gut Lake et al.
