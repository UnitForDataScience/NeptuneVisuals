While we did not study the finished vermicompost during the ageing process after removal from the tanks the microbial communityTable 1 Nutrient and chemical properties of the substrate mixture during different stages of vermicomposting of coconut leaves byEudrilus sp.Parameter15th day45th day75th day105th dayValues presented are mean - standard deviation from triplicate samplesTable 2 Diversity indices for the vermicompost and earthworm gut bacterial communities after normalizing for sample sizekf Indices were calculated at D  0.03 using a random subsample of 250 sequences per replicate and then averaged for all replicates of a sample except for the Ikf estimate as explained below.

These findings further support the use of vermicompost for improving plant productivity.Linking the bacterial communities of substrate and earthworm gutOne of the main objectives of this study was to examine the role of the earthworm microbial commu- nity on vermicomposting and whether the earthworm community could serve as the inoculum for the major decomposers of the vermicompost microbial commu- nity.

In comparison with the vermicompost bacterial community the earthworm gut bacterial community EB75 showed consistently lowerdiversity Tables  S2 Fig.

The presence of only few shared OTUs sug- gested that the increase in Firmicutes was due to community succession in the vermicomposting pro- cess and not direct inoculation by the earthworms.The total bacterial community composition was very different for the coconut leaf vermicompost than other substrates.

The coconut leaf vermicompost also contains high levels of plant-beneficial microorganisms and its application not only improves the soil microbial biomass and fertility but also significantly increases the coconut yield Gopal et al.

Similarly com- bined application of coconut leaf vermicompost and biofertilizer also increased the chlorophyll index in the leaves of coconut palms as compared to chemical fertilizer application Hebbar et al.

Both functional attributes would lower the levels of alkaloids in the mature vermicompost thereby suggesting an indirect mechanism for enhancement of plant growth by the vermicompost microbiome.

Alpha diversity measurements revealed an increase in bacterial diver- sity till the 75th day which then declined in the mature vermicompost.

this intrinsic error rate is very high and especially problematic for estimating the rare biosphere.Description of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene dataAlthough DNA was successfully extracted from all vermicompost samples 11 of the 12 earthworm samples yielded very little community DNA and could be PCR amplified only upon cleaning and concentrating the DNA using the MoBio DNA Clean-up kit.

The results indicated that the bacterial diversity did increase as the substrates were converted to vermicompost by the earthworms and then decreased in the finished product.
