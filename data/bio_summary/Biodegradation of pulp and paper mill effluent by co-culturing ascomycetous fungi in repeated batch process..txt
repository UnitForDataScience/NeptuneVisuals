statistical analysis displayed a positive correlation between fungal biomass color and lignin degradation and was significant at p  0.05. the control sets showed no changes in the effluent parameters.biodegradation efficiency of the fungal consortium in repeated batch cultureoptimized culture conditions cn ratio 1.50.5 tem- perature 30 degc ph 5.0 and agitation rate 140 rpm were applied to investigate the reduction in ph bod cod color and lignin using fungal consortium in a repeated batch culture table .

the use of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfite in the pulping process to dissolve lignin and hemicelluloses contributes to the excess ph and sulfate levels whereas the release of lignin and its derivatives after bleaching process elevates the cod level of the effluent singhal et al.

increased supply of readily metab- olizable carbon sources stimulates ligninolytic system in fungi and catalyzes the lignin degradation process hammerli et al.

a. low amount of nitrogen stimulates the production of ligninolytic enzymes and quickens lignin degrada- tion whereas reduced substrate degradation and re- strained fungal growth have been reported when excess nitrogen was added mantovani et al.

b. a positive correlation was observed between biomass and color r  0.91 and biomass and lignin degradation r  0.90. modi et al.

lignin was measured according to the method of pearl and benson  and absorbance 430 nm values were trans- formed into lignin residue ppm.

comparatively slow removal rates were observed in the first treatment cycle color 77.4 lignin 69.8 bod 79.3 and cod 74 and the third treatment cycle color 79.7 lignin 71.2 bod 81.1 and cod 77 respective- ly.

have been studied which demonstrate their potential to degrade lignin and colored compounds but less infor- mation is available about the potential of ascomycetous fungi for the detoxification and degradation of pulp and paper mill effluent.microbial growth and enzyme production in the cul- ture medium are affected by many environmental and nutritional factors i.e.

hence the optimum cn ratio is more promising for lignin degradation and color removal than the sole carbon and nitrogen sources.

samples were taken out from the flasks after 168 h of incubation and ana- lyzed for degradation of lignin and color.

many re- search studies have reported the effect of different car- bon sources on the color and lignin degradation of pulp and paper mill effluent da re and papinutti .

among nitrogen sources efficient degradation resulted from sodium nitrate with 1972.8 co-pt 72.33 re- duction in color units and 681.9 mgl 63.4 reduction in lignin along with biomass production of 4.07 gl fig.

maximum degradation was ob- served using the cn ratio 1.50.5. the color was re- duced 73.1 1951.1 co-pt and lignin up to 65.23 648.4 mgl whereas fungal biomass increased up to5.54 gl after 168 h of incubation period fig.
