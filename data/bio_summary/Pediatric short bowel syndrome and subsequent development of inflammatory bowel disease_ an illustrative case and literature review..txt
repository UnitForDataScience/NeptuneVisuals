Short of a coordinated transition clinic the authors suggest that it is important for pediatric specialists managing SBS patients to have close relationships with an adult SBS program.

At this point the authors would only recommend immune modulating agents in SBS patients after an exten- sive workup showing pathologic and serologic markers of IBD.Considering the complex and evolving field of SBStreatment it is not surprising that studies have shown improved outcomes for patients managed by a multidisci- plinary team .

We conclude that there may be an etiologic con- nection between SBS and IBD and that this knowledge may impact outcomes and approaches to care.Keywords Inflammatory bowel disease  Longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tailoring procedure Bianchi procedure  Malabsorption  Short bowel syndromeIntroductionShort bowel syndrome SBS is a rare but extremely mor- bid disorder in children most often resulting from a neo- natal insult such as necrotizing enterocolitis NEC com- plicated gastroschisis intestinal atresia or midgut volvulus.

SBS affects approximately 2 of patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit NICU and carries a high mor- tality rate up to 37 in the first 5 years of life  .

Such integrated strategies have advanced over the past several decades and now result in improved outcomes for these patients.With improved survival and longer life-expectancy of pediatric SBS patients long-term complications are increasingly recognized.

Diagnosisrequires a high index of suspicion and experience with the management of SBS patients.Recent small case series have reported the development of IBD in pediatric patients after major abdominal opera- tions as neonates.

Five of these patients were man- aged for SBS.

Both the anatomic and nutritional alterations of the intestine in SBS contribute to microbial perturbations which may lead to chronic inflam- mation or other immune responses that trigger IBD.In our case report we mention several approaches bothsurgical and medical to rehabilitation in patients withintestinal failure.
