4 MRE estimated liver stiffness of less than 3 Kpa therefore documenting absence of any fibrosis.Exclusion criteria for Normal Cohort Derived from Older Twins--Participants were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria 1 significant alcohol intake 10 gramsday in females or 20 gramsday in males for at least three consecutive months over the previous 12 months or if the quantify of alcohol consumption could not be reliably ascertained 2 clinical or biochemical evidence of liver diseases other than NAFLD including hepatitis B hepatitis C alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency hemochromatosis Wilson's disease autoimmune hepatitis polycystic liver diseases cholestatic liver diseases and vascular liver diseases 3 chronic illnesses associated with hepatic steatosis including human immunodeficiency virus infection type I diabetes mellitus celiac disease cystic fibrosis lipodystrophy dysbetalipoproteinemia and glycogen storage diseases 4 use of drugs known to cause hepatic steatosis including amiodarone glucocorticoids methotrexate L-asparaginase and valproic acid for at least three out of the previous six months 5 history of bariatric surgery including roux-en-Y gastric bypass and gastroplasty 6 presence of systemic infectious illnesses 7 females who were pregnant or nursing at the time of the study 8 contraindications to MRI including metal implants claustrophobia and body circumference greater than that of the imaging chamber 9 any other conditions which based on the principal investigator's opinion may significantly affect the participant's compliance competence or ability to complete the study.Method DetailsStudy design and recruitment--This is a prospective cohort study of consecutive biopsy-proven NAFLD patients who were participating in a biobanking initiative at the University of California at San Diego NAFLD Research Center between January 2012 to December 2013.

It is likely that the gut microbiome signatures of advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD who are residing in the United States would be very different than gut microbiome signature of patients with cirrhosis predominantly due to hepatitis B who are residing in China.Given the importance of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD and the association between specific microbial populations and NASH a strong rationale exists for the development of a panel of gut-microbiome derived biomarkers that can be used to predict the presence of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD.

Our aim was to develop a panel of gut-microbiome derived biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD.RESULTSBaseline characteristics of the study cohortThis prospective study included 86 patients female 56 with biopsy-proven NAFLD 72 patients had stage 0-2 fibrosis and were classified as mildmoderate NAFLD Group G1 and 14 patients had stage 3-4 fibrosis and were classified as advanced NAFLD Group G2.

Based on histology assessment NAFLD patients were classified into two groups Group 1 G1 n72 - mild moderate NAFLD patients with stage 0-2 fibrosis and Group 2 G2 n14 - advanced fibrosis NAFLD patients with stage 3-4 fibrosis.

We aimed to specifically address the role of gut dysbiosis in the progression of liver disease to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis before the onset of clinically significant portal hypertension.Qin and colleagues studied metagenomics profiling in Chinese patients with cirrhosis due to diverse etiologies but mainly included patients with viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease with a small subset of patients who had NAFLD cirrhosis.

This study provides preliminary evidence for a novel fecal-microbiome derived metagenomic signature to detect advanced fibrosis in NAFLD.Graphical abstractKeywordsNASH cirrhosis biomarker microbiome non-invasive fatty liver hepatic steatosis liver disease hepatitisINTRODUCTIONNonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States affecting approximately 80-100 million Americans.

Patients with advanced fibrosis were more likely to haveLoomba et al.Page 4more severe lobular and portal inflammation and ballooning than those without advanced fibrosis.Differences in the taxonomic composition of stool derived metagenomes between mild moderate NAFLD versus advanced fibrosisGut microbiome compositions of the patients were determined using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of DNA extracted from their stool samples.

The numbers of healthy and NAFLD cirrhosis patients were 33 and 16 respectively.Loomba et al.Page 9Sample size and subject allocation to experimental groups--This is a pilot proof of concept study including 86 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD 72 in mildmoderate group and 14 in advanced fibrosis group.

The 49 patients in Cohort B consist of 17 G1 and 14 G2 patients from the UCSD NAFLD Cohort 16 healthy patients from the normal cohort derived from older twins single twin from each pair and two biopsy-proven cirrhotic patients from a familial cirrhosis study.

This model had a robust and statistically significant diagnostic accuracy of AUC 0.936 Figures 1 and 2.From the 37 species selected by the optimized model eight species were more than two-fold more abundant in advanced fibrosis G2 compared to mildmoderate NAFLD G1 while 22 species were more than two-fold abundant in mildmoderate NAFLD G1 compared to advanced fibrosis G2 Table 4.
