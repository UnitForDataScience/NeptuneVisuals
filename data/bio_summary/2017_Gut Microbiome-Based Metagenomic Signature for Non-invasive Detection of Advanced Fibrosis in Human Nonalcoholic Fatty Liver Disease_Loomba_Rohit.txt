4 mre estimated liver stiffness of less than 3 kpa therefore documenting absence of any fibrosis.exclusion criteria for normal cohort derived from older twins--participants were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria 1 significant alcohol intake 10 gramsday in females or 20 gramsday in males for at least three consecutive months over the previous 12 months or if the quantify of alcohol consumption could not be reliably ascertained 2 clinical or biochemical evidence of liver diseases other than nafld including hepatitis b hepatitis c alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency hemochromatosis wilson's disease autoimmune hepatitis polycystic liver diseases cholestatic liver diseases and vascular liver diseases 3 chronic illnesses associated with hepatic steatosis including human immunodeficiency virus infection type i diabetes mellitus celiac disease cystic fibrosis lipodystrophy dysbetalipoproteinemia and glycogen storage diseases 4 use of drugs known to cause hepatic steatosis including amiodarone glucocorticoids methotrexate l-asparaginase and valproic acid for at least three out of the previous six months 5 history of bariatric surgery including roux-en-y gastric bypass and gastroplasty 6 presence of systemic infectious illnesses 7 females who were pregnant or nursing at the time of the study 8 contraindications to mri including metal implants claustrophobia and body circumference greater than that of the imaging chamber 9 any other conditions which based on the principal investigator's opinion may significantly affect the participant's compliance competence or ability to complete the study.method detailsstudy design and recruitment--this is a prospective cohort study of consecutive biopsy-proven nafld patients who were participating in a biobanking initiative at the university of california at san diego nafld research center between january 2012 to december 2013. patients in this biobank had a confirmed diagnosis of nafld based on clinical magnetic resonance and histologic assessments.

it is likely that the gut microbiome signatures of advanced fibrosis in patients with nafld who are residing in the united states would be very different than gut microbiome signature of patients with cirrhosis predominantly due to hepatitis b who are residing in china.given the importance of advanced fibrosis in nafld and the association between specific microbial populations and nash a strong rationale exists for the development of a panel of gut-microbiome derived biomarkers that can be used to predict the presence of advanced fibrosis in nafld.

our aim was to develop a panel of gut-microbiome derived biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of advanced fibrosis in nafld.resultsbaseline characteristics of the study cohortthis prospective study included 86 patients female 56 with biopsy-proven nafld 72 patients had stage 0-2 fibrosis and were classified as mildmoderate nafld group g1 and 14 patients had stage 3-4 fibrosis and were classified as advanced nafld group g2.

the baseline characteristics are detailed in table 1. based on histology assessment nafld patients were classified into two groups group 1 g1 n72 - mild moderate nafld patients with stage 0-2 fibrosis and group 2 g2 n14 - advanced fibrosis nafld patients with stage 3-4 fibrosis.

we aimed to specifically address the role of gut dysbiosis in the progression of liver disease to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis before the onset of clinically significant portal hypertension.qin and colleagues studied metagenomics profiling in chinese patients with cirrhosis due to diverse etiologies but mainly included patients with viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease with a small subset of patients who had nafld cirrhosis.

patients with advanced fibrosis were more likely to haveloomba et al.page 4more severe lobular and portal inflammation and ballooning than those without advanced fibrosis.differences in the taxonomic composition of stool derived metagenomes between mild moderate nafld versus advanced fibrosisgut microbiome compositions of the patients were determined using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of dna extracted from their stool samples.

this study provides preliminary evidence for a novel fecal-microbiome derived metagenomic signature to detect advanced fibrosis in nafld.graphical abstractkeywordsnash cirrhosis biomarker microbiome non-invasive fatty liver hepatic steatosis liver disease hepatitisintroductionnonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the united states affecting approximately 80-100 million americans.

the numbers of healthy and nafld cirrhosis patients were 33 and 16 respectively.loomba et al.page 9sample size and subject allocation to experimental groups--this is a pilot proof of concept study including 86 patients with biopsy-proven nafld 72 in mildmoderate group and 14 in advanced fibrosis group.

the 49 patients in cohort b consist of 17 g1 and 14 g2 patients from the ucsd nafld cohort 16 healthy patients from the normal cohort derived from older twins single twin from each pair and two biopsy-proven cirrhotic patients from a familial cirrhosis study.

the skew in age was not as extreme for patients in group 1 such that a wider range of ages was observed for patients with either stage 0 1 or 2. to address the observed skew in age for patients with advanced fibrosis we created a second cohort referred to as cohort b of patients that are all 60 years or older from multiple cohorts.

in this study we found that the gut microbiomes in nafld is dominated by members of firmicutes and bacteroidetes followed by proteobacteria and actinobacteria in much lower abundances table 3. however as the disease progresses from mildmoderate nafld to advanced fibrosis the proteobacteria phylum has a statistically significant increase in abundance while the firmicutes phylum decrease.at the species level e. rectale 2.5 median relative abundance and b. vulgatus 1.7 were the most abundant organisms in mildmoderate nafld while b. vulgatus 2.2 ande.

this model had a robust and statistically significant diagnostic accuracy of auc 0.936 figures 1 and 2.from the 37 species selected by the optimized model eight species were more than two-fold more abundant in advanced fibrosis g2 compared to mildmoderate nafld g1 while 22 species were more than two-fold abundant in mildmoderate nafld g1 compared to advanced fibrosis g2 table 4. the orthogonal machine learning method resulted in a model whose final feature set had a high degree of concordance with the features in the rf based model and with a similarly high auc figure s1.microbial metabolism and functionthe comparison between metabolites detected and metabolites predicted from the microbial pathways reconstructed from stool metagenome data yielded 89 metabolites table s1 figure s2 and included several known to be produced by both host and microbes.

a differential analysis identified 11 metabolites whose abundances peak intensities are significantly different between mildmoderate nafld g1 and advanced fibrosis g2 wilcoxon rank sum corrected for fdr and a  0.05. figure 3 in this set two metabolites associated with nucleoside metabolism were enriched in mildmoderate nafld g1 while nine metabolites associated with amino acids and carbon metabolism were enriched in advanced fibrosis g2.

this study included 86 uniquely well- characterized patients with biopsy-proven nafld 72 of which had mildmoderate stage 0-2 fibrosis nafld and 14 had advanced fibrosis stage 3 or 4 fibrosis.

further studies are needed to validate the clinical utility of the proposed microbiome-derived signature to detect advanced fibrosis as well as candidacy for anti-fibrotic treatment trials in nafld.star methodscontact for reagent and resource sharingfurther information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact rohit loomba roloombaucsd.edu.experimental model and subject details human subjectucsd nafld cohort training set 86 patients with biopsy-proven nafld were included.
