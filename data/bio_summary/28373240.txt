However due to the complexity and relative inaccessibility of the gut environment and the challenges in constructing realistic in vitro gut models these processes remain poorly understood.Genetically engineered sensor bacteria have untapped potential as tools for analyzing gut pathways.

Finally we analyzed sfGFP expression by flow cytometry using mCherry expression to identify our sensor bacteria among the native microbiota and other particles Appendix Fig S20.Each ligand activates its corresponding sensor and these responses are attenuated when the TCSs are inactivated by muta- tion Appendix Figs S21 and S22.

Thus we hypothe- sized that a bioinformatic search for a TCS containing a sensor kinase SK with a PhnD-like sensor domain located near a thiosulfate reduc- tase might reveal an uncharacterized thiosulfate sensor.We searched the UniProtKB sequence database for all SKs with PhnD-like sensor domains resulting in 838 proteins Materials and Methods and Dataset EV1.

These results suggest that either our engineered S. baltica TtrSR construct does not function in vivo or tetrathionate concentration in the lumen of DSS-treated mice where our sensor bacteria likely reside in this 6-h protocol is below the1 lM limit of detection Fig 4F.DiscussionWe have discovered and validated the first genetically encoded thio- sulfate sensor ThsSR and a tetrathionate sensor S. baltica TtrSR with improved performance features relative to the only previously known variant.

We then re-measured ligand activation which revealed that this alteration does not change the performance of either sensor Appendix Figs S15 and S16.Then we analyzed the performance of each Nissle sensor strain in anaerobic conditions in vitro Materials and Methods.

We observe a weak correla- tion between fluorescence output and histopathology score for the wild-type sensor but not the inactive D57A sensor Appendix Fig S27.

Our tetrathionate sensor has low in vivo activity even at high inflammation levels suggesting this molecule may not be produced in the DSS model or that it is rapidly degraded by the gut microbiota.36targets for studying the link between gut sulfur metabolism and inflammation.

Therefore we set out to adapt our sensors to the gut environment.First to eliminate the use of chemical inducers we synthesized two paired plasmid libraries wherein the SK and RR for each sensor are expressed to different levels from constitutive promoters and ribosome binding sites RBSs of varying strengths Appendix Figs S15 and S16.

Finally unlike ThsSR S. baltica TtrSR is not inhibited by any of the alternative TEAs Appendix Fig S14.Optimizing ThsSR and Shewanella baltica TtrSR for the gut environmentWe performed the above sensor development studies aerobically in monoculture in a domesticated laboratory strain and using chemi- cal inducers to optimize SK and RR expression levels.
