reuteri microencapsulated in yogurt reduce LDL-cholesterol serum total cholesterol andnon-HDL cholesterol L. plantarum capsules reduce serum total cholesterol ConclusionsIt is evident that gut microbiota isintegral to the homeostatic functions of the body often having a protective role against disease .

The foam cells deposit in arterial plaque further contributing to atherosclerosis .The body has internal homeostatic mechanisms such as reverse cholesterol transport RCT to counteract the accumulation of excess cholesterol in peripheral tissues.

In particular dysbiosis has been shown to affect the metabolism of bile acids BAs and the production of trimethylamine-n-oxide TMAO and butyrate .Bile AcidsBAs are synthesized from cholesterol and constitute a major pathway for cholesterol catabolism .

Additionally BSH prevents systemic cholesterol accumulation by promoting the de novo synthesis of BAs and increased cholesterol efflux by enterocytes and hepatocytes .

LXR expression normally promotes the upregulation of cholesterol transporters ABCG5G8 increasing cholesterol efflux from hepatocytes and enterocytes .

Microencapsulationadministration in yogurt formulation of L. reuteri decreased LDL-cholesterol LDL-C by 8.92 serum total cholesterol TC by 4.81 and non-HDL cholesterol by 6.01 .

Specifically bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides LPS found on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria can promote the formation of foam cells which are a major component of atherosclerotic plaque .Foam cells are macrophages phagocytic immune cells that have engulfed excessive amounts of modified low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol in an attempt to remove it from the bloodstream .

LDLs are responsible for the transport of cholesterol within the bloodstream .

The accumulation of modified cholesterol within the macrophages leads to foam cell formation .
