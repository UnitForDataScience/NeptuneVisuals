The 16S rRNA gene sequence- based phylogenetic tree indicated that strain BR31T formed a separate branch within the family  and S1 available in the online Supplementary Material.0.0280100798980837376100Ruminococcus faecis Eg2T FJ611794Ruminococcus lactaris ATCC 29176T ABOU02000049 Ruminococcus torques ATCC 27756T AAVP02000040 Clostridium glycyrrhizinilyticum ZM 35T AB233029Clostridium oroticum DSM 1287T FR749917 Eubacterium fissicatena DSM 3598T FR749935 Eubacterium contortum DSM 3982T FR749945Merdimonas faecis BR31T KP966093Coprococcus comes ATCC 27758T ABVR01000038Clostridium nexile DSM 1787T X73443Dorea longicatena DSM 13814T AAXB02000032Dorea formicigenerans ATCC 27755T AAXA02000006Clostridium scindens ATCC 35704T ABFY02000057Clostridium hylemonae TN-271T AB023972Hespellia porcina PC80T AF445239Hespellia stercorisuis PC18T AF445264Lachnobacterium bovis LRC 5382T AF298663Roseburia intestinalis L1-82T AJ312385 Blautia coccoides ATCC 29236T M59090 Clostridium aerotolerans DSM 5434T X76163 Clostridium citroniae RMA 16102T DQ279737991007397Clostridium clostridioforme ATCC 25537T M59089Lachnospira multipara DSM 3073T FR733699Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis DSM 9787T X95893Anaerostipes caccae DSM 14662T ABAX03000031Sporobacterium olearium DSM 12504T AF116854Parasporobacterium paucivorans SYR1T AJ272036Catonella morbi ATCC 51271T KI535366Johnsonella ignava ATCC 51276T ACZL01000055Eubacterium limosum ATCC 8486T M59120Fig.

S1.Based on these results DSM 3982T DSM 15053T KCTC 5591T and ATCC 29176T were demonstrated to be the closest relatives.Both DSM 3982T  and DSM 15053T  were obtained from DSMZ Deutsche Samm- lung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen and ATCC 29176T  was purchased from ATCC American Type Culture Collection.

Phenotypic characteristics that differentiate strain BR31T from members of related generaStrains 1 BR31T 2 DSM 3982T 3 DSM 15053T 4 KCTC 5591T 5 ATCC 29176T 6 ATCC 27756T 7 comes ATCC 27758T.

Strain BR31T showed a close rela- tionship with members of the family  such as DSM 3982T 94.6  16S rRNA gene sequence similarity KCTC 15010T 93.9  ZM35T 93.9  ATCC 29176T 93.8 ATCC 27756T 93.8  DSM 15053T 92.8  and KCTC 5591T 91.5 .

Carbohydrate utilization properties can differentiate strainBR31T from closely related type strains such as DSM 3982T DSM 15053T KCTC 5591T ATCC 29176T and ATCC 27756T.

Cellular fatty acid composition  of strain BR31T and related strains of cluster XIVaStrains 1 BR31T 2 DSM 3982T 3 DSM 15053T 4 KCTC 5591T 5 ATCC 27756T.

The major cellular fatty acids of strain BR31T were C14  0 25.0  C16  0 18.6  summed feature 4 14.6  and C13  0 11.6  which were absent in the pro- file of DSM 3982T which encompassed iso- C17  110c 29.0  iso-C15  19c 26.5  and C15  0 2-OH18.8  as major fatty acids.

The 16S rRNA gene sequence of ATCC 8486T was used as an outgroup.

The highest ANI value was73.0  which was obtained through comparison of strain BR31T and ATCC 35704T PRJNA18175 Table S1.

Although the same major fatty acids of strain BR31T were detected in DSM 15053T KCTC 5591T and ATCC 27756T strain BR31T had a higher C14  0 content.
