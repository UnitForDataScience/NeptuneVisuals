after washing in distilled water air-dried grids were examined under the transmission electron microscope.all experiments were performed under strictly anaerobicrelated type strain was dsm 3982t sharing94.6  similarity.

major cellular fatty acids of strain br31t were absent in the fatty acid profile of dsm 3982t.

in addition the fatty acid methyl ester profile of strain br31t was completely different from that of dsm 3982t.

the major cellular fatty acids of strain br31t were c14  0 25.0  c16  0 18.6  summed feature 4 14.6  and c13  0 11.6  which were absent in the pro- file of dsm 3982t which encompassed iso- c17  110c 29.0  iso-c15  19c 26.5  and c15  0 2-oh18.8  as major fatty acids.

the 16s rrna gene sequence of atcc 8486t was used as an outgroup.

the highest ani value was73.0  which was obtained through comparison of strain br31t and atcc 35704t prjna18175 table s1.
