The PCR mix was subsequently di- luted 10-fold and 1 ml used as template in the second amplification step using the same forward primer with a unique 10-12 bp barcodefor each bacterial community and reverse primer both with sequenc- ing adaptors Christensen et al.

The output fasta files were analyzed using the pickde novootus.py pipeline with the usearch OTU picking method at 97 similarity and the RDP method with the Silva111 database for taxo- nomic assignment 0.5 confidence incorporated in the QIIME pipeline Caporaso et al.

The average bacterial composition at the class level for each feed type FeedFC and FeedWest and mucosal scrap samples from the fasted and nonfasted animals are shownAlthough most animals were found to be dominated by bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes class Clostridia as also reported in fecal samples from other carnivorous animals Garcia-Mazcorro et al.

The bacterial composition at the family level is shown for each mucosal scrap sample obtained from individual animals as well as the triplicate feed samples FeedFC and FeedWest2005 Nieminen et al.

There have been few investiga- tions of the mink gut microbiota and they have mostly applied con- ventional culture-based methods Vulfson et al.
