in conclusion we need more evidence to support the causality role of gut microbiota in colorectal cancer and also more clinical practice in the management of colorectal cancer.compliance with ethical standardsconflict of interest none of the authors have any conflicts of interest to declare.open access this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4 .0 international license http creativecommons.orglicensesby4.0 which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appro- priate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.referenceszheng r zeng h zhang s chen t chen w 2016 national estimates of cancer prevalence in china 2011. cancer lett 3701 33-38. doichen w zheng r baade pd zhang s zeng h bray f jemal a yu xq he j 2016 cancer statistics in china 2015. ca cancer j clin 662115-132. doipeters u bien s zubair n 2015 genetic architecture of colo- rectal cancer.

the study also identifies that cags are also associated with human immune responses such as il17a myc and stat3.to illustrate the relationships between crc and gut micro- biota several typical rodent models which simulate the crc development are also performed.

crc has long been investigated and it is classified into two typical types colitis-associated colorectal cancer cac and sporadic colorectal cancer scc according to genomic mutation diversity.

kostic and his team identify high enrichment of fusobacteria sequence in colorectal carcinoma tissue using whole genome sequencing and confirm the result in a large scale study of colorectal cancer tissue samples  .

nrpl10 has been shown to be cru- cial to maintain adaptive immunity and nrpl12 knockout mice show a susceptibility to colitis and colon tumorgenesis which display its important role in the gut homeostasis  .hypothesis models associated with colorectal cancerto better understand the role of gut microbiota in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer a few hypotheses are raised by the researchers.

short-chain fatty acids decrease in colorectal cancer patients but if the concentration is in- creased it stimulates the epithelia metabolism decreases the intracellular o2 load and protectes the tight barrier function .beneficial effects of faecalibacterium prausnitziiin the previous part of this paper we summarize the candidate gut microorganisms which relate to colorectal cancer.
