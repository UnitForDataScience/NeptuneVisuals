This article is published with open access at Springerlink.comAbstract The gut microbiota is considered as a forgotten or- gan in human health and disease.

The role for microorgan- isms that initiate and facilitate the process of colorectal cancer has become clear.

The candidate pathogens have been identi- fied by culture and next sequencing technology.

The inner involved signal pathways are totally different between these two relatively independent phenotypes but they also share a few sequential genetic mutations.

The initiating events of CRC have been proved to be APC mutation in SCC and TP53 mutation in CAC.

The etiology of CRC has been investigated using large cohorts and confirmed by animal models and the consensus conclusion contains genetic back- ground and environmental risk factors such as diabetes cho- lecystectomy obesity high fat diet and processed and red H.

The total number may reach 100 trillion and the number of microbe cells is estimated to be 10- fold more than the human cells.

The gut microbiota not only protect the local homeostasis but also mediate the related organ.

The lumen and tissue microbiota are obviously different in microbial structure.
