On the other hand the remaining four regressors--nasal polyps Lund-Mackay score eosinophilia  10 and pres- ence of eosinophilic mucus--were of comparably negligi- ble relative importance 8.92 2.99 3.58 and respectively.DISCUSSIONThe results of this article demonstrate that ITS sequencing provided an accurate way of characterizing the sinonasal mycobiome because it showed correlation with traditional fungal detection techniques the highest ITS amplicon concentration was found in CRS patients in whom fungi were detected histologically or on culture as compared to those CRS patients without fungus iden- tified and control patients.

Although less well characterized than the 18S region ITS sequencing has been shown to have the highest probability of successful identification of the broadest range of fungi.11 Despite ITS sequencing now commonly used in the wider scientific community to date there have been no sinonasal studies using this highly sensitive methodology on sinonasal specimens.The aim of this study is to use ITS sequencing to analyze and quantify the sinonasal mycobiome in healthy control and CRS patients in an attempt to better elucidate its role in sinus disease.MATERIALS AND METHODSPatient RecruitmentThis study was conducted as a prospective cohort study recruiting patients from a tertiary academic rhinology center.

Part of the controversy relating to the fact that fungus is ubiquitous has been isolated in both healthy and diseased subjects.35 Although there has been previous evidence of disturbance in the innate and adaptive immunity associated with fungi this has been contradicted by later studies by Orlandi et al.36 The sys- tematic review also has found no routine role for the use of antifungal medication in the management of CRS.37 A recent review article has disputed the hypothesis that fungi are the underlying causative factor for all CRS patients.26 Although this may be the case it is impor- tant to remember that CRS is a spectrum of disease with many different phenotypic presentations.

They found greater fungal richness in CRS patientscompared with controls and this richness was decreased after surgery.10Although 18S rRNA sequencing has provided insights into the mycobiome it has the significant disad- vantage of potential eukaryote DNA contamination leading to inaccuracies in the results.2425 Internal tran- scribed spacer sequencing appears to circumvent this problem and recently has been adopted as a universal DNA barcode for fungal identification.11 To our knowl- edge this is the first study utilizing ITS sequencing to analyze the sinonasal mycobiome in control and CRS patients.

Moreover fungus could not be virtually detected  0.1 nglL ITS amplicon concentra- tion after PCR in 28 of CRS patients and in 59 of control patients suggesting that in many individuals the middle meatus could be functionally considered as fun- gus sterile.The most abundant fungus identified using ITS sequencing and traditional detection techniques was Aspergillus a common fungi identified in fungal sinusi- tis that has been implicated in invasive fungal sinusi- tis27 allergic fungal sinusitis28 and isolated fungal mycetoma.2930 In the laboratory setting Aspergillus also is associated with the development of biofilm and has been shown to have a synergistic relationship with Staphylococcus aureus.31 Relative abundance compari- sons showed that Aspergillus was highest in the fungus- detected group followed by the CRS-without-fungus- detected group and was lowest in the control group Fig.

Despite advances in the char- acterization of bacterial communities in CRS the study of the fungal microecology or mycobiome in CRS patients is lacking.

Ethics approval was obtained from the Queen Elizabeth Human Ethics Committee approval Human Research Ethics Commit- tee14TQEHLMH222.Patients were included in the disease group if they had a diagnosis of CRS as per the European Position Paper on CRS EPOS12 and underwent endoscopic sinus surgery as part of their treatment.

Patients were phenotyped as CRS with nasal polyps CRSwNP or CRS without nasal polyps CRSsNP based on the macroscopic presence or absence of polyps accord- ing to EPOS guidelines.Sample CollectionEndoscopic guarded flocculated microbiome swabs Copan Italia S.p.A. Brescia Italy were taken intraoperatively from the middle meatus of patients.

Perhaps most importantly our results suggest that fungal overgrowth and dysbiosis only occurs in a selected subset of CRS patients once again refuting the hypothesis that fungus or fungal dys- biosis is responsible for all forms of chronic rhinosinusitis.Our understanding of the role of infection in CRS has evolved from a focus on a single pathological organ- ism to a more holistic view of the microbiome of the sinus cavity and how disturbances of this ecological niche can lead to disease.
