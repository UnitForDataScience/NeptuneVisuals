There was a significantly higher ITS concentration in the fungus-detected group compared with CRS without fungus detection post-hoc P 5 0.012 and compared with control group post-hoc P 5 0.012.Fig.

Although less well characterized than the 18S region ITS sequencing has been shown to have the highest probability of successful identification of the broadest range of fungi.11 Despite ITS sequencing now commonly used in the wider scientific community to date there have been no sinonasal studies using this highly sensitive methodology on sinonasal specimens.The aim of this study is to use ITS sequencing to analyze and quantify the sinonasal mycobiome in healthy control and CRS patients in an attempt to better elucidate its role in sinus disease.MATERIALS AND METHODSPatient RecruitmentThis study was conducted as a prospective cohort study recruiting patients from a tertiary academic rhinology center.

Demographic information is summarized in Table I.TABLE I.Summary of Patient Data.CRS 5 chronic rhinosinusitis F 5 female HPF 5 high power field M 5 male.Fungal Status Using Traditional Detection TechniquesFungi were not detected in any of the 27 control patients using traditional techniques described above.

Part of the controversy relating to the fact that fungus is ubiquitous has been isolated in both healthy and diseased subjects.35 Although there has been previous evidence of disturbance in the innate and adaptive immunity associated with fungi this has been contradicted by later studies by Orlandi et al.36 The sys- tematic review also has found no routine role for the use of antifungal medication in the management of CRS.37 A recent review article has disputed the hypothesis that fungi are the underlying causative factor for all CRS patients.26 Although this may be the case it is impor- tant to remember that CRS is a spectrum of disease with many different phenotypic presentations.

They found greater fungal richness in CRS patientscompared with controls and this richness was decreased after surgery.10Although 18S rRNA sequencing has provided insights into the mycobiome it has the significant disad- vantage of potential eukaryote DNA contamination leading to inaccuracies in the results.2425 Internal tran- scribed spacer sequencing appears to circumvent this problem and recently has been adopted as a universal DNA barcode for fungal identification.11 To our knowl- edge this is the first study utilizing ITS sequencing to analyze the sinonasal mycobiome in control and CRS patients.
