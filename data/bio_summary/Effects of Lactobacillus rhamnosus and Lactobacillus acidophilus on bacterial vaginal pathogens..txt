Percentage of growth inhibition was calculated as the recovered pathogen bacteria at the different time points after incubation with probiotics alone a-d or in combination e fcompared with the control cultures pathogens alone taken as 100. a L. acidophilus 107 cfumL b L. acidophilus 108 cfumL c L. rhamnosus 107 cfumL d L. rhamnosus 108 cfumL e L. acidophilus 107 cfumL and L. rhamnosus 107 cfumL f L. acidophilus 108 cfu mL and L. rhamnosus 108 cfumL.the inoculum of S. aureus was 107 cfumL com- plete inhibition of pathogen growth was observed after 12 h Figure 1f.

acidophilus GLA-14 and L. rhamnosus HN001were differently active against E. coli Figure 1a-d. L. rhamnosus 107 cfumL was more effec- tive than L. acidophilus 107 cfumL against E. coli at 106 cfumL Figure 1a c and their combination was synergic against E. coli 107 cfumL inducing a complete inhibition of growth after 48 h Figure 1a c e. A probiotic combination of 108 cfumL and an E. coli inoculum of 106 or 107 cfumL resulted ina complete inhibition of pathogen growth after 12 h and 24 h respectively Figure 1f.

acidophilus GLA-14 was able to inhibit S. aureus growth after 6 h Figure 1b or 12 h Figure 1a b whereas inhibition with L. rhamnosus HN001 was observed at 24 h Figure 1d and after48 h Figure 1c d. The combination of both Lactobacilli 107 cfumL with S. aureus inoculum 106 cfumL caused complete inhibition of patho- gen growth after 48 h Figure 1e whereas when the inoculum of S. aureus was higher 107 cfumL complete inhibition of pathogen growth was observed after 24 h Figure 1e.

UPEC E. coli CFT073 O6K2H1 ATCC7009289 and S. aureusATCC29213 were cultured in Luria Bertani LB and Tryptone Soy TSB broths respectively.The capability of L. acidophilus GLA-14 and L. rhamnosus HN001 to interfere with the growth of the different pathogens was evaluated by a liquid co-culture assay in anaerobiosis or in aerobiosis depending on the particular bacterial strain used.The co-culture test was performed by incubating in Defined Medium Simulating Genital Tract Secretions DMSGTS10 capable of sustaining the growth of both probiotics and pathogens different concentrations of the probiotic strains 107 and 108 cfumL alone or in combination with different concentrations 106 and 107 cfumL of the target pathogen.

acidophilus GLA-14 alone 107 cfumL or 108 cfumL was able to inhibit both concentrations ofG.

The combination of both Lactobacilli 108 cfumL with S. aureus inoculum 106 cfumL caused complete inhibition of pathogen growth since 6 h Figure 1f and whenFigure 1.

This probiotic combination of 108 cfumL seems have some slight effects after 6 h incubation with both aerobic patho- gens inoculum of 107 cfumL Figure 1b f.L.

Our results from mixed cultures with AV and BV pathogens strongly sug- gest that L. acidophilus GLA-14 alone or com- bined with L. rhamnosus HN001 can be used in probiotic products to prevent aerobic or anaerobic bacterial infections of the urogenital tract.Materials and methodsLactobacillus strains L. acidophilus GLA-14r L. rhamnosus HN001tm were stored in milk yeast extract MYE at -80degC.

The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier thus facilitating relapses and recurrences.We report here the antimicrobial activities of two commercially existing Lactobacillus strains Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Lactobacillus acidophilus GLA-14 strains and their combination Respectar probiotic blend against four different pathogens responsible for both bacterial vaginosis Gardenerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae and aerobic vaginitis Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by co-culturing assay.
