the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier thus facilitating relapses and recurrences.we report here the antimicrobial activities of two commercially existing lactobacillus strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and lactobacillus acidophilus gla-14 strains and their combination respectar probiotic blend against four different pathogens responsible for both bacterial vaginosis gardenerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and aerobic vaginitis staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli by co-culturing assay.

in this study we have analyzed the antimicrobial activity of two commercially existing probiotic strains l. rhamnosus hn001 and l. acidophilus gla-14 alone or in combination respectar pro- biotic blend against four different pathogens responsible for bv g. vaginalis and a. vaginae or av s. aureus and e. coli.

l. acidophilus gla-14 was more active than l. rhamnosus hn001.l.

vaginalis and a. vaginae after 6 h figure 1a b whereas l. rhamnosus hn001 had little inhibitory activity figure 1c d. as expected the combina- tion of both lactobacilli showed the same inhibi- tion degree of l. acidophilus gla-14 alone on both anaerobic pathogens.taken together the results obtained showed thatl.

acidophilus gla-14 and l. rhamnosus hn001 respectar probiotic blend were able to inhibit the growth of all tested pathogens at different incuba- tion time depending on the initial inoculum of path- ogen and for anaerobic strains from lactobacillus strain concentrations.discussionthe vaginal microbiota is a dynamic ecosystem that in healthy individuals is usually colonized by the lactobacillus genus but it can rapidly lead to microbiota dysbiosis where a range of microor- ganisms such as g. vaginalis and a. vaginae orcoli s. aureus and group b streptococcus become predominant and cause polymicrobial bv or av respectively.111 incompetent diagnosis and antibiotic resistance together with the elimi- nation of some helpful bacteria7 are the main causes of the unsatisfactory results of conven- tional antimicrobic treatments of bv and av.

probiotics according to the world health organization definition are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.12 even though the use of probiotics to colonize the vagina and prevent or treat infection has been considered for some time only recently their efficacy has been proven and different from that observed for anti- biotics no adverse effects have been reported.3 here we studied the antimicrobial activity of two commercially probiotic strains l. rhamnosus hn001 and l. acidophilus gla-14 alone or in combination respectar probiotic blend against four different pathogens responsible for both bv g. vaginalis and a. vaginae and av s. aureus and e. coli.
