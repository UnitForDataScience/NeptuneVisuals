Compared with mice fed a LFD mice fed a HFD had a significant increase in renal interstitial fibrosis which was prevented by concomitant treatment with DMB B and C. Importantly in- crease in renal interstitial fibrosis was positively correlated with corresponding elevations in plasma TMAO levels D. More-over expression of phosphorylated SMAD3 a key regulator of the pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor-b1-mediated extracellular matrix production and tissue fibrosis during fibrotic kidney disease  was significantly increased in mice fed a HFD compared with mice fed a LFD but was normalized by DMB treatment E. Notably DMB treatment did not alter renal interstitial fibrosis and expression of phosphorylated Smad3 in mice fed a LFD.Effects of HFD and DMB on renal functionWe next examined whether elevated circulating TMAO is amajor contributor to the development of renal dysfunction.

Of note a 16-week DMB treatment beginning at the start of diet modification had no significant effects on these measured parameters in mice fed either a LFD or a HFD.Effects of HFD and DMB on circulating TMAO levels and renalfibrosisAfter 16 weeks of diet modification plasma TMAO levels were markedly higher in mice fed a HFD than mice fed a LFD A. Concomitant treatment with DMB significantly decreased plasma TMAO levels in mice fed either a LFD or a HFD.Increased interstitial fibrosis has been considered a histologic hallmark of virtually all progressive renal diseases including obesity-related renal injury and it is strongly associated with decline in renal function and long-term prognosis .

Expression of NOX-4 TNF-a and IL-1 b in mice fed a LFD was not affected by DMB treatment.DiscussionThe novel findings of this study are 1 mice fed a HFD develop obesity and metabolic disorders which are not altered by concomitant treatment with DMB an inhibitor of trimethylamine formation 2 mice fed a HFD have elevated circulating TMAO levels increased renal interstitial fibrosis and impaired renal function 3 increased renal interstitial fibrosis and impaired renal function in mice fed a HFD are prevented by treatment with DMBFig.

Importantly we found that increases in expression of phosphorylated SMAD3 a key regulator of renal fibrosis and renal interstitial fibrosis and expression of KIM-1 and plasma cystatin C levels in HFD-induced obese mice were prevented by concomitant treatment with DMB which significantly reduced circulating TMAO levels.

Numerous studies have shown that mice or rats continuously fed high-fat diets or Western-style diets high fat combined with sucrose develop obesity as well as path- ological changes in the kidney characterized by glomerulusclerosis proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis e. In the present study we found that mice fed a HFD for 16 weeks developed obesity and metabolic disorders as evidenced by increased BW and elevated plasma levels of insulin cholesterol and triglyceride.

Additionally there was a positive correlation between increase in expression of KIM-1 in the kidney and corresponding elevations in plasm TMAO levels C.Effects of HFD and DMB on renal oxidative stress and inflammationOxidative stress and inflammation in the kidney have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of obesity-related renal injury e. To further determine the possible molecular mechanisms by which elevated TMAO levels induce renal interstitial fibrosis and dysfunction we measured expression of NOX-4 a constitutive active enzyme responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines in the kidney.

Molecular and morphological studies revealed that renal interstitial fibrosis phosphorylation of SMAD3 a key regulator of renal fibrosis expression of kidney injury molecule-1 and plasma cystatin C were significantly increased in mice fed a HFD compared with mice fed a LFD.

To examine whether elevated TMAO levels contribute to increased interstitial fibrosis in the kidney in HFD-induced obese mice Masson Trichrome staining was performed to assess renal inter- stitial fibrosis at 16 weeks after HFD feeding and DMB treatment.
