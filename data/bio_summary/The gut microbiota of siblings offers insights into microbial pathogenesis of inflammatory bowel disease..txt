First the degree of genetic relatedness of full-siblings is on average around 50 but detailed analysis of sibling genomes reveals that their similarity may vary between 37 to 62.Secondly expression of risk phenotypes may depend on environmental exposures that may vary between family members for example aspirin may induce increased intestinal per- meability.Finally one of the advantages of family studies the capacity to examine genotype-environ- ment interactions is also a limitation in that it may not be possible to determine whether a phenotype that is shared between siblings is shared because of geno- type e.g.

healthy relatives of IBD patients provide a window into pathogenic pathways in the absence of the obfus- cating influence of established chronic CD.In our recent publication Siblings of patients with Crohn's disease exhibit biologically relevant dysbiosis in mucosal microbial metacommunities we used 16S rRNA gene targeted high-throughput sequencing to test the hypothesis that dysbiosis exists in the mucosal microbiota of healthy siblings of CD patients and is therefore not merely a consequence of estab- lished disease.

Despite these limitations studies of healthy at-risk relatives of patients with CD may uniquely contribute to the illu- mination of pathogenic pathways that are not easily discernible in studying patients with established disease.We showed that core microbiota of both CD patients and healthy siblings were significantly less diverse compared with healthy unrelated controls.

Dendrogram showing the microbial community dissim- ilarity between the 3 groups The composition of the whole microbiota as determined by Bray-Curtis index is more similar between patients and their healthy siblings than between healthy siblings and healthy controls and this pattern is driven by similarity in the core microbiota between patients and siblings rather than the rare microbiota.which was lower in siblings median 9.27 IQR 8.12-9.78 log10 copiesg compared with controls median 9.59 IQR 9.34-10.14 log10 copiesg p D 0.048 as well as between patients median 6.88 IQR 5.03-9.35 log10 copiesg compared with controls p D 0.006 .Thus the finding of sibling dys- biosis including reduced abundance of F. prausnitzii is robust having been demonstrated in analyses using different techniques 454 pyrosequencing and qPCR and in both mucosa-associated and faecal microbiotaThere has been intense speculation regarding the role of F. prausnitzii in CD pathogenesis as it is the only microbial factor shown to be predictive of the natural history of CDand of the response to treatment.It may be speculated that loss of F. praus- nitzii could result in the loss of key functions that contribute to gut health for example the production of short-chain fatty acids in particular butyrateand NFkB-mediated effects.However we would be cau- tious in constructing pathogenic hypotheses based on the functions of this particular species rather inter- preting these data as implicating that loss of F. praus- nitzii is a sensitive indicator of a broader change in the gut microbiota.

Recent data in animal models supports the role for the gut immune system in shap- ing the microbiota and suggests that this effect may be at least in part dependent on a pathway involving both polyreactive and bacteria-specific secretory IgAas well as mediated through gut epithelial cells and HopxC cell-derived miRNAs which enter bacte- ria and regulate bacterial gene expression and growth in turn affecting the microbiota composition and sus- ceptibility to colitis.Furthermore specific SNPs have been associated with gut microbiota composition in a cohort of healthy relatives.We have shown that perturbations in the mucosal gut microbiota occur not only in individuals withCrohn's disease but also in otherwise healthy individu- als at elevated risk of Crohn's disease thus dysbiosis is not merely a consequence of inflammation.

Such influences may be effected through factors including microbial molecular transfer mediated by maternal immunoglobulins transmitted both trans-placentally and through lacta- tion.Defining the interrelated processes of human immune development and microbial acquisition may have a significant impact on our understanding of the pathogenesis of IBD.Given the factors discussed above it may be hypothesized that environmental factors impact on the acquisition of the gut microbiota during the prena- tal neonatal or early childhood period which in turn creates a persistent inflammatory immune tone thus laying the foundations for future IBD risk.
