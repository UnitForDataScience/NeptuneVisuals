healthy relatives of IBD patients provide a window into pathogenic pathways in the absence of the obfus- cating influence of established chronic CD.In our recent publication Siblings of patients with Crohn's disease exhibit biologically relevant dysbiosis in mucosal microbial metacommunities we used 16S rRNA gene targeted high-throughput sequencing to test the hypothesis that dysbiosis exists in the mucosal microbiota of healthy siblings of CD patients and is therefore not merely a consequence of estab- lished disease.

Despite these limitations studies of healthy at-risk relatives of patients with CD may uniquely contribute to the illu- mination of pathogenic pathways that are not easily discernible in studying patients with established disease.We showed that core microbiota of both CD patients and healthy siblings were significantly less diverse compared with healthy unrelated controls.

Dendrogram showing the microbial community dissim- ilarity between the 3 groups The composition of the whole microbiota as determined by Bray-Curtis index is more similar between patients and their healthy siblings than between healthy siblings and healthy controls and this pattern is driven by similarity in the core microbiota between patients and siblings rather than the rare microbiota.which was lower in siblings median 9.27 IQR 8.12-9.78 log10 copiesg compared with controls median 9.59 IQR 9.34-10.14 log10 copiesg p D 0.048 as well as between patients median 6.88 IQR 5.03-9.35 log10 copiesg compared with controls p D 0.006 .Thus the finding of sibling dys- biosis including reduced abundance of F. prausnitzii is robust having been demonstrated in analyses using different techniques 454 pyrosequencing and qPCR and in both mucosa-associated and faecal microbiotaThere has been intense speculation regarding the role of F. prausnitzii in CD pathogenesis as it is the only microbial factor shown to be predictive of the natural history of CDand of the response to treatment.It may be speculated that loss of F. praus- nitzii could result in the loss of key functions that contribute to gut health for example the production of short-chain fatty acids in particular butyrateand NFkB-mediated effects.However we would be cau- tious in constructing pathogenic hypotheses based on the functions of this particular species rather inter- preting these data as implicating that loss of F. praus- nitzii is a sensitive indicator of a broader change in the gut microbiota.

However genetic and microbiome studies have challenged this dogma for example some studies support a difference between small intestinal-restricted and colonic-involving CD.A genetic predisposition to IBD is fundamental andrelatives of patients are at enhanced risk of developing IBD themselves.The interaction between the gut microbiota and the gut immune system is pivotal inIBD pathogenesisand in patients with IBD abnor- malities can be demonstrated in both the gut immune system and the gut microbiota dysbiosis as well as alterations in intestinal permeability and increased concentrations of neutrophil-derived calprotectin in faeces.However whether dysbiosis has a role in dis- ease pathogenesis or is merely consequent to inflam- mation cannot be determined by examining only individuals with established IBD.

Addendum to Hedin C van der Gast CJ Rogers GB Cuthbertson L McCartney S Stagg AJ Lindsay JO Whelan K. Siblings of patients with Crohn's disease exhibit a biologically relevant dysbiosis in mucosal microbial metacommunities.

Furthermore data are emerging demonstrating increases in F. prausnitzii in new onset pediatric Crohn's disease indicating that the role this species plays in pathogenesis is complex.Interest- ingly increased E. coli contributed to the dissimilarity between patients and healthy controls but not to the dissimilarity between siblings and healthy controls.

Recent data in animal models supports the role for the gut immune system in shap- ing the microbiota and suggests that this effect may be at least in part dependent on a pathway involving both polyreactive and bacteria-specific secretory IgAas well as mediated through gut epithelial cells and HopxC cell-derived miRNAs which enter bacte- ria and regulate bacterial gene expression and growth in turn affecting the microbiota composition and sus- ceptibility to colitis.Furthermore specific SNPs have been associated with gut microbiota composition in a cohort of healthy relatives.We have shown that perturbations in the mucosal gut microbiota occur not only in individuals withCrohn's disease but also in otherwise healthy individu- als at elevated risk of Crohn's disease thus dysbiosis is not merely a consequence of inflammation.

Defining the relationship between microbial acquisition immune phenotype and IBD risk requires longitudinal studies and the results of ongoing studies including the MECONIUMstudy Exploring MEChanisms Of disease traNsmisson In Utero through the Micro- biome a study comparing the bacterial profiles of pregnant women with and without IBD with their new-born babies and in addition assessing the influ- ence of infant feeding practices and antibiotic use early in life on microbiota acquisition and the GEM project Genetics Environment and Microbiota Proj- ect A longitudinal study of relatives of patients with Crohn's diseaseare eagerly awaited.Disclosure of potential conflicts of interestNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.FundingThis research was funded by a research fellowship for Dr Charlotte Hedin from Core a charity for digestive diseases.ReferencesCleynen I Boucher G Jostins L Schumm LP Zeissig S Ahmad T Andersen V Andrews JM Annese V Brand Set al.
