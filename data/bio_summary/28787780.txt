3.Principal component analysis PCA of taxonomical community com- position was used to examine clustering between communities and showed high correlation between forest and grassland samples  a. Tundra samples were clustered with other grasslands probably be- cause the samples were collected during the summer when tundra soil microbial communities are shaped by the summer monocotyledonous growth .

Also Candidatus Solibacter usitatus be- longing to Acidobacteria phylum and related to nitrate and nitrite reduc- tion and plant cell wall polysaccharide degradation was found in high frequency .The phyla Chloroflexi particularly the thermophilic class Thermomicrobia Firmicutes and Deinococcus-Thermus were signifi- cantly more abundant in semiarid and desert samples than in forest grassland and tundra soil samples.

Native soil samples were selected from Amazon forest Brazil dataset to represent the tropical forest biome .

This occurred due to the scarcity of WGS samples related to the Tundra biome in pub- lic databases.Soil functional profiles from the desert biome group were signifi- cantly less similar to each other than soil profiles within the forest grassland and semiarid biomes c. Therefore while semiarid grassland and forest soils with similar vegetation and climate are func- tionally similar even when located in very different geographic regions desert soils buck the trend.

Only two metagenomes were available from 8 Mediterranean chaparral soils and one metagenome was available from each 9 temperate coniferous 10 temperate deciduous 11 boreal forest and prairie 2 - temperate savanna.Boreal forest Alaska prairie USA temperate coniferous USA deciduous forest USA hot desert USA and Polar desert Antarctica datasets were used from a previous work on soil microbial community comparisons .

On the other hand functional modules associated with plant-derived compound metabolism were significantly overrepresented in grassland and forest soils when com- pared to desert samples .Although previous studies have already discussed differences in mi- crobial communities among biomes some groups such as semiarid and tundra were poorly discussed or even not considered.

Nonetheless reads annotated to Ascomycota were signifi- cantly more abundant in forest and grassland biome groups when compared to semiarid and desert soil samples.

The Archaea domain showed lower abundance in forest and grassland soils when com- pared to semiarid soil samples Welch's t-test p b 0.05 Supple- mentary Fig.
