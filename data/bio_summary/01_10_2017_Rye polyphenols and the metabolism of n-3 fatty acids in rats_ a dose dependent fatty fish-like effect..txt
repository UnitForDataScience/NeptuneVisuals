the intake of plant n-3 alpha-linolenic acid and wr results in a sort of fatty fish-like effect demonstrating that the n-3 lcfa levels in blood and tissues could be increased without eating marine foods and therefore without promoting unsustainable overfishing and without damaging marine ecology.long-chain fatty acids lcfa of the n-3 series -- also called marine lcfa because marine foods are the main source of these lipids -- are critically important for human health.

main urinary metabolites were phenolic acid derivatives particularly hippuric acid and glucuronide and sulphate con- jugates of ferulic acid sinapic acid and hydroxyphenylpropionic acid as also shown in a previous study.

all the results are presented as mean-sd.the association between urinary polyphenol metabolites and plasma n-3 lcfa was evaluated by using multi-ple linear regression model where the levels of fatty acids obtained in plasma  were the predicted variable and the polyphenols metabolites excreted in urine mmoll were the predictor variables according to the following model using the minitab v17 software yij  gi  a pij1  b pij2  c pij3  ... x pij16 where gi was the diet effect i  ct diet or wr 39 diet or wr 79 diet and pij the effect of polyphenol metabolite j j 1 2 3... or 16 yij being the fatty acid response to the changes in i diets and j polyphenol metabolites.

the wr-fed rats excreted significantly more enterolactone and enterolactone-glucuronide as well as several phenolic acid metabolites such as sinapic and ferulic acid glucuronides and ferulic acid dihy- droferulic acid and caffeic sulphates compared with controls and the wr79 rats excreted significantly more metabolites than the wr39 rats.

we have previously demonstrated that wr was able to modulate the microbiota composition inducing a stimulation of the n-3 lcfa synthesis and thatseveral types of polyphenols -- including anthocyanins present in black cornand phenolic acids present in wheat aleurone-- are possibly active factors in the metabolism of n-3 lcfa in rats.the alternative experimental strategy has been to feed rats with wr and to analyse the relations between n-3 lcfa levels and urinary metabolites of rye phenolics.

for the present time no affordable environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable solution exists.since humans have the ability to synthesize marine n-3 lcfa from plant n-3 alpha-linolenic acid although insufficiently one solution would be to stimulate the endogenous production of n-3 lcfa by the human body.

it was shown that some polyphenols could stimulate the endogenous synthesis of marine n-3 lcfa in rats and humans and in particular that polyphenols of wr seem very active by stimulating the different steps of n-3 lcfa synthesis from alpha-linolenic acid to epa from epa to 225n-3 and from 225n-3 to dha.the main aim of the present study was then to examine whether wr consumption may increase levels of n-3lcfa in the blood and liver of rats in a dose-dependent manner.

thus we must eat fatty fish -- or n-3 lcfa supplements -- to get sufficient amounts of marine n-3 lcfa as these lipids are critical for optimal development and function of the brain and heart.

the main phenolic metabolites identified as factors in the interactions between rye polyphenols and n-3 lcfa are two phenolic acid derivatives produced by the gut microbiota namely hydroxyphenylpropionic acid-o-sulphate significantly associated with dha and 3-3'-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid significantly associated with epa.

because of the high correlation between blood and liver n-3 lcfa r 0.87 for dha and r 0.72 for epa analyses were limited to the association between urinary polyphenols and plasma n-3 lcfa.resultsmacronutrient and fatty acid composition in the three groups.

this is not surprising because the involved enzymatic systems are similar for the n-3 and n-6 pathways.since 182n-6 is an essential fatty acid whose unique sources are foods the potential mechanisms by whichrye polyphenols interfere with liver and blood 182n-6 levels may be different from the mechanisms by which they interfere with n-3 lcfa metabolism i.e.

this hypothesis raises two questions first why should absorption of 182n-6 and not that of other polyunsaturated fatty acids particularly 183n-3 alpha-linolenic acid be impacted by rye polyphenols second why should only one rye polyphenol metabolite -- hydroxyphenylpropionic acid-o-sulphate -- be involved in the inhibition of absorption of 182n-6 to understand the interactions between rye polyphenols and 182n-6 it would be critical to answer these two questions in future studies.conclusionthis study confirms that certain polyphenols may stimulate the synthesis of n-3 lcfa but demonstrates for the first time that this effect is linked to the transformation of specific polyphenols into their microbial and hepatic metab- olites.

eating plant n-3 alpha-linolenic acid and wr might result in a sort of fatty fish-like effect ideally proving that we can increase n-3 lcfa blood and tissue levels without eating marine foods and therefore without promoting unsustainable overfishing and without damaging marine ecology.

we focused our analyses on the changes in n-6 and n-3 fatty acids in particular eicosapentanoic acid epa 205n-3 and docosahexanoic acid dha 226n-3.statistical analysis.
