Main urinary metabolites were phenolic acid derivatives particularly hippuric acid and glucuronide and sulphate con- jugates of ferulic acid sinapic acid and hydroxyphenylpropionic acid as also shown in a previous study.

The intake of plant n-3 alpha-linolenic acid and WR results in a sort of fatty fish-like effect demonstrating that the n-3 LCFA levels in blood and tissues could be increased without eating marine foods and therefore without promoting unsustainable overfishing and without damaging marine ecology.Long-chain fatty acids LCFA of the n-3 series -- also called marine LCFA because marine foods are the main source of these lipids -- are critically important for human health.

The WR-fed rats excreted significantly more enterolactone and enterolactone-glucuronide as well as several phenolic acid metabolites such as sinapic and ferulic acid glucuronides and ferulic acid dihy- droferulic acid and caffeic sulphates compared with controls and the WR79 rats excreted significantly more metabolites than the WR39 rats.

We have previously demonstrated that WR was able to modulate the microbiota composition inducing a stimulation of the n-3 LCFA synthesis and thatseveral types of polyphenols -- including anthocyanins present in black cornand phenolic acids present in wheat aleurone-- are possibly active factors in the metabolism of n-3 LCFA in rats.The alternative experimental strategy has been to feed rats with WR and to analyse the relations between n-3 LCFA levels and urinary metabolites of rye phenolics.

For the present time no affordable environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable solution exists.Since humans have the ability to synthesize marine n-3 LCFA from plant n-3 alpha-linolenic acid although insufficiently one solution would be to stimulate the endogenous production of n-3 LCFA by the human body.

It was shown that some polyphenols could stimulate the endogenous synthesis of marine n-3 LCFA in rats and humans and in particular that polyphenols of WR seem very active by stimulating the different steps of n-3 LCFA synthesis from alpha-linolenic acid to EPA from EPA to 225n-3 and from 225n-3 to DHA.The main aim of the present study was then to examine whether WR consumption may increase levels of n-3LCFA in the blood and liver of rats in a dose-dependent manner.

The main phenolic metabolites identified as factors in the interactions between rye polyphenols and n-3 LCFA are two phenolic acid derivatives produced by the gut microbiota namely hydroxyphenylpropionic acid-O-sulphate significantly associated with DHA and 3-3'-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid significantly associated with EPA.

carp and tilapia are quite low and will not be able to meet the future growing demand.Seaweed farming may be another solution and marine n-3 LCFA have now been produced in large-scale cul- tivation of microalgae but this is unlikely to become an affordable reality in the short-term particularly because of high production costs quite limited yields in marine n-3 LCFA and consumer reluctance.

In the above-cited animal study comparing refined rye and WR we did not evaluate the dose-effect relationship -- a useful approach to demon- strate a causal effect -- between rye polyphenols and n-3 LCFA and whether specific rye polyphenol metabolites were involved in the metabolism n-3 LCFA.

Thus we must eat fatty fish -- or n-3 LCFA supplements -- to get sufficient amounts of marine n-3 LCFA as these lipids are critical for optimal development and function of the brain and heart.
