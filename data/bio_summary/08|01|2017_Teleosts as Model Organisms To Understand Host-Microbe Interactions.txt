Most mouse studies rely upon indirect characterization of gut microbial communities from fecal samples which are not consistently reliable indicators of gut microbial communities  and cannot be used to detect differences in microbial communities that are spatially separated along the gut .

While associations have also been found between MHC diversity and microbiota in mice  microbiota changes correlated more strongly with body size in females than in males .

However the communities recovered to baseline after 2 weeks in clean water sug- gesting that short-term disruption to gut microbiota may be sufficient to harm a developing host but that there is an opportunity to recover normal bacterial diversity after disturbance.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSWhat have we learned from studying fish models Researchers have gained novel insights into mechanisms underlying development of the digestive tract and how microbiota contribute to disease states      .

They share physiological and immunological features common among vertebrates includ- ing humans and harbor complex gut microbiota which allows identification of the mechanisms driving microbial community assembly.

Gnotobiotic studies in both mammals and teleosts allow the documentation of a broad array of host responses to gut microbiota  but zebrafish have revealed advantages over mice in identifying microbial signaling pathways influ- encing development  .

These studies reveal the varied roles that microbiota play in normal digestive devel- opment and function.Gnotobiotic studies of laboratory-reared oceanic and resident freshwater stickleback have demonstrated that these two ecotypes have common gut microbial communities and similarities in intestinal development despite their separation in the wild for at least 10000 years .

However the two ecotypes differed in the intensity of their inflammatory responses to microbes highlighting the potential for gene-environment interactions that influence host immune response .INSIGHTS FROM WILD-CAUGHT VERSUS LABORATORY-REARED ZEBRAFISHWild-caught and laboratory-reared zebrafish populations have similar gut microbial communities suggesting the existence of a core gut microbiota  which may also be true of mammals .

Host-microbe researchers are now beginning to use the natural variation found in wild populations to unravel interactions among diet genetic background and environmental microbial communities with respect to effects on gut microbiota composition.

Vertebrates harbor complex residential microbial communities that have been shaped by the host  and unlike invertebrate models such as fruit flies and squid have adaptive immune systems that recognize particular microbes and play vital roles in cultivating residential gut microbial communities .

While studies of host- microbe interactions have provided novel insights into development disease and physiology gaps remain in our understanding of the processes underlying microbial community assembly   the mechanisms by which gut microbes influence host development and physiology  and the genetic and environmental factors that regulate gut microbial composition and diversity .
