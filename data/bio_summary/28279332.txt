The generality of this pattern across diverse organisms would be one feature that helped us to identify the first effector superfamily a broadly distributed group of T6S substrates with related activity .With the contributions of many groups--many of which we regrettably cannot highlight here--the T6S field has progressed immensely since those early days.

FoSheng Hsu a talented technician in the lab went on to show that Tse2 directly inter- acts with its adjacently encoded immunity protein.At this point we were thrilled to have identified T6S substrates and to learn that one of these was part of a toxin-im- munity system.

Indeed to ratio- nalize the toxicity of Tse2 toward bacteria we had entertained this possibility in the wildly speculative discussion of our first submission ''the ability of Tse2 to impact growth of a bacterial cell raises the intriguing possibility that its role may involve assisting P. aeruginosa in compe- tition with other bacteria.''

In the experi- ment that yielded the first three Pseudo- monas T6S substrates we compared the extracellular proteome of our ''on'' strain to a strain in the ''off'' state.

Together their efforts allowed us to identify what turned out to be very low abundance proteins.Combing through the data with all stan- dard filtering criteria thrown to the wind we fished out three candidate T6S sub- strates.

Highlights from the History of T6S ResearchTop timeline for the chronology of significant studies discussed in the text.

Their genome-wide screen for Proteus mirabilis mutants with defects in kin recognition hit a T6S gene cluster .These inklings together with Joseph's defeat in Cleveland led us to try our hand at interbacterial competition experi- ments.

On the heels of this work we highlighted a large body of experimental findings incon- sistent with the widespread involvement of T6S in mediating host cell interactions and issued a call for others to consider its role in bacterial antagonism.

The demon- strated molecular targets of T6S toxins to date encompass several essential structures including cellular membranes electron carriers the nucleoid and the cell wall.Aided by several landmark structural studies research into the mechanism by288 Cell Host  Microbe 21 March 8 2017which the T6SS recognizes and translo- cates substrates has kept pace with ad- vances in understanding its physiological function.

Three distinct T6S apparatus protein assemblages have been identi- fied phage tail- and baseplate-related complexes and a membrane complex containing homologs of type IV secretion system proteins.
