b.Effect of monocolonization of GF miceby L. plantarumNIZO2877 or E. coli Nissle 1917 on CYP gene expressionFirst we have observed the effect of monocolonization of GF mice by bacterial strains in comparison with GF mice Fig.

SPF specific pathogen-free mice with normal intesti- nal flora GF germ-free mice lacking intestinal flora GF  L. plantarum germ-free mice monocolonized by L. plantarumNIZO2877 GF  E. coli Nissle 1917 germ-free mice monocolonized by probiotic bacteria E. coli Nissle 1917.

Differences were regarded as statistically significant when the P value was lower than 0.05.ResultsComparison of CYP gene expression in GF vs. control SPF miceThe mRNA expressions of CYPs were determined in the liver of germ-free GF mice and were compared to mRNA CYPs of control-specific pathogen-free SPF mice Fig.

Hence in case of this gene the monocolonization of the GF animals with bacteria did not convert the expression more closely to the state in the SPFmice as it happened with the CYP1a2.Increased level of Cyp2e1 expression observed in the GF mice Fig.

In the present study we determined the mRNA expression of Cyp1a1 Cyp1a2 Cyp2b10 Cyp2c29 Cyp2c38 Cyp2d22 Cyp2e1 Cyp3a11 and 3a13 in the liver of GF mice and GF mice colonized by bacterial strainsL.

After the colonization of the GF mice with L. plantarumNIZO2877 or probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 the level of Cyp3a11 has remained downregulat- ed and corresponded to the GF conditions Fig.

To investigate the effect of microbial colonization on messen- ger RNA mRNA expression of liver cytochromes P450 CYPs the main drug-metabolizing enzymes we used germ- free GF mice lacking the intestinal flora and mice monocolonized by non-pathogenic bacteria Lactobacillus plantarumNIZO2877 or probiotic bacteria Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 compared to specific pathogen-free SPF mice.

Our results show that the mRNA expression of Cyp1a2 and Cyp2e1 was significantly increased while the expression of Cyp3a11 mRNA was decreased under GF conditions compared to the SPF mice.

The both bacteria L. plantarumNIZO2877 and E. coli Nissle 1917 given to the GF mice decreased the level of Cyp1a2 mRNA and normalized it to the control level.

On the other hand the coloni- zation by these bacteria had no effect on the expression of E.
