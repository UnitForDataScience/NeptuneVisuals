A conserva- tive database de novo read assembly and a modi- fied counting method were incorporated into the protocol to improve the results of metataxonomic analysis.MethodsReference sequence databasesBacterial fungal and viral genomes and the corre- sponding transcriptomes as of March 1 2015 were taken from the NCBI Genomes database  To in- crease fungal representation in the reference database additional select genomes and transcriptomes available as of June 1 2015 were retrieved from FungiDB.org For simplicity members of Stramenopiles sometimes called pseudo-fungi were included in the database as members of the fungal kingdom.

The database does contain other species in the same genera for 6 of the ASF species namely genera Parabacteroides Lactobacillus 2 species Clostridium 2 species and Eubacterium.

Moreover its performance is better than state-of-the-art methods for metataxonomics.Additional filesAbbreviations16S Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing 18S Fungal 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing ASF Altered Schaedler flora DNAseq Shotgun DNA sequencing FDR False discovery rateFPKM Fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped a normalized unit for gene expression measurement ITS Internal transcribed spacer LCA Lowest common ancestor NCBI National Center for Biotechnology Information RNAseq Ribosomal depleted shotgun RNA sequencing TPR True positive rateAcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to the CCHMC Division of Biomedical Informatics for large volume storage and computing resources enabling the conduct of this study.FundingThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health 5R01HL119190 to A.P..Availability of data and materialsSimulated datasets and databases supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Figshare repository Project name IMSAAProject home page Archived version IMSA-AOperating system Linux Programming Language Python 2.7Other requirements IMSAA depends on many other software tools.

The remaining two gen- era are unrelated to the ASF species.We compared the output from IMSAA Oases to Kraken and MEGAN CE MEGAN version 6 Table MEGAN BLASTN used the same custom database as IMSAA allowing for a direct comparison of IMSAA to MEGAN CE BLASTN.

Then we illustrate the performance of the developed protocol on a real RNAseq data derived from mice with a controlled microbiome whose com- positional species are not included in the reference database.Simulation experimentsThe simulation conditions were chosen to represent difficult taxonomy classification circumstances high number of species present from multiple kingdoms 30 bacteria 15 fungi and 10 viruses as well as a variable microbial composition high host sequencing percentage 95 leading to low microbiome sequen- cing depth and 1 sequencing error rate.

ASF consists of eight species Parabacteroides goldsteinii two Clostridium species a Pseudoflavonifrac- tor species Eubacterium plexicaudatum Mucispirillum schaedleri Lactobacillus murinus and Lactobacillus intenstinalis We analyzed RNAseq data derived from the samples taken from the germ-free ASF colo- nized mice NCBI SRA ID SRA051354  using the IMSAA Oases protocol.

Also the complete NCBI RefSeq database January 10 2016 was used as an alternative reference database when testing IMSAA.Our Kraken database was constructed by combining the standard Kraken database generated by its utility with additional complete genome sequences of micro- organisms sourced from Genbank.

The ability of the protocol to classify micro- biome samples containing organisms which are not represented in the reference database is evaluated below see .Impact of assemblerTwo assemblers capable of de novo metatranscriptome sequence assembly were evaluated for inclusion in the metataxonomics protocol.

The new protocol improves accuracy by using a conservative reference database employing a new counting scheme and by assembling shotgun reads.

Therefore IMSAA gives researchers a second use for their metatran- scriptome data as well as a possible way to minimize the cost of experiments.Simulation experiments demonstrated that low se- quencing coverage limits the protocol's ability to de- tect organisms whereas database selection de novo assembly of shotgun reads and stricter counting scheme improve classification performance.
