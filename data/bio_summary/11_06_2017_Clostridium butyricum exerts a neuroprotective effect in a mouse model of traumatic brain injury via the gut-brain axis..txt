In our previous studies it was found that Cb is effective in the treatment of vascular dementia29 and diabetes com- bined with cerebral ischemia.13 Our previous studies showed that Cb can produce a large amount of SCFA butyrate in the gut and exert anti-apoptosis and antioxygenation in vascular dementia ani- mal models which may have beneficial effects on host brain injury.30 These effects of Cb can mainly be explained by its ability to increasethe production of butyrate and the secretion of the gut hormone GLP-1.31 Although the ability of Cb to attenuate neuroinflammatory responses and apoptosis and to promote GLP-1 have been sepa- rately reported in different experimental models the effects of Cb on GLP-1 secretion and production have not been clarified in a TBI animal model.In this study we provide evidence supporting Cb as a treatment for and management strategy against TBI.

The level of GLP-1R in the brain was remarkably decreased in the TBI group compared with the sham group P  .01 Figure 9A and B whereas Cb treatment P  .01 Figure 9A and B resulted in a sig- nificant increase suggesting that Cb treatment could activate cerebral GLP-1R protein in the TBI mice.4  DISCUSSION FIGURE 5 Representative images of EB-stained in the TBI group A B and Cb group C D. E The concentrations of the EB were normalized against the brain tissue weight and calculated as ng EBg of brain tissue according to the linear standard curve.

Bcl-2 expression was lower in the TBI group than in the sham group 24 hour after TBI but was elevated after Cb treatment Figure 7C and D. Bax levels were elevated in the TBI group and were reduced after treatment with Cb Figure 5C and D. The ratio of Bcl-2Bax was significantly lower in the TBI group compared with the sham group P  .001 Figure 7C and D. These data demonstrate that Cb activated the PI3KAkt pathway and inhibited neu- ronal apoptosis in TBI mice.

However the level of colonic GLP-1 in mice treated with Cb was higher than in the TBI group.A number of studies have shown that TBI are associated with pro- found changes in gut dysfunction.938 Our previous studies have confirmed that Cb is effective in the treatment of brain disor- ders1329 by virtue of producing a large amount of butyrate.30 These effects of Cb can be mainly explained by its ability to increase the secretion of gut hormones GLP-1.31 However mechanistic insights are lacking especially regarding how probiotics-derived GLP-1 pathways to attenuate TBI-induced brain barrier impairment and neuronal damage.

The aim of this study was to explore the neuro- protective effects of Clostridium butyricum Cb on brain damage in a mouse model of TBI.Methods Male C57BL6 mice were subjected to a model of TBI- induced by weight- drop impact head injury and were treated intragastrically with Cb.

The levels of SCFAs in the gastrointestinal tract are influenced by the microbial composition.19 The level of SCFAs in the GI may change along with the occurrence of intestinal dysbiosis.62 Cb treatment could produce abundant bu- tyrate from the fermentation of fibers63 and result in increased bu- tyrate levels in the colon.

Mice in the Cb group were intragastrically administered with Cb 109 CFUml once daily for 14 consecutive days prior to the onset of TBI and then following TBI they were intragastrically treated once daily for 14 consecutive days.

Cb treatment significantly increased expression of the occlu- din and ZO-1 proteins occludin P  .01 and ZO-1 P  .01 Figure 6D-F.  Cb treatment ameliorated neuronal apoptosis in TBI miceWe measured the expression of apoptosis-related protein markers at 14 days post-trauma.

Our experiment used a mouse model in which TBI was induced with the weight-drop method which frequently resulted in cortical contusion and a series of neurological impairments.39 In our previous studies Cb treatment was shown to potentially attenuate cognitive disorder in mice.40-42 Consistent with our present study Cb treatment signifi- cantly ameliorated TBI-induced neurological deficits.

Increases in TJ protein levels are beneficial for the integrity of the BBB.49 Protection against BBB-integrity damages induced by TBI is probably achieved through the recovery of TJ proteins.50 In this study Cb treatment improved BBB impairment induced by TBI in mice.Thus it is likely that the post-TBI reductions in BBB permeability and brain edema demonstrated in the present study are related to the anti-apoptosis properties of Cb.
