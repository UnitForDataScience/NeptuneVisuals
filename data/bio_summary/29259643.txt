The protein expression levels of TLR4 and MyD88 were upregu- lated in the ileum of the HFD group Figures After treatment with DZD such levels were restored to normal Figures The phosphorylation levels of ERK and JNK in the HFD group exceeded those of the control group Figures and However the three groups had similar ERK and JNK levels Figures and Similarly DZD downregulated the phosphorylation levels of these proteins Figures and Thus activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in the ileum was enhanced by HFD whereas DZD reduced the activity of this pathway to normal.DZD Intervention Activated the TLR4 Signaling Pathway in the Colon.

The protein expression levels of TLR4 and MyD88 in the ileum were upregulated in the HFD group Figures After treatment with DZD such levels were restored to normal Figures The total protein levels of ERK and JNK were similar among the three groups Figures and However the phosphorylation levels of these two proteins in the HFD group surpassed those of the control group Figures and DZD downregulated the phosphorylation levels of ERK and JNK in NAFLD rats Figures and These results confirmed that activation of the TLR4 signaling pathway in the ileum was upregulated by HFD.

Compared to the control group the HFD group had higher body weight liver weight and serum ALT AST TG TC HDL-C and LDL-C levels Figures DZD treatment for 4 weeks signif- icantly decreased body and liver weights and restored serum lipid levels and liver function parameters compared with those of the HFD group Figures Meanwhile the body weight liver weight serum lipids and liver function parameters of the DZD group were similar to those of the control group.

The DZD group received daily gavage of 5.13 gkg DZD density 1 g crude herbml in addition to HFD for four weeks while the NAFLD group was gavaged with the same volume of saline for four weeks.

Meanwhile the three groups had similar richness as indicated by the Chao index Figure Samples from the three groups formed distinct clusters in the ordination plot suggesting that HFD and DZD induced main changes in the gut microbiota Figure The HFD group had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and a lower relative abundance of Bacteroidetes than those of the control group and DZD decreased the proportion of Firmicutes and increased that of Bacteroidetes on the phylum level Figuresand e. Besides principle component analysis PCoA was performed to compare the differences in bacterial communities between different groups on the OTU level Figure .

Interestingly the fecal microbiome of the NAFLD group had increased Desulfovibrionaceae family Desulfovibrio genus and EscherichiaShigella genus Figures The relative abundances of Desulfovibrionaceae a family of sulfate-reducing bacteria SRB and Desulfovibrioa genus of SRB increased in the NAFLD group which were reversed by DZD Figures and A previous study showed that diet increased SRB in vitro These gutRT 4.00-30.00100908070606.8711.0113.4315.1016.7327.1228.09NL1.26E7TIC F FTMS p ESI Full29.49 ms120.00-900.00 MSdh504030205.70 6.321007.387.9710.789.3712.6413.8818.2718.63 19.6323.2520.7524.2027.0425.1846810121416182022Time mina24262830RT 4.00-30.0010090807060506.8610.8011.0213.45 13.8914.0816.6918.28NL1.84E7TIC F FTMS- p ESI Full ms 120.00- 900.00 MS dh-neg403020 4.081006.347.418.3310.2911.7012.9015.0818.6419.6520.5921.8223.2925.1725.36 27.13468101214161820Time minb2224262830Figure 7 HPLC chromatogram of DZD.
