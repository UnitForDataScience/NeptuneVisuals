ac- cording to our data within each time series the transition from one steady state to the next generally retained a strong individual signature indicative of a rearrangement of the autochthonous microbial asset contribution of the individual microbial communities up to 96. nevertheless in each steady state-based tra- jectory we could identify a major change event three for subject 5006 in the microbial configuration associ- ated with a higher relative contribution of allochthonous microbial sources than indigenous ones median contri- bution of the individual microbial communities 10. these major events were variously distributed along the individual timelines but occurred on average after 340 days range 330-360 days of isolated confinement for subjects 5002 5004 and 5006.according to a random forests analysis the vast majority of steady state discriminatory otus belonged to the lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae families fig.

all steady states displayed significantly different inter-relationships from each other p  0.001. the taxonomic profiles for each steady state were gener- ated taking the median value of relative abundance for each otu in the samples being part of that steady state.within each subject the dynamics of formation of the microbiota steady states was assessed by estimating for each steady state except for the first one the percent- age of microbiota not deriving from the previous steady state using sourcetracker and then normalizing values by a z-score approach.

two previous milestone studies have investigated the normal temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers in their daily lives showing highly personalized microbial communities to be generally stable for months but quickly and profoundly perturbed in a strictly personalized way according to specific hu- man experiences  more recently researchers have highlighted substantial interaction and exchange over time between microbial communities of co-habiting humans - these results suggest the potential of sharing life to lead to convergent temporal dynamics of the gut microbial ecosystem paving the way to the pos- sibility of steering the microbiota trajectories by means of rational modulation of environmental factors.

besides shedding some light on the dynamic behavior of the intestinal microbial ecosystem under controlled confinement our findingson microbial ecology changes experienced by mars500 crewmembers should be considered in programming fu- ture isolation experiments or real space flights to help preserve the physical and psychological health of space- farers thus ensuring the mission accomplishment which is a critical issue in long-term manned interplanetary space flights.resultsstability of the individual gut microbiota profile in confined environmentthe intestinal microbial communities of the six crew- members of the mars500 project subject 5001 to 5006 were tracked over time during the 520 days of ground-based space simulation.

steady state discriminatory otus were identified using random forests their taxonomy is shown above each wiggum plotstates were identified for individuals 5002 and 5004 6 for 5001 5003 and 5005 and 7 for 5006. as already described for the individual microbial profiles the phylogenetic structures of steady states were largely dominated by firmicutes but retained a strong individual fingerprint in terms of taxonomic composition of the microbial commu- nities with variable percentages of bacteroidetes proteo- bacteria actinobacteria and verrucomicrobia members additional file figure s4.

formicigenerans otuid 181619 and coprococcus catus otuid 616283 were highly stable in the in- testinal microbiota of all crewmembers.identification of microbiota steady states and ecological succession in timetemporal dynamics of the gut microbiota were further in- vestigated for each crewmember by identifying microbial steady states and characterizing their ecological successionover time fig.

since the available information about the mission setup especially with regard to air module surfaces and water supply system leads to ex- clude the presence of factors that would favor sharing of microbes  we could extrapolate this sharing behav- ior to different confined environments other than the mars500 modules.to further investigate the gut microbiota dynamics in confined isolation we identified individual steady states which we define as subject-specific clusters of similar microbial configurations and evaluated their ecological succession over time providing a new inter- pretation of the temporal trajectories of the human gut microbiota.

a mutualistic configuration of the microbial ecosystem has a key role in metabolic homeostasis and in regulating the immune system thus contributing strongly to shaping our health in particular the microbial-derived short-chain fatty acids scfa mainly acetate propionate and butyr- ate can act both locally and systemically serving as en- ergy substrates or signaling molecules affecting satiety energy production and storage and exerting a number of anti-inflammatory effects  in this light there is growing and highly topical interest in understanding the multiple factors endogenous and environmental that in- correspondence  equal contributors1unit of microbial ecology of health department of pharmacy and biotechnology university of bologna bologna 40126 italyfull list of author information is available at the end of the articlefluence the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota with the intent to keep a health-promoting microbial arrangement along the course of our life c the authors.

box color is related to the dynamics of formation of the microbial structure of that steady state respect to the previous one by evaluating the contribution of the individual microbial heritage and possible allochthonous microorganisms.

as already observed in free-living subjects  even under isola- tion conditions steady states are formed mainly through relative abundance variations in autochthon- ous rather than allochthonous microbes indicative of dynamic microbiota responses of adaptive rather than innovative nature nevertheless for each crew- member it was possible to trace back a major change event in the microbial configuration with a large in- clusion of allochthonous microbial sources and not a mere rearrangement of indigenous ones.

however based on available data it is reasonable to assume thatthe diets were similar among astronauts across the mis- sion and thus unlikely to make a major contribution to the inter-individual differences in the gut microbial dynamics.notwithstanding the strong individuality the intestinal microbial communities of the six crewmembers shared14 otus all belonging to the firmicutes phylum and mainly to the lachnospiraceae family 9 otus additional file table s1 additional file figure s2.

ex- cept for 5006 whose microbiota was deeply unstable with steady states continuously alternating with one another the intestinal microbial communities of the other crew- members remained stable for periods lasting on average 2 months with steady states generally recurring one up to three times over the entire sampling period.

interestingly only for subjects 5004 and 5006 we observed a return to the initial microbiota configuration after exiting the mod- ule while new steady states were consolidated for the other crewmembers.steady state-based temporal dynamics of the crew- members differed from each other also for the microbial ecology of the establishment of a steady state compared to the previous one.

steady states that i showed significant correlations between samples within the group multiple testing using theq-value method and ii were statistically significantly different from each other permutational manova using the jsd matrix as input function adonis of the vegan package in r. we assumed that such clusters approximated steady states of each individual micro- biota as microbial configurations with precise values of taxon relative abundance and defined functional roles.

such studies would allow maximizing the impact of environmental factors on the individuality of the gut microbial ecosys- tem shedding light on the degree of resilience of the in- dividual gut microbiota profile and its pliable nature.
