The taxonomic profiles for each steady state were gener- ated taking the median value of relative abundance for each OTU in the samples being part of that steady state.Within each subject the dynamics of formation of the microbiota steady states was assessed by estimating for each steady state except for the first one the percent- age of microbiota not deriving from the previous steady state using SourceTracker and then normalizing values by a z-score approach.

Nevertheless in each steady state-based tra- jectory we could identify a major change event three for subject 5006 in the microbial configuration associ- ated with a higher relative contribution of allochthonous microbial sources than indigenous ones median contri- bution of the individual microbial communities 10.

Two previous milestone studies have investigated the normal temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota in healthy volunteers in their daily lives showing highly personalized microbial communities to be generally stable for months but quickly and profoundly perturbed in a strictly personalized way according to specific hu- man experiences  More recently researchers have highlighted substantial interaction and exchange over time between microbial communities of co-habiting humans - These results suggest the potential of sharing life to lead to convergent temporal dynamics of the gut microbial ecosystem paving the way to the pos- sibility of steering the microbiota trajectories by means of rational modulation of environmental factors.

Besides shedding some light on the dynamic behavior of the intestinal microbial ecosystem under controlled confinement our findingson microbial ecology changes experienced by MARS500 crewmembers should be considered in programming fu- ture isolation experiments or real space flights to help preserve the physical and psychological health of space- farers thus ensuring the mission accomplishment which is a critical issue in long-term manned interplanetary space flights.ResultsStability of the individual gut microbiota profile in confined environmentThe intestinal microbial communities of the six crew- members of the MARS500 project subject 5001 to 5006 were tracked over time during the 520 days of ground-based space simulation.

Box color is related to the dynamics of formation of the microbial structure of that steady state respect to the previous one by evaluating the contribution of the individual microbial heritage and possible allochthonous microorganisms.

As already described for the individual microbial profiles the phylogenetic structures of steady states were largely dominated by Firmicutes but retained a strong individual fingerprint in terms of taxonomic composition of the microbial commu- nities with variable percentages of Bacteroidetes Proteo- bacteria Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia members Additional file Figure S4.

Ac- cording to our data within each time series the transition from one steady state to the next generally retained a strong individual signature indicative of a rearrangement of the autochthonous microbial asset contribution of the individual microbial communities up to 96.

As already observed in free-living subjects  even under isola- tion conditions steady states are formed mainly through relative abundance variations in autochthon- ous rather than allochthonous microbes indicative of dynamic microbiota responses of adaptive rather than innovative nature Nevertheless for each crew- member it was possible to trace back a major change event in the microbial configuration with a large in- clusion of allochthonous microbial sources and not a mere rearrangement of indigenous ones.

formicigenerans OTUID 181619 and Coprococcus catus OTUID 616283 were highly stable in the in- testinal microbiota of all crewmembers.Identification of microbiota steady states and ecological succession in timeTemporal dynamics of the gut microbiota were further in- vestigated for each crewmember by identifying microbial steady states and characterizing their ecological successionover time Fig.

Ex- cept for 5006 whose microbiota was deeply unstable with steady states continuously alternating with one another the intestinal microbial communities of the other crew- members remained stable for periods lasting on average 2 months with steady states generally recurring one up to three times over the entire sampling period.
