body fluids previously considered mostly sterile eg amniotic fluid and milk have been shown to contain microbial dna suggesting they may support microbial communities or be in contact with tissue that does support a microbiota eg placenta and mammary tissue respectively.23 as knowledge regarding the various microbio- tas grows it is becoming evident that many are interconnected to varying extents and that characteristics of one can affect the characteristics of others.4 for example the newly discovered1 research department american college of obstetricians and gynecolo- gists washington dc usa2 nutrition laboratory conservation ecology center smithsonian conser-vation biology institute washington dc usa3 department of obstetrics and gynecology university of washington school of medicine seattle wa usacorresponding authormichael l. power research department american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 409 12th st sw washington dc 20024 usa.email placental microbiota shares many microbial taxa with the maternal oral microbiota5 and in mice it has been demon- strated that members of the oral microbiota can reach the pla- centa through hematogenous transmission.6 the milk microbiota contains species from the maternal gut microbiota.37the term microbiome technically refers to the totality of the expressed genetics of the microbiota1 although it is sometimes loosely used to refer to the structure of the microbial commu- nity as well.

these data suggest that typical markers of bv might not be as accurate as once considered given that asymptomatic patients exhibit such var- ied microbial profiles.39table 1. suggested clustering of vaginal microbiota into five types based on the dominant species.there also appears to be a dramatic and lasting change in the vaginal microbiota after parturition with a substantial decreasemicrobial communitynumber ofmicrobial taxa dominant speciesmean vaginal phin lactobacillus and an increase in the overall diversity of the vaginal microbiota.4345 this change in microbial community occurred regardless of the pregnancy microbiota composition45104lactobacillus crispatus4.0  0.325lactobacillus gasseri5.0  0.7135lactobacillus iners4.4  0.6108diverse non-lactobacillus5.3  0.6 species21lactobacillus jensenii4.7  0.4aadapted from ravel et al.34some researchers have attempted to cluster vaginal microbial communities into community state types csts.

for example a 16s rrna sequence study considered the effect of preexisting obesity and gestational weight gainon the makeup of the placental microbiota and showed that excessive maternal weight gain but not preexisting obesity alters the placental microbiota in cases of preterm but not term parturition.85researchers believe that the placental microbiome may play a role in colonizing the infant gut microbiome if the placental bacteria are able to enter amniotic fluid and be swallowed by the infant.6782 variation in the gut microbiome of infants of differing gestation lengths suggests that in utero colonization via placental bacteria may be an ongoing process throughout gestation.82 in a study of 2 births 1 vaginal and 1 cesarean section the microbiota of the first feces from the neonates more closely resembled the placental microbiota compared to the maternal vaginal microbiota.80one caution regarding the evidence for a placenta micro- biome the fact that bacteria can travel to the placenta and take up residence is not proof that there is a naturally occurring stable placental microbial community.

in some healthy women the microbial makeup of the vaginal microbiota can change rapidly and dramatically without leading to disease.37 although the microbial structure changed over time in terms of taxa the authors suggested that the inherent functions of the microbiome eg production of lactic acid may have varied less an example of the microbiota being more variable than the microbiome.

microbes certainly get into breast milk and the evidence is suggestive that maternal mechanisms exist to transport microbes into milk from other maternal micro- biota but the milk microbiota may not be a true microbial com- munity analogous to the vaginal or gut microbiotas.one possibility is that the microbial content of milk serves as a signal to the mammary gland providing information regarding the maternal microbiomes the infant microbiomes and even the microbial content of the external environment.

interestingly the vaginal microbiota appears to undergo consistent changes during pregnancy with a decrease in both microbial diversity and richness35364350 sug- gesting the possibility of regulated changes to the vaginal microbiota prior to parturition.

thus the vaginal microbiome properly refers to the suite of expressed genes from the vaginal microbiota but in common parlance the distinction is often not made and the vaginal microbiome is used to refer to the vaginal microbial community as well as to the expressed microbial genome.

are these microbial communities stable coe- volved elements of female reproductive health or do they represent the ubiquity of microbes such that microbial inva- sions will always occur at a low level but that the normal condition is for the upper reproductive tract including pla- centa to be relatively sterilewith our increased understanding of the importance of the various microbiomes to human health and well-being has come well-intentioned therapies to adjust supposed dysbiosis back to a healthy microbiota.

for example malnutrition in twins studied in malawi has been linked to differences in the gut microbiome which affected digestive and absorptive efficiency and even affected the krebs cycle.11 the range of benefits conferred to the host by the various micro- biomes include defense against pathogens microbial gene products for use by the host and products of microbial meta- bolism eg fatty acids and vitamins.providing resistance to pathogenic microbial colonization is a prime benefit of a healthy microbiome.

microbes of one microbiota appear to have the possibility of spreading to others sometimes with no ill effects but other times spreading patho- gens or even commensals of one microbiota that can be patho- genic in another.

about one-fourth of women who are of reproductive age and display no symptoms of bv have low levels of lactobacillus the typical biomarker of bv and a vaginal ph higher than 4.5.34 a study of asymptomatic south african women found that only 37 had a cervicovaginal microbiota dominated by lactobacillus.38interestingly the vaginal communities with few if any lactobacillus species contained high proportions of other lactic acid-producing species eg atopobium and megasphaera suggesting that the production of lactic acid is an important conserved element of the human vaginal microbiome3940 a possible example of microbiota differences that are greater than the microbiome differences.

however the community with low levels of lactobacillus species generally produces a slightly higher vaginal ph table 1 leading to asymptomatic women with that vaginal microbiota type being at risk of a false- positive diagnosis of bv by amsel and nugent criteria.stability of the vaginal microbiota also varies among healthy women.

for example ravel and colleagues identified 5 different types of vaginal csts 4 types i ii ii and v in table 1 dominated by lactic acid-producing species in the genus lactobacillus and one com- munity type iv with low proportions of lactobacillus and high proportions of anaerobic species from a number of different genera eg atopobium megasphaera prevotella and sneathia table 1.34 women of european and asian ancestry are more likely to have a vaginal microbiota dominated by lactobacillus eg types i ii iii and v while hispanic and african american women are more likely to have a type iv vaginal microbiota.34 a more recent study with a larger sample size found the same general pattern between african american and white women but also detected 2 other vaginal microbiota types one domi- nated by gardnerella vaginalis and the other by bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 1 bvab1 both of which were more common among african american women.41other researchers have cautioned that there is a lack of consensus regarding defining csts and in their interpretation.

for example an increase in lactobacillus species appears to be a common finding dur- ing pregnancy.43 although nonpregnant hispanic women in the united states were found to be less likely to have a lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota 98 of preg- nant mexican women had lactobacillus in their vaginal microbiota.44 although the vaginal microbiota appears to be generally more stable during pregnancy in some women transitions between csts appear common.43and was sustained for up to 1 year postpartum.43there is a rapid decrease in circulating estrogen in women immediately postpartum which will be sustained during lacta- tion.

a small study found that the intestinal microbiota of vaginally born infants but not those born by cesarean section differed between those born to obese mothers and normal weight mothers.59 nonetheless even after accounting for these other inputs many studies have found mode of delivery to be a significant factor at least in early life.545558 caution is warranted however given that many of these studies have had small sample sizes especially for babies born by cesarean section and that the effect of other maternal factors eg pregnancy complications on the inocula- tion of neonates are not completely understood.a recent pilot study attempted to restore the microbiota of cesarean section-delivered infants to the vaginal delivery state by swabbing them with maternal vaginal fluids after birth.60 thirty days after birth swabbed cesarean section-delivered infant microbiotas were similar to those of vaginally delivered infants suggesting the promising use of vaginal swabs in inoculating infants with the appropriate microbiota.60 in this study mothers with sexually transmitted diseases including group b streptococcus infection bv or signs of viral disease were excluded.
