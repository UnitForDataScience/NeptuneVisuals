Body fluids previously considered mostly sterile eg amniotic fluid and milk have been shown to contain microbial DNA suggesting they may support microbial communities or be in contact with tissue that does support a microbiota eg placenta and mammary tissue respectively.23 As knowledge regarding the various microbio- tas grows it is becoming evident that many are interconnected to varying extents and that characteristics of one can affect the characteristics of others.4 For example the newly discovered1 Research Department American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo- gists Washington DC USA2 Nutrition Laboratory Conservation Ecology Center Smithsonian Conser-vation Biology Institute Washington DC USA3 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology University of Washington School of Medicine Seattle WA USACorresponding AuthorMichael L.

For example an increase in Lactobacillus species appears to be a common finding dur- ing pregnancy.43 Although nonpregnant Hispanic women in the United States were found to be less likely to have a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota 98 of preg- nant Mexican women had Lactobacillus in their vaginal microbiota.44 Although the vaginal microbiota appears to be generally more stable during pregnancy in some women transitions between CSTs appear common.43and was sustained for up to 1 year postpartum.43There is a rapid decrease in circulating estrogen in women immediately postpartum which will be sustained during lacta- tion.

For example a 16S rRNA sequence study considered the effect of preexisting obesity and gestational weight gainon the makeup of the placental microbiota and showed that excessive maternal weight gain but not preexisting obesity alters the placental microbiota in cases of preterm but not term parturition.85Researchers believe that the placental microbiome may play a role in colonizing the infant gut microbiome if the placental bacteria are able to enter amniotic fluid and be swallowed by the infant.6782 Variation in the gut microbiome of infants of differing gestation lengths suggests that in utero colonization via placental bacteria may be an ongoing process throughout gestation.82 In a study of 2 births 1 vaginal and 1 cesarean section the microbiota of the first feces from the neonates more closely resembled the placental microbiota compared to the maternal vaginal microbiota.80One caution regarding the evidence for a placenta micro- biome the fact that bacteria can travel to the placenta and take up residence is not proof that there is a naturally occurring stable placental microbial community.

In some healthy women the microbial makeup of the vaginal microbiota can change rapidly and dramatically without leading to disease.37 Although the microbial structure changed over time in terms of taxa the authors suggested that the inherent functions of the microbiome eg production of lactic acid may have varied less an example of the microbiota being more variable than the microbiome.

Microbes certainly get into breast milk and the evidence is suggestive that maternal mechanisms exist to transport microbes into milk from other maternal micro- biota but the milk microbiota may not be a true microbial com- munity analogous to the vaginal or gut microbiotas.One possibility is that the microbial content of milk serves as a signal to the mammary gland providing information regarding the maternal microbiomes the infant microbiomes and even the microbial content of the external environment.

About one-fourth of women who are of reproductive age and display no symptoms of BV have low levels of Lactobacillus the typical biomarker of BV and a vaginal pH higher than 4.5.34 A study of asymptomatic South African women found that only 37 had a cervicovaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus.38Interestingly the vaginal communities with few if any Lactobacillus species contained high proportions of other lactic acid-producing species eg Atopobium and Megasphaera suggesting that the production of lactic acid is an important conserved element of the human vaginal microbiome3940 a possible example of microbiota differences that are greater than the microbiome differences.

For example Ravel and colleagues identified 5 different types of vaginal CSTs 4 types I II II and V in Table 1 dominated by lactic acid-producing species in the genus Lactobacillus and one com- munity type IV with low proportions of Lactobacillus and high proportions of anaerobic species from a number of different genera eg Atopobium Megasphaera Prevotella and Sneathia Table 1.34 Women of European and Asian ancestry are more likely to have a vaginal microbiota dominated by Lactobacillus eg types I II III and V while Hispanic and African American women are more likely to have a type IV vaginal microbiota.34 A more recent study with a larger sample size found the same general pattern between African American and white women but also detected 2 other vaginal microbiota types one domi- nated by Gardnerella vaginalis and the other by bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 1 BVAB1 both of which were more common among African American women.41Other researchers have cautioned that there is a lack of consensus regarding defining CSTs and in their interpretation.

However the community with low levels of Lactobacillus species generally produces a slightly higher vaginal pH Table 1 leading to asymptomatic women with that vaginal microbiota type being at risk of a false- positive diagnosis of BV by Amsel and Nugent criteria.Stability of the vaginal microbiota also varies among healthy women.

Often used characteristics as part of BV diagnosis are a vaginal pH greater than 4.5 one aspect of the Amsel criteria32 and a low prevalence of Lactobacillus species among the vaginal microbiota Nugent criteria.33 However both of these characteristics have been shown to exist in asymptomatic healthy women especially among women of African descent and of Hispanic origin34 contributing to the confusion and uncertainty regarding BV in different populations.29The vaginal microbial community serves many purposes including maintaining a healthy vaginal pH and resisting inva- sion by noncommensal microbes.
