The current study confirmed that feeding an HC diet to lactating dairy goats significantly increases total SCFA and free LPS concentration in the lumen of the hindgut indicating the impairment of fermentation and dysbiosis in the hindgut of goats.The alterations in the bacterial community in ruminal and hindgut digesta and their adaptation to different dietary regimens have been widely reported in ruminants that were fed an HC diet for a short period Metzler-Zebeli et al.

Therefore the current study aimed to investigate the changes in fermented products and toxic compounds microbiome metabolomics and mucosal status of the hindgut of lactating goats fed with an HC diet over a short or long period.Abbreviations LC low concentrate HC high-concentrate HS high concentrate short-term HL high concentrate short-term LPS lipopolysaccharide VFA volatile fatty acid TJ tight junction SARA subacute ruminal acidosis SCFA short-chain fatty acid VIP variable importance in the projection ACE abundance-based coverage estimator OTU operational taxonomic unit RT- qPCR real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction SOD superoxide dismutase GPX glutathione peroxidase MDA malondialdehyde T-AOC total antioxidant capacity TLR4 toll-like receptor 4 MYD88 myeloid differentiating factor 88 TNF-a tumor necrosis factor alpha IL-1b interleukin-1 beta IL- 10 interleukin-10 NHE NaH hydrogen exchanger MCT monocarboxylate transporter.RESULTSHigh-Concentrate Diet Induced Changes in SCFA and LPS Content in Hindgut DigestaAs shown in Table 1 compared with the LC group the HS and HL groups contained significantly higher free LPS concentrations in the colonic digesta P  0.05.

The increase in the percentage of Prevotella in the colonic digesta of the goats fed with an HC diet was consistent with the increase in the starch content of the hindgut digesta of the goats fed with an HC diet.

The results of the unweighted UniFrac PCoA and AMOVA further revealed the difference in bacterial community composition between the control and the HC groups and showed that feeding an HC diet altered the composition of the bacterial community in the hindgut digesta.

Our results indicate that an HC diet induces microbiota dysbiosis metabolic disorders and mucosal damage in the hindgut of goats.Keywords microbiome metabolome high-concentrate diet host health hindgut goatsINTRODUCTIONTo meet the required energy intake for high milk production a common strategy is to feed a large amount of dietary grain or easily degradable dietary byproducts to lactating dairy cows.

In general this study provides a comprehensive picture of the biochemical and microbial function in the hindgut of ruminants fed with an HC diet and elucidates the etiology of metabolic disorders occurring in the hindgut.

81764. doi Studies on the effect of a high-concentrate HC diet on the hindgut microbiota and metabolome of ruminants are rarely reported.

These results imply that the HC diet could induce inflammation in the cecal mucosa.CONCLUSIONThis study revealed that feeding an HC diet to lactating goats alters fermentation pattern bacterial dysbiosis and metabolicperturbations.

We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA genes and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to evaluate the effects of long-term feeding HL or short-term HS feeding of an HC diet on changes in bacterial microbiota and their metabolites in the hindgut with Guanzhong goat as a ruminant model.

Results indicated that an HC diet decreased bacterial diversity and induced metabolic disorder in the hindgut.
