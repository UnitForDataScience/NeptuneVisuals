Viremic patients on the other hand har- bored a microbiome that was enriched with Actionobacteria when compared to patients with undetectable HIV RNA.

Future research is needed to further elucidate these findings to gain a deeper insight into host-microbiota interactions and to develop novel therapeutic strategies.Keywords HIV intestinal microbiota gut microbiome-host homeostasis dysbiosis bacterial richness bacterial translocation chronic immune activation inflammation immune recovery probioticsAbbreviations AA arachidonic acid ART antiretroviral therapy BR bilirubin BV biliverdin Dol-b-G dolichol-b-D-glucosyl phosphate Dol-P dolichol phosphate ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate GALT gut associated lymphoid tissue GIT gastro- intestinal tract HIV human immunodeficiency virus Hs-CRP high sensitivity C-reactive protein INR immune non-responder IR immune responder LBP lipopolysaccharide-binding protein LPS lipopolysaccharide LTB4 leukotriene B4 MeSH medical subject headings MSM men having sex with men Neu5Ac N-acetylneuraminic acid SIV simian immunodeficiency virusTh T helper type UGT uridine glucuronyl transferases URO urobilinogen VU viremic untreated patientsIntroductionHIV infection and clinical manifestations within the gas- trointestinal tractHuman immunodeficiency virus HIV-infected patients are known to suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms even under effective antiretroviral therapy ART.

Long-term consequences of this HIV infection- induced scenario are chronic inflammation with chronic immune activation finally leading to the exhaustion of the immune system thereby raising morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients 7 8 19-21.The gut microbiome in HIV infectionThe human gut microbiota is composed of the following four main phyla Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Actinobacte- ria and Proteobacteria 22.

further analyzed b diversity changes in elite controllers defined as patients with undetectable HIV RNA since the diagnosis of HIV infection.

The relative abundances of respective phyla vary depending on a plethora of factors such as socioeconomic factors age geography diet and exercise besides others 23-25.Previous studies revealed that HIV infection also has an impact on the gut microbiome composition given that HIV infection was associated with increased bacterial populations in the intestinal tract that are either pro-in- flammatory and hence potentially pathogenic and whose abundance correlated with immune status and immune recovery 7 8 19.The here presented systematic literature review aims at portraying the most recent studies addressing the impact of HIV infection on changes in the balanced gut microbi- ome composition.

The search terms were therefore united as follows- HIV gut microbiome MeSH Terms OR HIV gut mi- crobiome TitleTo cover all relevant articles and to assure that no study was left out synonyms of the keywords HIV gut micro-European Journal of Microbiology and Immunology160A.

After a thorough assessment 6 studies were excluded as for the following reasonsFirstly studies that did not mention or took into con- sideration the exclusion criteria of patients with a medical history of inflammatory bowel disease or other intestinal inflammatory disorders b chronic or acute medical con- ditions such as cancer diabetes or hepatitis c antibiotic treatment 2 months prior to study conduction and d recent immunosuppressive therapy immune modulators or pro- biotics were excluded n  2 due to the potential impact of respective factors on the gut microbiome composition.Secondly studies that only analyzed blood samples were also excluded since the focus was rather on systemic effects of microbial translocation and on assessment of defined biochemical markers than on the link to the gas- trointestinal tract and the potential changes of the gut mi- crobiome itself n  3.Thirdly one study which analyzed colon biopsies was excluded due to its detailed focus on the pathophysiologic processes involving CD1c and CD1c- myeloid dendritic cells and not on the host-microbiome interaction and the impact of the gut microbiome in HIV-infected patients n  1.Finally the numbers of studies screened assessed for eli- gibility and included in the review were narrowed down to 5.Data extractionAll relevant information derived from the articles was ex- tracted and sorted in columns using a table in Microsoft Word with the following criteria study details study type study population type of sample analyzed microbiome analysis applied technique and main findings.

These patients displayed lower inter-individual variation compared to viremic patients.
