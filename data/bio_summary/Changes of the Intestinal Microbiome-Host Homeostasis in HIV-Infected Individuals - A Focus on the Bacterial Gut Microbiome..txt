long-term consequences of this hiv infection- induced scenario are chronic inflammation with chronic immune activation finally leading to the exhaustion of the immune system thereby raising morbidity and mortality in hiv-infected patients 7 8 19-21.the gut microbiome in hiv infectionthe human gut microbiota is composed of the following four main phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacte- ria and proteobacteria 22. the relative abundances of respective phyla vary depending on a plethora of factors such as socioeconomic factors age geography diet and exercise besides others 23-25.previous studies revealed that hiv infection also has an impact on the gut microbiome composition given that hiv infection was associated with increased bacterial populations in the intestinal tract that are either pro-in- flammatory and hence potentially pathogenic and whose abundance correlated with immune status and immune recovery 7 8 19.the here presented systematic literature review aims at portraying the most recent studies addressing the impact of hiv infection on changes in the balanced gut microbi- ome composition.
