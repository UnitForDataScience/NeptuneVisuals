S. mitis made up roughly 23 of each subject's streptococcal isolates and isolates of S. salivarius and S. vestibularis including those designated S. salivariusvestibularis see Materials and Methods for the definition of this designation made up roughly 30.

S. anginosus S. gordonii and S. tigurinus were isolated only from subject 1 as predicted by HOMIM analysis  but HOMIM data neither supported nor contradicted the subject-specific recovery of most other streptococcal isolates.

Thus the condition of Rothia cells within high- biomass regions appears to be different from that of isolated cells and of cells associated with small multispecies aggregates.FIG 2 a Immunofluorescence localization of Haemophilus and associated cells in undisturbed biofilms from subject 1.

However isolates of these species participate in high numbers of mechanistically distinct coaggregations the S. australis isolates bear RPS whereas the S. infantis strains bear adhesins.

Within each subject streptococci made up roughly 70 of all isolates and RSs 81 of 115 isolates and 34 of 48 RSs in subject 1 87 of 129 isolates and 49 of 71 RSs in subject 2. summarizes data on the streptococcal isolates.

Found on strains of S. oralis S. sanguinis and S. gordonii the polymers are hexa- or heptasaccha- ride repeats that contain a host-like disaccharide motif namely either Gal31-3GalNAc the G motif or GalNAc31-3Gal the Gn motif.

Fructans of cariogenic S. mutans have ecological relevance as extracellular carbon storage products   and the commensal streptococcal spe- cies S. gordonii and S. sanguinis are predicted by the CAZy database   to have cell surface fructosidases.

only two of the four could have been identified in situ.In 4-h biofilms from subject 1 cells reactive with anti-Rm were seen in tight association with other cells and in clusters containing as few as three cells including those reactive with anti-RPS4 .

For example 4 isolates of S. infantis HOT 638 were obtained from subject 2 which displayed 2 distinct REP-PCR patterns with 2 isolates falling into each pattern.
