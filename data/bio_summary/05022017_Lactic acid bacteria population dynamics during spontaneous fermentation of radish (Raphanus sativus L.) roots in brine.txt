pro- duction of lactic acid may be assigned to homofermenta- tive metabolism by lactic acid bacteria and accumulation of acetic acid and ethanol to heterofermentative catabolism by lactic acid bacteria as well as yeasts.the structure and dynamics of the lactic acid bacteria microcommunity was monitored with rapd and rep-pcr an approach commonly applied in similar studies.

during fermentation at 30 degc glucose ranged from 3.49 to 3.95 mm during the first 5 days reduced to 0.17 mm in day 7 and was not detected in day 11. fructose ranged from 0.65 to1.29 during the first 5 days and was not detected in days 7 and 11. lactic acid acetic acid and ethanol were the metabolites detected table  at the end of fermenta- tion at 20 degc they reached 42.01 5.02 and 16.18 mm respectively while at the end of fermentation at 30 degc they reached 38.78 3.29 and 18.39 mm respectively.

therefore the aim of the present study was to monitor the microbial population dynamics during spontaneous fermentation of radish roots in brine at 20 and 30 degc and to taxonomically characterize the dominating lactic acid microbiota.materials and methodspickle preparation and samplingfermentation of radish r. sativus l. roots was performed according to a traditional recipe currently employed in southern attica.

all analyses were per- formed in duplicate and the average values are presented.isolation and identification of lactic acid bacterialactic acid bacteria were isolated throughout fermentation with the exception of days 0 and 1. selection of the colo- nies was performed according to the representative sam- pling scheme of harrigan and mccance  purifica- tion was performed by successive sub-culturing on mrs agar and incubation at 30 degc for 48 h. gram stain and cata- lase reactions were performed for confirmation.clustering of the lab was performed by ran- dom amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chainreaction rapd-pcr with m13 as primer and repeti- tive sequence-based pcr rep-pcr with gtg5 as primer as described by paramithiotis et al.

lactic acid bacteria population was detectable from the third and first day of fermentation and increased until the seventh and third day of fermentation at 20 and 30 degc respectively reach- ing approximately 7.70 log cfuml in both cases.

at higher fermentation temperature 30 degc faster reduction of the ph value and development of acidity were observed most likely due to the faster development of the lactic acid microbiota which concomitantly resulted in faster reduction of pseudomonads enterobacteriaceae and yeastsmolds population.

the surface was covered with olive oil and the mixture left to ferment at 20 degc and at 30 degc for 17 and 11 days respectively.

thus brine samples were analyzed at days 0 1 3 5 7 11 15 and 17 in the case of 20 degc and 0 1 3 5 7 and 11 in the case of 30 degc.

indeed during the third and fifth days of fermentation at 30 degc the ph value was significantly p  0.05 lower than the respective at 20 degc table .
