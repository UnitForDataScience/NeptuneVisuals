Total aerobic mesophilic count yeastsmolds enterococci pseudomonads and St. aureus determination was carried out by spreading 0.1 mL of the diluted sample to the surface of Plate Count Agar LAB M Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol Agar LAB M Kana- mycin Aesculin Azide Agar LAB M Pseudomonas Agar base supplemented with Cephalothin Fucidin and Cetrim- ide LAB M and Baird-Parker selective agar LAB M and incubating at 30 degC for 48 h 25 degC for 5 days 35 degC for 3days 25 degC for 48 h and 35 degC for 24-48 h respectively.The enumeration limit was 2 log CFUmL.

The surface was covered with olive oil and the mixture left to ferment at 20 degC and at 30 degC for 17 and 11 days respectively.

Thus brine samples were analyzed at days 0 1 3 5 7 11 15 and 17 in the case of 20 degC and 0 1 3 5 7 and 11 in the case of 30 degC.

Indeed during the third and fifth days of fermentation at 30 degC the pH value was significantly P  0.05 lower than the respective at 20 degC Table .

Lactic acid acetic acid and ethanol were the metabolites detected Table  at the end of fermenta- tion at 20 degC they reached 42.01 5.02 and 16.18 mM respectively while at the end of fermentation at 30 degC they reached 38.78 3.29 and 18.39 mM respectively.

Thus the ambient temperatures in which the fermen- tation takes place may extend from 20 to more than 30 degC.
