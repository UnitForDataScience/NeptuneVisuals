The produced amount of methane per g of solubilized COD was in both methane stages slightly above the theo- retical maximum of 350 ml gCOD-1 due to small particles that re- mained in the collected high strength liquor from the acidification.In addition and in comparison to the control system we observed in the heat-shock system a reduced methane formation in the acidificationFig.

Values for samples from the control system without heat shocks are shown in B and D. All samples were analysed as duplicates.microbial composition but only transient modifications indicates that the mesophilic microbiomes from anaerobic digesters exhibit high re- silience against heat shocks while being more sensitive to pH changes.

Besides thermal tolerance anaerobic microbiomes tend to be robust and adaptable to extreme conditions including high ammonia levels  or high salinity  Corresponding author at Institute for Integrative Systems Biology I2SysBio Paterna Valencia Spain.E-mail address M.

Produced methane as well as conversion efficiency of solubilized COD for acidification and methane stages is summarized for different time intervals d1-d21 day 1-21 d22-d42 day 22-42 B.

Compared to the methane stage only low levels of methane were formed in the acidification stage of both reactor systems.

In the acidification stage with 55 degC heat shocks 67 less methane was formed than in the un-heated control.

Values for samples from the experiment with 55 degC heat shocks are shown in A and C corresponds to the 70 degC heat shocks.

Very likely this is due to heterogeneity of the used substrate.The high conversion of solubilized COD indicates that methanation was not inhibited in both methane stages heat shock system and control system B.

In the experi- ment with 70 degC it was 40 less methane compared to the control C.Therefore the reduction of methanogenic contaminations from the seed sludge in the acidification stage associated to heat treatments could help to separate acidification from methanation more efficiently in order to prevent loss of methane.Post heat-shock transient microbial communityFor each acidification cycle samples for 16S-rRNA high throughput sequencing were taken at the second and last day .

The produced high strength liquor from the acidification stage from the first system was regularly exposed to heat shocks.Heat shocks and samplingAn overview about heat shock regimes is given in .
