This mini-review gives an overview of the beneficial effects reported for L. lactis the mucus composition and function the different surface proteins discovered in L. lactis and involved in muco-adhesion and the different complementary approaches and tools used to uncover their role.BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF LACTOCOCCI IN THE GITThe main beneficial effects reported for natural or recombinantL.

These three proteins have different structures  with three MucBP domains in MbpL protein from dairy L. lactis BGKP1   two Mub domains in Muc protein from vegetal L. lactis TIL448   and one MucBP domain in AJ8907570 protein from dairyL.

Until now three different gene clusters specifying sortase-dependent heterotrimeric pili have been identified in several L. lactis strains one chromosomal present in all L. lactis strains   and two plasmid-encoded others in plant   and dairy   strains respectively.

Pili were also visualized by electron microcopy in four other L. lactis plant or clinical natural isolates but the genes involved in their synthesis were not identified  .Aggregation Factor AggLA plasmid-encoded aggregation factor AggL was characterized in L. lactis BGKP1.
