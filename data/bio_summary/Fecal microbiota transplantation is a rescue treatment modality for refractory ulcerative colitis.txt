the remaining 7 patients preferred to have their family members such as mother partner and brother as a donor donor d. three recipients received fmt from donor a for a second time because of failure of the first fmt.outcomesclinical remission and response rates were calculated for all subjects at week 12. when the uc patients were categorized into the 2 groups according to the response status as nonresponder and responder groups there was no significant difference between groups before fmt concerning the baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of subjects with uc 2. the clinical response was observed in 21 patients with uc 70. in the responder group while 13 43.3 patients achieved clinical and endoscopic remission at week 12 8 patients 26.7 met thecriteria of clinical response according to mayo score 30 and3 points decrease from baseline.

clinical remission was considered as a mayo score 2 points and complete mucosal healing mayo endoscopy subscore 1. patients with uc who have achieved clinical remission were also included in the analysis of clinical response.

there was no association between clinical response and these potential impact factors p .05 for all parameters.when fmt success rate was evaluated according to donors the rate of clinical and endoscopic remission was 50 612 for donor a 42.9 37 for donor b 25 14 for donor c and 42.9 37 for donor d p .05. the rate of clinical response was 66.7 812 for donor a 57.2 47 for donor b 75 34 for donor c and 83.8 67 for donor d p .05 2.esr  erythrocyte sedimentation rate fmt  fecal microbiota transplantation hgb  hemoglobin hs-crp  high-sensitive c-reactive protein wbc  white blood cells.there was no significant difference among donors concerningfigure 1. changes of laboratory parameters after fmt in responder and nonresponder groups.

to date 3 previous random- ized clinical trials with contradictory results were carried out toboth the rate of clinical remission and clinical response p .05 for all results.safety and tolerability of fmtno adverse events were observed in the majority of patients during fmt and 12 weeks follow-up.

in a systematic review and meta- analysis sun et alreported that the rate of clinical remission in patients with uc was 30.4. from the data of another recent meta-analysis shi et alshowed that 40.5 patients with uc achieved clinical remission and 66.1 achieved clinical response.

nine patients 30 were accepted as a nonresponder at the end of the week 12. after 12weeks while mean hs-crp sedimentation and hemoglobin levels were found to be improved significantly compared with the levels before fmt p .001 p .022 and p .007 respectively white blood cell wbc did not show a significant change p .05 3. improvements in hs-crp after fmt were higher in the responder group than in the nonresponder group p .038 but there was no significant difference between nonresponder and responder groups regarding improvement in sedimentation and hemoglobin levels p .05 for both 1. in addition we analyzed the correlation between clinical response and clinicalthe clinical characteristics of study population.parametersresultspatientstotal number30age m -sd range34.6 - 10.3 19-58sex male  n46.7 14smoking  n3.3 1disease duration y m-sd range5.3 - 3.3 2-18 disease severitysevere disease  n66.7 20moderate disease  n33.3 10 disease extentpancolitis  n50 15left-sided colitis  n50 15 medicationsmesalazine  n100 30steroid  n100 30azathioprine  n100 30anti-tnf  n76.7 23donorstotal number relatives10 7age m -sd range25.3 - 4.3 20-33sex male  n90 9tnf  tumor necrosis factor.

of patients with uc 76.6 2330 were willing to undergo fmt for uc treatment again regardless of response status in the next time.discussionin this prospective and uncontrolled study we showed that 43.3 of patients with refractory uc achieved clinical endoscopic and laboratory remission and 26.7 achieved a clinical response at the end of the week 12 after fmt.

multiple infusions of fmt may increase the rate of clinical remission especially in patients with clinical response and early recurrences.

therefore we speculate that the fever after fmt may be a good predictor of clinical remission.changes in the laboratory parameters are worth deliberating because they show a strong correlation with disease activity severity and treatment response.laboratory parameters including crp sedimentation wbc and hemoglobin levels are as important as clinical parameters such as rectal bleeding stool frequency and endoscopic findings in the global assessment of uc.

consistent with our results zhang et alreported that crp levels are not able to predict the immediate clinical efficacy but crp significantly reduced 3 months after fmt in patients who have achieved clinical response.

therefore we recommend that more evidence from long-term and randomized controlled clinical studies examining donor and recipient microbiota composition are needed for the use of fmt in clinical practice.referencesloftus evjr.

the aim of the present study was to prospectively investigate the fmt efficacy by assessing the clinical and endoscopic response in patients with uc who had failed anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapy including inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor tnf.

all authors had access to the study data and had reviewed and approved the final manuscript.study populationin the present study patients were recruited among 30 individuals who were satisfying the diagnosis of uc criteria according to the confirmation of typical clinical radiological endoscopic and histopathological findings.

clinical response at week 12 was considered as a decrease in the mayo score 30 and 3 points when compared with baseline score.
