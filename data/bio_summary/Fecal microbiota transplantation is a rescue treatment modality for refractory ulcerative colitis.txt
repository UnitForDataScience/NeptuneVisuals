To date 3 previous random- ized clinical trials with contradictory results were carried out toboth the rate of clinical remission and clinical response P .05 for all results.Safety and tolerability of FMTNo adverse events were observed in the majority of patients during FMT and 12 weeks follow-up.

Patients with UC who have achieved clinical remission were also included in the analysis of clinical response.

In the responder group while 13 43.3 patients achieved clinical and endoscopic remission at week 12 8 patients 26.7 met thecriteria of clinical response according to Mayo score 30 and3 points decrease from baseline.

In addition we analyzed the correlation between clinical response and clinicalThe clinical characteristics of study population.ParametersResultsPatientsTotal number30Age m -SD range34.6 - 10.3 19-58Sex male  n46.7 14Smoking  n3.3 1Disease duration y m-SD range5.3 - 3.3 2-18 Disease severitySevere disease  n66.7 20Moderate disease  n33.3 10 Disease extentPancolitis  n50 15Left-sided colitis  n50 15 MedicationsMesalazine  n100 30Steroid  n100 30Azathioprine  n100 30Anti-TNF  n76.7 23DonorsTotal number relatives10 7Age m -SD range25.3 - 4.3 20-33Sex male  n90 9TNF  tumor necrosis factor.

There was no association between clinical response and these potential impact factors P .05 for all parameters.When FMT success rate was evaluated according to donors the rate of clinical and endoscopic remission was 50 612 for donor A 42.9 37 for donor B 25 14 for donor C and 42.9 37 for donor D P .05.

Of patients with UC 76.6 2330 were willing to undergo FMT for UC treatment again regardless of response status in the next time.DiscussionIn this prospective and uncontrolled study we showed that 43.3 of patients with refractory UC achieved clinical endoscopic and laboratory remission and 26.7 achieved a clinical response at the end of the week 12 after FMT.

From the data of another recent meta-analysis Shi et alshowed that 40.5 patients with UC achieved clinical remission and 66.1 achieved clinical response.

Multiple infusions of FMT may increase the rate of clinical remission especially in patients with clinical response and early recurrences.

Therefore we speculate that the fever after FMT may be a good predictor of clinical remission.Changes in the laboratory parameters are worth deliberating because they show a strong correlation with disease activity severity and treatment response.Laboratory parameters including CRP sedimentation WBC and hemoglobin levels are as important as clinical parameters such as rectal bleeding stool frequency and endoscopic findings in the global assessment of UC.

Consistent with our results Zhang et alreported that CRP levels are not able to predict the immediate clinical efficacy but CRP significantly reduced 3 months after FMT in patients who have achieved clinical response.
