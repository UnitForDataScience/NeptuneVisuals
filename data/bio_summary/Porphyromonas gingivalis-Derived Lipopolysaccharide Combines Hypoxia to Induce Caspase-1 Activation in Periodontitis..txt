The assumption may be further verified byusing germ-free mice which supplies an ideal model to study the synergistic effects of E. coli LPS and P. gingivalis LPS.CONCLUSIONIn periodontitis hypoxia is a propelling factor of P. gingivalis LPS in activating caspase-1 cascade.

It was concluded that E. coli LPS induced a hypoxic phase which is a combing pathological factor of P. gingivalis LPS in caspase-1 activating and IL-1b maturation in periodontal inflammation.Keywords Porphyromonas gingivalis Escherichia coli hypoxia caspase-1 IL-1bINTRODUCTIONPeriodontitis is defined as chronic inflammation of tooth supporting tissues.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Porphyromonas gingivalis P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides LPS and Escherichia coli E. coli LPS in inducing caspase-1 activation in normoxic or hypoxic phases.

Although clinical evidence and research support P. gingivalis as a key periodontal pathogen we speculated that hypoxia can be involved in periodontal cell death process.The Synergistic Effects of LPS and Hypoxia Activated Caspase Cascade in Human Gingival FibroblastsThere is a longstanding paradox that P. gingivalis LPS reveals low inflammatory potency though it is the keystone pathogen.The paradox might be explained by the synergistic infection of P. gingivalis and commensal microbial community Darveau et al.

However E. coli LPS also increased IL-1b and thus induced hypoxia in the gingiva in a chronic process.Hypoxia and P. gingivalis LPS Has Synergistic Effects in PeriodontitisAs an anaerobe P. gingivalis scarcely survives under normorxia.

Moreover E. coli LPS turned normoxia into hypoxia phase in experimental periodontitis model which may subsequently propel the inflammatory effect of P. gingivalis LPS.

The results also suggested that Gram-negative microbiota may prepare a favorable environment for P. gingivalis and helped to propel caspase-1 activation.In the experimental periodontitis model NLRP3 and IL- 1b were also enhanced similar to the results of human periodontitis specimen Figure 4B.

Yet cleaved-caspase-1 was enhanced by hypoxiaand E. coli LPS at 1 h and 2 h. But by 4 h E. coli LPS had little effect on either NLRP3 or cleaved caspase-1 expression.E.

However a 10-specie subgingival biofilm model including P. gingivalis down-regulate NLRP3 and IL-1b expressions in gingival fibroblasts partly because of P. gingivalis Belibasakis et al.
