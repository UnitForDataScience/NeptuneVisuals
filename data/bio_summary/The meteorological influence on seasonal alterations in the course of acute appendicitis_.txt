CCI 14 Charlson Comorbidity Index MPI 14 Mannheim peritonitis index LOS 14 length of stay OP 14 operation lap 14 laparoscopic.Meteorological analysisSeasonal analysis revealed more NAT days in summer and winter versus spring and autumn P  0.0001 and more EXT days during summer 26 days and spring 14 days versus autumn 2 days and winter 0 day P  0.0001.

No patients died during hospital stay or during 30-day follow-up.Comparisons between noncomplicated AA and compli- cated AA revealed a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications 22.2 versus 9.8 P  0.0001 a higher rate of SSI grade I and II 6 versus 3.2 P  0.0001 and SSI grade III 8.5 versus 1.4 P  0.0001 higher reoperation rate 4.3 versus 1.4 P 14 0.004 and a longer postoperative stay 5 0-23 days versus 3 0-17 days P  0.0001 for complicated AA.Calendric analysisThere were 347 patients treated during summer half-year versus 333 during winter half-year P 14 0.896.

This effect was even more obvious after CD th HUM WBC 13.92 - 5.52 versus 12.55 - 4.68 CRP 4.71 - 9.94 versus 1.6 - 7.3 P 14 0.031 and for WBC afterNAT days 13.3 - 4.66 versus 12.5 - 4.67 P 14 0.009.

Other meteorological effects on intraoperative findings were not noticeable.In the postoperative period we observed more complica- tions after HD WD and WD th DRY HD 18 versus 10.6P 14 0.021 WD 18.9 versus 10.4 P 14 0.009 and WD th DRY20.3 versus 11.1 P 14 0.037.

Male patients were significantly older 33 versus 30 years P  0.0001 had a higher BMI 24.9 versus 23.0 P  0.0001 and less previous abdominal operations in their medical history 16.1 versus 10 P 14 0.27.

In addition patients operated on in summer and accordingly after warm days suffer more complications P  0.0001 especially more superficial surgical site infections P  0.048.Conclusions The concordant observation of more complicated AA and complications after AA with meteorological data and calendric seasonal variations makes it most likely that temperature is a cofactor in complicated AA and contributes to the seasonal variations in AA.

Meteorological parameters were tested in single analyses and in all reasonable combinations against recorded patient data.The patients' characteristics showed significantly higher CRP 2.68 - 7.87 versus 1.51 - 7.51 P 14 0.034 and WBC13.77 - 4.4 versus 12.45 - 4.72 P 14 0.034 values in patients presenting after HD and VCD.

After HD more patients had a complicated AA 23.6 versus 15.8 P 14 0.034 and peritonitis 69.4 versus 58.5 P 14 0.034.

No further differ- ences in patients' characteristics were noticed.The intraoperative data showed a significantly higher rate of complicated AA after NAT days 21.07 versus 14.17 P 14 0.016.

The mean postoperative stay was longer for patients operated in summer 3.64 - 2.28 days versus 3.14 - 2.23 days P 14 0.004.140  e Table 3 e Patient characteristics.
