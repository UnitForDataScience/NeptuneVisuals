In addition patients operated on in summer and accordingly after warm days suffer more complications P  0.0001 especially more superficial surgical site infections P  0.048.Conclusions The concordant observation of more complicated AA and complications after AA with meteorological data and calendric seasonal variations makes it most likely that temperature is a cofactor in complicated AA and contributes to the seasonal variations in AA.

Seasons were analyzed by using the meteorological classification summer meteorological June 1eAugust 31 autumn meteo- rological September 1eNovember 30 winter meteorological December 1eFebruary 2829 and spring meteorological March 1eMay 31.

No patients died during hospital stay or during 30-day follow-up.Comparisons between noncomplicated AA and compli- cated AA revealed a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications 22.2 versus 9.8 P  0.0001 a higher rate of SSI grade I and II 6 versus 3.2 P  0.0001 and SSI grade III 8.5 versus 1.4 P  0.0001 higher reoperation rate 4.3 versus 1.4 P 14 0.004 and a longer postoperative stay 5 0-23 days versus 3 0-17 days P  0.0001 for complicated AA.Calendric analysisThere were 347 patients treated during summer half-year versus 333 during winter half-year P 14 0.896.

Other meteorological parameters had no influence on the postoperative course.Due to the sample size a correlation of severity of appen- dicitis with the extent of deviations from ambient tempera- ture ambient atmospheric pressure precipitation and other meteorological parameters was not possible.Combined analysis and multivariate analysisThe graphical analysis showed no conspicuous patter of the distribution of AA the patients' characteristics laboratory parameters operative technique conversion rate and drain- ages.

Exclusion criteria included all intraoperatively diagnosed neoplasms except neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix below 1 cm T1 appendectomies AEs performed during operations for another reason and travel through patients whereabouts of the patients not in FrankfurtMain Germany for 24 h prior to admission.Acquisition of patient's data was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of Frankfurt Germany Institutional Review Board No 54415.

Eight patients were excluded one extensive tumor three missing data and five patients whose preoperative stay was not in Frankfurt.

There were no noticeable differences in patients' characteristics intra- operative findings or postoperative course between patients operated in summer half-year and winter half-year.The seasonal analysis showed more AA during summer189 versus winter 163 and no difference during summer164 and autumn 164 P 14 0.421.

Meteorological parameters were tested in single analyses and in all reasonable combinations against recorded patient data.The patients' characteristics showed significantly higher CRP 2.68 - 7.87 versus 1.51 - 7.51 P 14 0.034 and WBC13.77 - 4.4 versus 12.45 - 4.72 P 14 0.034 values in patients presenting after HD and VCD.

No further differ- ences in patients' characteristics were noticed.The intraoperative data showed a significantly higher rate of complicated AA after NAT days 21.07 versus 14.17 P 14 0.016.

After HD more patients had a complicated AA 23.6 versus 15.8 P 14 0.034 and peritonitis 69.4 versus 58.5 P 14 0.034.
