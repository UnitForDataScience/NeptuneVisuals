seasons were classified meteorologically as 3-month periods winter spring summer and autumn.results nonambient temperature unusual warm or cold weather is correlated with a higher rate of complicated gangrenous or perforated aa p 14 0.018. in summer and winter days with nonambient temperatures were more frequent p  0.0001. a higher rate of complicated aa was seen during summer and winter p 14 0.009. in addition patients operated on in summer and accordingly after warm days suffer more complications p  0.0001 especially more superficial surgical site infections p  0.048.conclusions the concordant observation of more complicated aa and complications after aa with meteorological data and calendric seasonal variations makes it most likely that temperature is a cofactor in complicated aa and contributes to the seasonal variations in aa.

postoperative complications showed a peak during june and july which corresponded to a peak for wdhd in these months and a higher mean temperature c and d. an analog correlation between ssi i and ii and mean tem- perature respectively wdhd was observed.in the multivariate analysis complicated aa wassignificantly associated with operation after nat days hr 1.9 95 ci 1.22-2.98 p 14 0.007 and higher age hr 1.07 95  141a b 1800.3555555c 25 mean temperature14 d 180 wdhd14 complications20151051601214010120810068060440220 complications121086420000fig.
