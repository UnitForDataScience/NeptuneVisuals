Although most clinical isolates were identified as A. baumannii 78 authors indicated that a significant number of other species were found particularly A. lwoffii 8.8 A. ursingii 4 genospecies 3 1.7 and A. johnsonii 1.7 often associated with bacteremia.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the occurrence of nasopharyngeal colonization of Lama glama by respiratory bacteria and to assess the usefulness of serological tests for clinical diagnosis.

The colonization was studied by culture techniques carried out with material taken by nasopharyngeal swabs.

The presence of specific serum antibodies was studied by ELISA and Western blot.

The results presented herein contribute to a better understanding of the respiratory microbiota in camelids and increase the knowledge about environmental distribution of Acinetobacter non-baumanii species.

The occurrence of respiratory opportunistic pathogens in South American camelids SACs has been reported and therefore it should be monitored as by serological tests.
