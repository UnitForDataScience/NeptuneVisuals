Then the mice were divided into four groups as follows HFD group HFD n8 antibiotic-treated group AB n10 simvastatin-treated group SV n13 and combined antibiotic and simvastatin treatment group ABSV n12.

We observed that the relative concentration of LCA was increased in HFD group compared to control group and was further up-regulated in SV group but was greatly depleted in either AB or ABSV group.

The relative concentrations of CA TCA and GCA were dramatically reduced in HFD group compared to control group in which only TCA was further depleted by SV treatment.

The transcriptional expression of 28 genes was significantly changed by HFD feeding in comparison with Con group however only a very small part of the differently expressed genes were reversed by SV treatment such as Apoa4 Cyp7a1 Cyp7b1 Cyp51 and Srebf1 compared to HFD group.
