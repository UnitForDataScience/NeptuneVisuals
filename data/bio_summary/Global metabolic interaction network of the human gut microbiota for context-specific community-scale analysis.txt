Applying this strategy to microbiome data from type 2 diabetes patients reveals a context-specific infrastructure of the gut microbial ecosystem core microbial entities with large metabolic influence and frequently produced metabolic compounds that might indicate relevant community metabolic processes.

Furthermore inherent microbial activities involving the import of metabolic nutrients and export of metabolic byproducts give rise to both competition for resources and cooperative relationships such as metabolic cross-feeding among resident microorganisms in the gutenvironment.

Despite ongoing computational efforts to describe microbial interactions using biologicallyrealistic manually curated constraint-based or simplified kinetic metabolic models most of these models have not yet reached the scale of diversity in the gut community which typically comprises hundreds of different microbial speciesit is noteworthy that this scale of microbial diversity has been recently covered by semi-automatically generated constraint- based metabolic models.Here we present a global interspecies metabolic interaction network of the human gut microbiota NJS16.

Overall if a microbial entity i is found to have a highergrowth-promoting capability than a growth-inhibiting capabilitytowards another microbial entity j then Wij 4 0 and we classify this interaction as having a net positive metabolic influence if there is a higher growth-inhibiting capability than a growth- promoting capability then Wij o 0 and we classify this interaction as having a net negative metabolic influence.

For example a member of the Propionibacterium genus produces riboflavin for Lactobacillus delbrueckii in the MIN.Apart from the positive metabolic influence relationships examined above the MIN also includes links of net negative metabolic influence.

Differences in these two sets of metabolites could suggest insights into metabolic processes associated with a T2D gut microbial ecosystem.number of other microbial entities prompted us to explore whether a hidden hierarchy of metabolic influence exists within the microbial communities.

For example in our MIN E. rectale was found to have a metabolic influence to 25 different microbial entities hence its community metabolic influence Fi is quantified as 25.

Substrate- dependent product formation interdependency of different metabolic pathways and end-product inhibition of cell growth have yet to be considered and these would be better described by constraint-based genome-scale metabolic models.
