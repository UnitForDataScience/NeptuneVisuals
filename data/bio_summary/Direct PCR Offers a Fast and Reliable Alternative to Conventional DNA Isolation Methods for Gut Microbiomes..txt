The cecum colon and feces showed very high correspon- dence in beta diversity for identical samples prepared with direct PCR and DNA extraction as they clustered by individual and not method whereas differences were much greater for cloacal and in particular ileal samples .Differences in microbiomes obtained with direct PCR and DNA extraction.

Scatterplots show abundances of all OTUs in extraction replicates obtained with the DNA extraction method A extraction replicates obtained with the direct PCR method B PCR replicates obtained with the DNA extraction method C and PCR replicates obtained with the direct PCR method D. OTU abundances have been normalized in accordance with the DESeq2 method and log transformed 0.1 for graphical purposes.

However alpha diversity was significantly higher in direct PCR samples than in DNA extraction samples for the ileum npairs  19 V  5 P  0.0001 and significantly lower in direct PCR cecal samples npairs  20 V  199 P  0.0001 .

Cloacal samples showed significantly greater distances than cecal npairs  20 V  21 q  0.005 and colon npairs  20 V  34 q  0.013 samples and finally cecal samples showed slightly shorter distances than fecal samples npairs  20 V  40 q  0.023 .Differences in OTU abundance with direct PCR and DNA extraction.

These practical advantages combined with the fact that direct PCR is possibly more sensitive at measuring diversity in samples with low DNA concentrations high- light direct PCR as an excellent alternative to the DNA extraction method.

The amplicon libraries represented 100 unique ostrich gut microbiome samples n  20 per sample type 2 control and 2 blank samples 40 extraction replicates and 10 PCR replicates that were all prepared with both the DNA extraction and direct PCR methods Table S1 Fig.

S3 suggesting that although it is difficult to measure the relative abundances of specific bacterial taxa when DNA concentrations are low it may still be possible to accurately measure the community composition with both of these methods.The direct PCR samples from the ileum had significantly higher alpha diversity  and higher relative abundances of the majority of differentially abundant OTUs  than those obtained with the DNA extraction method.

Second small differences between the direct PCR and DNA extraction methods can become exaggerated in low-DNA samples because the sequence coverage will be higher for low-abundance OTUs as a result of equal quantities of PCR product from all samples being used before sequencing.
