For example when a comparative microbiotamicrobiome analysis indicates particular species or strains as effector species or strains the culturability of the corresponding species can be first confirmed by the presence of corresponding DNA signatures in culture-recovered bacterial populations before any attempt can be made to isolate the target species strains for further evaluation as promising probiotics.

Failure to recover these species from MRS agar may be due to the followings reasons these species either i require strictly anaerobic condition L. aviarius or ii grow well under anaerobic condition although being facultative anaerobic L. fornicalis as compared to microaerophilic condition at 37C which was used in this study      .
