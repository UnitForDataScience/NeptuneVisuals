Here we report the complete genome sequence of Fusobacterium varium Fv113-g1 genome size 3.96 Mb isolated from a patient with UC.

Compared with the genome sequences of F. varium ATCC 27725 genome size3.30 Mb and other strains of Fusobacterium spp.

F. mortiferum and F. varium are frequent residents of the human gut  some experimental data suggest that F. varium can actively invade host epithelial cells .In this study we analyzed the whole-genome sequence of F. varium Fv113-g1 isolated from a patient with UC.

Comparative genome analyses totally suggested that Fv113-g1 is basically assigned as F. varium in particular it could be reclassified as notable F. varium subsp.

Genomic information of F. varium Fv113-g1.followed by comparative genome analysis of F. varium ATCC 8501 T and publicly available draft-genome sequence of ATCC 27725 3.3 Mb .

Abovementioned comparative genome analyses totally suggested that Fv113-g1 should be basically assigned as F. varium in particular it could be reclassified as notable F. varium subsp.

Circular representation of the Fv113-g1 genome chromosome and two plasmids along with comparative genome information of other F. varium strains .

In addition orthology analysis indicated that 65.5 2198  2853 all clusters 503 singletons in Fv113-g1 of gene clusters are identified as core clusters among F. varium related strains whereas 343 orthologous gene clusters between Fv113-g1 and F. ulcerans ATCC 49185 found to be more than 251 clusters between Fv113-g1 and F. varium ATCC 27725  and .
