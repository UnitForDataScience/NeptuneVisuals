There were no differences in rates of carbohydrate oxida- tion Figure 2GH mean difference -0.014 - 0.13 gmin effect of trial P  .283 or protein oxidation control 0.062 - 0.006 gmin vs propionate 0.059 - 0.005 gmin P  .535 between trials.The effects of propionate on energy homeostasis were not related to differences in circulating levels of glucose Figure S2AB in File S1 mean difference 0.4 - 0.9 mmolL effect of trial P  .666 or insulin Figure S2CD in File S1 mean difference -0.1 - 0.9 mU mL effect of trial P  .742.

There were no differences in circulat- ing levels of acetate Figure 1CD mean difference 2.64 - 3.99 mmolL effect of trial P  .518 or butyrate Figure 1EF mean differ- ence -0.09 - 0.21 mmolL effect of trial P  .657 between trials.The REE was significantly higher after propionate compared with control Figure 2AB with a mean difference of 0.045 - 0.020 kcal min effect of trial P  .036.

All data expressed as mean - SEM n  18revealed raised concentration after propionate at 180 minutes com- pared with control 33.6 - 7.7 pmolL vs 56.9 - 8.6 pmol L P  .012.There were no significant differences in heart rate Figure S5A in File S1 mean difference 1.0 - 0.8 bpm effect of trial P  .197 or mean arterial blood pressure Figure S5B in File S1 mean difference1.0 - 0.9 mm Hg effect of trial P  .267 between study visits.

Levels of propionate in peripheral blood were higher in the propionate trial Figure 1AB mean difference 1.19 - 0.34 mmolL effect of trial P  .003 with values significantly raised at 180 minutes compared with control 3.04 - 0.26 mmolL vs5.25 - 0.65 mmolL P  .005.

The increase in REE was accompanied by a significantly lower RER in the propionate trial Figure 2CD0.88 - 0.02 vs 0.85 - 0.02 effect of trial P  .040 with higher lipid oxidation rates compared with control supplementation Figure 2EF with a mean difference of 0.012 - 0.006 gmin effect of trial P  .048.

There was no mean difference between trials in levels of non-esterified fatty acids NEFA Figure 2EF mean difference -0.02 - 0.05 mmolL effect of trial P  .767 but there was a significant time x trial interaction P  .017.
