Of those 71 continued to have satisfactory relief at 1 year post- reintroduction and 68 continued to avoid high FODMAP foods at least 50 of the time.8 Another study providing a follow-up questionnaire at 6 months post-treatment found that those who had remained on a strict or attenuated diet at 6 months had a significantly greater symptomatic improvement at 6 weeks com- pared with those who had abandoned the diet although information on the level of reintroduction was not assessed.9 Those who had abandoned the diet were likely to have been unresponsive within the initial 6-week strict elimination phase.9 It is key that those who do not respond to the low FODMAP diet should not be encouraged to continue on the dietary restrictions.

There is risk of nutritional inadequacy with implementation of any exclusion diet or dietary restriction.5 Indeed recent data demonstrate that more than half of patients following a low FODMAP diet did not meet their recommended intakes of calcium and iron although values were not dissimilar to the healthy population on a habitual diet.

Importantly patients are encouraged not to remain on a strict low FODMAP diet long-term and many patients maintain symptom improvement with a relaxed moderate FODMAP restriction.

FODMAP subtypes that are less well tolerated may also be reintroduced but dosage and frequency of consump- tion need to be individualized.Additional challenges that face dietitians include consideration of patients with multiple dietary restrictions such as in vegetarians or patients with diabetes who are simultaneously following a low FODMAP diet.

The re- challenge phase can finally provide patients with some certainty around their dietary intolerances of which patients have often struggled for many years.Patients are encouraged to remain on the strict low FODMAP diet while completing the challenges.

Further data on the degree of dietary FODMAP restriction required for individ- ual patients would be beneficial to help tailor the diet more specif- ically to the individual patients' needs.

Patients requiring the diet long-term then follow a modified FODMAP diet based on their dietary tolerance found while challenging.2 Although this re- challenge phase is conducted worldwide and anecdotally has success in relaxing the approach and maintaining symptomatic improvement limited data exist to define the re-challenge process.

Interestingly this study did not see any change in the proportion of those meeting fiber recommendations from baseline to follow-up.6 Furtherdata including comprehensive analysis of micronutrient intake are needed to fully understand what effect the low FODMAP diet and re-challenge phase has on nutritional adequacy.Patients often report difficulty with complying with the low FODMAP diet when eating away from the home through for example fear of inadvertently consuming high FODMAP foods possibly affecting social inclusion and quality of life QOL.

Once the re-challenges are completed the patient is encouraged to then follow their own individual modified version of the low FODMAP diet in the longer term ensuring that their diet is only as restrictive as their symptoms require.
