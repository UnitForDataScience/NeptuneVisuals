Obviously the occurrence of uncultured and VBNC bacteria in the following text the two groups will be collectively referred as non-culturable bacteria for convenience in the samples will result in a dramatic underestimation of the total viable bacterial amounts the sum of culturable and non-culturable bacteria and thus potentially poses a threat to patient health.Therefore in order to elucidate the bacterial community in dialysis water accurately it is indispensable to apply protocols independent of culturing.

Moreover some detected culturable strains in the RO effluent such as Ralstonia and Herbaspirillum could release lipopolysaccharides responsible for the pyrogenic reaction and outbreaks of sterile peritonitis 29 30 posing a direct threat to long-term dialysis patients.Occurrence and Variation of the Total Viable BacteriaAs pointed out the differences between the total bacteria and the total viable bacteria are slight which indicated that most of the bacteria in the treatment system were viable.

However the HPC method can only include culturable bacteria which is only a very small part of the total viable bacteria in the samples.

Process flow diagram.TW tap water SF sand filter CF carbon filter WS water softener RO reverse osmosis.collected from each process except RO water 50 L for enriching the bacteria primarily due to the different levels of bacteria in the water samples.

It was noteworthy that numerous pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Herbaspirillum were found in the system.The total bacteria and total viable bacteria are also shown in Fig.

Similar to the culturable bacteria the total viable bacteria also climbed to higher levels of 6.31 x 10 and 2.14 x 10 copies100 ml in effluents of the carbon filter and softener respectively.

The above results demonstrated that the water treatment processes with a core of RO could optimize the physicochemical parameters effectively.Occurrence and Variation of the Culturable BacteriaAlthough the culturable bacteria amounts conformed to the standards some tendency was worrying that is the culturable bacteria amounts increased after the carbon filtration and then remained at about 10 CFU100 mlFig.

The related risks would be amplified if it was considered that VBNC bacteria could still retain some toxicinfectious metabolic activity and resuscitate under certain favorable conditions.With respect to the quantitative distribution of the total viable bacteria the two key impacting factors were chlorine residue and RO retention.

However these methods cannot detect the uncultured or viable but non-culturable VBNC bacteria both of which may be quantitatively predominant throughout the hemodialysis water treatment system.

Therefore propidium monoazide PMA-qPCR associated with HPC was used together to profile the distribution of the total viable bacteria in such a system.
