Here we summarize existing bioinformatics tools of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data analysis the purpose of which is to assist re- searchers in deciding the appropriate tools for their microbiome studies.

Here we introduce five bioinformatics tools for 16S rRNA ana- lysis as shown in  which are QIIME UPARSE MOTHUR DADA2 and minimum entropy decomposition MED.QIIME aims to perform the downstream analyses because of the lack of library demultiplexing and taxonomy assign- ment tools as the development of high-throughput pyrose- quencing -.

The information provided will facilitate the selection of suitable tools meeting specific aims of each study.Species-level metagenomic data analysisSix metagenomic analysis tools are listed in  including MetaPhlAn2  Kraken  CLARK  FOCUS  SUPER-FOCUS  and MG-RAST .

MG-RAST provides post- annotation analysis and visualization directly through the Web interface or by tools like matR metagenomic analysis tools forR  that use the MG-RAST API to easily download data from processing pipeline.

MetaTrans uses multi-threading computers to accelerate the taxonomic and gene expression analyses of active microbial communities  SAMSA is a com- prehensive pipeline including four phases preprocessing phase annotation phase aggregation phase and analysis phase for gut microbiome data analysis .Citation of metagenome and metatranscriptome analysis toolsTo demonstrate the usage of existing metagenome and meta- transcriptome analysis tools we have collected the citing information of 14 tools from Google Scholar and their rela- tive annual citations are showcased in .

It is obvious that MOTHUR  and MG-RAST are the two most popu- lar tools in 16s rRNA-level and species-level metagenome analyses tools respectively.

Relative annual citation information of 14 tools according to the numbers from Google Scholar.Note All the tools summarized in this figure must be published for at least 2 years.With a gene set along with matching metagenome and metatran- scriptome data we can understand microbiota's role in diseases or important biological mechanisms.

Additionally we propose an Integrated Meta- Function mapping pipeline to incorporate various reference databases and accelerate functional gene mapping procedures for both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses.Key words metagenome metatranscriptome microbe bioinformatics tools functional and quantitative analysis integrated mapping pipelineIntroductionIn addition to the human body communities of microbes are found in other environments such as the ocean soil plants and other animals .

We hope the provided information will help more researchers in identifying the appropriate tools for their microbiome studies.Metagenomic data analysis16S rRNA analysis is one of the most popular and a relatively cheap method to profile the genus composition of microbiota.
