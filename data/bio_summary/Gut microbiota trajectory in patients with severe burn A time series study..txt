Also for both mouse and human gut microbiota dysbiosis can be triggered by burn injury allowing the overgrowth of Gram-negative aerobic bacteria which play a pivotal role in potentiating sepsis.Although previous studies have demonstrated the association be- tween severe burns with gut microbiota dysbiosis few is focusing on the dynamic change of gut microbiomes and its association with enteral nutrition EN in severe burn patients .

Weighted UniFrac cluster analysis of gut microbiota profiles also indicated separation of the early two three and four weeks and late five and six weeks stage after severe burn .A trend of enriched beneficial bacteria and diminished pathogen bacteriaAt the phylum level the proportion of Bacteroidetes was significant- ly decreased and Firmicutes increased at early stage after severe burn especially in EN poorly-tolerated patients but it gradually recovered at late stage a.

S1.Identification of the diagnosis and prognosis microbiome biomarkers of severe burn patientThe genus of Enterococcus and Escherichia was enriched at the sam- ples collected on the early stage which represented the sign of the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome of severe burn patients.

Weighted UniFrac cluster analysis was used to evaluate differences of samples in species complexity at six time points 1-3 days 2 3 4 5 and 6 weeks after severe burn n  7.Bio-diversity analysis of gut microbiomesFor the species bio-diversity analysis the alpha diversity of patient' gut microbiome was greatly decreased at the early stage after severe burn compared with the initial stage Shannon's diversity index 3.02 - 0.441.60 - 1.02 1.52 - 0.74 and 2.03 - 1.83 for 1-3 days 2 w 3 w andw respectively Simpson' diversity index 0.11 - 0.03 0.43 - 0.330.41 - 0.18 and 0.28 - 0.24 for 1-3 days 2 w 3 w and 4 w respectively .

For severe burn patients understanding the exact gut flora dynamic along the prognosis of the patients is critical to understand the genesis development and progno- sis of burn.

Many Escherichia are commensal gut flora but particular strains of Escherichia are pathogens that can cause severe gastrointestinal disease.Early EN has demonstrated to be effective in improving clinical out- comes in critically ill patients including severe burn or trauma which can contribute to supporting intestinal structural integrity stimulating epithelial cell proliferation and promoting the production of brush border enzymes .

Six patients survived burn area81.7 - 5.9 APACHE II score 14.5 - 1.7 SOFA score 6.3 - 1.7 and one patient died burn area 95 APACHE II score 25 SOFA score 11.

The dynamic changes of gut microbiome of fecal samples at six time points 1- 3 days 2 3 4 5 and 6 weeks after severe burn were detected using 16S ribosomal RNA pyrosequencing technology.

Results Following the post-burn temporal order gut microbiota dysbiosis was detected in the gut microbiome after severe burn then it was gradually resolved.
