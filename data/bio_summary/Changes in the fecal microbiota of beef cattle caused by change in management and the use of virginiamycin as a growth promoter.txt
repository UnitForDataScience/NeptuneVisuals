there were significant decreases in richness over time with a sig- nificant decrease in richness at mid feedlot and at exit in b1 p  0.001 compared to arrival and a decrease at exit compared to mid feedlot in b2 p  0.024. animals from b2 that received virgi- niamycin did not differ in richness throughout the study but those in the con group had reduced richness at exit compared to mid feedlot p  0.001. conversely there was an increase in diversity in animals from both batches b1 and b2 and treatments atb and con com- paring arrival to mid feedlot p  0.001 and p  0.002 for b1 and b2 respectively.

c and d community structure yue and clayton in samples from b1 and b2 respectively.species the distal gut bacteria of ruminants might be essential for homeostasis and also for part of feed digestion therefore a better un- derstanding of factors affecting those microorganisms is of crucial im- portance.the comparison between batches b1 vs. b2 revealed statistical differences at the mid and final timepoints which might be related not only to the different diet composition since b2 received orange pulp as silage.

adaptation to the new diet occurred over a 10 day period with increases of 20 of con- centrate dry matter every 48 h.samples from the two batches were collected at three time points arrival d0 mid feedlot period 26 and 24 days after arrival for b1 and b2 respectively and exit.

animals from two batches were enrolled batch 1 b1 entered feedlot on may 5th 2014 and batch 2 b2 entered feedlot on january 19th 2015. at arrival animals from both batches were randomly divided ensuring an even distribution of sex into two neighboring pens.

one pen was a treatment pen atb where animals received virginiamycin as a growth promoter while animals in the other pen were managed identically with the exception that they did not receive virginiamycin con.diet was composed dry matter basis of concentrate 58.00 corn silage 29.80 and orange pulp 12.20 given as wet pulp to b1 and as silage to b2.

the same approach was adopted for the comparison of results of chao and simpson's indexes but considering a p value  0.050 as statisti- cally significant.body weight and adg from all animals at exit b1 50 and b2 36 were compared between treatments con vs. atb using t-tests.

animals from b1 were shipped at three different timepoints 66 days of feedlot six heifers from con and six heifers from atb 88 days four heifers and three steers from con and three steers from atb and 116 days two steers from con and two heifers and four steers from atb.
