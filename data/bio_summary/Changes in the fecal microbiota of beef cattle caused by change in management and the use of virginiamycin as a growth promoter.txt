However it is difficult to attribute this stability to the use of antibiotics since theTable 1Results P values from statistical comparison of community membership Jaccard and structure Yue  Clayton present in feces of beef cattle receiving virginiamycin ATB and controls CON at arrival mid feedlot and exit.Batch 1Batch 2Yue  ClaytonJaccardYue  ClaytonJaccardParsimonyATB - arrival x middle 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001ATB - arrival x exit 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001ATB - middle x exit 0.001 0.0010.5610.054CON - arrival x middle 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001ATB - arrival x middle 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001ATB - arrival x exit 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001ATB - middle x exit 0.001 0.0010.2030.018CON - arrival x middle 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001CON - arrival x exit 0.001 0.001 0.001 0.001CON - middle x exit0.002 0.0010.099 0.001ARRIVAL - ATB x CON0.1230.5150.2420.932MID - ATB x CON 0.001 0.0010.209 0.001EXIT - ATB x CON0.2460.0120.0070.029Table 2Percentage of resistant E. coli strains isolated from fecal samples of beef cattle at arrival and exit of a feedlot facility receiving virginiamycin as growth promoter ATB and in a control group CON.AntibioticArrivalExitCONATBCONATBResistanceAmpicillin4.002.081.850Enrofloxacin2.00000Nalidixic acid4.002.0800Tetracycline4.002.081.850Intermediate resistanceAmoxicillinclavulanic acid8.00000Ampicillin8.002.081.850Streptomycin12.00000 has been previously suggested .

Relative abundances of bacterial communities found in feces of two batches of cattle B1 and B2 receiving vir- giniamycin ATB or not CON at arrival mid and exit of feedlot.and B B1 and B2 at the phylum level respectively.

Principal Coordinate Analysis plots representing the dissimilarity between microbial communities in feces of two batches B1 and B2 of feedlot cattle receiving virginiamycin ATB or not CON at arrival mid and exit of feedlot.A and B community membership Jaccard in samples from B1 and B2 respectively.

The ADG in CON and ATB were respectively 1.02 and 1.16 kgday in B1 P  0.30 and 1.32 and 1.44 kgday in B2 P  0.07.Antimicrobial resistanceCulture of fecal samples yielded growth of 206 E. coli colonies of which 98 were from samples collected at arrival CON  50 and ATB  48 and 108 collected at exit CON  54 and ATB  54.

S3.PerformanceMean body weight and standard deviation at exit for CON and ATB animals in B1 were respectively 426.00 kg  - 64.34 and 441.33 kg  - 58.51 and 481.67 kg  - 24.49 and 479.78 kg  - 17.01 in Bwith no significant differences in body weight at feedlot exit between CON and ATB groups for either B1 or B2 P  0.05 for both.

Conversely there was an increase in diversity in animals from both batches B1 and B2 and treatments ATB and CON com- paring arrival to mid feedlot P  0.001 and P  0.002 for B1 and B2 respectively.

C and D community structure Yue and Clayton in samples from B1 and B2 respectively.species the distal gut bacteria of ruminants might be essential for homeostasis and also for part of feed digestion therefore a better un- derstanding of factors affecting those microorganisms is of crucial im- portance.The comparison between batches B1 vs. B2 revealed statistical differences at the mid and final timepoints which might be related not only to the different diet composition since B2 received orange pulp as silage.

Samples were thawed at room temperature just before pro- cessing.Body weight was measured at arrival and exit of feedlot for ADG calculation.Isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Escherichia coli strainsAn aliquot from all samples collected from B2 animals at arrival n  36 and exit n  36 was used for isolation of E. coli as an in- dicator of antimicrobial resistance.

Adaptation to the new diet occurred over a 10 day period with increases of 20 of con- centrate dry matter every 48 h.Samples from the two batches were collected at three time points arrival D0 mid feedlot period 26 and 24 days after arrival for B1 and B2 respectively and exit.
