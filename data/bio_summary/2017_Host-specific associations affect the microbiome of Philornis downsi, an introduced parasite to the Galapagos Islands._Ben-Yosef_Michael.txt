However the link between the microbiomes of parasitic organisms with their own host's ecology and evolution adds additional complexity particularly in the case of parasitic organisms that affect multiple host species Newton Fitt Atkins Walters  Daniell 2010.A diverse and varying composition of bacteria within parasitic organisms can lead to differential host pathogenicity and host-para- site co-evolutionary interactions Sandionigi et al.

CONCLUSION Our study finds variation in the microbiome of the avian parasitic fly P. downsi according to life stage adult fly vs. parasitic larvae and larval stage with significant differences in larval microbiome between ecologically divergent host species that differ in foraging niche and diet.

Further studies focusing on samples taken from afflicted nestlings and their co-occurring par- asites will determine whether wound microbiome composition encountered by the feeding larvae is host specific and consequently reflected in the larval microbiome.Finally we suggest that host diet determines the gut bacterial community in larval P. downsi.

Two Darwin's finch species are critically endangered island endemics i the medium tree finch Camarhynchus pauper has the highest P. downsi intensity of any finch species on Floreana Island and declined 52 between 2004 and 2013 Kleindorfer Peters Cus- tance Dudaniec  O'Connor 2014 Kleindorfer O'Connor et al.

However our findings do not support this notion because no significant differences in the larval microbiota were found within species that were sampled randomly throughout the study area and importantly Darwin's finches do not reuse nests though they may usurp a new nest and build a new nest for every nesting attempt Kleindorfer 2007 Kleindorfer  Dudaniec 2009.Second differences in the feather microbiota of host species may affect the larval microbiome.

Host-species effectsOur results indicate that the Darwin's finch host upon which P. downsi larvae feed significantly affects the larval microbiome suggesting uniquely evolving host-parasite interactions in an ecologically diverged multihost island system.

Bacteria present in host diet may thus be transferred onto first-instar larvae and consequently perpetuate as stable gut residents throughout the remaining larval period.Despite the exact mechanism of the relationship being open to further research our results are consistent with a scenario involving host dietary effects as we found that the gut microbiota of larvae infesting nests of the insectivorous warbler finch was strikingly dif- ferent from the microbiota of the larvae infesting nests of ground and tree finch species who have varied diets with many common components Figure 2b.
