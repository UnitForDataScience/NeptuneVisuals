indeed hpv31 was detected only by metashot in both dna-seq and rna-seq datasets 25 359 reads over 25 368 total viral reads in dna-seq data and 13 684 reads over 14 150 total viral reads in rna-seq data whereas kraken detected much fewer viral reads 2656 and 1565 in total for dna-seq and rna-seq data respect- ively notably not including hpv31 see supplementary table s1 which also metaphlan2 was unable to detect.these results confirm the optimal performance of metashot with re- spect to kraken and metaphlan2 also in the case of real data analysis.the metashot output consists of i an html interactive table reporting for each node in the inferred taxonomy the taxon name the ncbi taxonomy id and the number of assigned reads ii a csv file containing the same information reported in the interactive table iii a krona graph  to graphically inspect the inferred microbiome.a remarkable unique feature of metashot is the possibility to ex- tract all unassigned reads or the set of reads assigned to a specific taxon defined by the ncbi taxonomy id.

we present here metashot a novel analysis work- flow for assessing the microbiome composition from host-associated shotgun sequence data and show its overall better performance with re-table 1. a benchmark assessment of kraken kr and metashot ms on a simulated dataset see the supplementary material for details consisting of 19 582 500 human 94.5 986 114 bacterial4.8 and 146 886 viral 0.7 reads.

a software package implementing the metashot pipeline is freely available at and includesba utility tool for extracting all reads assigned to a specific ncbi taxonomic id or all those left unassigned.3 resultsin order to carry out a comparative assessment of metashot per- formance with respect to kraken  andhuman hostprokaryotesviruseskrmsmpkrmsmpkrmsmpu0.001.04 99.99 55.28 2.44 94.50 4.25 3.94 30.74metaphlan2  two state of the art tools for ana- lyzing shotgun metagenomics data we used art   to generate an in silico designed human microbiota with a composition resembling a typical human sample containing human bacterial and viral sequences see and supplementary material for a more detailed description.the simulated dataset also included reads from phix phage which have been shown to contaminate many assembled microbial genomes  and from human endogenous ret- roviruses herv which escape detection by most tools designed for analyzing shotgun metagenomics data because they are simply labeled as host reads.

moreover in order to compare metashot kraken and metaphlan2 on a controlled real dataset we analyzed a bacterial and viral mock community   available in the ncbi-sra archive srr3458569.the results of the benchmark assessment displayed in clearly show that metashot outperforms kraken and metaphlan2 in terms of the overall accuracy of reads assignment for the prokaryotes and viruses simulated datasets at the family genus and species levels.

in addition metashot performs better that kraken and metaphlan2 also in terms of taxon assignment accuracy at species and genus levels at both qualitative see supplementary tables s1-s4 and quantitative levels see supplementary figs s2 and s3.finally in order to test metashot on a real dataset we analyzed dna-seq 528 034 456 100 bp x 2 pe reads and rna-seq 61 318 866 100 bp x 2 pe reads data from a sample of cervical squamous cell carcinoma of the uterus.

metashot is about 2 and 3 times slower than kraken and metaphlan2 respectively for the complete analysis of the simulated benchmark dataset see supplementary material.acknowledgementscomputational resources were provided by elixir-ita and bioforiu pona300025.fundingthis work was supported by miur-italy cnr aging and medicina personalizzata programs 2012-2014 jpi project enpadasi h2020 projects inmare embric and elixir-excelerate spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness and european regional development fund project dpi2015-67082-p minecofeder grant no.
