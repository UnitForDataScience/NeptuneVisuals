similarly to the gram-positive isolates tyramine levels were reduced by the majority of gram-negative bacteria except for e. coli h.1 and h.10 m. morganii j.1 and k. pneumoniae i.2.spermidine levels were increased following co- incubation with bas for the majority of both gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria .however all the gram-positive c. perfringens isolates b.1 b.2 and b.3 reduced spermidine levels while the gram-negative strains e. coli h.6 h.9 and h.14 also reduced spermidine levels.

in total 54 isolates were gram positive  and 20 isolates were gram negative .bacterial production of bas in the presence of aasto assess the production of bas strains were grown for 48 h in the presence of an aa cocktail containing histidine lysine arginine ornithine and tyrosine and supernatants were subsequently assessed by uplc.table 1. gram-positive isolates medium used for their isola- tion and 16s rrna genbank accession number.genbank accessionseparation was carried out by uplc on anstrainmediumno.acquity uplc h-class bio system waters corp. milford ma usa equipped with a quatern-bifidobacterium adolescentisa.1bhikx674032bifidobacterium longuma.2rcmkx674040rcmkx673988ary solvent manager sample manager with flow-through needle column manager and diode array detector.

similarly spermine was secreted by all gram-negative isolates except for k. pneumoniae i.1 .tabulated data for gram-positive and gram-nega- tive bacteria can be observed in supplementary tables s1 and s2 respectively.bacterial production and degradation of bas in the presence of basin vivo bacteria are exposed to multiple substrates and may not produce bas in the sole presence of aas.
