Such specific recapitulations of behaviour by the manipulation of a subset of neurons in a precise cortical region is a state- of-the-art experimental demonstration of the link between an individual brain region and distinct behaviours.In a final tour de force using a viral-based technique to determine cellular connections Yim andcolleaguesidentified aregionofthecor- tex called the temporal association area TeA together with the striatum as the brain areas to which cells in the S1DZ project.

These factors too might enhance clonal haematopoiesis and the development of both blood-related and solid tumours.As a body of work research into clonalCRAIG M.

They found that neurons in the S1DZ connect to neurons in a brain region called the temporal association area TeA that influence social behaviours and to neurons in the striatum that affect repetitive behaviours.authors expressed light-sensitive ion channels in the subset of S1DZ neurons projecting to the TeA stimulation of these neurons in offspring of wild-type mice that had not undergone MIA resulted in atypical social behaviours butnot in repetitive behaviours.

The authors could there- fore implicate a subregion of the brain as a key circuit hub foratypical behaviours that resemble features of autism in humans.

They also discov- ered that the two behaviours social and repeti- tive were linked to different brain regions with both regions being modulated to some degree by the S1DZ hub.Do cortical abnormalities due to maternal viral infections have a role in the development of autism in humans This link has not been clearly established but infections during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy are probably risk factors3 and areas of abnor- mally developed cortex have been identified in individuals with autism7.

Additional exper- imental work and analyses of post-mortem brain samples will be required to answer this question.

Moreover after antibiotic pretreatment offspring did not show abnor- mal brain development or atypical behaviours revealing a link between microbes present in the pregnant mother and the risk of autism- like features developing in her offspring.The authors investigated which bacteria targeted by the antibiotic might be respon- sible for the changes observed.

When mice lacking the bacteria underwent MIA their offspring did not show atypical brain development or behaviour.

Yim and colleagues delved further into the underlying mechanism by trying to determine exactly where in the brain the MIA-associated abnormalities occur.
