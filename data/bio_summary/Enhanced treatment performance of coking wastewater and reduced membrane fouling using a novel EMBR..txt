The operation was divided into three phases firstphase 0-30 day the concentrations of COD phenol pyridine and quinoline were 2276.8 mg L-1 600 mg L-1 70 mg L-1 and 70 mg L-1 second phase 31-60 day the concentrations of COD phenol pyridine and quinoline were 2565.2 mg L-1 700 mg L-1 90 mg L-1 and 90 mg L-1 third phase 61-75 day the applied voltage on the reactor A was cut off while maintaining the concen- trations of COD phenol pyridine and quinoline of 2565.2 mg L-1 700 mg L-1 90 mg L-1 and 90 mg L-1.

Based on above results strain JB could not use pyridine and quinoline as the sole carbon source but could cometabolically degrade pyridine and quinoline using phenol as the primary sub- strate indicating that phenol was the real inducer for the degrada- tion enzymes expression and degrading enzymes of phenol controlled the metabolic pathway while pyridine or quinoline was not.

As the applied volt- age further increased 0.2 V cm-1 to 0.3 V cm-1 the degradation rates of COD phenol pyridine and quinoline decreased gradually particularly when it reached 0.3 V cm-1 the COD phenol pyridine and quinoline degradation rates by reactor A with strain JBdropped markedly to 40.4 46.5 48.5 and 44.8 respectively indicating that the treatment process was mostly inhibited due to the high electric field strength.

Clearly the final degradation rates of COD 94.3 phenol 100 pyridine 98.5 and quinoline 98.4 in reactor A were significantly higher than the sum of reactor B and the electro- catalytic degradation 82.5  2.11  84.61 for COD 94.5 3.3  97.8 for phenol 85.1  1.86  86.96 for pyridine and84.5  1.92  86.42 for quinoline during the long-term treat- ment which further confirmed the coupling effect between the biodegradation and electro-catalytic degradation process.Toxicity assessmentIn this study eco-toxicity estimation was carried out by the Microtox test bacterium V. fischeri to detect the change in effluent toxicity of coking wastewater by the EMBR treatment Fig.

Moreover the current studies are rarely on its application in the treatment of industrial wastewater and the effects of the electric field applied in EMBR on the microbial activ- ity and the microbial community dynamics were not clear.In this study to enhance the treatment performance of coking wastewater containing phenol pyridine and quinoline and reduce membrane fouling a novel configuration of membrane and elec- trodes in EMBR was built by placing two pieces of stainless steel mesh in both insides of the flat sheet membrane module as the cathode and placing two stainless steel mesh anodes outside the module.

These findings suggested that the dominant micro- bial communities enriched by the electrical field still played impor- tant roles in the degradation performance of COD phenol pyridine and quinoline even though the electrical field was cut off  .The membrane fouling reduction in EMBRAs it is well known the membrane fouling was the big problem for the long-term operation of MBR .

The membrane fouling in reactor A was enhanced and the membrane needed two times cleaning in the operation for 15 days which further indi- cated that electric field could effectively reduce the membrane fouling once the electric field was removed the membrane fouling increased.ConclusionsA novel EMBR was built to enhance the treatment performance of coking wastewater and reduce membrane fouling.

Moreover compared to the degradation rates of all the compounds under applied volt- age at 0 V cm-1 degradation only by strain JB the reactor A with strain JB showed higher biodegradation activity for COD phenol pyridine and quinoline under the applied voltage ranging from0.05 V cm-1 to 0.1 V cm-1 and degradation rates for all the com-pounds by the reactor A with strain JB were higher than the sum of degradation rates by the single strain JB and electro-catalytic degradation especially under the applied voltage of 0.1 V cm-1 78.9  2.26  81.16 for COD 90.7  3.93  94.63 for phe-nol 88.1  2.3  90.4 for pyridine and 87.3  2.57  89.87 for quinoline.
