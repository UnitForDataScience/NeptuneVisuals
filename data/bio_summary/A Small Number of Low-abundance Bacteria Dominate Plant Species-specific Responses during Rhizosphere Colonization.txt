Our objectives were to i quantify how many species-level bacterial taxa respond in a plant-species specific manner ii address the role of the rare biosphere in shaping the rhizosphere bacterial community and iii determine whether plant phylogeny has an influence on the rhizosphere bacterial community.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant MesocosmsWe used 19 herbaceous mostly perennial grassland species  that had been previously analyzed in a plant-soilfeedback experiment for their relationship between specific growth rates and biotic soil effects by .

To assess whether greater plant growth and biomass accumulation resulted in greater shifts in rhizosphere bacterial community composition we performed another PERMANOVA using Bray-Curtis dissimilarities as above but only for the rhizosphere soils and with aboveground biomass as the explanatory variable and species as a random effect.Differences in variability of bacterial community compositions among samples within groups initial soil substrate or rhizosphere soils of each species were assessed using the 'betadisper' function in 'vegan.'

Observed number of bacterial OTUs Chao1 richness estimate Shannon-Wiener and Simpson's Index for the initial soil substrate and respective rhizosphere soils are displayed for each plant species.FIGURE S2  Mean relative abundance of bacterial phyla and in case of Proteobacteria classes across the initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils for each plant species.FIGURE S3  Beta-diversity of bacteria in rhizosphere soils that responded positively to one plant species only.

In our study we expanded investigation of the root bacteriome to thelarge bacterial diversity represented by low-abundance bacteria         and analyzed how this rare biosphere shapes the plant species-specific root bacteriome.Already at the level of individual bacterial phyla or proteobacterial classes it was evident that changes in the rare biosphere drive a substantial part of the bacterial community shift between the initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils.

We did this to assess how much variation in these subsets was explained by plant identity.Finally in order to assess whether similarity in rhizosphere bacterial community composition among samples was correlated with phylogenetic similarity among plants we applied a Mantel test with a Spearman's correlation coefficient on the phylogenetic correlation matrix of the plants and a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix of the rhizosphere bacterial community.

Plant species-specific effects on soil bacterial communities involved only 18-111 bacterial OTUs out of several 1000s this minority may potentially impact plant growth in plant-bacteria interactions.Keywords microbiome next-generation amplicon sequencing rhizosphere 16S rRNA gene rare biosphereINTRODUCTIONThe performance and growth of plants is tightly connected to chemical physical and biological properties of the inhabited soil.

The phylogeny was built using the package 'ape' version 3.5    and the Mantel test was performed using the function 'mantel' in the package 'vegan' version 2.4-1  .RESULTSPlant Species Identity Is a Minor Driver of Bacterial Rhizosphere CommunitiesWe used next-generation amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes V1-V3 region to assess the influence of 19 differentherbaceous plant species on their own rhizosphere bacterial community.

This included numerically dominant phyla such as the Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes as well as phyla that represented only a minority of the bacterial community such as Lenthisphaerae or Deinococcus-Thermus .The large difference in bacterial beta diversity between the initial soil substrate and the rhizosphere soils was also evident when analyzed at the level of individual OTUs.

However no effect of plant phylogeny could be observed on the established rhizosphere bacterial communities neither when considering differences in the overall established rhizosphere communities nor when considering plant species-specific responders only.

The observed increase in alpha diversity was paralleled by a trend toward larger bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soils Supplementary Table S1 as revealed by qPCR analysis across seven selected plant species representing the five analyzed plant orders.The initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils were dominated by bacteria belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria classes Alpha- Beta- Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria Bacteroidetes Chloroflexi Parcubacteria Actinobacteria Acidobacteria Verrucomicrobia Planctomycetes or unclassified bacteria with each of these phyla constituting more than 1 relative abundance of the detected 16S rRNA genes and .
