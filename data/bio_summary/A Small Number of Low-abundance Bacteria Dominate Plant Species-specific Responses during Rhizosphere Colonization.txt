to assess whether greater plant growth and biomass accumulation resulted in greater shifts in rhizosphere bacterial community composition we performed another permanova using bray-curtis dissimilarities as above but only for the rhizosphere soils and with aboveground biomass as the explanatory variable and species as a random effect.differences in variability of bacterial community compositions among samples within groups initial soil substrate or rhizosphere soils of each species were assessed using the 'betadisper' function in 'vegan.'

the phylogeny was built using the package 'ape' version 3.5    and the mantel test was performed using the function 'mantel' in the package 'vegan' version 2.4-1  .resultsplant species identity is a minor driver of bacterial rhizosphere communitieswe used next-generation amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes v1-v3 region to assess the influence of 19 differentherbaceous plant species on their own rhizosphere bacterial community.

dispersion did not differ significantly among species f17154 0.494 p 0.957. however it did differ significantly between the initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils f1170 10.607 p 0.001 which reflects the less variable bacterial community composition in rhizosphere soils as compared to the initial soil substrate .interestingly there was no significant correlation between phylogenetic distance among plant species and rhizospherebacterial community dissimilarity mantel r 0.09 n 86 p 0.99. this strongly suggests that bacterial communities were no more dissimilar between distantly related spanning five different plant orders than they were between more closely related plant species e.g.

our objectives were to i quantify how many species-level bacterial taxa respond in a plant-species specific manner ii address the role of the rare biosphere in shaping the rhizosphere bacterial community and iii determine whether plant phylogeny has an influence on the rhizosphere bacterial community.materials and methodsplant mesocosmswe used 19 herbaceous mostly perennial grassland species  that had been previously analyzed in a plant-soilfeedback experiment for their relationship between specific growth rates and biotic soil effects by .

variation in bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere soils was also not significantly explained by the amount of biomass accumulated by plants during the incubation period of 14 weeks f184  1.684 p  0.082 r2  0.02.positive plant-specific responders constitute on average 1 of the bacterial otu richness in the rhizosphereeach plant species had a small subset of 18-111 otus that responded specifically either positive or negative to that plant species only .

phyla or classes that harbored exclusively positive responders were dominated by the chloroflexi and parcubacteria out of seven phylaclasses in total while exclusively negative responders were restricted to the tenericutes spirochaetes hydrogenedetes and unclassified proteobacteria .in rhizosphere soils the sum of normalized sequence counts of all common positive responders corresponded on average totable 2  permutational analysis of variance permanova assessing dissimilarity of rhizosphere bacterial communities according to soil incubation and plant species identity using a bray-curtis dissimilarity matrix.dfmsf-valuer2whole communitysoil incubation119.671251.560.55species identity170.1551.990.07soil incubation x species identity170.14891.900.07residual1360.078subset of specific responders after incubationand acidobacteria in descending order 20 responders.

however how taxa within this rare biosphere respond to growth of different plant species is not well-understood.to assess how the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community is shaped by different plant species we used 19 herbaceous plant species grown independently in a common soil substrate.

we did this to assess how much variation in these subsets was explained by plant identity.finally in order to assess whether similarity in rhizosphere bacterial community composition among samples was correlated with phylogenetic similarity among plants we applied a mantel test with a spearman's correlation coefficient on the phylogenetic correlation matrix of the plants and a bray-curtis dissimilarity matrix of the rhizosphere bacterial community.

this suggests that even though these otus responded in the rhizosphere of all plants in a similar way the magnitude of those responses differed according to plant species.discussionplant-specific rhizosphere bacteria belong mainly to the rare biosphereplant-species identity is one of several factors that shapes the rhizosphere bacterial community e.g.

in our study we expanded investigation of the root bacteriome to thelarge bacterial diversity represented by low-abundance bacteria         and analyzed how this rare biosphere shapes the plant species-specific root bacteriome.already at the level of individual bacterial phyla or proteobacterial classes it was evident that changes in the rare biosphere drive a substantial part of the bacterial community shift between the initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils.

if these small subsets of responding bacteria influence plant performance then these findings would agree with a recent meta-analysis which found no plant phylogenetic signal in the strength of plant-soil feedback effects  .the rhizosphere bacterial community is strongly influenced by common respondersthe observed community shifts between the initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils  were strongly influenced by aroughly equally large number of abundant and low-abundance otus that significantly responded in the presence of all tested plant species  and table s3.

the observed increase in alpha diversity was paralleled by a trend toward larger bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna gene copy numbers in the rhizosphere soils supplementary table s1 as revealed by qpcr analysis across seven selected plant species representing the five analyzed plant orders.the initial soil substrate and rhizosphere soils were dominated by bacteria belonging to the phyla proteobacteria classes alpha- beta- gamma- and deltaproteobacteria bacteroidetes chloroflexi parcubacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria verrucomicrobia planctomycetes or unclassified bacteria with each of these phyla constituting more than 1 relative abundance of the detected 16s rrna genes and .

in addition variation in bacterial community composition among plant species was also significant but much smaller 7. a significant interaction between plant-species identity and incubation indicated that bacterial communities responded differently depending upon plant species and this interaction explained 7 of the variation .

we repeated the permanova described above for the subsets of bacterial otus that responded either commonly to all plant species or specifically to one plant species only using the rhizosphere soils.
