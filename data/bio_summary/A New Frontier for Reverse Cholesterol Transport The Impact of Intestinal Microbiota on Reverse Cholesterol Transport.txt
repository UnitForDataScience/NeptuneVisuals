the findings of mistry et al14 also suggest pos- sibilities for new approaches to increasing rct.a direct approach is to reduce the load of intestinal bac- teria and intriguingly low-dose antibiotics have been used to reduce trimethylamine production in the human intestine15 but it should be noted that antibiotic trials in humans set up to test the hypothesis that certain microorganisms such as chla- mydia may directly infect the arterial wall have not shown any cardiovascular benefit.16 however if bacterial species respon- sible for decreasing rct could be identified and eliminated with selective antibiotics this would be ideal therapeutically sufficient and less disruptive to the intestinal microbiota than broad-spectrum antibiotics.another approach is to use probiotics live microorganisms that either inhibit or promote various species in the intestinal microbiota.

therefore further studies are needed to investigate whether the present findings translate into the clinical setting.386arterioscler thromb vasc biolmarch 2017in summary the study of mistry et al14 focuses on the observation that the absence of intestinal microbiota increases rct suggesting that the intestinal microbiota might be a new therapeutic target for enhancing rct leading to the preven- tion of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.

in human studies it has been shown that the capacity of hdl to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages ex vivo is inversely related to the risk of cardiovascular disease even after adjusting for hdl-c levels.45 furthermore although niacin treatment raises hdl levels in statin-treated patients it does not augment cholesterol efflux which could explain lack of efficacy of niacin.6 in view of this an increasing num- ber of studies have investigated the hypothesis that specific therapies such as those using reconstituted hdl and various drugs could increase cholesterol efflux and rct and thereby improve cardiovascular outcomes.7-9see accompanying article on page 419.our microbiota has been linked to intestinal health immune function bioactivation of nutrients and vitamins and recently complex disease phenotypes such as obesity and insulin resistance.10 interestingly recent studies in this regard by wang et al11 and tang et al12 showed that intestinal microbial processing of dietary choline to trimethylamine which is further metabolized to trimethylamineoxide by flavin monoxygenases in human and rodent livers was significantlyfrom the division of neurology anti-aging and vascular medicine department of internal medicine national defense medical college tokorozawa japan k.n.

these findings suggest a new concept that specific combinations of intestinal microbiota and host genetics may provide cardio- metabolic regulation.in this issue of arteriosclerosis thrombosis and vascular biology mistry et al14 show that complete absence of intesti- nal microbiota significantly enhances in vivo macrophage-to- feces rct mainly affecting the fecal bile acid fraction.

a new frontier for reverse cholesterol transportthe impact of intestinal microbiota on reverse cholesterol transportkazuhiro nakaya shunichi takiguchi katsunori ikewakiumerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c levelsare inversely associated with cardiovascular risk.1 however despite intense efforts to develop new pharmacological strate- gies to increase hdl-c levels such as with niacin and choles- teryl ester transfer protein inhibitors few robust associations with improved clinical outcomes have been observed.2 this failure of hdl-raising interventions has been accompanied by a shift toward gaining a more rigorous basic understanding of hdl as a molecule with multiple functions that can be dif- ferentiated from simple measures of hdl-c mass.3 reverse cholesterol transport rct is a pivotal pathway involved in the return of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion in the bile and eventually the feces.

these findings add to those of previous studies showing the importance of the intestinal microbiota to hdl metabolism and development of atherosclerosis.

in addition there are large dif- ferences between rodents and humans regarding bile acid and cholesterol metabolism.19 furthermore they do not address a possible effect of intestinal microbiota on atherosclerosis.

in the light of their study it would be of substantial interest to determine the impact of intestinal microbiota on rct in patients with atherosclerotic risk.

if such an impact were found it should then be considered whether specific targeting of intestinal microbiota would improve hdl func- tionality and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with athero- sclerotic risk.disclosuresnone.referencesbarter p gotto am larosa jc maroni j szarek m grundy sm kastelein jj bittner v fruchart jc treating to new targets investigators.

furthermore koeth et al13 found that trimethylamineoxide suppressed rct via an intestinal microbiota-dependent mechanism in vivo.

they show that plasma cholesterol levels and mass fecal neutral ste- rol excretion are not altered whereas fecal bile acid excretion is reduced in the absence of intestinal bacteria.

in a mouse model carrying a humanized micro- biota administration of a certain probiotic reduced trimethyl- amineoxide production whereas another probiotic increased it.17 also previous clinical studies have shown that probiotics improved the low-density lipoproteinhdl ratio as well as blood pressure inflammatory mediators blood glucose levels and body mass index.18 it would therefore be interesting to investigate the effect of probiotics on hdl metabolism and rct in humans in future studies.although the above findings are extremely provoca- tive cholesterol profiles in the absence of intestinal bacteria observed in the study by mistry et al14 and other previous studies have varied.
