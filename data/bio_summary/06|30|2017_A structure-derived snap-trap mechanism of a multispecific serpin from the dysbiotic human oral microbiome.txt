Miropin is an elongated ellipsoid with two similar equatorial semi-axes of35 A and a long vertical semi-axis of 80 A Fig.

f3-Strand s4A from sheet sA absent in A is shown in the colors of the corresponding segment of A and labeled.

F fragment of refined native miropin depicting the five strands of sheet A from left to right s6A s5A s3A s2A and s1A strand s1C in magenta and the RCL in orange superposed with the final refined 2mFobs - DFcalc-type Fourier map turquoise mesh shown with a zone radius of 2 A and a contour level of 1u.

trypsin to 1.6 A resolution and subtilisin to 1.7 A resolutionTable 1 which cleaved the RCL at bonds P2-P1 and P1-P1' respectively.

The insertion is accounted for by a horizontal sliding motion a rigid-body left shift of strands s6A and s5A of up to 2 A and a right shift of strands s3A s2A and s1A of maximally 3.5 A Fig.

Antithrombin had the closest similarity to both native miropin antithrombin PDB code 3KCG 76 Z score  48.2 RMSD  2.1 A length of alignment  370 residues 419 residues in total 27 sequence identity and induced miropin antithrombin PDB code 1ATT 77 Z score  50.2 RMSD  1.4 A length of alignment  356 residues 420 residues in total 29 sequence identity.In turn sequence identity searches revealed close matches within bacteria see Fig.

The final coordinates of native trypsin-in- duced and subtilisin-induced wild-type miropin as well as of trypsin-induced miropin mutant V367KK368A were depos- ited in the PDB with respective access codes 5NCS 5NCT 5NCU and 5NCW.traces RMSD value of 0.9 A so molecule A was used for the presentation of the results and discussion.The structure of subtilisin-induced wild-type miropin was solved by molecular replacement with the protein coordinates of trypsin-induced miropin after omitting segments Glu353- Lys368 and Ser373-Ile381 and the trypsin dipeptide.

A phylogenetic tree was constructed with PHYML 101 using LG as substitution model with 100 bootstrapping replicates 4 substitution rates optimization in topologylengthrate and topology search based on near- est-neighbor interchange and subtree-pruning and regraft- ing within the Geneious platform.ReferencesLeevvenhoeck A.
