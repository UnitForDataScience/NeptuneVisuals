The microbial biomass was analyzed by phospholipid fatty acids PLFAs and the microbially medi- ated ecosystem multifunctionality was studied by the integration of soil enzyme activities related to the cycles of C N and P. The microbial biomass and ecosystem multifunctionality decreased in drought-plots as a consequence of the lower soil moisture and poorer plant development but this decrease was more notable in unthinned plots.

Furthermore the response of a microbial community to drought may depend on the physiological tolerance and metabolic flexibility of the microbiome Allison  Martiny 2008.The soil microbial community is a complex blackbox that requires a multi-conceptual approach Hultman et al.

Recently the increasing application of soil metaproteomics has provided unprecedented in-depth characteriza- tion of the composition and functionality of active microbial com- munities giving deeper insights into terrestrial microbial ecology Chourey et al.

2016 Keiblinger Fuchs Zechmeister-Boltenstern  Riedel 2016.We hypothesized that the active soil microbial community willbe more sensitive to drought and forest management than the total microbial community.

Particularly we aim i to evaluate the impacts of 6 years of induced drought on the diversity biomass and activity of the microbial community in a semiarid forest ecosystem and ii to show whether forest manage- ment thinning influences the resistance of the microbial commu- nity to induced drought.

To achieve these objectives several properties were evaluated including soil enzyme activities microbial biomass and the diversity and composition of the total and active microbial communities by genomic and metaproteomic approaches.

Composition diversity and structure of the active microbial communityOverall all populations that were computed as dominant in the active microbial community by proteomics could be found in the total microbiome by genomics with just some exceptions at genus level Piriformospora Gematirosa Fibroporia Rhodovulum and Cylin- drodendrum.

The impacts of drought on soil microbial biomass can be explained through direct effects mediated by the lower soil moisture indFI GU RE 5 The composition of the active microbial community derived by metaprotoemics.

The abundance of total microbial populations was analyzed by genomics 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing and the abundance of active microbial populations was analyzed by metaproteomics.
