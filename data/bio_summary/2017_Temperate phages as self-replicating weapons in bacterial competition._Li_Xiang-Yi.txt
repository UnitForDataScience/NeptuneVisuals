cell by a free phage 4 followed by phage replication 5 and release of the new phages 6.

We approximate those losses by assuming that phage dynamics are much faster than bacterial dynamics implying that the phage density quickly reaches its asymptotic value P for which dPdt  0 where the bacterial densities C and D are essentially free parameters.

As we will now show the contributions of these two pathways to phage growth behave very differently as the relative initial abundances of the two bacteria change.Contribution of the lytic cycleThe lytic life cycle is known to be especially effective at high host densities when each phage particle quickly finds a new host.

If the host density is too low however the losses through phage decay are not outweighed by reproduction the phage can thus not invade the host population and is eventually lost from the system.

the minimum host density that allows positive phage growth - can be calculated explicitly by observing that if there is only lytic reproduction d f   0 for all f  we havedPmdt  0  f  1 - b ph B .11This implies that with lytic reproduction alone the phage can grow and have a substantial impact on Duganella sp.

when it is rare it will eventually reach the replication threshold of the phage but it does so too late for the phage to grow to substantial densities before nutrients are depleted.See Fig.

growth rate is inde- pendent of both the phage and the presence of Duganella sp.Contribution of the lysogenic cycleLet us now turn to phage reproduction via the lysogenic pathway denoted by dC D in Eqn 2.

However lysogenic production alone is generally not enough to sustain the phage at high densities and lytic reproduction is still necessary for the phage to reach densities at which it has a visible impact on Duganella sp.
