Those data strengthen the essential role played by the intestinal microbiota bacteria but also fungi in triggering intestinal inflammation following Card9 impairment2.local production of IL22 by innate lymphoid cells and Tcells6.

Bilophila wadsworthia and colitis in Il10 mice10 the study from Lamas et al2 is a good example of the positive interplay between diet and the intestinal microbiota leading to the generation of microbial metabolites that play a central role in the protection against intestinal inflammation.Finally in their study Lamas et al2 further corroborated the results obtained in mice with the analysis of samples from IBD patients and demonstrated that such patients have a reduced fecal AHR activity and fecal levels of tryptophan.

A study published in the June 2016 issue of Nature Medicine by Lamas et al2 made significant progress in this area by investigating how a gene predisposing to IBD Card9 encoding the caspase recruitment domaincontaining protein 9 leads to a colitogenic microbiota by impairing its ability to generate tryptophanderived metabolite.In their study the authors reported that the deletion of Card9 gene a central component of the innate anti fungal immune response render mice more prone to chemicallyinduced colitis by dextran sulfate sodium DSS2.

Indoles derivatives are ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor AHR that can drivesCOMMENTARY ON HOT TOPICSThe human intestinal tract harbors a complex com munity including 100 trillion of microbes referred as intestinal microbiota.

Previous studies focusing on the amino acid trypto phan demonstrated that mice fed with a lowtrypto phan diet became susceptible to chemically induced inflammation7 and conversely mice or piglets fed with a tryptophan supplemented diet have a reduced inflammation and a decreased severity of DSS-induced colitis89.As a therapeutic strategy the authors next postulated that altering the intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible host so as to increase its ability to generate AHR ligands could protect from intestinal inflammation.

The etiology of IBD is still not well defined but evidence suggest that it results from per turbation of the homeostasis between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system with the involvement of both genetic and environmental factors.

IBD arise as a complex interaction between host genetic factors mucosal immune system intestinal dysbiosis and environmental factors among which dietary compounds being increa singly appreciated in the onset of inflammatory related disorders.

Thus the authors demonstrated that supplementation with three commensal Lactobacilllus strains with high tryptophan-metabolic activities was sufficient to restore intestinal IL22 production and to reverse the colitis susceptibility observed in susceptible Card9 mice.

In light of the close relationship occurring between the intestinal microbiota and dietary intake such data further highlight the need of controlling both macro and micronutrients consumption in IBD patients with genetic predisposition.In the same issue of Nature Medicine an additional study by Rothhammer et al12 also expand the sub stantial effect of tryptophan in regulating inflammation by focusing their study on the central nervous systemEtienneMesmin L et al .
