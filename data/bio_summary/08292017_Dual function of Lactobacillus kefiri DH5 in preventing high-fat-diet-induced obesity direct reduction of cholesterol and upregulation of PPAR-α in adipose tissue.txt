kefiri DH5 upregulated PPAR-a FABP4 and CPT1 expression in the epididymal adipose tissues 2.29- 1.77- and 2.05-fold change respectively suggesting a reduction in adiposity by stimulating fatty acid oxidation.Conclusion L. kefiri DH5 exerts anti-obesity effects by direct reduction of cholesterol in the lumen and upregulation of PPAR-a gene in adipose tissues.KeywordsCholesterol reduction  High fat diet  Lactobacillus kefiri  Obesity  PPAR-aReceived March 14 2017Revised June 2 2017Accepted June 27 2017IntroductionObesity is becoming endemic in developed countries and is currently considered an important risk factor of metabolic syndrome including diabetes hepatic steatosis and cirrho- sis and cardiovascular diseases 1 2.

10-oxo-12 Z-octadecenoic acid a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria potently activates PPARy and stim- ulates adipogenesis.

The Chow-Saline and HFD- Saline groups were orally administered 0.2 mL of 0.9 steril- ized saline while the Chow-DH5 and HFD-DH5 groups were given 0.2 mL of 0.9 sterilized saline containing 2 x 108 cfu of L. kefiri DH5.

Remarkably the adipocytes of the DH5 groups were significantly smaller than those of the other HFD-fed groups Fig.

p  0.05 p  0.001 compared to HFD-saline group analysis of variance and Tukey method.Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of epididymal adipose tissue and liverMacroscopically the livers of chow diet-fed groups had sharp margins and dark-red color whereas those of HFD-saline HFD-DH4 and HFD-DH7 groups had blunt margins and yellow-red color suggesting obvious hepatic steatosis in these three groups Fig.

In addition we previously determined inhibitory effects of L. kefiri DH5 on pancreatic lipase activities and intra- cellular lipid accumulation in preadipocyte cells indicating possible anti-obesity action in vivo data not published.In this study L. kefiri DH5 exerted a more potent anti- obesity effect in HFD-fed mice than Leuc.

Based on these results L. kefiri DH5 administra- tion alleviates dysbiosis of gut microbiota induced by HFD 16.Based on the results of the present study we developed a model for the proposed anti-obesity effects of L. kefiri DH5 in HFD-fed mice Fig.

Remarkably L. kefiri DH5 seemed to have a dual function reduction of cholesterol in vitro and acceleration of fatty acid oxidation in the adipose tis- sue in vivo.

A large proportion of the orally admin- istered L. kefiri DH5 remains active and viable in the gas- trointestinal tract and exerts po- tent anti-obesity effects in HFD- fed mice via a dual mechanismi direct reduction of excessivecholesterol in the lumen to de- crease overall fat influx and ii upregulation of genes encoding PPAR-a CPT1 and FABP4 in adi- pose tissue to increase fatty acid oxidation.that pre- and probiotics could act as effective PPAR-a agonists 7 8.

Another study reported that bifidogenic dietary fructo-oligosaccharides alleviate hepatic steatosis by stimulating fatty acid oxidation resulting from upregulation of the PPAR-a gene 36.Our study showed that administration of L. kefiri DH5 significantly upregulated the expression of PPAR-a in the epididymal adipose tissue.
