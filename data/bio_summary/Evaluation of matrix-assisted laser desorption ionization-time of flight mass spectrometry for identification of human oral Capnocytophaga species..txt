Results3.1 Identifications of strains by MALDI-TOF MS and l6S rRNA gene sequencingThe MALDI-TOF MS and l6S rRNA gene sequencing of the clinical and referenceisolates clearly identified all strains as Capnocytophaga l00 agreement at the genus leveland 4l53 77.4 were identified as the same at the species level Table l with a scorel.8 and a reproducibility 4 minimum of 3l0 replicates had MALDI confidence scoresl.8.

The five reference strains were cfxA PCR negative andsusceptible to beta-lactams.3.3 MALDI-TOF spectra similarity dendrogramThe MALDI-TOF spectra similarity dendrogram in which the strains were dispersedirrespective of their mass spectral patterns was unsuccessful in differentiating susceptibleand resistant strains data not shown.4.

The MALDI-TOF MS technique had limitedability to discriminate between C. gingivalis and C. granulosa two misidentified strains butthese species were similar as shown on the dendrogram of all Capnocytophaga speciesidentified using MALDI-TOF MS Figure l.3.2Susceptibility testingFrom the total clinical Capnocytophaga sp.

The MALDI-TOF MS method failed to detect cfxA positiveCapnocytophaga strains compared to cfxA negative strains cultured in the presence orabsence of cefotaxime.

The interpretation considered two independent parameters the value of thehomology score and the reproducibility of the identification obtained from l0measurements carried out after laser impacts where the same bacterial species must befound at least three times with the highest scores.To test if MALDI-TOF MS was able to differentiate between cfxA-negative and cfxA-positiveisolates bacterial pellets were also extracted after incubation of each isolate in the presenceof cefotaxime 0.5 mgL in Brucella broth supplemented with 5 blood and vitamin Kl lmgL under anaerobic conditions for 6 h. Identification was performed as indicated abovefrom a deposit of a drop of pellet left to dry and score-oriented dendrogram of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles werecompared.The MALDI-TOF MS spectral data resulting from the analysis of 53 isolates were processedusing the Bruker database software to identify species-specific masses that were then usedto generate dendrograms.

Distinctionbetween the cefotaxime resistant and susceptible strains was unsuccessful using the MALDI-TOF MS method.

The58classification of many described strains AHN remains uncertain.Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS is based on the protein composition of the microbial cell particularly ribosomalprotein contents and can discriminate clinical and environmental species.

In the same way we hopedto discriminate negative and positive cfxA strains culture of bacteria with cefotaxime wasalso tested to confirm the experiment.The aim of this study was to use MALDI-TOF MS for rapid species identification ofCapnocytophaga.

Thefour Capnocytophaga AHN AHN9576AHN9798AHN847lChDc strains identified by l6SrRNA sequencing were characterized as C. sputigena by MALDI-TOF MS.

The six C. leadbetteri and four C. AHN strains recognized by l6S rRNAsequencing were identified by MALDI-TOF MS as C. spp.
