Conse- quently FMT is recommended for the treatment of rCDI by international guidelines and consensus reports.The assessment of the safety and efficacy of FMT in the subset of patients studied by Hefazi et alis highly interesting for several reasons.First oncology patients have higher rates of both primary and rCDI along with complications such as toxic megacolon and treatment failure as compared with nononcology patients.In fact the increased length of stay in hospitals and the extended-care facilities as well the underlying immunosuppression together with the multiple exposures to broad-spectrum antibiotics all in- crease the risk of infection in these subjects.

In addition antineoplastic chemotherapy can alter gut microbiota and promote CDI even in the absence of antibiotic exposure.A second relevant consideration as regards the study by Hefazi et al is that FMT was effectively offered to several cancer patients who were immunocompromised by prior within the previous 12 weeks chemotherapy.

Therefore RCTs comparing the safety and ef- ficacy of FMT for the treatment of rCDI in cancer patients are clearly needed.In addition to focusing on recurrent CDI the FMT study by Hefazi et al raises an important and timely topic that is the com- plex and intriguing relationship between gut microbiota and cancer.

However it may be prudent to consider less invasive routes of administering FMT such as an enema in patients with se- vere or complicated CDI in immunocompro- mised patients with significant comorbidities.

Current evidence on the safety and ef- ficacy of FMT in cancer patients is limited consisting only of isolated case reports or heterogeneous cohorts mainly comprising pa- tients without cancer.In recent years the gut microbiota is increasingly considered an adjunct organ of the human body emerging in essence as a virtual organ with a level of complexity comparable to that of any other organ system.

Regarding the components of the gut micro- biota in these patients Bacteroides Lactoba- cillus Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium were the dominant species.This field is just at its beginning.

The resilience and stability of gut microbiota and its responsiveness to physiological environ- mental and pathological changes hold out the prospect of using the intestinal microbial composition as a biomarker a diagnostic tool andor a therapeutic target in cancer patients.

EDITORIALNovember 2017Volume 92Number 11Gut Microbiota and Cancer Patients A Broad-Ranging Relationshipn this issue of the Proceedings Hefazi et al report their experience in applying fecal microbiota transplantation FMT for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection rCDI in cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapy.

In 2014 Kelly et al reported few adverse events and no related infectious complications in immunocompromised patients including 7 with cancer receiving FMT.
