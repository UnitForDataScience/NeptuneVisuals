conse- quently fmt is recommended for the treatment of rcdi by international guidelines and consensus reports.the assessment of the safety and efficacy of fmt in the subset of patients studied by hefazi et alis highly interesting for several reasons.first oncology patients have higher rates of both primary and rcdi along with complications such as toxic megacolon and treatment failure as compared with nononcology patients.in fact the increased length of stay in hospitals and the extended-care facilities as well the underlying immunosuppression together with the multiple exposures to broad-spectrum antibiotics all in- crease the risk of infection in these subjects.

therefore rcts comparing the safety and ef- ficacy of fmt for the treatment of rcdi in cancer patients are clearly needed.in addition to focusing on recurrent cdi the fmt study by hefazi et al raises an important and timely topic that is the com- plex and intriguing relationship between gut microbiota and cancer.

editorialnovember 2017volume 92number 11gut microbiota and cancer patients a broad-ranging relationshipn this issue of the proceedings hefazi et al report their experience in applying fecal microbiota transplantation fmt for the treatment of recurrent clostridium difficile infection rcdi in cancer patients previously treated with chemotherapy.

current evidence on the safety and ef- ficacy of fmt in cancer patients is limited consisting only of isolated case reports or heterogeneous cohorts mainly comprising pa- tients without cancer.in recent years the gut microbiota is increasingly considered an adjunct organ of the human body emerging in essence as a virtual organ with a level of complexity comparable to that of any other organ system.

in addition antineoplastic chemotherapy can alter gut microbiota and promote cdi even in the absence of antibiotic exposure.a second relevant consideration as regards the study by hefazi et al is that fmt was effectively offered to several cancer patients who were immunocompromised by prior within the previous 12 weeks chemotherapy.

however it may be prudent to consider less invasive routes of administering fmt such as an enema in patients with se- vere or complicated cdi in immunocompro- mised patients with significant comorbidities.

the rate of response to fmt was 86 which is similar to a cumula- tive success rate of approximately 90 previ-ously reported in nononcology patients.this is the largest case series involving subjects with cancer treated with fmt to cure rcdi.

n november 201792111605-1607 n n a 2017 mayo foundation for medical education and research1605mayo clinic proceedingscontrolled trials systematic reviews and meta- analyses clearly demonstrate that fmt is a highly effective treatment against rcdi.because of the rise in prevalence and severity of this infection along with the attendant mortality caused by this infection the therapeutic role played by fmt is important not only in saving lives but also in decreasing the associated eco- nomic burden on health care systems.

twelve 52 had severesevere-complicated cdi at some stage and 8 35 patients had active cancer 6 of the latter had received chemotherapy within 12 weeks before fmt.

however common antibiotic therapies may progressively lose their effectiveness thereby promoting the recurrence of cdi.although an- tibiotics effectively treat cdi in general some in- dividuals may not respond to these drugs but may be cured by fmt the latter shown to be highly efficacious in preventing rcdi.fecal microbiota transplantation refers to the infusion of feces from healthy donor into a recipient patient's gastrointestinal tract aiming at restoring the normal gut microbiota in diseases or infections associated with bacterial disruption.

in 2014 kelly et al reported few adverse events and no related infectious complications in immunocompromised patients including 7 with cancer receiving fmt.

to date no study has prospectively investigated the safety and efficacy of fmt in cohorts of immunocom- promised patients.

these patients are generally excluded by fmt clinical trials because of the theoretical risk of invasive infection through bacterial translocation.

fecal micro- biota transplantation clinical guidelines there- fore recommend caution in the treatment of immunocompromised patientsas risks with fmt may be greater in these patients.

there is no specific guideline for the admin- istration of fmt in cancer patients in terms of donor screening amount of stool infusedroute of administration or follow-up obser- vation.
