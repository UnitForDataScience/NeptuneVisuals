Dietary modulation of gut microbiota contributes to alleviation of both genetic and simple obesity in children EBioMedicine vol.

For the aspect of obesity the research team of Jeffrey Gordon learned that differences of gut microbial communities were associated with obesity and that obesity would lead to reducing the diversity of microorganisms .

We recommend that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus might be used as indicators of healthy conditions among obese children as well as a kind of prebiotic and probiotic supplement in the diet to be an auxiliary treatment for obesity.IntroductionObesity isa condition mainly caused by an alteration in ener- gy intake shifting towards positive energy balance which can be influenced by genetic and environmental factors The prevalence of obesity is increasing at an epidemic rate globally with more than one billion adults overweight and at least 300 million of them clinically obese Morbid obesity is known to be accompanied by serious health conditions including hypertension type 2 diabetes cardiovascular dis- eases stroke and venous thromboembolism A large number of diverse microbial species reside in the distal gastrointestinal tract and gut microbiota dysbiosis results in the imbalance of the composition and function of these intestinal microbes To date many studies demon- strate that gut microbes play a great role in disease rangingfrom localized gastroenterologic disorders to neurologic respiratory hepatic and cardiovascular illness and metabolic related syndromes In particular the fundamental role of gut microbiota in regulation and pathogenesis of metabolic disorders has attracted interest of more and more researchers in recent years.

However to which extent and through which mechanism the gut microbiota contributes to obesity development have not yet been elucidated.In this present study we recruited 87 obese children and adolescents as the case group and 56 healthy children and adolescents as the control group to analyze the community composition of gut microbiota between them and to further reveal potential microbial functional characteristics of obese children.Method and MaterialsCohort in This Study.

To our knowledge Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus might be used as indicators of healthy conditions among obese children and adolescents as well as a kind of prebiotic and probiotic supplement in the diet to be an auxiliary treatment in obesity.ConclusionIn summary from the present study we learned that the gut microbiota composition was significantly different between obese children and the healthy cohort which included bac- teria categories of Enterococcus Blautia Sutterella Klebsiella and Collinsella which were enriched in obese children while Bacteroides Parabacteroides Anaerotruncus and Coprobacil- lus were enriched in healthy controls.
