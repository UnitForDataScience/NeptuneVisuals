studies with other anti-inflammatory agents such as prednisone or hydroxychloroquine produced completely negative results .anti-obesity drugs that act on the cnsthe potential of targeting behavioral feeding circuitries is evident by the capacity of selective cannabinoid receptor type-1 cb1 inhibition to ameliorate rodent and human obesity  obesity drugs directly act on neural pathways that influence eating behavior  of food hedonics in combination with the archetypical anorectic and thermogenic pathways is likely to yield hitherto unparalleled pharmacological efficacy to reverse human obesity and to maintain a leaner phenotype.

therefore gut microbiota dysbiosis may be implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity and cognitive decline through its impact on local and systemic inflammation.pharmacological approachesseveral studies have shown that alterations of the gut microbial composition can induce changes in inflamma- tory status body composition and brain functioning raising the possibility of therapeutic manipulation of the microbiome for the treatment of diseases.antiinflammatory drugs for obesity and adold salicylates and new compounds essentially mono- clonal antibodies which are able to tackle various inflam- mation targets have already been tested in clinical trials in patients with insulin resistance metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus.

in addition studies performed in rodent models of obesity show that inflammation also occurs within the brain particularly in areas involved in mood regulation and memory formation such as the hippocam- pus or the cortex .peripheral cytokines can act on the brain to induce local production of cytokines .

although it is not possible to exclude the direct effect of host metabolism on brain function such findings do suggest that diet-induced changes in the intestinal micro- biome substantially influence brain function.thus we believe that changes in the gut microbiota may have occurred first and triggered an inflammatorypathway from the gut to the brain.

moreover accumulating evidence indicates that obesity during mid-life increases the risk of dementias such as alzheimer's disease ad later in life .in light of the high numbers of overweight and obese individuals there is a clear need to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning obesity and the accompanying impact on cognitive function.

the precise mechanisms that underlie the connections between obesity and the risk of cognitive impairment are still largely unknown but potential avenues of further research include insulin resistance the gut- brain axis and systemic mediators and central inflammation processes.

for example clinical and experimental evidence indicates that obesity andor high fat feeding are associated with deficits in learning memory and executive functioning  and potentially brain atrophy .

the gut microbiome has a substantial impact on brain function  dietary factors .inflammation a possible link between obesity and adsystemic inflammationobesity is presently considered not only as a metabolic disorder but also as an inflammatory disease affecting both innate and acquired immune system function .

the implications of this new insight are only beginning to become apparent however the potential value offigure 1schematic representation of the putative link between the intestinal microbiome obesity and cognitive decline.microbiome analyses in revealing mechanisms that underpin altered brain development and mental illness is hugely exciting.

this review aims to provide an overview of the approved anti- obesity drugs and newer molecules that could affect different targets in the central nervous system or peripheral tissues the molecular mechanisms emerging dietary treatments and phytogenic compoundsin this review roles of gut microbiome in shaping brain development and neurological function are examined and the mechanisms by which it can contribute to mental illness.

it is now thought that through this gut- brain pathway microbiota can affect brain plasticity and cognitive function.communication between gut microbiome and cns the connection between cns and the gastro-intestinal gi tract is well established and it is essential in the modulation of gut function and homeostasis.

these findings indicate that the pres- ence of commensal bacteria in the gut is critical for normal brain development and raise the possibility that bacteria may influence brain plasticity and cognition later in life.it has been suggested that the processes of age-related gut dysbiosis and neurological decline are linked through the former mediating chronic low-grade inflammation as a common basis for a broad spectrum of age-related pathologies  gut dysbiosis could contribute to cognitive decline including direct inflammatory stimulation the production of pro-inflammatory metabolites and the loss of immune- regulatory function.

however there is now accumulating evidence that this peripheral inflammation precipitates central inflamma- tion within the brain that alters synaptic plasticity con- tributes to neurodegeneration and even initiates brain atrophy.

some human clinical studies have evidenced that obesity is related to the risk of the development of mild cognitive impairment in the form of short-term memory and executive function deficits as well as dementia and alzheimer's disease.
