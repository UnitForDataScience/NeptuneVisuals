taken together these data demonstrate that both l-la and d-la elicit an anti-inflammatory response from frt epithelial cell lines and prevent tlr-induced inflammation and that this effect is mediated by the protonated form of la which predominates at low ph.l-la elicits an anti-inflammatory response from primary cervicovaginal epithelial cells and tissuesthe anti-inflammatory effect of l-la observed in frt epithelial cell lines was next confirmed using primary vaginal-ectocervical epithelial cells cultured on transwells.

frt epithelial cells possess toll-like receptor tlr pathogen recognition receptors and respond to both commensal bacteria and invading pathogens by producing cytokines and immune mediators.vaginal dysbioses and low lactobacillus abun- dance microbiota are associated with genital inflammation in vivoand in vitro co-culture studies demonstrate that bv-associated bacteria directly elicit pro-inflammatory cyto- kine production from cervicovaginal epithelial cells and tissue models.in contrast co-culture of frt epithelial cells with vaginal lactobacillus spp.

these data demonstrate that frt epithelial cells cultured in our transwell system can tolerate apically applied la at low ph found in the frt.l-la elicits an anti-inflammatory response from unstimulated cervicovaginal epithelial cellsgiven the ability of cultured lactobacilli to dampen the inflammatory response of cervicovaginal epithelial cells and that la is the major organic acid metabolite in womenarticleswith lactobacillus-dominated microbiotawe asked whether la produced by these bacteria could reproduce this effect.

on cervicovaginal epithelial cells from the frt to determine whether the positive sexual health outcomes associated with lactobacilli may be mediated through an immunomodulatory effect of la on epithelial cells of the frt.we found that la acts directly on cervicovaginal epithelial cells to induce an anti-inflammatory state characterized byarticlesfigure 6 l-lactic acid l-la inhibits pro-inflammatory immune mediator production at a stage prior to gene transcription.

pro-inflammatory factors including mip3a and il-8 are associated with increased activation and recruitment of hiv target cd4 t cells into the genital mucosa and disruption of tight junctions between epithelial cellsfacilitating the passage of virions through the epithelial layer.

on cervicovaginal epithelial cells and determined its role in decreasing inflam- mation elicited by viral and bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns and seminal plasma.resultscervicovaginal epithelial cells cultured in transwells remain viable in the presence of physiological concentrations of lathe average physiological la concentration in the vaginal lumen of women with lactobacillus-dominated microbiota is 1.0-0.2 wv and the vaginal ph ranges from 2.8 to 4.2. however the presence of mucus and the stratified structure of the vaginal epithelium that includes surface layers of flattened dead cellsmeans that viable cells within the basal layers of the epithelium are likely exposed to la concentrations o1.

furthermore transelectrical epithelial resistance teer measurements from ect epithelial cells confirmed that treatment with 0.3 l-la did not alter the integrity of the cell monolayer supplementary figure 1b.

these data demonstrate that l-la acts directly on cervicovaginal epithelial cell lines to dampen the production of pro-inflammatory mediators elicited by bacterial and viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns and mediates the production of il-1ra in the absence or presence of these pathogen-associated molecular patterns.the anti-inflammatory effect of l-la on cervicovaginal epithelial cell lines is not due to acidity alonegiven the observation that the anti-inflammatory effect of la was only observed at low ph we next confirmed that the effect was not solely due to acidity alone.

a similar trend was also observed for il-8 and mip3a production supplementary figure 5ab and this effect was reproduced in a different preparation of vaginal epithelial cells ''v19'' supplementary figure 5c-h. moreover treatment with 0.3 l-la ph 3.9 significantly increased the production of il-1ra from primary epithelial cells .

for these experiments we used the epivaginal reconstructed human vaginal epithelial tissue model vec-100 mattek which is composed of healthy primary vaginal epithelial cells in a highly differentiatedarticlesfigure 4 l-lactic acid l-la elicits an anti-inflammatory response from both primary vaginal-ectocervical cells and an organotypic tissue model of female reproductive tract epithelium.

we therefore conducted a stimulation time course of ect cells treated with l-la in the absence or presence of pic for 1-18 h and confirmed that even 0.5 h stimulation with l-la was able to elicit significant levels of il-1ra production and abolish pic-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production supplementary figure 6.l-la mediates an anti-inflammatory effect on frt epithelial cells exposed to either cervicovaginal or seminal fluids in vivo frt epithelial cells are exposed to cervicovaginal fluid cvf which contains a milieu of immunomodulatory factors that can influence cellular activation and response to stimula- tion.
