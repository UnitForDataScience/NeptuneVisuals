The chicks were assigned into four groups of 25 chicks each in floor pens using a Completely Randomized Design consisting of a negative control a positive control and two treatment groups.

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test on relative abundances of microbial domains revealed that group B included a higher number of DNA viruses compared to the other groups kh2 7.21 P 0.06 whereas no significant differences in the number of bacteria were observed among all the groups .

A higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in group A kh2 7.20 P 0.06 was detected whereas a higher abundance of Firmicutes in groups B and C was observed compared to the other groups kh2 8.74 P 0.03.

Core resistomes of the treatment groups were generated in the following way 112 79 and 103 ARGs in the resistomes from group A 129 124 and 121 ARGs in group B 108 102 and 115 ARGs in group C and finally 94 111 and 80 ARGs in group D. Based on gene functions the identified ARGs in individual samples were further assigned to 14 groups resistance to aminocoumarin aminoglycosides beta-lactam sulfonamides bacitracin chloramphenicol fluoroquinolone transferable element based glycopeptide antibiotics trimethoprim macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B polymyxin streptothricin tetracyclines and efflux pump conferring resistance.

In this study percentages of ARGs associated with efflux pump mediated antibiotic resistance in core resistomes of groups A B C and D were 39.1 49.5 46.6 and 39.1 respectively.A total of 52 ARGs from 10 out of 14 ARG groups showed coexistence in all of the core resistomes.

Relative abundances of aminoglycoside bacitracin fluoroquinolone transferable elements polymyxin streptothricin tetracycline and efflux pump conferring ARGs were higher in group B compared2variation in the cecal resistomes from group B compared to the other groups PERMANOVA F 7.77 R2 0.74 P 0.004while resistomes from groups A C and D clustered together which indicate that BPE supplementation may be safe in terms of development and transfer of ARGs among microbial communities .To conclude in this study we discovered BPE supplementation in water increased the mean body weight of chickens by 5.8 and caused an AGP-like pattern in the cecal bacterial community with a comparative increase of Firmicutes and a concomitant reduction of Bacteroidetes in chicken ceca.

We conducted two trials with 100 Cobb-500 broiler chicks in each trial in four equal groups that were provided water with no supplementation supplemented with AGP tylosin neomycin sulfate bacitracin erythromycin and oxytetracycline or supplemented with 0.1 g Gallic acid equivalent GAEL or 1.0 g GAEL during the last 72 h before euthanasia of BPE for 6 weeks.

Initially the Bray-Curtis distance matrix and the FirmicutesBacteroidetes FB ratio were determined for each sample in each treatment group groups A B C and D. Samples within a treatment group that clustered together and possessed an FB value ranging from 0.10 to 10.0 FB is a gauge of overall gut microbiota balance and associated with AGP supplementation and weight gain in animals were determined to be the core microbiome representing that group and these samples were selected for further analysis total 12 samples 3 from each group       .

The organ weight to whole body weight ratios were the same for spleen P 0.844 liver P 0.548 heart P 0.560 and pancreas P 0.599 among chickens from all four groups .
