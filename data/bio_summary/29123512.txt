a numeric reduction in the mean relative abundance of bacteria was noticed in group b compared to the other groups kh2 1.67 p 0.64. unpaired t-test analysis on relative abundance of archaea demonstrated significantly higher numbers in groups b and c compared to group a p 0.049 and 0.031. investigation into the biological significance of increased archaeal population in the microbiomes from groups b and c revealed that influence of archaeal communities in poultry gutis still an understudied area.

the chicks were assigned into four groups of 25 chicks each in floor pens using a completely randomized design consisting of a negative control a positive control and two treatment groups.

kruskal-wallis rank sum test on relative abundances of microbial domains revealed that group b included a higher number of dna viruses compared to the other groups kh2 7.21 p 0.06 whereas no significant differences in the number of bacteria were observed among all the groups .

methanogenic archaea in the gi tract consume h2 and helpabundances of bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria ranged between 44.6-64.3 10.3- 21.5 and 5.0-9.1 respectively supplementary file 2. in groups b and c bacterial phyla distribution was dominated by firmicutes 29.45 and 36.46 followed by bacteroidetes 23.62 and 31.11 and proteobacteria 21.29 and 7.55. differences in the community composition were observed among the different treatment groups.

a higher relative abundance of bacteroidetes in group a kh2 7.20 p 0.06 was detected whereas a higher abundance of firmicutes in groups b and c was observed compared to the other groups kh2 8.74 p 0.03. group b possessed highest relative abundance of proteobacteria kh2 5.05 p 0.17. this finding was supported by  who also reported that non-therapeutic concentration of chlortetracycline sulfamethazine and penicillin administered to piglets increased the prevalence of proteobacteria.

both transferable args and efflux pump mediatory args were present in these core resistomes supplementary file 4. core resistomes of the treatment groups were generated in the following way 112 79 and 103 args in the resistomes from group a 129 124 and 121 args in group b 108 102 and 115 args in group c and finally 94 111 and 80 args in group d. based on gene functions the identified args in individual samples were further assigned to 14 groups resistance to aminocoumarin aminoglycosides beta-lactam sulfonamides bacitracin chloramphenicol fluoroquinolone transferable element based glycopeptide antibiotics trimethoprim macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b polymyxin streptothricin tetracyclines and efflux pump conferring resistance.

in this study percentages of args associated with efflux pump mediated antibiotic resistance in core resistomes of groups a b c and d were 39.1 49.5 46.6 and 39.1 respectively.a total of 52 args from 10 out of 14 arg groups showed coexistence in all of the core resistomes.

we conducted two trials with 100 cobb-500 broiler chicks in each trial in four equal groups that were provided water with no supplementation supplemented with agp tylosin neomycin sulfate bacitracin erythromycin and oxytetracycline or supplemented with 0.1 g gallic acid equivalent gael or 1.0 g gael during the last 72 h before euthanasia of bpe for 6 weeks.

initially the bray-curtis distance matrix and the firmicutesbacteroidetes fb ratio were determined for each sample in each treatment group groups a b c and d. samples within a treatment group that clustered together and possessed an fb value ranging from 0.10 to 10.0 fb is a gauge of overall gut microbiota balance and associated with agp supplementation and weight gain in animals were determined to be the core microbiome representing that group and these samples were selected for further analysis total 12 samples 3 from each group       .

the organ weight to whole body weight ratios were the same for spleen p 0.844 liver p 0.548 heart p 0.560 and pancreas p 0.599 among chickens from all four groups .

however higher alpha-diversity index values chao1 ace shannon simpson invsimpson and fisher were noticed in groups b and c compared to the control groupa .

the nmds plot and permanova analysis on the bray-curtis distances among the microbial taxa revealed similarity between microbial communities in groups b and c though statistical significance at an alpha of 0.05 was not detected in this relationship permanova f 2.11 r2 0.44 p 0.095 .

it is important to note that proteobacteria include a wide variety of human pathogens such as escherichia campylobacter salmonella helicobacter pseudomonas and many other notable pathogenic genera.significant variation in the mean firmicutes to bacteroidetesfb ratio 0.32 1.32 1.09 and 0.46 in groups a b c and d respectively was observed p 0.01. spearman correlation analysis indicated a positive correlation between fb ratio to chicken body weight spearman r 0.70 p 0.01 .
