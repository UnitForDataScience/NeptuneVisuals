In Vivo EPS Formation by L. reuteri 35-5Growth of L. reuteri 35-5 on MRS agar supplemented with different carbon sources forming slimy sucrose maltodextrins or non-slimy colonies glucose.One-dimensional 1H NMR analysis of the EPS extracted from slimy colonies on agar plates with sucrose and maltodextrins showed that their composition is comparable with respect to glycosidic linkage type a-14 and a-16.SEC analysis of the EPS extracted from slimy colonies on agar plates revealed that the extracellular polysaccharides derived from either sucrose or mal- todextrins are similar in size distribution 30 MDa.

Therefore both NMR and SEC results suggest that providing L. reuteri 35-5 with either sucrose or maltodextrins as a carbon source results in formation of EPS with a similar linkage and size distribution.PAS-stained SDS-PAGE gel of whole-cell proteins of L. reuteri 35-5 grown in the presence of either sucrose sucrose  maltodextrin or maltodextrin revealing the association of bands corresponding to the molecular weights of either the glucansucrase GtfA 199 kDa or the 46-a-glucanotransferase GtfB 179 kDa with the production of sucrose-derived EPS or of maltodextrin-derived EPS respectively.

subfamilies 4 and 18.In Vivo ExperimentsGrowth of a fructansucrase-negative mutant of L. reuteri 121 L. reuteri 35-5 on either sucrose or maltodextrins containing 5 a-16 linkages and 95 a-14 linkages on agar plates re- sulted in the formation of transparent colonies surrounded by a slimy halo A in contrast growth on glucose did not yield such halos.

Active-Site Comparison of a 46-a-GT and a GSA and B Comparison of L. reuteri 121 GtfB-DNDV this work molecule A of the asymmetric unit is shown A with the L. reuteri 180 Gtf180-DN - su- crose complex B cvcZv.

The bound saccharides make only a few interactions with the protein the interacting residues are not conserved in 46-a-GTs.Genomic and Phylogenetic AnalysisQuerying the NCBI database with the L. reuteri 121 GtfB sequence yielded 47 putative 46-a-GTs identity 50 mostly in Lactobacillus strains.

Thus as shown by our in vivo experiments  L. reuteri strains with 46-a-GTGS gene pairs have an additional advantage of being able to synthesize a-glucans from both starch-derived maltooligosaccharides and sucrose.Thus the crystal structure of GtfB-DNDV clearly suggests that the GH70 46-a-glucanotransferase subfamily is intermediate in the evolution of glucansucrases from a-amylases and phyloge- netic and genomic analysis further supports this finding.

In this orientation the O6 atom of the non-reducing end glucosyl unit of panose can attack the C1 atom of the covalent intermediate to form an a-16 glycosidic linkage.Superposition of the models in A and B bound in a donor situation magenta carbon atoms and hydrogen bonds or acceptor situation yellow carbon atoms orange hydrogen bonds highlighting the rotation and shift of the glucosyl unit in subsite 1 stick representation.formed by L. reuteri 35-5 from sucrose is a reuteran containing both a-16 and a-14 linkages .
