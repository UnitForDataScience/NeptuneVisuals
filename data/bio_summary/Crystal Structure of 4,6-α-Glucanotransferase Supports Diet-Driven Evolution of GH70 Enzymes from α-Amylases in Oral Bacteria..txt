Active-Site Comparison of a 46-a-GT and a GSA and B Comparison of L. reuteri 121 GtfB-DNDV this work molecule A of the asymmetric unit is shown A with the L. reuteri 180 Gtf180-DN - su- crose complex B cvcZv.

A third loop con- necting strand b7 and helix a8 of the ba8 barrel ''loop A2'' res- idues 1430-1440 lies below loops A1 and B.The structurally closest glucansucrase homolog of GtfB-DNDV is GTF180-DN from L. reuteri 180 cvcZv  their A  B domains can be superimposed with an rmsdof 0.84 A .

Yet important differences are pre- sent in the arrangement of three loops near the active site  B sequence alignments of the regions containing these loops A show that they are unique to 46-a-GTs and more conserved than within GSs.Regarding GH13 a-amylases the A  B domains of GtfB- DNDV are most similar to the A  B domains of the a-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis  root-mean-square deviation rmsd of 2.10 A .

Notably loop A2 of GtfB-DNDV atthe base of the tunnel is shorter than the equivalent loop in GTF180-DN lacks a short a helix and does not block access to donor subsites beyond -1.The catalytic subsite -1 of GtfB-DNDV is very similar to that ofa-amylases and GSs six of the seven conserved GH13 residuesare present the three catalytic residues D1015 E1053 and D1125 as well as residues R1013 H1124 and D1479 the seventh residue a histidine is replaced by a glutamine Q1484 as in GSs .On the other hand sequence alignment of motifs I III and IV B shows that the 46-a-GTs form a highly conserved and separate group regarding subsite 1 there are a few notable differences with GSs.

subfamilies 4 and 18.In Vivo ExperimentsGrowth of a fructansucrase-negative mutant of L. reuteri 121 L. reuteri 35-5 on either sucrose or maltodextrins containing 5 a-16 linkages and 95 a-14 linkages on agar plates re- sulted in the formation of transparent colonies surrounded by a slimy halo A in contrast growth on glucose did not yield such halos.

Binding of Oligosaccharides in the Tunnel at the Donor Side of GtfB-DNDV Binding of oligosaccharides maltopentaose in subsites -1 to -5 of GtfB-DNDV D1015N A and C and a mixed isomalto-maltooligosaccharide transglycosylation product 64-a-D-glucosyl-mal- totetraose in subsites -2 to -6 of GtfB-DNDV B and D. The a-16-linkage at the non-reducing end of 64-a-D-glucosyl-maltotetraose is indicated asterisk.

The asymmetric unit contained two molecules of GtfB-DNDV A. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited at the PDB PDB 5JBD wild-type native 5JBE wild-type maltohexaose soak 5JBF D1015N maltopentaose soak.Modeling and Docking We modeled donor substrate binding and acceptor substrate binding panose to a covalent glucosyl-enzyme intermediate in GtfB-DNDV by using related structures of a-amylases a cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase and glucansu- crases.
