evolution toward the different substrate specificity observed in gss likelyfigure 9. evolutionary relationships between a-amylases 46-a-glucanotransferases and glucansucrasesthe catalytic site for cleavage and transglycosylation traingles is between subsites -1 and 1. the a-amylases that process maltooligosaccharides mos squares represent glucose units have an open binding groove with multiple donor and acceptor subsites they lack loops a1 and b and are unable to synthesize polysaccharides ps.

since subsite -1 remained virtually unchanged we propose that structural changes in subsite 1 involved residues y1055w1065 k1128q1140 gtfbgtf180 numbering andsmall hydrophobic residues from domain b these changes affect hydrogen- bonding capabilities and binding space for donor substrates shifting binding preference from an a-14-linked glucosyl to an a-12-linked fructosyl unit.

previously it has been shown that the epsthe crystal structure of l. reuteri 121 gtfb-dndv shows that its active-site architecture is intermediate between gh13 a-amy- lases and gh70 glucansucrases with an a-amylase-like binding groove partly covered by long loops forming a tunnel.

thus as shown by our in vivo experiments  l. reuteri strains with 46-a-gtgs gene pairs have an additional advantage of being able to synthesize a-glucans from both starch-derived maltooligosaccharides and sucrose.thus the crystal structure of gtfb-dndv clearly suggests that the gh70 46-a-glucanotransferase subfamily is intermediate in the evolution of glucansucrases from a-amylases and phyloge- netic and genomic analysis further supports this finding.

moreover several residues from loop a2 that are different in a-amylases provide interactions to the bound maltooligosaccharides figure s3 related to .after binding donor substrates are cleaved incubation of gtfb-dn with a blocked substrate figure s5 related to  shows that the enzyme can act not only exo- but also endolyti- cally.
