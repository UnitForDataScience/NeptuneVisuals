The evidence suggests that breath hydrogen tests have limited clinical value in guiding clinical decision for the pa- tient with a functional bowel disorder.Bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates in the colon produces the gases hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide.

However such correlations have not been reproduced by more recent studies in children on a fructose-restricted diet.23Limitations of methodology and interpretation of hydrogen breath testingIn the recent years evidence is accumulating for significant limita- tions in the interpretation and methodology of breath hydrogen test and its application in FBD patients following a low FODMAP diet.The prevalence of sorbitol fructose and lactose malabsorp- tion in FBD patients are similar to healthy controls.4 Such findings suggest that carbohydrate malabsorption is not a separate entity to IBS but a normal physiological occurrence which represents a therapeutic opportunity for dietary manip- ulation to reduce functional gastrointestinal symptoms.The sensitivity specificity and false positivenegative rates for accurate detection of carbohydrate malabsorption are dependent on the testing methodology used.

Whilst carbohydrate malabsorption has been well studied in patients who produce breath hydrogen breath methane is less predictable and baseline levels are difficult to control even with dietary changes.6 Its clinical application therefore re- mains unclear.Considerable intra-individual variability in breath hydrogen responses exists with repeated testing.

Komericki and col- leagues found that 29 of patients with IBS having an initial positive fructose breath test lost this response upon repeat testing at 1 year despite no intervention being administered during the interim period.7 Barrett and colleagues also showed 17 of IBS patients had fructose malabsorption re- versed and 67 changed their degree of malabsorption upon repeat testing 6 weeks later.8 A false negative rate of 20 in subjects repeating a lactulose test within 3 months has also been demonstrated.9 Such findings reaffirm that breath testing outcomes at a single time point do not accurately predict an individual's intestinal physiology and disputes the use of breath hydrogen testing for individual FODMAPs.Clinical relevance of symptom response on breath testingApart from breath hydrogen responses the development of symp- toms during a test have also been used to guide dietary restriction in these patients despite evidence opposing this strategy.

Based on these cut-off values the prevalence of SIBO can vary drastically between 4 and 78.13 In IBS patients demonstrating SIBO based on an early rise  90 min in breath hydrogen after the ingestion of lactulose 30 lost this response upon repeat test- ing.11 Simultaneous transit and breath hydrogen assessment has also shown that such early rise nearly always represents rapid tran- sit rather than SIBO.15 Few data exist regarding the reliability of other cut-off values.

This suggests that lactulose breath hydrogen measurements are poorly reliable to diagnose SIBO in patients with FBD and therapeutic strategies such as antibiotic therapy to eradicate SIBO as a means of achieving symptomatic relief should not be based on such results.ConclusionsRecent evidence suggests that breath hydrogen tests contribute lit- tle value to the clinical management of patients with FBD whether for guidance on instituting a low FODMAP diet or prescription of antibiotics for eradication of SIBO.

Therefore the assessment for the presence of carbohydrate malabsorption via the use of breath hydrogen tests have been widely utilized to identify specific triggers of functional bowel symptoms in these patients.Utility in refining dietary triggers on a low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosaccharides and Polyols dietA low Fermentable Oligosaccharides Disaccharides Monosac- charides and Polyols FODMAP diet is commonly used to treat symptoms in patients with FBD.
