The diversity and dis- tribution of cryoconite microbial communities and the influenceof the unique environment of these high-altitude glaciers of the Tibetan Plateau remain unexplored.We studied the biogeography and diversity of cryoconite bacterial communities from three climatically distinct Tibetan Plateau glaciers using Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

To further enhance our understanding of these glacial ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau and to examine their role in carbon cycling as the glaciers respond to climate change we explored the bacterial communities within cryoconite holes associated with three climatically distinct Tibetan Plateau glaciers using Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

b.Values in boldface indicate significant differences P  0.05 between bacterial communities in pairs of sampling sites.Variation of bacterial community compositionThe NMDS ordination analysis based on the unweighted Unifrac distance across samples clearly revealed differences in the cry- oconite bacterial communities among the three glaciers with samples grouping within glacier Fig.

This result im- plies that the Chloroflexi in combination with Cyanobacteria play an important role in structuring the cryoconite communities on the Tibetan Plateau.Spatial distribution of cryoconite bacterial communities on the Tibetan PlateauOur study aimed to determine how geographic distance and en- vironmental variables controlled the biogeography of cryoconite bacterial communities regionally on the Tibetan Plateau.

.Few studies have examined the cryoconite bacteria on alpine glaciers compared to studies of polar glaciers despite the im- portance of cryoconite in alpine glacier mass balance Takeuchi Kohshima and Seko  Ambrosini et al.

With average altitude 4000 m alpine glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau reside at 1000 m higher altitude than European alpine glaciers Yao et al.

The increase in altitude relative to other alpine glaciers exposes Tibetan Plateau glaciers to lower temperatures lower allochthonous inputs of organic matter and strong solar radiation.

Among the top 15 OTUs of representative Cyanobacteria 7 OTUs were most closely related to sequences recovered from the Antarctic 5 were from stream and lake samples  and the other 2 were from soil including one from the Tibetan Plateau Table S3.The relative abundances of the Chloroflexi were similar among the three glaciers and accounted for 13 16 and 12 of LHG TGL and YL glaciers respectively.

The distance-decay slope within glacier 0.046 was significantly shallower than the slope among glaciers 0.391 indicating higher similarity within glacier than among glaciers.
