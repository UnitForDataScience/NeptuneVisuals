A comprehensive descrip- tion of the available genome-scale metabolic reconstruction procedures and pipelines can be found in recent reviews  .Along this line of research but using different approaches Bayesian inference of metabolic networks has been used to reveal a metabolic system with greater prevalence among IBD patients  and the construction and functional ana- lysis of proteome interaction networks enabled the analysis of nutrient-affected pathways in human pathologies .Resources and tools for intestinal microbiota studies  15Gut microbiome community modelsAs more metabolic reconstructions of gut microbes become available bioinformatics efforts are being directed towards the development of modelling frameworks for the systematic inves- tigation of metabolic crosstalk in gut microbiome communities  .

These models are useful to gain a deeper understanding about host-microbe symbiosis in the scope of metabolic disorders and thus may offer valuable insights into diet modulation and the benefits of probiotics.For example a 'meta-metabolome' network describing the interactions between the human host and three predominant phyla of gut bacteria namely Firmicutes Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria shed light into cross-feeding relationships be- tween some gut microbe enzymes and host carbohydrate me- tabolism enzymes .The genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of B. thetaiotao- micron iAH991 was integrated with the mouse metabolic recon- struction iMM1415 in an effort to characterize intestinal transport and absorption reactions.

Then GlobalFit finds the optimal metabolic model with the minimum number of metabolic changes that fits better with the experimental data .OptFlux is a platform for metabolic engineering allowing user- manipulation of the nodes composing a metabolic network and the overlay of phenotype results or flux modes .

Therefore the ability to modu- late the gut microbiome and the associated host-microbe inter- actions holds great promise for developing new therapeuticstrategies for many chronic diseases and antibiotic-resistant in- fections  .Colonization of the gut starts just after birth when pioneer- ing species interact through surface receptors with gut cells to promote the expression of a specific set of host genes and fa- vour the colonization of commensal microorganisms .

For ex- ample El-Semman and colleagues  reconstructed two metabolic models for Bifidobacterium adolescentis L2-32 the iBif452 model and F. prausnitzii A2-165 the iFap484 which enabled the study of the anti-inflammatory role that these microorganisms play in the gut ecosystem.A genome-scale metabolic model for Lactobacillus casei LC2W enabled the identification of essential amino acids and vitamins and the exploration of the biosynthetic potential of some me- tabolites .

Mackinac has been designed to profit from the COBRA metabolic analysis capa- bilities to in combination with ModelSEED infer in the metabolic potential of a biological system and to optimize genome-scale metabolic models .
