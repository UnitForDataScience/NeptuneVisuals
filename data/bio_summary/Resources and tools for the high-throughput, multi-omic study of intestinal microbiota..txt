a comprehensive descrip- tion of the available genome-scale metabolic reconstruction procedures and pipelines can be found in recent reviews  .along this line of research but using different approaches bayesian inference of metabolic networks has been used to reveal a metabolic system with greater prevalence among ibd patients  and the construction and functional ana- lysis of proteome interaction networks enabled the analysis of nutrient-affected pathways in human pathologies .resources and tools for intestinal microbiota studies  15gut microbiome community modelsas more metabolic reconstructions of gut microbes become available bioinformatics efforts are being directed towards the development of modelling frameworks for the systematic inves- tigation of metabolic crosstalk in gut microbiome communities  .

these models are useful to gain a deeper understanding about host-microbe symbiosis in the scope of metabolic disorders and thus may offer valuable insights into diet modulation and the benefits of probiotics.for example a 'meta-metabolome' network describing the interactions between the human host and three predominant phyla of gut bacteria namely firmicutes bacteroidetes and actinobacteria shed light into cross-feeding relationships be- tween some gut microbe enzymes and host carbohydrate me- tabolism enzymes .the genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of b. thetaiotao- micron iah991 was integrated with the mouse metabolic recon- struction imm1415 in an effort to characterize intestinal transport and absorption reactions.

then globalfit finds the optimal metabolic model with the minimum number of metabolic changes that fits better with the experimental data .optflux is a platform for metabolic engineering allowing user- manipulation of the nodes composing a metabolic network and the overlay of phenotype results or flux modes .

therefore the ability to modu- late the gut microbiome and the associated host-microbe inter- actions holds great promise for developing new therapeuticstrategies for many chronic diseases and antibiotic-resistant in- fections  .colonization of the gut starts just after birth when pioneer- ing species interact through surface receptors with gut cells to promote the expression of a specific set of host genes and fa- vour the colonization of commensal microorganisms .

for ex- ample el-semman and colleagues  reconstructed two metabolic models for bifidobacterium adolescentis l2-32 the ibif452 model and f. prausnitzii a2-165 the ifap484 which enabled the study of the anti-inflammatory role that these microorganisms play in the gut ecosystem.a genome-scale metabolic model for lactobacillus casei lc2w enabled the identification of essential amino acids and vitamins and the exploration of the biosynthetic potential of some me- tabolites .

mackinac has been designed to profit from the cobra metabolic analysis capa- bilities to in combination with modelseed infer in the metabolic potential of a biological system and to optimize genome-scale metabolic models .

these efforts demonstrate the power of standardized and reproducible computational work- flows for integrating and analysing varied omics data and gaining deeper insights into microbe community structure and function as well as host-microbe interactions.key words human gut microbiome data repositories large-scale and integrative computational tools modelling immuno- modulation drug screeningbackgroundthe human gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem in which eukaryotic cells continuously interact with nutrients and with the complex microbial population of the gut microbiota .

trimethylamine-n-oxide and indoxyl sul- phate higher abundance of genomes containing genes coding enzymes involved in the production of these toxic co-metabol- ites and higher abundance of pathways for biosynthesis of bac- terial antigens such as endotoxin -.although the precise cause remains unknown profiling stud- ies of the gut microbiome associate the pathogenesis of ibd a chronic and relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gut with the under-representation of certain species in the faecal microbiota -.

moreover it is well recognized that the excessive use of broad- spectrum antibiotics can affect the relative proportions of gut microbial populations and foster bacterial resistance .considering recent technological advancements and com- munity initiatives towards large-scale compilation of data on human microbiome integrative data analysis may be the key to better understand the mechanisms of action of the gut micro- biome and their implication in the development and chronicity of the above-mentioned diseases .

this review is accompanied by a small website avail- able on that keeps up-to-date track of the public availability of the hereby mentioned projects resources and tools while welcoming further inputs from the community.attention is set on two main application areas 1 the char- acterization of gut microbiota composition and the functional interplay related to dysbiosis such as disease and antibiotic therapy and 2 the screening of the proteome of human gut species for products holding immunomodulatory anti- inflammatory or other bioactivity of therapeutic interest.

in this sense presents relevant data repositories for human gut microbiome research and provides a list of the data sets available for human gut e.g.

alternatively the metapro-iq workflow which has been specifically developed for gut metaproteome identification and quantification uses almost complete human or mouse gut mi- crobial gene catalogues as reference database and an iterative database search strategy .unipept offers programmatic access to metaproteomics ana- lysis features and has the advantage of being supported by a fast index built from uniprotkb and ncbi taxonomy .
