this review focused on how the enteric mycobiota and virome changes during the pathogenesis of ibd and discussed potential treatment strategies that open new insights into the managements of ibd.key words dysbiosis inflammatory bowel diseases mycobiota virome.introductioninflammatory bowel disease ibd mainly consisting of ulcerative colitis uc and crohn's disease cd is a complex group of recurrent inflammatory disor- ders affecting the gastrointestinal gi tract.

cerevisiae and an increased proportion of c. albi- cans.the colonization of c. albicans could aggravate intestinal inflammation in a murine colitis model while antifungal treatment could dramatically reverse the inflammatory responses suggesting that fungi account for the exacerbation of the inflammatory response in colitis.however the exact mechanisms of mycobiota in ibd remain unclear.

the activation of latent prophages may result in lysis of their host bacterium which then triggers downstream inflammatory signal- ing factors to induce cytokine release cellular infiltra- tion and tissue damage.moreover in vitro studies have proven that myd88-dependent proinflamma- tory cytokine production can be activated by macro- phages with bacteriophage particles indicating that bacteriophages can also be recognized by the innate immune system and induce inflammation.since the increased use of glucocorticoids immuno- suppressive and biological agents in treating patients with ibd it has become essential for clinicians to investigate their potential risks and select an appro- priate therapy to avoid serious viral infections associ- ated with immunomodulation.
