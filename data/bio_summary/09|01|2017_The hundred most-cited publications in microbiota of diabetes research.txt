Scholars have investigated the most cited articles that describe the advances in varies specialties and subspecialties included diabetes research10-13 which helped recognizing the quality of the works discoveries and the trends steering the study.1415 As numbers of literatures and researches reported that the microbiota was the important mechanism to influence the diabetes pathogenesis there is a need to conduct a bibliometric study on the published literature relating to microbiota of diabetes to investigate the important mechanism of this disease reflected in trends.Thus the aim of this study was to provide a detailed evaluation of the hundred most cited articles in microbiota of diabetes research using bibliometric analysis hoped to get the insights ofmicrobiota of diabetes by analyzing the authorship number of citations h-index citation density source journal geographic origin and interactions scientific research institution article type and funding source.Materials and methodsThe Web of Science database was used to identify the top articles concerning microbiota of diabetes from the beginning of the database to August 12 2016.

A total of 66 articles shared the same country respectively 17 articles had 2 countries and 17 articles had 3 countries or more.

And Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation had supported 11 of the T100 articles.DiscussionA number of research works on microbiota the important pathogenesis mechanism of diabetes have exponentially grown during the past decades and currently involve many other specialties.1819 In this study we sought to identify the most- cited 100 articles in microbiota of diabetes in an effort to provide insights into the development and evolvement of microbiota of diabetes over time.As all the selected articles were published after 2007 the number of citations for the T100 articles varied from 1289 to 35 which might be fewer than those in other subspecialties.101113 However it also reflects that scholars paid much attention onProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America3microbiota of diabetes continuously in latest years and published many outstanding researches on top journals in the medical areaScience2Gastroenterology.2ISME Journal2Journal of Immunology2Nature Reviews Gastroenterology  Hepatology2Nutrients2Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care2that aroused widespread response.

It is well aware that outstanding articles tend to be published in journals with high impact factor IF and high IF journals help spread the articles' academic influence.Although 77 of the T100 were published in 2010-2013 several articles with high citation density published in recent 2 years which made them accumulate relatively low total citations due to less time such as Kostic et al2015 Shin et al 2014 and Zeevi et al2015.

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed evaluation of the hundred most cited articles in microbiota of diabetes research.Methods The database of the Web of Science was utilized for identification of articles.

8 articles had citations over 500 more than half of the articles n  56 received 100 citations.

Sixty-six articles had more than 1 institution and 22 articles had 5 institutions or more.

It meant that these articles were cited by at least 10 articles which had at least 10 citations.

Citation is logically dependent on its publication year because citations accumulate over time older articles are likely to be cited more than recent articles.

The top 100 were selected for further analysis of authorship number of citations article type source journal geographic origin and interactions.Results The articles selected were published from 2007 to 2015.
