However as outlined by G. Greub this makes quite difficult to use metagenomics to really discover new pathogens since any putative novel emerging pathogen identified using a metagenomics approach will have to be confirmed at least in a subset of subjects using another approach considered gold standard such as culture.The increasing rapidity of clinical metagenomicsTogether with a high cost the main limitation of clinical metagenomics is the slow turnaround time TAT which is allegedly slower than that of conventional methods including cultures.

In this context the first International Conference on Clinical Metagenomics ICCMg was held in Geneva in October 2016 and several key aspects have been discussed including i the need for improved resolution ii the importance of interpretation given the common occurrence of sequence contaminants iii the need for improved bioinformatic pipelines iv the bottleneck of DNA extraction v the importance of gold standards vi the need to further reduce time to results vii how to improve data sharing viii the applications of bacterial genomics and clinical metagenomics in better adapting therapeutics and ix the impact of metagenomics and new sequencing technologies in discovering new mi- crobes.

First as many attendees were not familiar with next- generation sequencing and metagenomics an introduction to these concepts opened the conference.

Then the biggest part of the talks focused on clinical metagenomics applied to the etiological diagnosis of infectious diseases.

All throughout the various talks the different visions of clinical metagenomics that were shared by the speakers and the issues that have been raised  we identified nine key messages that we aim to share in the pre- sent meeting report .High-resolution microbiomicsIn order to get the most precise taxonomic assignment from 16S profiling data G. Weinstock demonstrated the relevance of using long reads for 16S profiling showing different binning results obtained for the v1ev3 16SrDNA sequencing using short reads as compared to the full-length gene sequenced with the PacBio technology Pacific Biosciences1286-4579c 2017 Institut Pasteur.
