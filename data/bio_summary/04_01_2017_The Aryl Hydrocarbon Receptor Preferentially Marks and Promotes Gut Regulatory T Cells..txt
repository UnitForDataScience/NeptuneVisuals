The results were displayed as relative expression values normalized to b-actin.T Cell-mediated Transfer Model of ColitisNaive 4x105 CD4CD25-CD45RBhigh cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of CD45.1 congenic mice were intravenously injected into Rag1-- mice with or without 4x104 CD4YFP splenic Tregs sorted from AhrfFoxp3Yfp-Cre or littermate Ahrf-Foxp3Yfp-Cre mice or CD4YFPGFP or CD4YFPGFP- splenic Tregs sorted from AhrCAIRFoxp3Yfp-Cre mice.

The reduction of Nrp1-RORgt Tregs was confirmed in germ-free mice demonstrating that their accumulation and differentiation are dependent on microbiota Figures 3E and 3F.Intriguingly Ahr expression in Tregs was unaffected in antibiotics-treated mice or germ-free mice Figures 3C 3D 3G and 3H suggesting that environmental factors other than microbiota drive the gut-specific expression of Ahr in Tregs.

Large intestinal LPLs from congenically marked AhrFoxp3Yfp-Cre CD45.145.2 mice or Ahrf-Foxp3Yfp-Cre CD45.245.2 mice were mixed at equal ratio and transferred to Rag1-- mice.

Co-transferred GFP- Tregs maintained Foxp3 expression compared to GFP Tregs suggesting that Ahr is dispensable for Foxp3 expression andor stability Figure S7B.In contrast to Tregs from AhrfFoxp3Yfp-Cre mice that suppressed T-cell transfer colitis Tregs purified from Ahrf-Foxp3Yfp-Cre mice had impaired suppressive function as revealed by worsened gut histopathological changes and enhanced gut inflammation in Rag1-- recipient mice while maintaining Foxp3 expression Figures S7C-S7H.

Likewise comparable in vivo Treg differentiation by OVA treatment was observed in recipient mice that was adoptively transferred with naive non-Treg cells from Ahrf-Foxp3Yfp-Cre OT-II mice compared to those from AhrfFoxp3Yfp-Cre OT-II mice data not shown.

The weight change of recipient Rag1-- mice were monitored for 8 weeks or the mice were sacrificed for analysis 2 weeks after cell transfer.Methylation AnalysisGenomic DNA of FACS-sorted large intestinal CD4TCRbYFP Tregs from AhrfFoxp3Yfp-Cre or littermate Ahrf-Foxp3Yfp-Cre mice was isolated with DNeasy tissue kit Qiagen.

Data are representative of four independent experiments A-D or complied from three independent experiments I and J and shown as mean - SD n  4 mice per group.E F G and H Germ-free wildtype mice were gavaged with or without feces collected from specific pathogen free SPF mice.

Data are representative of three independent experiments.F and G Large intestinal LPLs from AhrFoxp3Yfp-Cre CD45.145.2 mice Ctr andAhrf-Foxp3Yfp-Cre CD45.245.2 cKO mice were mixed and around 1x107 cells were adoptively transferred into Rag1-- mice.

Systemic analysis of Tregs in different anatomic locations revealed a gut-specific expression pattern of Ahr in Tregs and a role for Ahr in directing Treg gut homing and function.Ye et al.Page 4RESULTSDevelopment of Ahr conditional knock-in mice expressing a constitutively active form of Ahr with GFP reporterTo investigate the expression pattern of Ahr and the consequence of Ahr activation in vivo we used a Cre-loxP site-specific recombination approach to generate an Ahr knock-in mouse model AhrCAIR mice in which constitutively active Ahr CA-Ahr that lacks the PAS-B domain is expressed in a Cre-inducible manner and marked by GFP.

Accordingly AhrCAIRCAIR mice have a defect in innate lymphoid cells in the gut thus phenocopying Ahr null mice Figure S1D and Kiss et al.
