They also investigated the association between the microbiome and several other diseases and modelled the prediction of disease based on microbiome composition FIG.

The researchers note considerable overlap between the microbiome composition in this ASCVD cohort and the composition in studies of other cardiometabolic diseases including obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis suggesting that the microbial shifts might be indicative of poor metabolic health in general rather than being directly related to ASCVD.An understanding of the link between microbiota and disease is of considerable clinical relevance.

A new study by Jie and colleagues is the first large case-control study to examine directly the enrichment of certain communities of gut bacteria in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared with control individuals.In a new study published in Nature Communications Jie and colleagues performed shotgun sequencing of the gut microbiome in a Chinese cohort of 218 patients with atherosclerotic cardio vascular disease ASCVD and 187 healthy controls1.

LusisDepartments of Microbiology Medicine and Human Genetics University of California Los Angeles Los Angeles California 90095-1679 USAAbstractThe gut microbiota has been associated with many different disorders including cardiovascular diseases.

They observed several significant associations between the microbiota taxa and disease status strengthening the evidence for the inclusion of ASCVD in the ever-expanding list of microbiota- associated diseases.

Third as explored by Jie et al.1 disease diagnosis might be based on the use of microorganisms as biomarkers9.Replicating these associations between microbiota and diseases will be important.
