Levels of CD41 CD81 T cells figure e-1 A-D at and natural killer cells figure e-2 A-D did not differ between patients with CISMS and controls.As we observed a significant age difference between patients with CISMS and controls we calculated the cor- relations between age and total DCs CD1031 DCs and Tregs.

Moreover SCFAs endow DCs with an enhanced ability to induce the differentiation of Tregs.182021 Recently oral propionate administration also resulted in expanded peripheral Treg counts in patients with MS.22 On the basis of these data we hypothesized that corresponding changes in immune cells of the gut mucosa and in SCFAs should also be present in patients with MS. We speculated to find lower numbers of DCs in particular CD1031 DCs in the colon mucosa of patients with MS which might be associated with fewer Tregs.

Mucosal immune cells were analyzed by FACS and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of stool samples served to determine SCFA.Results The number of total dendritic cells DCs CD1031 tolerogenic DCs and CD41251127- regulatory T cells Tregs was significantly reduced in the distal colon of patients with CISMS compared with controls whereas we found no differences in the proximal colon.

These observations were hitherto not made in humans and could suggest a concept where changes of mucosal immune cells may be linked to reduced levels of certain bacterial metabo- lites in the colon of patients with MS. Propionate has been shown to be the most potent Treg inducer in vitro and oral gavage ameliorated CNS demyelin- ation in mice.19 Propionate levels were lower in our patients with MS although not to a significant extent.

Thereby activation of CD1031 DCs in cervical lymph nodes played a major role in attenu- ating CNS autoimmunity.16 Of interest a recent report provides evidence for the CNS lymphatic system communicating with deep cervical lymph nodes.37 Because the lymphatic system is known to communicate throughout the whole body informa- tion from the intestinal lymphatic system may also reach the CNS.3738 In this context T cells have already been shown to gain autoreactive function in extracerebral tissues such as the lungs and to migrate to the CNS transgressing the blood-brain barrier.39 The concept of extracerebral immune-cell alterations at mucosal sites may therefore be supported by our data and warrants further mechanistic investigation regarding the gut in patients with MS.In this study we solely focused on patients with early MS and therefore we do not know if observedchanges in the colonic mucosa may further increase with more advanced disease which needs to be acknowledged as a limitation of the study.

The patients' fecal samples also showed a substantially lower content of SCFA and especially lower levels of butyrate and acetate.Conclusions Our findings indicate a disturbed homeostasis of colonic DCs and Tregs in patients with MS which could be associated with colonic SCFA depletion.
