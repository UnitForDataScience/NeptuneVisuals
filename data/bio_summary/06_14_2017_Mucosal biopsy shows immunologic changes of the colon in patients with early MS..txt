Biopsies were separately taken from the proximal cecum and ascending colon and distal descending and sigmoid colon colon during the retraction of the colonoscope to investigate possible differences of colonic immune cells related to colonic compartments.24 Colonic biopsy specimens were immediately preserved in chilled Roswell Park Memorial Institute RPMI medium Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO supplemented with penicillin streptomycin and amphoter- icin.

Mucosal immune cells were analyzed by FACS and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of stool samples served to determine SCFA.Results The number of total dendritic cells DCs CD1031 tolerogenic DCs and CD41251127- regulatory T cells Tregs was significantly reduced in the distal colon of patients with CISMS compared with controls whereas we found no differences in the proximal colon.

Patients with CIS MS had significantly fewer overall DCs and CD1031 DCs in the distal colon compared with controls total DCs 3.0 2.2-3.8 vs 5.0 3.6-6.3 p 5 0.019 of living cells and 255 93-381 vs 404 335-592 p 5 0.026 absolute numbers CD1031 DCs 1.4 0.9-1.8 vs 2.5 1.4-3.1 p 5 0.036  of living cells and 114 38-174 vs 183 124-303 p 5 0.048absolute numbers figure 2 C and D.Furthermore significant reductions of Tregs in patients with CISMS were likewise only observed in the distal colon Tregs 3.1 1.3-3.7 vs 4.73.4-6.1 p 5 0.032  of living cells and 15383-205 vs 226 136-510 p 5 0.023 absolutenumbers figure 3 A-D. Levels of CD41 CD81 T cells figure e-1 A-D at and natural killer cells figure e-2 A-D did not differ between patients with CISMS and controls.As we observed a significant age difference between patients with CISMS and controls we calculated the cor- relations between age and total DCs CD1031 DCs and Tregs.

SCFAs.29-31 In addition mucosal DC subsets differ between the proximal and distal colon of healthy individuals.24 Altogether these findings suggest a concept of colonic immune com- partmentalization which may well explain our dif- ferent observations in the proximal and distal colon.

Chemokine C-C motif receptor 2 mediates dendritic cell recruitment to the human colon but is not responsible for differences observed in dendritic cell subsets phenotype and function between the proximal and distal colon.

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health Inc. on behalf of the American Academy of Neurology.1Colonic specimens were obtained separately from the proximal and distal colon and lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated.

Moreover SCFAs endow DCs with an enhanced ability to induce the differentiation of Tregs.182021 Recently oral propionate administration also resulted in expanded peripheral Treg counts in patients with MS.22 On the basis of these data we hypothesized that corresponding changes in immune cells of the gut mucosa and in SCFAs should also be present in patients with MS. We speculated to find lower numbers of DCs in particular CD1031 DCs in the colon mucosa of patients with MS which might be associated with fewer Tregs.

Group differences of continuous variables were determined by Mann-Whitney U test or t test depending onDC numbers from the proximal A and B and distal C and D colon see central scheme.

A andB No significant differences in the number of total and CD1031 DCs were found in the proximal colon of MS-p compared with controls Ctrl.

C and D In the distal colon significant reductions of total and CD1031 DCs were observed in MS-p compared with Ctrl total DCs 3.0 2.2-3.8 vs 5.0 3.6-6.3 p 5 0.019 0 of living cells and 255 93-381 vs 404 335- 592 p 5 0.026 absolute numbers CD1031 DCs 1.4 0.9-1.8 vs 2.5 1.4-3.1 p 5 0.036 0 of living cells and 114 38-174 vs 183 124-303 p 5 0.048 absolute numbers median Q1-Q3 Mann-Whitney U test or t test to compare non-Gaussian and Gaussian variables.
