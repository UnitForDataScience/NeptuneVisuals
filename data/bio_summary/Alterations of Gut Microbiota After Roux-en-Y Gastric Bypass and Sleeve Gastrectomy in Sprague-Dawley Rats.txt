Examination of the Shannon diversity index of gut microbiota revealed a decline in the diversity of gut microbiota of rats that had received RYGB while SG caused virtually no change in the diversity of gut microbiota except a brief decline in the immediate post- operative period.

On the other hand our study analyzed 5323091 sequences from 85 fecal samples which were col- lected pre-operatively and at 4 different postoperative time points from 17 rats offering a more comprehensive view of longitudinal alterations in the gut microbiota of rats following RYGB or SG.Little is known about the impact of SG on gut microbiota.

The food in- take in the SG group remained significantly depressed post- operatively baseline 191.53 - 4.54 g vs. week 9171.67 - 3.86 g P  0.01 and markedly lower than that of the sham group P  0.01.RYGB Causes a Distinct Shift in Gut MicrobiotaUnweighted UniFrac-based principal coordinate analysis of 5323091 sequences from 85 fecal samples from 17 rats re- vealed a similar gut microbiota in rats from the SG group and the sham group forming one distinct cluster at 1 week post- operatively and another cluster from 3 weeks postoperatively Fig.

These findings imply that bariatric surgery causes a procedure SG and RYGB-dependent alterations in gut microbiota of SD rats.We found that RYGB was associated with a markedly higher proportion of Proteobacteria and a significantly lower proportion of Clostridiales compared to SG or sham surgeryFig.

Though we observed enrichment of Cyanobacteria and Desulfovibrionaceae post SG the two taxa were of low abundance Cyanobacteria7.5 - 2.7  Desulfovibrionaceae 1.6 - 0.4  in the gut microbiota post SG and therefore may have little effect on overall gut microbial composition.

SG vs. sham P  0.05 P  0.01 and P  0.001 SG vs. RYGB P  0.05 P  0.01 and P  0.001 RYGB vs. shamP  0.05 P  0.01 and P  0.001We then investigated the effect of RYGB and SG on food intake of rats.

Despite an initial spike in the percentage of Proteobacteria in the sham group and the SG group at 1 week postoperatively sham baseline 7.50 - 1.47  vs. week 1 17.71 - 2.08 P  0.01 SG baseline 6.24 - 1.28  vs. week 135.91 - 4.18  P  0.01 the percentage of Proteobacteria in the two groups remained apparently lower than that of the RYGB group from 3 weeks postoperatively week 9 RYGB 8.98 - 1.99  vs. sham 2.07 - 0.44  P  0.01 RYGB 8.98 - 1.99  vs. SG 3.92 - 0.97  P  0.05.

A discrepancy has also been recently documented in the compo- Qiyuan Yaohscbmssina.cn 1 Center for Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Huashan Hospital of Fudan University Shanghai Chinasition and diversity of gut microbiota between obese individ- uals and normal weight persons suggesting a link between altered gut microbiota and obesity -.Limited data has also revealed alterations in gut micro- biota post bariatric surgery.

further demonstrated that altered gut microbiota af- ter Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB contributed to re- duction in host body weight and adiposity and transfer of post-RYGB gut microbiota to germ-free mice also result- ed in lost body weight .

showed that the mice fed a high-fat diet had considerably differentcomposition of gut microbiota compared with the mice fed normal chow before surgery they demonstrated that RYGB could overwhelm the effect of diet on gut microbiota and the gut microbial composition was similar following RYGB whether mice were fed normal chow or a high-fat diet .
