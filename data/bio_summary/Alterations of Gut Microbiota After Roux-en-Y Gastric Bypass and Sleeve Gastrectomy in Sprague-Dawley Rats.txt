examination of the shannon diversity index of gut microbiota revealed a decline in the diversity of gut microbiota of rats that had received rygb while sg caused virtually no change in the diversity of gut microbiota except a brief decline in the immediate post- operative period.

alterations of gut microbiota after roux-en-y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy in sprague-dawley ratsyikai shao1  rui ding1  bo xu1  rong hua1  qiwei shen1  kai he1  qiyuan yao1published online 20 july 2016 springer sciencebusiness media new york 2016abstractbackground the objective of the study was to compare gut microbiota post roux-en-y gastric bypass rygb and sleeve gastrectomy sg.methods sprague-dawley rats were randomized to rygb sg or sham surgery.

on the other hand our study analyzed 5323091 sequences from 85 fecal samples which were col- lected pre-operatively and at 4 different postoperative time points from 17 rats offering a more comprehensive view of longitudinal alterations in the gut microbiota of rats following rygb or sg.little is known about the impact of sg on gut microbiota.

b. for rats in the rygb group after an initial brief decline the food intake was comparable to that of the sham group from week 4 postoperatively p  0.05. the food in- take in the sg group remained significantly depressed post- operatively baseline 191.53 - 4.54 g vs. week 9171.67 - 3.86 g p  0.01 and markedly lower than that of the sham group p  0.01.rygb causes a distinct shift in gut microbiotaunweighted unifrac-based principal coordinate analysis of 5323091 sequences from 85 fecal samples from 17 rats re- vealed a similar gut microbiota in rats from the sg group and the sham group forming one distinct cluster at 1 week post- operatively and another cluster from 3 weeks postoperatively fig.

these findings imply that bariatric surgery causes a procedure sg and rygb-dependent alterations in gut microbiota of sd rats.we found that rygb was associated with a markedly higher proportion of proteobacteria and a significantly lower proportion of clostridiales compared to sg or sham surgeryfig.

though we observed enrichment of cyanobacteria and desulfovibrionaceae post sg the two taxa were of low abundance cyanobacteria7.5 - 2.7  desulfovibrionaceae 1.6 - 0.4  in the gut microbiota post sg and therefore may have little effect on overall gut microbial composition.

further demonstrated that altered gut microbiota af- ter roux-en-y gastric bypass rygb contributed to re- duction in host body weight and adiposity and transfer of post-rygb gut microbiota to germ-free mice also result- ed in lost body weight .

showed that the mice fed a high-fat diet had considerably differentcomposition of gut microbiota compared with the mice fed normal chow before surgery they demonstrated that rygb could overwhelm the effect of diet on gut microbiota and the gut microbial composition was similar following rygb whether mice were fed normal chow or a high-fat diet .

fecal microbiota was profiled by 16s ribosomal dna gene sequencing and analyzed using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime to determine the a and b diver- sities of gut microbiota.results the body weight of the rygb and sg group was significantly lower than that of the sham group.

unweighted unifrac-based principal coordinate analysis of 5323091 se- quences from 85 fecal samples from 17 rats revealed a distinct cluster of gut microbiota post rygb from sg and sham sur- gery.
