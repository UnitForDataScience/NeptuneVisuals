Despite an initial spike in the percentage of Proteobacteria in the sham group and the SG group at 1 week postoperatively sham baseline 7.50 - 1.47  vs. week 1 17.71 - 2.08 P  0.01 SG baseline 6.24 - 1.28  vs. week 135.91 - 4.18  P  0.01 the percentage of Proteobacteria in the two groups remained apparently lower than that of the RYGB group from 3 weeks postoperatively week 9 RYGB 8.98 - 1.99  vs. sham 2.07 - 0.44  P  0.01 RYGB 8.98 - 1.99  vs. SG 3.92 - 0.97  P  0.05.

In the Firmicutes phylum which includes Lactobacillales Clostridiales and Erysipelotrichales the RYGB group had a significantly higher proportion of Lactobacillales and Erysipelotrichales and a significantly lower proportion of Clostridiales 6 and 9 weeks postoperatively week 9 Clostridiales  RYGB 68.46 - 9 .84  vs. sham 91.97 - 2.19  P  0.05 RYGB 68.46 - 9.84  vs. SG90.71 - 4.02  P  0.05 Lactobacillales RYGB 25.98 - 8.06  vs. sham 6.60 - 2.11  P  0.05 RYGB 25.98 - 8.06  vs. SG 7.97 - 3.94  P  0.05 Erysipelotrichales RYGB 5.39 - 2.11  vs. sham 1.28 - 0.49  P  0.05 RYGB 5.39 - 2.11  vs. SG0.94 - 0.43  P  0.05 Fig.

The food in- take in the SG group remained significantly depressed post- operatively baseline 191.53 - 4.54 g vs. week 9171.67 - 3.86 g P  0.01 and markedly lower than that of the sham group P  0.01.RYGB Causes a Distinct Shift in Gut MicrobiotaUnweighted UniFrac-based principal coordinate analysis of 5323091 sequences from 85 fecal samples from 17 rats re- vealed a similar gut microbiota in rats from the SG group and the sham group forming one distinct cluster at 1 week post- operatively and another cluster from 3 weeks postoperatively Fig.

Examination of the Shannon diversity index of gut microbiota revealed a decline in the diversity of gut microbiota of rats that had received RYGB while SG caused virtually no change in the diversity of gut microbiota except a brief decline in the immediate post- operative period.

e f.RYGB Reduces the Diversity of Gut MicrobiotaExamination of the Shannon diversity index of gut microbiota showed that after an initial decline at 1 week postoperatively the Shannon diversity index recovered from 3 weeks postop- eratively to the pre-operative level in the SG group baseline 4.24 - 0.15 vs. week 9 4.48 - 0.16 P  0.05 and the shamgroup baseline 4.43 - 0.19 vs. week 9 4.44 - 0.06 P  0.05 Fig.

Furthermore at week 9 postoperatively the mean body weight of rats in the RYGB group was significantly lower than that of both the sham group and the SG group P  0.001 the mean body weight of rats in the SG group was also markedly lower than that of rats in the sham group P  0.01.Fig.

c. Furthermore the propor- tion of Gammaproteobacteria in the RYGB group was signif- icantly higher than that of the SG group and the sham group from 3 weeks postoperatively week 9 RYGB 6.70 - 1.99  vs. sham 0.15 - 0.04  P  0.01 RYGB 6.70 - 1.99  vs. SG 1.00 - 0.67  P  0.01 Fig.
