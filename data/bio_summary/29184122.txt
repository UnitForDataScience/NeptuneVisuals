In 2011 the 5-year survival rate for oral cancer patients was only 60 in the United States and it became the sixth most common cancer in Taiwan and the fourth most common cancer among Taiwanese males.

The use of saliva as a diag- nostic target may avoid unnecessary biopsies and hospital and outpatient clinical visits it offers an inexpensive non-invasive and easily accessible early detection and prognosis tool and it allows for monitoring post-therapy in oral cancer patients-.

The patient history in terms of TNM classification for cancer patients is presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.

The results from this investi- gation demonstrated that correlation networks of salivary microbiota were remarkably varied within the three groups and that five genera - Bacillus Enterococcus Parvimonas Peptostreptococcus and Slackia - indicated sig- nificant differences between the Epithelial precursor lesion and Cancer groups.In our study most oral cancer patients were former or current chewers as were patients with epithelial pre- cursor lesions.

The present study demonstrates that changes in microbiota composition might have the potential to be used as a biomarker for predicting the pathologic development tran- sition of oral epithelial precursor lesion to cancer.

Studies have used NGS to obtain complete cultured and uncultured bacterial profiles in OSCC subjects and have identified enrichments of the species Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Streptococcus gordonii at tumour sitesand significantly lower abundance levels of Firmicutes especially Streptococcus and Actinobacteria especially Rothia in cancer samples.Saliva is in direct contact with oral cancer and epithelial precursor lesions hence abnormal DNA RNA and protein molecules released by malignant cells can be easily obtained from saliva.

The involvement of oral bacteria in inflammation and their association with OSCC progression provide a feasible target for diagnosis.

The association of bacteria with OSCC progression can be explained by inflammation-induced DNA damage in epithelial cells caused by microorganism-secreted endotoxins.
