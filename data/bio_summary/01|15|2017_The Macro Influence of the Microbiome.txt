Through seven Brief Reviews this issue of The JI high- lights the pervasive impact of the gut microbiome on immune functions both in the gut and at distal sites and features a coverchosen from a themed competition for this issue.These compiled Brief Reviews underscore our recent appreci- ation that the far-reaching influence of commensal gut microbes on immune function reflects the coevolution of this symbiotic mi- crobial ecosystem and its mammalian hosts.

Recognizing the sweeping impact of lifestyle changes in the Western world Plunkett and Nagler highlight the influence of the microbiota and environmental exposure to microbial products on the acquisition of food allergies 4 whereas the focus of the Brief Review by Paun Yau and Danska is the effect of the resident gutmicrobiota on the rapid rise in the incidence of type I diabetesamong genetically stable populations 5.

Taken together these Brief Reviews provide an impressive illustration of the ongoing dialogue between the gut microbiota and the immune system which when balanced at the ideal set point maintains immune homeostasis and when dis- rupted drives far-ranging clinical consequences.We are excited that this collection of topical Brief Reviews on The Macro Influence of the Microbiome inaugurates the 101st year of continuous publication of The Journal of Immunology and underscores the breadth of the journal's scope and the eclectic research interests of its readership.
