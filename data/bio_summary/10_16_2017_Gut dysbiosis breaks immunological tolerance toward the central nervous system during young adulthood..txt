Furthermore the development of 3A6- TCR Tg CD4CD8- T cells is significantly decreased along with a massive reduction in CD4CD8 double-positive T cells in 21- to 35-wk-old Tg mice 3.3 and the population of MBP-specific CD4 T cells Vb5.1CD3CD4CD8- within the CD4CD8- T-cell compartment decreased in 21- to 35-wk-old mice 39.7 Fig.

Therefore adolescence and young adulthood are the most risky periods for the development of pathogenic MBP-specific T cells in 3A6DR2a Tg mice.In this study we investigated how autoreactive T cells specific for myelin antigens can differentiate into encephalitogenic T cells spontaneously in 3A6DR2a Tg mice during adolescence and young adulthood.

In addition thymic involution reduces the egress of T cells and triggers the proliferation of naive T cells in the periphery this is referred to as homeostatic proliferation 12 13.

During ho- meostatic proliferation certain populations of autoreactive naive T cells can expand and differentiate into Th1 and Th17 memory effector T cells which may then participate in the initiation of autoimmunity and allograft rejection 14-16.

To examine how MBP-specific T cells can spontaneously differentiate into encephalitogenic T cells we created Tg mice that express an MS-associated HLA-DR2a gene and TCR genes specific for MBP87-99HLA-DR2a that were isolated from a 3A6 T-cell clone derived from an MS patient referred to here as 3A6DR2a Tg mice 32.

Thus 3A6-TCR Tg T cells respond to cognate MBP antigen more vigorously during the 5- to 10-wk-old period when spontaneous EAE develops most frequently whereas these cells appear to have undergone anergy during the 21- to 35-wk-old period when EAE is not observed.Young Adulthood Is the Most Risky Period for the Development of Pathogenic T Cells.

Importantly naive T cells can differentiate into effectormemory T cells via homeostatic proliferation which occurs in response to thymic involution and the reduction of T-cell egress from the thymus.
