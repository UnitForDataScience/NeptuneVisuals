other studies performed in male rats indicate an alteration of the intestinal barrier at weaning in the maternal separation model23 that was detected by the significant increase of colonic short-circuit cur- rent and horseradish peroxidase flux along with increased intestinal permeability that was still maintained in adulthood.634 glucocor- ticoids play a role in the increased intestinal permeability induced by a short acute maternal separation stress in pnd10 pups17 but not in adult rats subjected to repeated maternal separation.3637 in the present study we found no correlation between corticosterone plasma levels and intestinal permeability at weaning either in lns or bms models suggesting that glucocorticoids are not involved in the mechanisms contributing to the altered permeability.

indeed sprague-dawley pups showed either no change712 or increased13 levels at pnd9 whereas pnd10 wistar pups exhibited a delayed maturation of the adrenal glands with significant reduction in plasma corticosterone.14 pnd10 wistar pups also showed elevated intestinal barrier perme- ability selectively in males.14at weaning the hpa axis is still in development1516 and the in-testinal barrier permeability to macromolecules is high and declines thereafter although it remains more permeable up to pnd40.17-19 during this period bacterial colonization is in process and promotes the development of food tolerance and immune function.20 of im- portance recent reports in rodents indicate that early-life stress may influence the microbiota which could be associated with long lasting effects.21-23 in particular maternal separation for 3 hours per day from pnd2-9 results in a distinct fecal microbiota in adult rats.22 however whether early life adverse event is associated with altera- tions of gut microbiota diversity and community structure during development is yet to be established.in the present study we investigated whether chronic post-natal stress induced by exposure to lns from pnd2 to 10 influences basal corticosterone and in vivo intestinal-colonic permeability at weaning after 11 days of normal housing.

intestinal barrier disruption has been described to occur in ibs patients38-41 although the link between early adverse life events and increased intestinal permeability needs to be evaluated based on the present experimental data.on the other hand bms exposure is associated with a signifi-cant lower intestinal permeability than the ctl group at weaning in both sexes which was already observed at pnd10.14 togetherthese findings are indicative that short maternal separation acceler- ates maturation of intestinal barrier function during development stages in both male and female pups.

no taxa were associated with intestinal permeability after adjusting for lns group and sex.discussionthe present study indicates that exposure of wistar pups to lns post-natally from days 2 to 10 induced alteration in plasma corticosterone levels gut permeability and fecal microbiota as moni- tored 11 days after the end of lns at the time of weaning.we reported previously that pnd10 wistar pups exposed to lns from pnd2 to 10 had delayed maturation of the hpa axis as shown by a significant reduction of corticosterone plasma levels and adrenal glands weight100 g body weight in both males and females.14 in the present study pnd21 male and female pups exposed to similar conditions of lns followed by 11 days of normal housing showed 67 p  0.050 and 147 p  0.01 higher basal corticosterone plasma levels respectively than same sex controls with values in females being significantly superior than in males.

considering the role of altera- tions in intestinal permeability in stress-sensitive ibs manifesta- tion42 the present data may have a bearing with our previous report showing that exposure to bms reduced the visceral pain to colorec- tal distension monitored 1 hour after exposure to water avoidance stress and prevents the hyperalgesia 24 hours later while repeated 3-hour maternal separations resulted in a hyperalgesic response when tested in adulthood.43there is growing recognition that the neonatal intestinal micro- biota plays a critical role in neurodevelopment and postnatal hpa stress response.44 recent evidence also indicates that the gut micro- biota contributes to the expression of behavioral alterations in adult mice exposed to early maternal separation.21 the present study in- dicates that pnd21 rats reared in lns conditions have decreased fecal microbiota diversity and a distinct composition compared to ctl rats.

however the analysis of the microbiota was performed in feces and not in the intestine and we could not exclude the possibility that alterations in bacteria adhering to the gut mucosa could potentially be involved in the modulation of the hpa axis and the intestinal permeability induced by lns.sustained perturbations in the intestinal microbiota relatedto early-life stress may be a potential contributing mechanism by which early adverse life events can be linked to the susceptibility of developing ibs later in life given the extensive literature suggesting a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of ibs.4748 recent stud- ies showed rats exposed to lns from pnd 2-9 display visceral hypersensitivity when they are adults.2627 disturbance of bacterialcolonization by antibiotic treatment from pnd4 to 13 induces visceral hypersensitivity in adult rats which is more pronounced in males.49 conversely probiotic treatment from pnd3 to 60 has a protective effect on the development of visceral hyperalgesia in wi- star rats exposed to maternal separation stress for 3 hours per day from pnd2 to 14.50 taken together the present and previous stud- ies point to a potential important role played by dysbiosis during the early-life period in modulating the visceral sensitivity of the host.in conclusion the present study shows for the first time that chronic early exposure of dams to lns for the pnd2-10 period impacts the offspring development during the critical suckling peri- od.

in vivo intestinal permeability to fd4 in male and female pnd21 pups in limited nesting stress lns brief maternal separation bms and control ctl groups.

by contrast we described previously that pnd10 pups exposed similarly to lns exhibited a significant increase of intestinal permeability occurring mainly in male pups.14 the temporal sex differences observed here could not be explained by hormonal actions as efficient secretion of sexual hormones does not occur until pnd30 in rats.35 collectively these findings point to a sex difference in developmental susceptibility to early-life stress with immediate and long lasting alterations in intes- tinal barrier function occurring later in females compared to males.
