in the case of spontaneous fermentation the must after crushing of grapes contains around 106 cfu of yeasts per ml ribe'reau-gayon and others 2006. because the most intense stage of fermentation is characterized by yeast populations of about 108 cfuml the time required for growth multiplication of indigenous yeasts cells and full conversion of sugar to alcohol is much longer compared to the fermentation with inoculation of selected yeast strain.

fermentation characteristics and aromatic profile of plum wines produced with indigenous microbiota and pure cultures of selected yeasturovs milji'c vladimir puvskavs vesna vuvcurovi'c and ana muzalevskiabstract the aim of this study was to assess and compare fermentation characteristics and aromatic profile of plum wines produced with indigenous microbiota and pure cultures of different selected yeast.

also plum fruits losses in refrigeration industry could be avoided due to longer shelf life of this fermented beverage.introductionthe composition and quality of fruit wines depends on the im- pact of a number of factors such as environmental conditions cli- mate and soil variety degree of fruit ripeness primary processing techniques fermentation conditions ph temperature aeration nutrient availability indigenous microbiota use of yeasts starter culture and so on and further vinification procedures applica- tion oenological preparations pomace mixing racking clarifica- tion filtration aging and stabilization of wine.yeasts are microorganisms responsible for wine fermentation the biotransformation of fermentable sugars into ethanol carbon dioxide and cellular energy.

spontaneous fermentation usually lasts longer than the fermentation with yeast cultures inoculation and gives results that do not always correspond to the producer's expecta- tions.

the activity of different saccharomyces strains in wine fermenta- tion gives wines of different aromatic profile which depends on the composition of a large number of volatile compounds esters of acetic acid ethyl esters of fatty acids higher alcohols volatile thiols and so on king and others 2008 swiegers and others 2009. thus for example s. bayanus produce greater amounts of some higher alcohol primarily 2-phenylethanol and esters 2- phenylethyl acetate compared to the s. cerevisiae antonelli and others 1999.effects of sequential inoculation and co-inoculation of saccha- romyces and non-saccharomyces yeast strains on the fermentation pa- rameters and the quality of produced wine represented the scope of numerous studies in the last decade ciani and others 2006 jolly and others 2006 mendoza and others 2007 ciani and others 2010 benito and others 2015 gonza'lez-royo and others 2015. one of the most investigated applications of mixed yeast cultures controlled multistarter fermentation in the wine production is related to biological deacidification of must andor wine.

the activity of these s. cerevisiae strains is responsible for converting the rest of sugar into ethanol and formation of aromatic by-products satora and tuszyn'ski 2005.shizosaccharomyces pombe effectively performed partial deacidi- fication of juice in the initial stage of plum wine fermentation of joshi and others 1991. efficiency of deacidification by the stated yeast was decreasing during fermentation with the increase of ethanol content in wine above 5 vv.

adjustment of ph to desired values was conducted using malic acid and calcium carbonate.in order to assess the effect of different yeasts application in the production of plum wine in this case of cv acvanska lepotica variety on the fermentation characteristics and aromatic profile of wines produced following commercially available yeast strains were testedsaccharomyces cerevisiae strains alchemy i anchor yeast johannesburg south africa spiriferm erbslo h geisenheim germany and oenoferm pinotype erbslo h geisenheim germanysaccharomyces bayanus strains spiriferm arom erbslo h geisenheim germany and oenoferm freddo erbslo h geisenheim germanyfurthermore sequential fermentation with schizosaccharomyces pombe culture collection of the faculty of technology uni- versity of novi sad serbia and s. cerevisiae spiriferm erbslo h inoculated after 3 d was evaluated.

plum wines produced by alcoholic fermentation of indigenous yeasts present on the skin surface of 3 plum varieties used in this study spontaneous fermentation represented con- trol samples k. control samples produced from 3 local plumvarieties were also analyzed in order to assess the influence of their indigenous microbiota on aromatic profile of plum wines.plum wine was passed through the cheesecloth when the fer- mentation finished and then kept in full 1.5 l glass bottles at 10 degc in order to in order to remove the coarse precipitate.

a large number of wine yeast strains is nowadays com- mercially available and what makes the choice difficult is a large number of complex interaction mechanisms between strains must and fermentation conditions.influence of different yeast strains on fermentation character- istics of plum wine is shown in table 1. based on the obtained results statistically significant differences in fermentative charac- teristics of different commercial yeast strains under applied exper- imental conditions were observed.

however ciani and others 2010 reported that the growth of wild yeasts such as k. apiculata and c. stellata is not entirely suppressed in the fermentation with selected cul- tures of s. cerevisiae and that their presence can be significant in the final stages of fermentation.impact of yeast strains on the aromatic profile of plum winesin addition to the primary aromatic components which are formed during the fruit ripening stage and are extracted during the vinification plum wine flavor is also determined with the sec- ondary aromatic components formed during fermentation.

the most important groups of aromatic compounds formed during fermentation of plums' pomace are higher alcohols aldehydes and esters.the impact of different yeast strains selected and indigenous on the composition and content of aromatic compounds of plum wine is shown in table 2.metabolic activity of various indigenous andor of selected yeasts during fermentation of plum pomace resulted in signifi- cant differences in the content of certain aromatic compounds in produced wines.

pozvegacva is con- sidered to be the most suitable plum variety for brandy production due to high concentration of aromatic substances in the fruit nikic'evic' and paunovic' 2013. on the other hand in the case ofcv acvanska rana early ripening variety fermentation by indigenous microbiota resulted in a wine with slightly poorer sensory characteristics.the results of the sensory analysis are also shown via the per- centage of sensory acceptability of wine aroma taste and flavor figure 1 and 2. sensory acceptability represents the ratio of the number of points assigned for specific sensory parameter in relation to a defined maximum.table 4-sensory analysis of plum cv acvanska lepotica variety wines produced with different yeast strains.the data represent the average values of the scores given by 5 members of the panel.different letters abc in the same row indicate significant differences between values p  0.05.table 5-sensory analysis of plum wines produced by the activity of indigenous yeast strains spontaneous fermentation.color max 2 pointsclarity max 2 pointsaroma max 4 pointstaste and flavor max 12 pointstotal max 20 pointscv acvanska rana1.7a2a2.8 a 10.0a 16.5a cv acvanska lepotica1.8a1.8a3a10.5b17.1b pozvegacva1.9a2a 3.3b 11.3c 18.5cthe data represent the average values of the scores given by 5 members of the paneldifferent inline letters abc in the same row indicate significant differences between values p  0.05.conclusionsstatistically significant differences in fermentative characteristics and the content of certain volatile compounds were observed as a result of metabolic activity of various indigenous andor selected yeasts during fermentation of plum pomace.

the predominantester in plum wines was ethyl acetate whereas ethyl lactate amyl acetate isoamyl acetate and ethyl palmitate esters responsible for the floral and fruity olfactory tones are also present in larger amounts.the most significant differences between the wines from 3 local plum varieties produced by spontaneous fermentation have been recorded in terms of 1-propanol 1-hexanol ethyl-lactate izoamailacetate 1-phenylethanol ethyl octanoate ethyl decanoate and ethyl laurate content.considering the results obtained for the fermentation efficiency the content of aromatic compounds as well as the assessment of sensory properties it can be concluded that the s. cerevisiae strains spriferm was the most suitable for production of high quality plum wine in the applied conditions.

statistically significant differences in fermentative characteristics and the content of certain volatile compounds were observed as a result of metabolic activity of various indigenous andor selected yeasts during fermentation of plum pomace.
