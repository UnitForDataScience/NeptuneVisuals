Also plum fruits losses in refrigeration industry could be avoided due to longer shelf life of this fermented beverage.IntroductionThe composition and quality of fruit wines depends on the im- pact of a number of factors such as environmental conditions cli- mate and soil variety degree of fruit ripeness primary processing techniques fermentation conditions pH temperature aeration nutrient availability indigenous microbiota use of yeasts starter culture and so on and further vinification procedures applica- tion oenological preparations pomace mixing racking clarifica- tion filtration aging and stabilization of wine.Yeasts are microorganisms responsible for wine fermentation the biotransformation of fermentable sugars into ethanol carbon dioxide and cellular energy.

Spontaneous fermentation usually lasts longer than the fermentation with yeast cultures inoculation and gives results that do not always correspond to the producer's expecta- tions.

Adjustment of pH to desired values was conducted using malic acid and calcium carbonate.In order to assess the effect of different yeasts application in the production of plum wine in this case of CV acVanska lepotica variety on the fermentation characteristics and aromatic profile of wines produced following commercially available yeast strains were testedSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains Alchemy I Anchor Yeast Johannesburg South Africa Spiriferm Erbslo h Geisenheim Germany and Oenoferm PinoType Erbslo h Geisenheim GermanySaccharomyces bayanus strains Spiriferm Arom Erbslo h Geisenheim Germany and Oenoferm Freddo Erbslo h Geisenheim GermanyFurthermore sequential fermentation with Schizosaccharomyces pombe Culture Collection of the Faculty of Technology Uni- versity of Novi Sad Serbia and S. cerevisiae Spiriferm Erbslo h inoculated after 3 d was evaluated.

Plum wines produced by alcoholic fermentation of indigenous yeasts present on the skin surface of 3 plum varieties used in this study spontaneous fermentation represented con- trol samples K. Control samples produced from 3 local plumvarieties were also analyzed in order to assess the influence of their indigenous microbiota on aromatic profile of plum wines.Plum wine was passed through the cheesecloth when the fer- mentation finished and then kept in full 1.5 L glass bottles at 10 degC in order to in order to remove the coarse precipitate.

A large number of wine yeast strains is nowadays com- mercially available and what makes the choice difficult is a large number of complex interaction mechanisms between strains must and fermentation conditions.Influence of different yeast strains on fermentation character- istics of plum wine is shown in Table 1.

Because the most intense stage of fermentation is characterized by yeast populations of about 108 cfumL the time required for growth multiplication of indigenous yeasts cells and full conversion of sugar to alcohol is much longer compared to the fermentation with inoculation of selected yeast strain.

However Ciani and others 2010 reported that the growth of wild yeasts such as K. apiculata and C. stellata is not entirely suppressed in the fermentation with selected cul- tures of S. cerevisiae and that their presence can be significant in the final stages of fermentation.Impact of yeast strains on the aromatic profile of plum winesIn addition to the primary aromatic components which are formed during the fruit ripening stage and are extracted during the vinification plum wine flavor is also determined with the sec- ondary aromatic components formed during fermentation.

The most important groups of aromatic compounds formed during fermentation of plums' pomace are higher alcohols aldehydes and esters.The impact of different yeast strains selected and indigenous on the composition and content of aromatic compounds of plum wine is shown in Table 2.Metabolic activity of various indigenous andor of selected yeasts during fermentation of plum pomace resulted in signifi- cant differences in the content of certain aromatic compounds in produced wines.

The predominantester in plum wines was ethyl acetate whereas ethyl lactate amyl acetate isoamyl acetate and ethyl palmitate esters responsible for the floral and fruity olfactory tones are also present in larger amounts.The most significant differences between the wines from 3 local plum varieties produced by spontaneous fermentation have been recorded in terms of 1-propanol 1-hexanol ethyl-lactate izoamailacetate 1-phenylethanol ethyl octanoate ethyl decanoate and ethyl laurate content.Considering the results obtained for the fermentation efficiency the content of aromatic compounds as well as the assessment of sensory properties it can be concluded that the S. cerevisiae strains Spriferm was the most suitable for production of high quality plum wine in the applied conditions.
