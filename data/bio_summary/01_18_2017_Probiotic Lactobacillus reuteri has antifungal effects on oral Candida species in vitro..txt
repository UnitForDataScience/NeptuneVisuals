both l. reuteri strains were able to inhibit the growth of five of the tested candida strains but not the two c. krusei strains.

co-aggregation increased significantly over time 1 2 and 4 h for all combinations of candida and probiotic strains p 0.05. for all the tested candida strains l. reuteri pta 5289 showed a statistically significantly higher co-aggregation ratio than l. reuteri dsm 17938 after4 h incubation p 0.001. the results of the co- aggregation ratios  after 4 h are presented in .growth inhibition of candida by l. reuterithe results of the growth inhibition assays are summarized in .

in general l. reuteri dsm 17938 was significantly better at inhibiting the growth of the candida strains than l. reuteri pta 5289 was p 0.001 the latter showed no complete inhibition of any of the candida strains.

in this study both l. reuteri strains were able to inhibit the growth of most of the candida strains except for c. krusei and to some extent c. tropicalis.

reuteri atcc pta 5289 and l. reuteri dsm 17938 showed the ability to co-aggregate with both clinicaland reference candida strains.

for c. tropicalis ccug 47037 an even weaker inhibition tendency was observed at high l. reuteri dsm 17938 cell concentrations compared with lower cell concentra- tions whereas c. glabrata cbs 863 was completelyinhibited at high l. reuteri dsm 17938 cell con- centrations compared with slight inhibition at lower concentrations.bacterial acid production measured by phtypical results of the ph microsensor measurements in the agar overlay cultures of the lactobacilli and candida strains and control plates are shown in and .

hence superior interference of l. reuteri dsm 17938 must likely be explained by other factors such as an enhanced h2o2 or reuterin production which has been sug- gested in other studies .it is likely that the observed inhibition of the yeasts is caused by the acidic environment in the agar due to lactic acid and other organic acids produced by the two l. reuteri strains either directly or due to the production of bacteriocins at low ph .

the candida strains used were six laboratory reference strains from the culture collection university of gothenburg sweden c. albicans ccug 46390 c. dubliniensis ccug 48722c.

the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the in vitro abilities of two strains of the probiotic l. reuteri with demonstrated ability to reduce the candida load in vivo in a vulnerable population and to co-aggregate with and inhibit the growth of six opportunistic pathogenic oral candida species.

moreover the ability of the lactobacilli to produce h2o2 was verified.materials and methodsstrains and culture conditionstwo strains of the probiotic l. reuteri dsm 17938 and atcc pta 5289 biogaia stockholm sweden were used in this study.

the experiment was repeated twice at two different occasions.h2o2 production by the lactobacilliin order to verify the ability of the two l. reuteri strains to produce h2o2 a method described by kang et al.

briefly one single colony of overnight cultured l. reuteri strains was plated onto mrs agar containing 0.25 mgml 33'55'-tetra- methylbenzidine sigma poole uk and 0.01 mgml peroxidase from horseradish sigma and incubated anaerobically for 48 h at 37degc.

no statistically significant dif- ferences were found between the two l. reuteri strains for c. krusei.
