of note similar im- mune modulatory responses were observed for both the l- and d-lactic acid isomers .our data are distinct from other studies reporting pro- inflammatory effects of lactic acid on immune and vaginal epithelial cells  which appears to be at odds with the observed non-inflammatory effects of vaginal lactobacilli e. this apparent discrepancy may be explained by the use of lactic acid concentrations that are cytotoxic under the conditions employed in vitro or that lactic acid is not tested at physiological concentrations and low ph observed in women with lactobacillus-dominated microbiota where the proton- ated lactic acid and not the lactate anion predominates .while our investigations have not revealed major differ- ences between the immunomodulatory properties of the two lactic acid isomers on cervicovaginal epithelial cells two studies have found differences.

the differential effects reported for lactic acid isomers and their protonated forms will be discussed as well as how lactobacilli generate lactic acid by using amylase breakdown products of glycogen we also review clinical studies that have evaluated the use of lactic acid or lactobacilli probiotics in preventing or treating bacterial vaginosis and studies that are providing a clearer understanding of the properties of lactic acid produc- tion by lactobacillus spp.

since lactic acid can inhibit hsv-1 and hsv-2 in vitro this suggests that either a lactic-acid-producing probiotic or direct vaginal delivery of lactic acid might reduce hsv-1 and hsv-2 levels in the lower frt.immunomodulatory properties of lactic acidlactobacilli are generally associated with a non- inflammatory vaginal environment e while the pres- ence of polymicrobial vaginal microbiota e.g.

while intermittent delivery of lactic acid alone may prove to be effective in the treatment of bv and to prevent bv recurrence  it is likely to be most effective when used in combination with antimicrobials for the treatment of bv .conclusionsprobiotic lactobacilli that produce lactic acid with the desiredd-to l-lactic acid ratios may be considered lactic acid factoriesthat can deliver sustained amounts of this metabolite to the cervicovaginal mucosa.

a major distinguishing feature between the vaginal environment in states of eubiosis and dysbiosis is a high concentration of lactic acid produced by lactobacilli that acidifies the vagina in eubiosis versus a sharp drop in lactic acid and an increase in ph in dysbiosis.

here we review the antimicrobial antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of lactic acid and the use of lactic acid and lactobacilli probiotics in preventing or treating bv.c 2017 the authors.

the observation that the vaginal microbiome in asymptomatic women is largely composed of bacteria capable of producing lactic acid leads to the assertion that lactic acid has a potential key ecological function in vaginal microbiomes associated with eubiosis.the vaginal microbiomes harboured by women can differ based on cultural behavioural and genetic factors.

acetic acid pka 4.76 propionic acid pka 4.87 butyric acid pka 4.82 and succinic acid pka 4.16 and 5.61. the association of high lactic acid levels with lactobacillus- dominated microbiota suggests that this organic acid metab- olite contributes to the beneficial properties ascribed to lac- tobacilli such as decreased susceptibility of the human host to urogenital pathogens which would be a desirable character- istic for a vaginal probiotic.lactic acid is the major acidifier of the lower frt when lactobacilli dominatelactobacilli are aerotolerant anaerobes that produce lactic acid through the fermentation of glucose .

in women with lactobacillus-dominated microbiota the lactic acid concen- tration is inversely correlated with ph indicating that lactic acid is primarily responsible for acidification of the vagina.

this lactic acid concentration is 11 times higher and ph considerably lower than previously reported  as these recent measurements were restricted to women with nugent scores of 0e3 and took into consideration the loss of co2 and minimised exposure of cervicovaginal secretions to aerobic conditions .vaginal lactic acid exists as l- and d-isomers predominantly produced by lactobacilli with 15 of l-lactic produced by vaginal epithelial cells .

lactobacilli acidifying the vagina slow down their production of lactic acid until their production rate matches the rate at which lactic acid is lost from the vagina .

we have demonstrated that the protonated form of lactic acid and not the lactate anion has antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities with similar properties reported for the l- and d- lactic acid isomers .

to maximise the antibacterial properties of lactic acid lactobacillus-based probiotics would need to acidify the vagina to ph 3.9 to achieve a condition where the protonated form of lactic acid dominates.lactic acid is a major antimicrobial factor produced by lactobacilliuntil recently the prevailing view was that h2o2 is the major antimicrobial factor produced by lactobacilli .

notably the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid is orders of magnitude greater than media acidified to ph 4.5 with hcl alone or with acetic acid and the bactericidal activity is mediated by the protonated form of lactic acid not the lactate anion .

while gbs are acid- tolerant and produce lactic acid as a virulence factor  the concentration of lactic acid produced is lower compared to lactobacilli grown under the same culture conditions .
