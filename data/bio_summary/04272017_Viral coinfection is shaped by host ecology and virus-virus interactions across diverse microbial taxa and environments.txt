The data set examining cross-infectivity assessed infection experimentally with laboratory cultures while other two data sets culture and single-cell coinfection used sequence data to infer infection.The first data set on cross-infectivity potential coinfection is composed of bacteriophage host-range infection matrices documenting the results of experimental attempts at lytic infec- tion in cultured phage and hosts .

The host-range infec- tion data are matrices of infection success or failure via the 'spot test' briefly a drop of phage lysate is 'spotted' on a bacte- rial lawn and lysing of bacteria is noted as presence or absence.This data set represents studies with varying sample composi- tions in terms of bacteria and phage species bacterial energy sources source of samples bacterial association and isolation habitat.The second data set on culture coinfection is derived from viral sequence information mined from published microbial genome sequence data on National Center for Biotechnology Information's NCBI databases .

ongoing lytic infections.A list and description of data sources are included in Supplementary Table S1 and the raw data used in this paper are deposited in the FigShare data repository Factors explaining cross-infectivity and coinfectionTo test the factors that potentially influence coinfection-- ecology host taxonomyphylogeny host defense mechanisms and virus-virus interactions--I conducted regression analyses on each of the three data sets representing an increasingly fine scale analysis of coinfection from cross-infectivity to culture coinfection and finally to single-cell coinfection.

In this study this concern can be addressed by noting that not all the sequencing data in the culture coinfection data set was gener- ated by high-throughput sequencing the prevalence of host coinfections containing ssDNA viruses was virtually identical within 0.63 to the detectability of ssDNA viruses in the over- all data set and the prevalence of ssDNA viruses in this data set 6 is in line with validated unbiased estimates of ssDNA virus prevalence from natural marine habitats  .

details the data used to test each of the factors that potentially influence coinfection and details on the analysis of each data set are provided in turn below.First to test the potential influence of these factors on cross- infectivity I conducted a factorial analysis of variance ANOVA on the cross-infectivity data set.

The data set is composed of viral infections detected using sequence data n 14 12498 in all bacterial and archaeal hosts n 14 5492 with sequenced genomes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's NCBI databases supplemented with data on host habitat and energy source collected primarily from the Joint Genome Institute's Genomes Online Database JGI-GOLD.

At the culture coinfection scale a study mining sequence data to examine virus-host relation- ships uncovered widespread coinfection in publicly available bacterial and archaeal genome sequence data .

Thus detailed molecular studies of coinfection dynamics and virome sequence data are generating questions ripe for testing across diverse taxa and environments.Here I employ virus-host interaction data sets to date to pro- vide a broad comprehensive picture of the ecological and bio- logical factors shaping coinfection.

These data are composed of three data sets that provide an increasingly fine-grained examination of coinfection from cross-infectivity potential coinfection to coinfection at the culture pure cultures or single colonies not necessarily single cells and single-cell levels.
