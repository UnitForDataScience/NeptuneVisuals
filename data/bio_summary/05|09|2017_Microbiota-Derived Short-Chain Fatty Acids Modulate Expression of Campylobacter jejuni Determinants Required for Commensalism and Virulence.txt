To assess the production of acetate in C. jejuni strains we inoculated C. jejuni into Campylobacter defined medium CDM and monitored produc- tion of acetate during growth of the WT strain and acetogenesis mutant for up to 32 h. CDM contains all amino acids with most amino acids around 1 mM and serine the most abundant at 19 mM and the keto acids pyruvate and a.-ketoglutarate 5 to 9 mM which together are the primary carbon sources for C. jejuni during growth in this medium .

We next inves- tigated whether genes dependent upon the acetogenesis pathway for WT levels ofFIG 4 Transcriptional analysis of acetogenesis-dependent genes of C. jejuni A and B. Semiquantitative real-time PCR analysis of transcription of a subset of genes initially identified by microarray analysis of WT C. jejuni and C. jejuni Dpta ackA.

These data indicate that lactate has an opposite effect on transcription of the SCFA-influenced genes in WT C. jejuni with lactate possibly functioning in vivo to dampen expression of these genes in the upper regions of the intestinal tract where lactate is a predominant metabolite over SCFAs and C. jejuni colonizes less efficiently.We next analyzed the net effect of a mixture of lactate and butyrate on gene expression in WT C. jejuni.

Thus we propose that C. jejuni monitors SCFAs in the environment to initiate production of catabolic pathways and colonization factors necessary for commensalism and persistence in favored niches in the natural avian host.DISCUSSIONIn this work we discovered that C. jejuni responds to common intestinal metabolites by altering transcription of genes required for commensal colonization of a naturalFIG 10 In vivo expression of the acetogenesis-dependent genes in C. jejuni colonizing different regions of the avian intestinal tract.

How C. jejuni differentiates between regions of the intestinal tract to locate preferred niches to establish either a persistent asymptomatic colonization in avian species or a productive infection in humans is largely unknown.Compared to many other enteric pathogens C. jejuni possesses a very limited carbo- hydrate catabolism due to lack of enzymes to utilize many sugars as a carbon source  .

Indeed we observed that transcription of ackA was greatly reduced in the ptaTn mutant compared to wild-type WT C. jejuni data not shown.We constructed new mutants from C. jejuni 81-176 Smr DastA.

On the day the chicks hatched the chicks were orally infected with approximately 100 CFU of WT C. jejuni 81-176 Smr or isogenic Dpta DackA or Dpta ackA mutants with different defects in the C. jejuni acetogenesis pathway.

In C. jejuni 81-176 a mutation has occurred that results in two separate openFIG 3 Analysis of growth of C. jejuni strains in rich and defined media.

C. jejuni strains were grown in Mueller-Hinton MH broth A or Campylobacter defined medium CDM broth B in microaerobic conditions at 37degC for 56 to 80 h. Strains used for analysis include WT C. jejuni 81-176 Smr containing pDAR1423 empty vector black circles and line 81-176 Smr Dpta ackA containing pDAR1423 empty vector blue circles and line and 81-176 Smr Dpta ackA containing pPML1071 pta ackA in pDAR1423 red circles and line.
