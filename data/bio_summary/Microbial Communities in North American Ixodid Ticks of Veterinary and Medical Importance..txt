Over the last decade next-generation sequencing technology targeting the 16S rRNA gene led to documented snapshots of bacterial communities among life stages of laboratory and field-collected ticks ticks in various feeding states and tick tissues.

4179.doi Interest in microbial communities or microbiota of blood-feeding arthropods such as ticks order Parasitiformes suborder Ixodida is increasing.

While each generation of ticks begins with a maternally acquired repertoire of microorganisms microhabitats off and on vertebrate hosts can alter the microbiome during the life cycle.

Here we review our current understanding of micro- bial communities for some vectors in the family Ixodidae hard ticks in North America and interpret published findings for audiences in veterinary and medical fields with an appreciation of tick-borne disease.Keywords tick vectors microbiome next-generation sequencing pathogens endosymbiontsTiCKS AS OBLiGATe PARASiTeS iMPLiCATiOnS FOR THe TiCK MiCROBiOMeTicks represent a unique group of hematophagous ectoparasites capable of transmitting the greatest variety of microorganisms to vertebrate hosts .

The significance of ticks as vectors is not new.

In the late 1800s Smith and Kilbourne established Rhipicephalus Boophilus ticks as the vector for Texas cattle fever caused by Babesia bigemina .

After that discovery the abilityof ticks to acquire maintain and transmit pathogens became a significant and productive area of scientific research.

The microhabitat at the surface of a vertebrate host such as a human presents a complex source of organisms for ticks to potentially acquire .

In addition microorganisms may be exchanged through co-feeding as well as from the external environment considering ticks spend approximately 90 of their life off the host.

There are at least ten bacterial genera that are transovarially vertically transmitted including some found only in ticks e.g.
