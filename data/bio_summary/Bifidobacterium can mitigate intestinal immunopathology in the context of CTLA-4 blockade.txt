Lyophilized Bifidobacterium species including Bifidobacterium bifidum Bifidobacterium longum Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium breve Seeking Health were resuspended in PBS.

For the tumor model Bifidobacterium was given at 7 and 14 d following tumor inoculation.Quantification of Bifidobacterium by qPCR Assay.

Taqman-targeted qPCR was applied using primers and probesspecific for Bifidobacterium Bifid forward CGGGTGAGTAATGCGTGACC Bifid reverse TGATAGGACGCGACCCCA and probe 6FAM-CTCCTGGAAACGGGTG.The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was normalized by primers and probe targeting all bacteria all bacteria forward CGGTGAATACGTTC- CCGG all bacteria reverse TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT and probe 6FAM-CTTGTACACACCGCCCGTC.Serum Cytokine Measurement.

SansomAntibodies that attenuate immune tolerance have been used to effectively treat cancer but they can also trigger severe autoim- munity.

We then found that a commonly used probiotic Bifidobacte- rium could largely rescue the mice from immunopathology without an apparent effect on antitumor immunity and this effect may be dependent on regulatory T cells.probiotics  Bifidobacterium  CTLA-4  immune checkpoint blockade  intestinal immunopathologyancer immunotherapy has focused on harnessing the host immune system to stimulate an antitumor response.

Indeed Quantitative PCR qPCR analy- ses targeting Bifidobacterium species showed that the administra- tion of vancomycin decreased the abundance of these species to an undetectable level Fig.

To test whether this loss of Bifido- bacterium strains or others contributed to the severe colitis we obtained a commercially available mixture of four Bifidobacterium species and administered this mixture to mice via oral gavage before the induction of DSS colitis.

This Bifidobacterium treat- ment resulted in a 10-fold increase in the relative abundance of these bacteria in feces Fig.

3A.In our CTLA-4 blockade condition Bifidobacterium treatmentresulted in substantially less weight loss the average weight of vancomycin-treated mice improved from 75 of their initial weight in the DSS plus anti-CTLA-4 group to 95 in the Bifi- dobacterium group on day 8 after DSS administration Fig.

Mice treated with both Bifidobacterium and vancomycin exhibited less weight loss than control mice Fig.
