B Cytotoxicity to HeLa cells of medium conditioned by K. oxytoca AHC-6 WT and K. oxytoca AHC-6 DtnaA over time as indicated.

K. oxytoca WT and K. oxytoca DnpsA were included as controls.

We identified the toxin biosynthetic gene cluster by genetic mutation and localized the region to a unique pathogenicity island on the genome of cytotoxic K. oxytoca strains.8Here we report the biosynthesis of tilivalline and charac- terize a second PBD monomer generated by this pathway tilimycin which has stronger cytotoxic properties.

Feeding experiments with K. oxytoca mutant strains confirm synthesis of tilimycin 2 via 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3HAA.

Proposed chemical reactions of tilimycin 2 to culdesacin 3 via spontaneous ring-opening and to tilivalline 1 via a nucleophilic attack of free indole released by the tryptophanase TnaA-catalyzed cleavage of l-tryptophan.This could be verified by HPLC detection of tilivalline after synthetic tilimycin and indole had been added to medium lacking bacteria or enzyme activity Figure S4.

These experiments showed that spontaneous conversion of tilimycin 212 to culdesacin 3 occurs and that 2 reacts with indole to form tilivalline 1 as the natural trans isomer in the absence of enzyme activities see Figure S8.Having identified tilimycin 2 as the precursor for tilivalline 1 we next addressed the biosynthesis of 2.

Since the producing organism Klebsiella oxytoca is part of the intestinal microbiota and the pyrrolobenzodiazepine causes the pathogenesis of colitis it is important to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of tilivalline activity.

Production of two cytotoxic pyrrolobenzodiaze- pines with distinct functionalities by human gut resident Klebsiella oxytoca has important implications for intestinal disease.Antibiotic therapy disrupts the human intestinal microbiota.

In some patients treated with penicillin antibiotics rapid proliferation of this organism results in antibiotic- associated hemorrhagic colitis AAHC.7 We showed in previous work that the indol-3-yl-substituted pyrrolobenzo- diazepine PBD tilivalline 1 produced by K. oxytoca was required for the pathogenesis of colitis in an animal model of AAHC.8 Naturally occurring PBDs form a family of antitumor antibiotics produced by Gram-positive soil bac- teria.9 Synthesis of a natural PBD by a Gram-negative resident of the gut is thus surprising.
