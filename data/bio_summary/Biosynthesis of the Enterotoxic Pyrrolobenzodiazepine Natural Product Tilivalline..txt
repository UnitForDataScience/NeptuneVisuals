the dtnaa mutant produced only 2 and 3. impor- tantly tilivalline biosynthesis was restored in the mutant by genetic complementation k. oxytoca ahc-6 dtnaa ptnaa as well as by addition of 500 mm indole figure 1 e.scheme 1. proposed chemical reactions of tilimycin 2 to culdesacin 3 via spontaneous ring-opening and to tilivalline 1 via a nucleophilic attack of free indole released by the tryptophanase tnaa-catalyzed cleavage of l-tryptophan.this could be verified by hplc detection of tilivalline after synthetic tilimycin and indole had been added to medium lacking bacteria or enzyme activity figure s4.

the final product of enzymatic synthesis leads to either tilimycin 2 or culdesacin 3. tilimycin 2 can be further converted to tilivalline 1 after the nucleophilic attack of free indole which is released by the bacterial tryptophanase tnaa after enzymatic cleavage of l-trypto- phan.enzymes from the pathogenicity island is processed by a nonribosomal peptide synthase to n-acylprolinal 6. the subsequent ring closure to tilimycin 1 as well as the introduction of the indole moiety do not require a specific enzyme but can occur spontaneously through the intrinsic reactivities of the pertinent reaction intermediates.

thus k. oxytoca is able to produce two pbdfigure 2. feeding experiments with k. oxytoca mutant strains confirm synthesis of tilimycin 2 via 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3haa.

we identified the toxin biosynthetic gene cluster by genetic mutation and localized the region to a unique pathogenicity island on the genome of cytotoxic k. oxytoca strains.8here we report the biosynthesis of tilivalline and charac- terize a second pbd monomer generated by this pathway tilimycin which has stronger cytotoxic properties.

the first metabolite which we named tilimycin 2 shares with tilival- line the same pyrrolo21-c14benzodiazepine motif but has an hydroxyl group instead of the indole ring at the c11 position resulting in a hemiaminal moiety which is also responsible for the low stability of 2 figure 1 c. tilimycin 211 is more cytotoxic to hela cells ic50  2.6 mm than tilivalline 1 ic50  14.5 mm  figure s6.

these experiments showed that spontaneous conversion of tilimycin 212 to culdesacin 3 occurs and that 2 reacts with indole to form tilivalline 1 as the natural trans isomer in the absence of enzyme activities see figure s8.having identified tilimycin 2 as the precursor for tilivalline 1 we next addressed the biosynthesis of 2. the adenylation a domains of npsa and npsb were analyzed for substrate-activating specificity.

k. oxytoca wt and k. oxytoca dnpsa were included as controls.

since the producing organism klebsiella oxytoca is part of the intestinal microbiota and the pyrrolobenzodiazepine causes the pathogenesis of colitis it is important to understand the biosynthesis and regulation of tilivalline activity.

here we report the biosynthesis of tilivalline and show that this nonribosomal peptide assembly pathway initially generates tilimycin a simple pyrrolobenzodiazepine with cytotoxic properties.

tilivalline results from the non- enzymatic spontaneous reaction of tilimycin with biogeneti- cally generated indole.

through a chemical total synthesis of tilimycin we could corroborate the predictions made about the biosynthesis.
