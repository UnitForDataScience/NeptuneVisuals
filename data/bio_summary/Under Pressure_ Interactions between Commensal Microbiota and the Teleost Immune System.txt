Future studies should dis- sect the specific mechanisms by which different members of the fish microbiota and the metabolites they produce interact with pathogens with other commensals and with the teleost immune system.Keywords microbiota commensals teleost fish immunity mucosal immunity evolutioniNTRODUCTiONTeleost fish are colonized soon after hatching by a diverse set of microbes which interact with and shape the development of the host immune system.

Importantly commensal bacteria modulate B cells and mucosal Igs.THe TeLeOST FiSH MiCROBiOMeAlthough the presence of microbial communities on the mucosal surfaces of teleost fish has been acknowledged for decades the composition topography and environmental factors that shapeteleost bacterial microbiomes have only recently been unveiled thanks to deep sequencing of the 16S rDNA variable region.Currently most of the research efforts which aim to under- stand the fish microbiota have focused on sequencing bacterial communities from aquacultured species.

Due to the important and direct interactions between commensals and teleost mucosal surfaces we will describe in further details the organization and functioning of teleost MALT and their compo- nents in this review.Acontinuouslyproducedmucuslayercoverstheintestinal gill skin and nasal mucosal surfaces of fish.

Additionally these microbes can exert immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive effects on both innate and adaptive immune cells specific examples of which will be discussed further in this review.One of the most intimate relationships between microbiota and vertebrate mucosal immune systems is the coevolution between microorganisms and mucosal antibodies .

Thus in this review we will describe in detail current findings regarding how microbiota shape teleost B cell and antibody responses and how mucosal antibodies and secretory component SC allow the host to sculpt its microbial communities.

To date the interactions between the microbiota and mucosal APCs of fish have not been investigated.T cells are the most abundant of all the immune cells present in the MALT of teleost fish.

Successful maintenance of immune homeostasis at these sites allow the microbiota to live as an extension of the teleost's own physiology providing essential functions in nutrient metabolism mainte- nance of mucosal barriers and protection from pathogens.

The mechanisms of antigen uptake and antigen presentation in teleost MALT are not as well defined as those present in mammalian MALT but it is clear that teleost MALT have significant numbers of antigen-presenting cells at mucosal sites.

The in vivo mechanisms behind this inhibitory effect remain unexplored but T lymphocytes exposed to the microbiota of Rag1-deficient zebrafish in vitro produced more IFNg and TNFa compared to T lymphocytes exposed to the microbiota of wild-type zebrafish suggesting T cell- mediated inflammatory responses may play a role in shaping the microbiome.Finally it is worth highlighting the notion that microbiota contribute to the host's array of immune defenses.

Thus similar to mammals teleost immune systems depend on the microbiota for stimulation to maintain a natural state of activity which benefits the host.Germ-free larvae can be used to conduct reassociation studies using the natural microbiota single microbial species or defined groups of microbes to determine direct effects of microbial presence on the immune system.
