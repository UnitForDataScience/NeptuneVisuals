However unrestrained inflammation directed to self-nuclear con- tents can result in immunopathology and subsequent sequelae associated with autoimmune and autoinflam- matory diseases.In addition to the ability of self-DNA or histones to induce inflammation the microbiota also play an important role in the development of so-called 'sterile inflammation'.

Overall blocking inflammasome activation or IL-1b holds promise as a therapeutic treatment during sterile inflammation but it will also be of interest to know whether inhibition of the interaction of AIM2 with self-DNA is possible as a therapeutic intervention.Is sterile inflammation truly sterileAlthough autoimmune diseases and trauma are often viewed as sterile events recent studies demonstrate that most 'sterile inflammation' partially depends on the presence of commensal microbes triggering innate immune receptors and 'training' the immune system to respond in a biased manner during sterile inflamma- tion.

These studies demonstrate that inflammasome activation in response to mtDNA contributes to sterile lung inflammation 59.During atherosclerosis development mitochondrial damage triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation 60.Cells that are depleted of mtDNA rho0 cells have reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation despite hav- ing similar levels of cholesterol accumulation suggest- ing that mitochondrial damage is a key trigger of inflammation in atherosclerosis 61.

Therefore examining the role of different antibodies immune complex structures and immune signaling capacities of these complexes will be essential for understanding sterile inflammation and how to treat it.Inhibiting inflammasomes as a therapeutic interventionBased on the important role of DNA-sensing inflam- masomes in sterile inflammation numerous reports have examined the therapeutic potential of targeting inflammasomes in diseases involving sterile inflamma- tion.

Thus as research in the field of sterile inflammation and autoimmunity move forward we must consider the non- sterile nature of the organisms and environment in which they exist and how this affects the development and progression of sterile inflammation.

Interestingly microbiota and infection play critical roles in the development of 'sterile inflammation'.

Herein we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the role for inflammasomes in nucleic acid- nucleosome- and histone- driven sterile inflammation and discuss knowledge gaps and areas of poten- tial future research.IntroductionInflammation and immunity are essential to fight infec- tious diseases and sensing pathogen-derived nucleic acids is a major mechanism of innate immune cell acti- vation.

Inflammasome activa- tion also results in an inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis via the caspase-1- or caspase-11- mediated proteolytic activation of gasdermin D where activated gasdermin D forms pores in the cell mem- brane 8-12.Although nucleic acids of pathogens are frequently exposed to endosomal or cytoplasmic sensors host cell nucleic acids are generally contained in the nucleus or modified 5' 7-methylguanosine cap of mRNA 5' monophosphate of tRNA to differentiate them from pathogen-associated nucleic acids thus preventing unwanted inflammation 1314.

However defects in apoptosis or in the removal and degradation of extracellular DNA or apoptotic bodies as observed in serum amy- loid P noncanonical autophagy DNase I or DNase II deficiency can lead to the persistence of free nucleo- somes histones or DNA molecules resulting in inflammation 16-19.
