However unrestrained inflammation directed to self-nuclear con- tents can result in immunopathology and subsequent sequelae associated with autoimmune and autoinflam- matory diseases.In addition to the ability of self-DNA or histones to induce inflammation the microbiota also play an important role in the development of so-called 'sterile inflammation'.

Overall blocking inflammasome activation or IL-1b holds promise as a therapeutic treatment during sterile inflammation but it will also be of interest to know whether inhibition of the interaction of AIM2 with self-DNA is possible as a therapeutic intervention.Is sterile inflammation truly sterileAlthough autoimmune diseases and trauma are often viewed as sterile events recent studies demonstrate that most 'sterile inflammation' partially depends on the presence of commensal microbes triggering innate immune receptors and 'training' the immune system to respond in a biased manner during sterile inflamma- tion.
