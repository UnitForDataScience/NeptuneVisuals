The petri dishes were incubated overnight at 30degC and the colonies of V. madracius were counted when present.To evaluate the transcriptomic profile of L. dendroidea in the presence and absence of V. madracius control tubes were set up with 250 mg of L. dendroidea and 40 ml of ESW n  3 the inoculated tubes contained 250 mg of L. dendroidea 40 ml of ESW and V. madracius at 107 CFU ml-1 n  3.

The analysis was based on the following numbers of replicates control 24 h  2 inoculated 24 h  3 control 48 h  2 inoculated 48 h  2 control 72 h  3 inoculated 72 h  3.FIG 3 Relevant differentially expressed genes in Laurencia dendroidea 24 48 and 72 h after inoculation with Vibrio madracius data represent logFC values considering inoculated versus control samples.

Moreover the upregulation of genes involved in mono- terpene biosynthesis was detected in L. dendroidea in response to V. madracius and offers a possible explanation for the reduction in the concentration of these bacteria in the culture medium in the presence of the seaweed.Genes relevant for vesicle trafficking--including those coding for Rab which par- ticipates in intracellular membrane trafficking by regulating the movement of vesicles along cytoskeletal filaments  actin which composes the structure of the connec- tions linking the CC to the cell periphery in L. dendroidea and tubulin which is responsible for the positioning of the vesicles toward exocytosis sites--were upregu- lated in this seaweed in response to the inoculation of V. madracius mainly 24 hpi .

The seaweed RNA was sequenced providing an unprecedentedly high coverage of the transcrip- tome of Laurencia and the gene expression levels were compared between control and inoculated samples after 24 48 and 72 h. Transcriptomic changes in L. den- droidea in the presence of V. madracius include the upregulation of genes that par- ticipate in signaling pathways described here for the first time as a response of sea- weeds to microbes.

The expression level of several genes in- volved in the biosynthesis of terpenes in L. dendroidea increased significantly 24 and 48 h after V. madracius inoculation.

The response of L. dendroidea to V. madracius involves transcriptomic reprogramming especially 24 and 48 h after bacterial inoculation.

dendroidea in response to V. madracius such as the genes coding for acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase ACAT 24 and 48 h after inoculation and genes homologous to those coding for plant --isopiperitenol dehydrogenase ISPD 24 hpi and - neomenthol dehydrogenase NMD 24 and 48 hpi .

The MAPK cascade transduces extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses during plant defense against pathogens and can induce the expression of defense-related genes through the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as ERF .Further we observed the upregulation of L. dendroidea genes coding for small GTPases such as Rac a member of the Rho family considered to be a key regulator in plant immunity 24 hpi .

The culture medium was plated in TCBS media n  3 immediately after bacterial inoculation and 24 48 72 96 and 144 h after bacterial inoculation in the presence and absence of L. dendroidea.

Here we detected in both control and inoculated samples the expression of genes coding for LRR-RLKs representing a major class of receptors involved in microbe detection in plants through the recognition of MAMPs  suggesting that these genes are constitutively expressed in the red seaweed L. dendroidea.Moreover at 24 hpi we verified the upregulation of the gene coding for NADPH oxidase the major gene for ROS production in seaweeds in L. dendroidea   .
