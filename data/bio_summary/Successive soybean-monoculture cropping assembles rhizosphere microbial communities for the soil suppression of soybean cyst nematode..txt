reported that the turnaround period is 8 years for SCN suppressive soils the egg densities of SCN in soils with 6 years of monoculture history WD-6yr were not significantly different from those of LTM soils BC-38yr and FL- 30yr thus we proposed 6 to 8 years for the turnaround period.

Compared with STM samples the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria in all samples significantly varied while Gammaproteobacteria showed an increase in relative abundance in LTM soils Fig.

However the differences in func- tional fungal taxa that respond to suppressiveness across var- ious locations suggested that geography also plays a key role such as the preference of Purpureocillium in southern LTM soils and Pochonia in northern LTM soils.

The genus Purpureocillium was highly abun- dant in LTM samples except for WD where the Purpureocil- lium was not detected in STM and LTM soil samples.

At the genus level the genera Pseudomonas Purpureocillium and Pochonia which have been documented to suppress SCN in earlier studies were much more abundant in LTM soils than in STM soils.

Overall in five out of the seven locations LTM soils had a significantly lower num- ber of SCN eggs compared with STM soils.

Specifically the abun- dance of the genus Pseudomonas was significantly higher in rhi- zosphere of soybean seedlings in LTM soils than that in STM soils and CK Fig.

Generally the fungal taxa were fewer in the rhizosphere of plants in LTM soils compared with STM soils.

In particular the class Gammaproteobacteria in this phy- lum has shown an increased abundance in LTM soils compared with STM soils.

To this end we conducted growth room pot experiments with naturally infested SCN soils collected from experimental soybean-monoculture fields located in northeast- ern China to assess the impact of short-term monoculture STM and long-term monoculture LTM cropping on the composition of rhizospheric bacterial and fungal communities and SCN sup- pression.MATERIALS AND METHODSSoil sample collection and physiochemical analysesSoil samples were collected from short-term 5 years or less and long-term 6 years or more soybean-monoculture fields located in Anda AD Baicheng BC Fulaerji FL Heihe HH Hailun HL Sunwu SW and Wudalianchi WD counties northeast- ern China.
