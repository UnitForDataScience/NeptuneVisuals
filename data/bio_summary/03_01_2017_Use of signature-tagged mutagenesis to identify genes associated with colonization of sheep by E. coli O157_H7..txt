A spontaneous nalidixic acid mutant of E. coli O157H7 strain 86-24 NalRD1TD4IF and E. coli K-12 strains E. coli CC118lpir and BW19795lpir were grown overnightat 37 8C in Luria Broth LB or on MacConkey agar.

Veterinary Microbiology 201 2017 177-182Table 1Genes identified by STM as being required for persistent colonization of sheep by E. coli O157H7.Table 2Specific growth rates of mutants grown alone and in a one-to-one ratio with the parent strain.a The specific growth rate was calculated using the formula k t2 - t12.303.b t-test was done to compare the specific growth rate of the mutant alone and when grown competitively with the parent strain.c t-test was done to compare the specific growth rate of the mutant with that of the parent strain.contained a random transposon insertion from the original conjugation experiment.

The recto-anal junction is an important site of colonization for E. coli O157H7 in cattle but there is less evidence in sheep that this site is more readily colonized than the remainder of the large intestine Cornick personal observation.

Veterinary Microbiology 201 2017 177-182concentration may not be sensitive enough to detect extremely low-level populations of E. coli O157H7 that could continue to serve as a seed for clonal expansion.Only a few genes have been shown to be critical for the colonization of ruminants by E. coli O157H7 the prototype STEC.

The roles of all of these gene products require further study to determine how the persistence phenotype of a given strain of E. coli O157H7 interacts with host factors.c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.IntroductionShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli STEC are an important cause of food-borne illness worldwide and ruminants are considered the major reservoir of these organisms.

The DwbdP mutant was recovered from the feces of 66 sheep at 2 days pi and from 46 sheep at 6 days pi .

Using a sheep model of persistence signature tagged mutagenesis STM was used to screen 1326 mutants for a persistence-negative phenotype of E. coli O157H7.

Fecal shedding of the DwbdP mutant and wild type E. coli O157H7 recovered from sheep.

It is well known that cattle and presumably sheep make antibodiesrough mutants of a probiotic E. coli Nissle strain and those from an O18K1H79 strain associated with neonatal meningitis were severely impaired with regards to in vivo colonization of mice .
