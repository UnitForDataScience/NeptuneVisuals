the net result of these multiple factors is a compromised mi- crobiome that is skewed to contain increasing amounts of pathologic bacteria such as clostridium and salmonella and reduced amounts of beneficial bacteria such as bifi- dobacterium and lactobacillus.2324chinese medicinea review of the above disorders in relation to the rubric of cm reveals a pattern of disharmonies that could well be related to dampness and phlegm through liver qi stagna- tion and spleen and kidney qi deficiency table 1. theinferred cm syndromes are not written in stone but rather they are best-guess possibilities based on symptoms.spleen and stomach qiin cm the digestive process is related to spleen and stomach qi.

given that spleen qi is ultimately rooted in the kidneys and the mingmen if fire of the mingmen is deficient then the spleen qi will be deficient too.kidney yin moistens and nourishes the organstissues while kidney yang warms and promotes the proper func- tioning of those same organstissues.

some of these conditions might have their roots in gut disturbances which in chinese medicine would be categorized as spleen and stomach qi disharmonies.

five cases are described briefly to illustrate the use of acupuncture.keywords microbiome leaky gut spleen qi damp phlegmintroductionhere has been a steady increase in the prevalence of a number of diseases in the past 60 years.

from a chinese medicine cm viewpoint these diseases reflect a disturbance of spleen qi in its transporting and transforming functions with subse- quent accumulation of damp and phlegm.biomedical conceptsthe leaky gutin a previous article the current author discussed the leaky gut syndrome as being a concept that could bridge thephilosophical gap between cm and modern biologic theory.3 to summarize some researchers claim that increased intes- tinal permeability is a factor in dozens of diseases.4 according to the theory gut absorption can become compromised by a variety of triggers leading to the absorption of incompletely digested proteins.

the stomach receives and ripens food sending the ''pure'' part to the spleen for processing and the ''im- pure'' part to the small intestine for sorting.

in the mean- time the spleen transforms and transports the food.

food is transformed into nutritive essence and then transported to the heart and lungs to be converted into qi and blood.an individual with a deficiency of spleen qi may have typical symptoms of indigestion such as gas bloating and general fatigue.

perhaps what the ancient chinese doctors were describing with the term spleen qi is predominantly the collective action of the gut flora.

what the ancient doctors lacked in microbiology they made up for with keen observation and an awareness of functional problems when the body's structures seemed to be otherwise healthy.dampalthough the phenomenon of damp can arise because of external weather exposure it arises more commonly today because of a weakness of spleen qi.

although the origin of phlegm can be external arising for example with a cough or cold it is the more-hidden internal type that is involved in complex disorders.internal phlegm is the consequence of a disruption of the body's fluid metabolism which in turn is related to spleen qi.

the balance of yin and yang in the kidneys produces kidney qi and the fire of the mingmen which in turn supports a vigorous spleen function.liver qi stagnationanother key factor involved in phlegm production is liver qi stagnation.
