MEDICAL ACUPUNCTUREVolume 29 Number 3 2017 Mary Ann Liebert Inc. DOI 10.1089acu.2017.1226PERSPECTIVEDysbiosis Spleen Qi Phlegm and Complex DifficultiesMichael T. Greenwood MB BChir FCFP CAFCI FAAMAABSTRACTThe incidence of complex chronic health conditions is rising.

Some of these conditions might have their roots in gut disturbances which in Chinese Medicine would be categorized as Spleen and Stomach Qi Disharmonies.

Five cases are described briefly to illustrate the use of acupuncture.Keywords Microbiome Leaky Gut Spleen Qi Damp PhlegmINTRODUCTIONhere has been a steady increase in the prevalence of a number of diseases in the past 60 years.

From a Chinese Medicine CM viewpoint these diseases reflect a disturbance of Spleen Qi in its transporting and transforming functions with subse- quent accumulation of Damp and Phlegm.BIOMEDICAL CONCEPTSThe Leaky GutIn a previous article the current author discussed the leaky gut syndrome as being a concept that could bridge thephilosophical gap between CM and modern biologic theory.3 To summarize some researchers claim that increased intes- tinal permeability is a factor in dozens of diseases.4 According to the theory gut absorption can become compromised by a variety of triggers leading to the absorption of incompletely digested proteins.

The net result of these multiple factors is a compromised mi- crobiome that is skewed to contain increasing amounts of pathologic bacteria such as Clostridium and Salmonella and reduced amounts of beneficial bacteria such as Bifi- dobacterium and Lactobacillus.2324CHINESE MEDICINEA review of the above disorders in relation to the rubric of CM reveals a pattern of Disharmonies that could well be related to Dampness and Phlegm through Liver Qi Stagna- tion and Spleen and Kidney Qi Deficiency Table 1.

Theinferred CM syndromes are not written in stone but rather they are best-guess possibilities based on symptoms.Spleen and Stomach QiIn CM the digestive process is related to Spleen and Stomach Qi.

The Stomach receives and ripens food sending the ''pure'' part to the Spleen for processing and the ''im- pure'' part to the Small Intestine for sorting.

In the mean- time the Spleen transforms and transports the food.
