p  0.05 p  0.01 between two groups.analysis shows that mice immunized with tspmy in dnaprotein heterologous prime-boost regimen produced significant higher larvae reduction than mice in groups of dna prime-boost p  0.05 and protein prime-boost p  0.05 mice immunized with tspmy in dna prime-boost regimen produced higher larvae reduction than mice in protein prime-boost p  0.05. these adult and muscle larvae reduction results indicate that tspmy immunization in dnaprotein heterologous prime-boost regimen induced significantly higher protective immunity than the dna or protein homologous prime-boost regimens againstt.

the similar pattern of cytokine profile was observed in the local mln cell responses to the re- stimulation of rtspmy with high th1 cytokine responses ifn-g and il-2 in mice immunized with dna prime-boost high th2 cytokine il-4 il-5 il-6 and il-10 responses in mice immunized with protein prime-boost and with highest th1th2 cytokine responses for mice immunized with dna protein prime-boost .

the heterologous prime-boost regimen may contribute to the better protection against trichinella infection than dna or protein homologous prime-boost regimens especially with significant better protection against the formation of muscle larvae.conclusionwe demonstrate here that a heterologous immunization regimen with tspmy dna-prime orally delivered by attenuatedtyphimurium and protein-boost effectively induced mucosal siga response and an enhanced and balanced th1th2 systemic immune responses that resulted in improved protection againstspiralis infection with 55.4 muscle larvae reduction which is significant higher than that induced by the homologous dna or protein prime-boost regimen.

the muscle larvae reduction induced by heterologous prime- boost regimen was significant higher than that induced by the homologous dna or protein prime-boost regimens which could act as a practical prophylactic approach to prevent t. spiralis infection.keywords trichinella spiralis vaccine prime-boost mucosal immunity salmonella typhimuriumintroductiontrichinellosis remains endemic in 66 countries with estimated 11 million people infected with trichinella spiralis around the world  .

the anti-tspmy igg level in mice of dna protein prime-boost group was significantly increased after first boost with rtspmy and reached to even higher titer than mice in protein prime-boost group after three immunizations.

similarly after three immunizations mice immunized with dna protein produced highest anti- tspmy igg1 and igg2a compared to dna or proteinhomologous prime-boost groups and the igg1 and igg2a level was proximately equal indicating balanced th1th2 immune responses were induced in heterologous prime-boost immunization.

the worm burden results reveal that mice immunized with dna protein prime-boost dna alone and protein alone prime-boost produced 41.8 44.8 and 10.1 respectively adult worm reduction compared with mice received pbs control .

mice immunized with dna protein and dna alone prime-boost induced significant higher adult worm reduction than mice immunized with protein alone prime-boost.

to improve its immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy we conducted a heterologous prime-boost strategy by orally delivering one dose of tspmy dna carried by attenuated salmonella typhimurium sl7207 followed by two doses of recombinant tspmy intramuscularly.

mice orally inoculated with tspmysalmonella dna vaccine displayed strong intestinal mucosal and systemic immune responses which resulted in 44.8 reduction in adult worm and 46.6 reduction in muscle larvae against t. spiralis larval challenge  .heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen primed by dna vaccine and boosted by recombinant protein has be proven to induce stronger cellular and humoral immunity      and the better protection against some infectious diseases such as leishmania infantum   toxoplasma gondii   plasmodium yoelii   and schistosoma japonicum  .

the other three control groups were given with either the same number bacteria with empty vector of sl7207pvax1 orally vector or pbs alone emulsified with isa 50v intramuscularly for three times or first oral vector followed with two pbs intramuscularly to mimic heterologous prime-boost regimen vector pbs as shown in .before immunization and 1 week after each immunizationfive mice from each group were sacrificed the lavage fluid of intestines serum mesenteric lymph nodes mlns and spleen were collected from each mouse to examine the levels of mucosal humoral and cellular immune responses as previously described  .

specifically mice immunized with protein prime-boost protein produced significant high titers of anti-tspmy igg after the first immunization and remained the plateau after two boosts.

mice immunized with protein prime-boost produced higher igg1 than igg2a indicating predominant th2 responses.

these results suggest that mice immunized with tspmy using heterologous prime-boost immunization regimen induced highest th1 and th2 cytokine responses in both systemiclymphocytes spleen and local lymphocytes around the intestine mlns.protective immunitytwo weeks after final immunization with tspmy in different regimens six groups of mice were challenged orally with 500 ml per mouse.
