B Molar pro- portions  of the three major fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate and minor fatty acids i-valerate i-butyrate i-caproate valerate capro- ate and heptanoic acid for 48 h of fermentation with substrates cow sheep goat and mixture whey milk in NW n  3 and OB n  3 groups.Acetate and propionate showed a tendency to increase with fermentation time mainly acetate in the case of the OB group.

In OB donors we found significant increases with respect to the initial time of fermentation in cases of cow and mixed whey 12 24 and 48 h with differences comparedto controls at 24 and 48 h. Differences between both types ofdonors were not found.The Bacteroides group in NW showed a significant decrease throughout the fermentation cow sheep and goat.

The Firmicutes group data did not show significant increases throughout fermentation remaining stable in both OB and NW donors although the initial value was significantly higher in OB.

The prebiotic potential of these substrates was evalu- ated through in vitro gastrointestinal digestion following faecal batch culture fermentations mimicking colonic fermentation for 48 hours using faeces from normal-weight NW and obese OB donors.

Whey milk had a strong prebiotic effecton the gut microbiota of NW and OB donors showing a significant increase of Bifidobacterium  p  0.05 with cow sheep and mixed whey and increase in the Lactobacillus group particularly in OB donors.

It has also been con- sidered the forgotten organ because it affects the absorption and fermentation of nutrients having a direct association with health and metabolism.5 It has been reported a specific profile of bacteria in OB and normal-weight NW subjects.

OB micro- biota is associated with a low diversity of bacteria population with an increase of Firmicutes and a decrease in Bacteroidetes in OB animals and humans.6-9 Nevertheless NW is associated with an increase in Bifidobacterium animalis Methanobrevibacter smithii and phylum Bacteroidetes.10 An important mechanismthat could explain the relationship between the gut microbiota and body mass is that bacteria could improve the host's ability to extract energy from the diet and store it in the adipose tissue.7-9 Treatments to manipulate the gut microbiota could be an interesting approach to prevent and treat overweight and obesity.
