To establish differ- ences between the substrates and times of fermentation  pH gas and SCFA production and bacterial populations one-way analysis of variance ANOVA and a subsequent post-hoc Tukey test were carried out  p  0.05.ResultsThe aim of this study was to evaluate pH gas production SCFA and microbiota composition in whey samples after in vitro digestion followed by batch culture fermentation of theNormal-weight0 h6.44d - 0.02 6.44d - 0.02 6.44d - 0.02 6.44c - 0.0212 h 4.90c - 0.03 4.93c - 0.04 5.06c - 0.05 5.16b - 0.0224 h 4.29b - 0.03 4.41b - 0.08 4.54b - 0.02 4.35a - 0.0448 h 3.88a - 0.07 3.95a - 0.05 3.99a - 0.03 4.07a - 0.03Obese0 h 6.77d - 0.04 6.77d - 0.04 6.77d - 0.04 6.77d - 0.0412 h 4.88c - 0.02 4.94c - 0.04 5.07c - 0.01 5.02c - 0.0324 h 4.40b - 0.04 4.99b - 0.02 4.65b - 0.01 4.35b - 0.0448 h 3.92a - 0.02 3.98a - 0.02 4.04a - 0.01 3.97a - 0.01Results are expressed as mean - S.D.

Results were evalu- ated by comparing both groups.pH values and gas production during fermentationpH values are shown in Table 3. pH values decreased signifi- cantly  p  0.05 along fermentation with respect to time 0 in all fermentation times and samples of whey.

B Molar pro- portions  of the three major fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate and minor fatty acids i-valerate i-butyrate i-caproate valerate capro- ate and heptanoic acid for 48 h of fermentation with substrates cow sheep goat and mixture whey milk in NW n  3 and OB n  3 groups.Acetate and propionate showed a tendency to increase with fermentation time mainly acetate in the case of the OB group.

In OB donors we found significant increases with respect to the initial time of fermentation in cases of cow and mixed whey 12 24 and 48 h with differences comparedto controls at 24 and 48 h. Differences between both types ofdonors were not found.The Bacteroides group in NW showed a significant decrease throughout the fermentation cow sheep and goat.

These data were similar to those found in our research as values of acetate and butyrate are directly and inversely related to time and to the fermentation time respectively.The most important metabolites produced by bacteria during fermentation are directly or indirectly organic acids such as acetate  produced by Bacteroides Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus Enterobacteria etc.

The prebiotic potential of these substrates was evalu- ated through in vitro gastrointestinal digestion following faecal batch culture fermentations mimicking colonic fermentation for 48 hours using faeces from normal-weight NW and obese OB donors.

Throughout the fermentation process pH gas production short chain and branched fatty acids SCFA-BCFA were measured as well as the changes of microbiota using qPCR.

The pH decreased in all whey samples during the fermentation process.

It has also been con- sidered the forgotten organ because it affects the absorption and fermentation of nutrients having a direct association with health and metabolism.5 It has been reported a specific profile of bacteria in OB and normal-weight NW subjects.

At the end samples were stored on ice to stop enzymatic activity before batch culture fermentation.
