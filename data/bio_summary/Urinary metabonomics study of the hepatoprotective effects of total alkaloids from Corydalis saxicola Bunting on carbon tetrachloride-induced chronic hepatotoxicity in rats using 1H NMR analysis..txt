nmr has proven to be an efficient and non-destructive technology that can supply an endogenous metabolic profile by simultaneously detecting hundreds of low-mw species within a biological matrix recently nmr-based metabonomics combined with pattern recognition approaches such as principal components analysis pca and partial least squares discriminant analysis pls-da have provided a rapid non-destructive and high-throughput approach to study the pathological mechanisms of chronic liver injury and the hepatoprotective effects of herbal medicine urine has long been a favored biofluid among metabonomics researchers as it is sterile easy-to-obtain in large volumes largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex in our previous study based on nmr and serum metabo-nomicsthe mechanisms of liver protection of cs were partially elucidated in an acute liver injury rat model which demonstrated that cs could synergistically regulate abnormalities of several metabolic pathways including alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism therefore in this study a urinary metabonomics strategy based on 1h nmr was used to further study the hepatoprotective effects of tacs the main active components of cs on chronic liver injury which occurs dur- ing the early stages of liver fibrosis.

the new clues and evidence for the mechanisms of the hepatoprotective effect of tacs may not only facilitate further understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of tacs in hepatic injury treatment but may also lead to the discov- ery of other active constituents for treating ccl4-induced chronic hepatic injury in cs.conclusionsin this study a urinary metabonomics approach utilizing 1h nmr was established and used for the first time to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of total alkaloids from corydalis saxicola bunting tacs on a ccl4-induced chronic liver injury rat model.

however the hepatic sections showed that the hepatic lobule in the tacs-treated group was comparable to that in the control group with a slight degree of fatty steatosis necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration which implied that tacs treatment could protect the liver from ccl4- induced chronic liver injury c. furthermore the bp-treated group also displayed similar protective effects d.data acquisition and metabolic profilingurine samples which represent the physiological status patho- logical conditions and protective effects from the control model and treated groups were investigated by 1h nmr analysis.

the rats were randomly divided into 4 groups 6 rats in each group control group model group tacs group and bp group.

creatine is synthesized primarily in the liver from the methylation of glyco- cyamine by s-adenosyl methionine it is then transported through the blood to the other organs including muscles and the brain where phosphorylation occured it becomes a high-energy compound literatures have been reported that both renal and liver injury could lead to the alteration of creatinine but the mechanism of ccl4-induced chronic liver injury associated with kidney injury needs further study.

in the present study a significant increase in serum alt ast and alp levels and a reduction in alb were observed in the experimental group in comparison with the control group which proves that liver injury occurred after 8 weeks' of ccl4 injury and correlates with the histopathology observations.

s7 which indicated that they possess high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of chronic liver injury.metabolic pathways analysis in response to ccl4 injury and tacs treatmentas shown in three pathways including taurine and hypotaurine metabolism glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle with impact values0.1 were considered as the most relevant metabolic pathways to the ccl4-induced chronic liver injury.

as demonstrated in tacs treatment could significantly restore the deviations in the mda sod and gsh levels which indicated that tacs could alleviate liver injury caused due to lipid peroxida- tion and oxidative stress.table 1biochemical parameters of serum alt ast alp alb and liver mda sod gsh in the control model tacs and bp groups in the ccl4-induced chronic hepatotoxicity study.model56.83 - 5.49149.17 - 11.44169.17 - 26.6529.73 - 1.282.33 - 0.20162.02 - 21.252.81 - 0.37tacs44.17 - 2.14120.5 - 5.82133.67 - 18.3633.17 - 1.811.82 - 0.33219.55 - 41.377.12 - 1.23bp39.83 - 3.66115.33 - 16.57125.17 - 23.8331.32 - 3.281.58 - 0.19200.13 - 23.335.96 - 0.99compared with control group p  0.05 p  0.1 p  0.001. compared with model group p  0.05  p  0.01 p  0.001.fig.

in present study the levels of citrate and 2-oxoglutarate decreased significantly in the model group compared to those in the control group which suggested the normal function of the tca cycle was disrupted in rats with ccl4-induced chronic liver injury.

the metabolic profile of the ccl4-induced model group was clearly different from that of the control group as observed using patternrecognition with multivariate statistical analysis whereas the tacs group was more similar to the control group.

this study could bring valuable insight to evaluating the efficacy of tacs intervention ther- apy help deepen the understanding of the hepatoprotective mechanisms of tacs and enable optimal diagnosis of chronic liver injury.c 2017 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.introduction corresponding authors.e-mail addresses h. song z.-h. su.1 these authors contributed equally.the liver as the largest and most complex metabolic organ plays key roles in storage biosynthesis and metabolic homeostasis chronic liver injury can occur due to viral infections alcohol abuse drug exposure metabolic dysfunctions or autoimmune dis- orders which can result in chronic liver damage and subsequently leads to hepatic fibrosis through repeated cycles of damage and wound-healing.

as shown in the elevated levels of alt ast and alp due to ccl4 injury could be down-regulated and the decreased activities of alb were restored by tacs treatment which suggests that tacs exhibited potential hepatoprotective effects in chronic chemically induced hepatic injury.ccl4-induced oxidative stress plays an important role in liver injury and is related to the formation of free radicals and the occurrence of lipid peroxidation in cells and organelles treat- ments with ccl4 injection result in oxidative stress accompanied by the over-production of free radicals and peroxides in rat livers.

therefore the reduction of hippurate in urine indicates that thenormal balance of gut microflora corresponding to aromatic acid metabolism may be disrupted in the present study decreased hippurate level was found in the model group  which suggested that the gut microflora disorder may occur during the process of chronic liver injury induced by ccl4.
