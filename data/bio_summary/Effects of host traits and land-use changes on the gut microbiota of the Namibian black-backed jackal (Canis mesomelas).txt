In this study land-use type hardly affected gut microbiotas of black-backed jackals which is most likely attributable to their ability to cope with environmental changes and their omnivorous feeding behaviour.Comparison of gut microbial diversity of black-backed jackals with domestic dogs and other mammalsTo disentangle the effects of environment host species and di- etary preference we compared the gut microbiotas of black- backed jackals to other wild and domestic carnivores herbivores and an omnivore.

We present here the first study investigating simultaneously the impact of host traits and environmental factors on gut microbiotas of a wildlife carnivore that occurs in a human-modified habitat.Keywords gut microbiota 16S rRNA gene wildlife black-backed jackal Canis mesomelas livestock and game farming NamibiaReceived 8 February 2017 Accepted 22 September 2017QC FEMS 2017.

Moreover comparisons between gut microbiotas of wildlife species and their domestic counterparts are lacking these could add important information about the characteris- tic features of 'wild' gut microbiotas De Jesu' s-Laboy et al.

this has mainly been at- tributed to a modified diet and environmental behavioural and physiological changes all of which might also be true for wildlife species and their domestic counterparts.So far studies are still rare that investigate in free-ranging individuals the natural variation of gut microbiota attributable to host traits and the effect of environmental factors on the gut microbiota composition Yuan et al.

We have combined high-throughput sequencing of gut bacterial 16S rRNA genes with estimates of individual genetic relatedness by using microsatellite markers and have compared the gut microbiota of this wild canid with domestic dogs and other mammals.

Its adaptabil- ity to live in natural as well as disturbed habitats makes this species an interesting model for investigating the impact of host traits and anthropogenic environmental factors on gut microbial community composition and occurrence of potential bacterial pathogens in wildlife canids.Specifically we investigated i the impact of host traits and habitat on black-backed jackal gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity.

Every dissected black-backed jackal was sexed a picture of the teeth was taken for later age determination Bingham and Purchase  and body length in m measured from neck to tail root and weight in kg were taken to determine body mass index BMI kgm2.16S rRNA gene sequencing and initial processingTo study the effects of host traits and the habitat on the variation of the gut microbiota in free-ranging black-backed jackals we used sequence reads that we had previously generated for an- other study in which we focused on a comparison of gut micro- biotas of black-backed jackals and sympatric cheetahs.

Asper bacterial family we compared sequences of the three most abundant oligotypes with GenBank.Impact of host traits and habitat on the variation of gut microbiota diversity of black-backed jackalsWe investigated the effects of the host traits sex age and BMI on the natural alpha and beta diversity variation in gut microbial composition of Namibian black-backed jackals and the impact of the environmental factors sampling location and land-use type livestock farm vs game farm.We calculated alpha diversity by using phylogenetic diversity PD and applied a generalised linear mixed model GLMM func- tion 'glmer' in R package 'lme4' by means of a Poisson distri- bution correcting for overdispersion.

We assigned taxonomy to OTUs which were significantly different abundant between livestock and game farms by comparing them to GenBank excluding uncultured and environmental samples.Comparison of gut microbial diversity of black-backed jackals with domestic dogs and other mammalsTo disentangle the effects of environment host species and di- etary preference we compared the gut microbiotas of black- backed jackals to other wild and domestic carnivores herbivores and an omnivore.
