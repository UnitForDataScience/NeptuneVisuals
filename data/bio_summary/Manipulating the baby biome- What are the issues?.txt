Although causality has not been demonstrated due to the logistical and ethical dif- ficulties in conducting randomised controlled trials or prospec- tive cohort studies the studies which have been carried out have indicated an association between asthma type 1 diabetes and autoimmune conditions such as coeliac and inflammatory boweldisease in children born by caesarean section.11-16 Dysbiosis ofthe infant gut can therefore impact on development immunity and long-term physiological outcomes.7It is speculated that manipulation of the caesarean section baby biome through vaginal seeding may result in a biome that is more reflective of the 'natural state' and thereby influence dis- ease development.12717 However it must be noted that multiple factors not only mode of delivery and resultant biome formation can trigger the development of disease.14Vaginal seeding is not a technically difficult procedure.

Mothers planning an elective caesarean delivery may not be routinely screened for GBS.18 For women who are considering vaginal seeding one approach would be to screen for GBS and if positive to recommend against vaginal seeding due to the 1200 risk of neonatal GBS sepsis.18 Although unproven another option would be for the mother to be admitted to receive an appropriate course of antibiotics four hours prior to collection of the vaginal biome and before undergoing caesarean section to reduce the risk of GBS transmission.

Clinicians should also ask about seeding status when assessing an unwell baby born via caesarean section.At present there is no strong evidence explicitly demonstrating the benefit of vaginal seeding but there are theoretical benefits which are being actively evaluated.

We discuss the potential risks of this practice and offer a harm minimisation approach to managing women requesting vaginal microbiome transfer after delivery by caesarean section.KEYWORDS caesarean section microbiome obstetrics seeding vaginalThe practice of establishing a baby biome through 'vaginal seed- ing' has garnered both general media attention and the interest of obstetricians.

and mixed anaerobes.110 Those born by caesarean section are exposed to skin and environmental flora and as a result have less Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species and generally less biodiversity particularly in the first month.7 The gut flora then increases in diversity although there is significant inter-individual variability especially in the first few years of life.1511Alterations to early microbiota translate to changes that are seen up to 24 months after delivery with less diversity found in children born by caesarean section.11 As such it is speculated that the effect of caesarean delivery may be prolonged with disrup- tion of the typical progression of microbiota which may favourdisease development in later life.

A recent article in the BMJ discourages staff from performing vaginal seeding as the au- thors felt that the small risk of harm could not be justified with- out further evidence of benefit.4 However if these potential risks could be mitigated the case supporting vaginal seeding is buoyed.233When GBS screening is performed in Australia it is generally at 35-37 weeks gestation in women who plan to have a vaginal delivery.

To reduce the risk of neonatal transmission of gonorrhoea and chla- mydia through vaginal seeding screening should be considered.We agree with the BMJ authors that if a baby were born by cae- sarean section and had vaginal seeding performed this should be notified to their healthcare provider who accordingly would need to consider treatment options if the baby became unwell.

As vaginal seeding gains popularity it is imper- ative that healthcare providers are equipped with the knowledge to answer questions and appropriately assist women considering biome transfer following delivery by caesarean section.The human microbiota the microbial cells that colonise the human body vary between individuals anatomical location and age.
