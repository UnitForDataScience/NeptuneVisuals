Recent climate change studies often involving the use of large- volume mesocosm facilities have suggested that increased tem- perature can stimulate bacterial activity Hoppe et al.

As such activity of bacterial assemblages may be sup- pressed during marine MHWs which are likely to become more frequent in the future as a consequence of anthropogenic cli- mate change Lima and Wethey  Trenberth Fasullo and Shepherd .The physical drivers of MHWs are varied and complex Hobday et al.

Assum- ing a carbon content of 12 fg per bacterial cell Barbosa et al.

Despite evidence for very high bacterial diversity espe- cially when assemblages are sampled and sequenced in depth Gibbons et al.

Other studies that have considered the impact of temperature on bacterial produc- tion include Hoch and Kirchman  working on the Delaware estuary they found that at lower temperatures 12C bacterial growth correlated well with temperature but less so at higher temperature.This study has shown that the response of bacterial assem- blages to instantaneous temperature change varied throughout the year.
