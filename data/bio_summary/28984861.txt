Early experiments using gno- tobiotic animals says Eaton involved simple comparisons between germ-free and normally raised animals centered on nutrition and immune response--the vast majority of those studies were biphasic with 'yes' or 'no' answers she says.In the 1940s James Arthur Reyniers and Philip C. Trexler at the University of Notre Dame began to design housing chambers that facilitated larger-scale pro- duction of germ-free animals.

TECHNOLOGY FEATUREGnotobiotics getting a grip on the microbiome boomSmriti MallapatyThe growing interest in the microbiome has driven demand for germ-free and gnotobiotic animals but facilities are struggling to keep up.Balfour Sartor was aware of the dangers he posed to his colonies of rats and mice.

They were gnotobiotes--a term derived from the Greek word for 'known' and 'life'--born and bred in plastic bubbles isolated from a world drenched in bacteria fungi and viruses.Smriti Mallapaty is an editor and science writer in Sydney Australia Smriti.Mallapatygmail.com.Withdrawn from all known microbial life forms or containing only known strains these animals present researchers with a blank slate to study how exactly microbes work with and against the body.Caring for them is a hypochondriac's dream.

The words compulsive and rigid come up at every single step of the process says Sartor who manages a large facility as director of the National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center NGRRC in North Carolina which is funded by the United States National Institutes of Health NIH.Everything that enters the animals' cham- ber--food water bedding--has to be ster- ilized in an adjacent portal.

Question number one was can animals live without a microbio- ta explains Eaton.

But many of the animals died prematurely.Eventually Michel Cohendy a researcher working under Emile Roux at the Pasteur Institute in Paris succeeded in raising germ-free guinea pigs in sterilized glass chambers for a period of time long enough to observe noticeable changes in their com- posure.

Most of the technologies used to raise gnotobiotic animals have not changed since the 1940s says Sartor.

Gnotobiotic animals can cost ten to twenty times more to breed than a stan- dard animal model.

A large number of lab animal personnel can produce a relatively small number of animals says Sartor.

If you charged what the animals are really worth no NIH-funded investigator could ever pay for them out of their grant.But change is needed as growing inter- est in the role of microbes in health and disease has made gnotobiotic models more valuable to researchers.Between seeping supply and surging demand the field has reached a critical bottleneck.
