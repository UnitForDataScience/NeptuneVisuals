The healthy controls included six healthy individuals that were matched to the CDV-infected individuals in terms of sex and age T1.A total of 16 samples from 10 giant pandas were collected between December 2014 and March 2015.

Considering the potential relationship between viral infection and the gut microbiomeand the vital role that the immune system plays in regulating the gut microbiome understanding how the composition of the microbiota changes as a result of CDV infection and the implications of these changes on the prevalence of disease-causing pathogens is vitally important.To evaluate the role of CDV infection in shaping the gut microbiome to determine how CDV affects the con-tent and stability of the gut microbiome in pandas and to understand the role and influence of CDV dynamics in this outbreak we collected fecal samples from four individuals who were infected with CDV as well as from six healthy individuals and followed the gut bacterial community of two CDV-positive individuals GP-603 and GP-754.

Asterisks indicate significant differences P 0.01 and the error bars denote 95 confidence intervals for the mean values.composition was significantly more variable in the samples from the CDV-infected individuals than in the healthy control samples P  0.01 2A.Euclidean distance metrics Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics and weighted UniFrac distance metrics showedthat in terms of changes in frequency relative abundance and the presence or absence of bacterial phylotypes the communities of the CDV-infected individuals were less stable than those of the healthy controls P  0.01 2B.CDV-associated alterations in fecal microbiota.

This analysis showed that the virus infection samples and healthy samples con- tained 20 and 11 unique OTUs respectively 1D.To measure the degree to which the gut microbiota of the CDV-infected individuals differed from the micro- biota of the healthy controls a principal coordinate analysis PCoA was conducted based on the Euclidean distance between the fecal samples.

We sequenced the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes in sixteen fecal samples collected from CDV-infected individuals n  4 including ten CDV-positive fecal samples collected during different stages of the infection and six collected from healthy controls.

In the fecal samples collected from CDV-infected individuals spikes in the relative abundance of pathogen-containing gut communities were observed such spikes were absent from the healthy control samples.

B The taxa whose abundance differed between the CDV-infected samples red bars and the healthy control samples blue bars.

Additionally we observed 1.5-fold to 2-fold upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CDV-positive pandas compared to that in the healthy controls P  0.01 6.DiscussionIn this outbreak CDV produced an acute febrile and highly fatal disease in captive giant pandas in China.

Unfortunately due to the absence of healthy intestines we could not directly compare the local inflammatory cytokines in the intestines of the pandas.Notably the relative frequencies of some bacteria including the genera Prevotella Peptoniphilus Arcanobacterium and Corynebacterium present within two individuals GP-603 and GP-754 increased in abun- dance as the infection progressed and this increase was particularly evident in the final sample collected before the deaths of these individuals 4.
