A similar examination was performed for the expression levelin the intestines where the CYP3A expression level was the second highest following the liver .The mRNA expression level of CYP3A11 in the livers of the mice that were given a diet containing 1.5 EGCG for 2 days decreased significant- ly to approximately 40 of the expression level in the control group.

Note that be- cause CYP expression is maintained in HepaRG cells they are widely used for research concerning changes in CYP expression  .No difference was observed in the mRNA expression level of CYP3A11 in the liver between the EGCG group and the control group -A.

Therefore in this study we examined whether the expression and nuclear translocation of PXR were suppressed in the livers of mice that showed a decrease in the expression of CYP3A.Regarding the mRNA expression level of hepatic PXR no difference was observed between the mice that were given a diet containing 1.5 EGCG for 2 days and the mice in the control group.

Epigallocatechin gallate induces a hepatospecific decrease in the CYP3A expression level by altering intestinal floraNobutomo Ikarashi 1 Sosuke Ogawa 1 Ryuta Hirobe  Risako Kon  Yoshiki Kusunoki  Marin Yamashita Nanaho Mizukami  Miho Kaneko  Nobuyuki Wakui  Yoshiaki Machida  Kiyoshi Sugiyama a Department of Clinical Pharmacokinetics Hoshi University Japanb Division of Applied Pharmaceutical Education and Research Hoshi University Japana r t i c l ei n f o Article historyReceived 5 October 2016Received in revised form 10 January 2017Accepted 19 January 2017Available online 21 January 2017KeywordsCytochrome P450 Epigallocatechin gallate Green tea polyphenol Clostridium spp.Pregnane X receptora b s t r a c t In previous studies we showed that a high-dose intake of green tea polyphenol GP induced a hepatospecific decrease in the expression and activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A CYP3A.

The mRNA gene expression levels were normalized to glyceral- dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH gene expression levels.Table 1Preparation of Microsomal and Nuclear Fractions for ImmunoblottingMicrosomal fractions from the liver and small intestines were per- formed as described previously .

The DNA expression levels were normalized to 16S rRNA gene expression levels.Extraction of Bile Acids in the Feces and Analysis Using UPLCESI-MSExtraction of bile acids and analysis using UPLCESI-MS were per- formed as described previously .

Accordingly we examined whether this de- crease in the expression level of CYP3A11 would also be observed when EGCG was given.The expression level of the mRNA of CYP3A11 in the liver decreased in proportion to the EGCG dose.

The extent of this decrease was nearly identical to that observed after the diet containing 3 GP was given for 7 days .Based on these results the decrease in CYP3A expression level ob- served after administration of a diet containing 3 GP was shown to be attributable to EGCG.Relationship Between the Decrease in CYP3A Expression Level Caused by EGCG and the Period of Food IntakeIt was observed that the mRNA expression level of CYP3A11 in the liver decreased significantly when a powdered diet containing 1.5 EGCG was given to mice for 7 days.

In the group of mice that was given a diet containing 1.5 EGCG for 2 days the protein expression level of CYP3A in the liver was significantly decreased to ap- proximately 80 of the expression level in the control group.

In the group of mice that was given a diet containing 1.5 EGCG for 10 days the protein expression level of CYP3A was significantly decreased to ap- proximately 60 of that in the control group .Based on the above results when a powdered diet containing 1.5 EGCG was given to mice a hepatospecific decrease in CYP3A expression level was observed from the second day of treatment.Effect of EGCG on the Hepatic Expression of CYP3AThe next issue to be examined was whether the decrease in CYP3A in the liver observed after the oral administration of EGCG was a direct effect of EGCG or an indirect effect characteristic of oral administration.
