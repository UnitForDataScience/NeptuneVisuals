no molds were detected in any of the silages after 90 days of ensiling with yeast populations ranging between 5.84 and 6.75 log10 cfug dm in oat triticale and intercropped silages and were virtu- ally absent in barley silage.after aerobic exposure the ph of oat triticale and intercropped silages increased p  0.001 while the ph of barley silage remained largely unchanged table the aerobic stability of barley was  336 h with no measurable increase in temperature over 14 days of aerobic exposure fig.

only traces of butyric acid were found in oat and intercropped silages indicating that all silages were well conserved and that growth oftions were in accordance with the microbial counts observed as no molds were detected at opening yeasts were only cultured from oat triticale and intercropped silages and numbers of lab exceeded 7.83 log10 cfug dm in all small grain silages.core microbiome during ensiling of small grain cereal foragesthe number of different otus identified were higher for fungal than for the bacterial core microbiome a re- sult that can be explained by differences in the databases and analyzes used for taxonomic assignments.

dm loss was significantly higher for triticale than other silages p  0.05the nutrient composition and fermentation profile of all silages differed p  0.05 after 90 days of fermentation table .

the level of starch in barley was higher p  0.001 than other forages and silages but declined in all silages by about 2 mgg dm during ensiling.

oat and intercropped silage exhibited lower p  0.05 aerobic stability than triticale silage table with temperature increases in thesetable 1 physico-chemical characteristics and microbial populations of barley oat triticale and intercropped forages 90day silages and aerobically exposed silages n  3itemforagesemp-value silagesemp-value  aerobically exposed silagesemp-value within a row means with a different superscript bcde differ p  0.05a hours of aerobic exposure before a 2 degc rise in temperature was recorded in the silage mass after exposure to airabbreviations cp crude protein ndf neutral detergent fiber adf acid detergent fiber adin acid detergent insoluble nitrogen wsc water soluble carbohydrates nm not measured nd not determined na not availablesilages noticeable after 1 day of aerobic exposure fig.

molds were only detected in oat and intercropped silages after 14 days of aerobic exposure.sequencinga total of 8937418 and 3959537 reads were obtained for the bacterial and fungal microbiomes in silages respectively.

ten of the bacterial orders associated with core bacterial microbiome of fresh forage were no longer detected in terminal silage.decline in relative abundance of otus was the high- est for the actinomycetales as a decrease ranging from -11.2 to -32 was observed among silages with the sphingomonadales also showing a consistent de- cline in all silages fig.

shared otus among aerobically exposed oat triticale and intercropped silages were mainly members of the bacillales order 98.82 of the number of otus observed with only a single otu belonging to the streptococcaceae order being associated with these silages table among the bacillales the bacillaceae represented 70.6 of the shared otus whereas the planococcaceae accounted for 22.4. the otus found in aerobically exposed barley silage were mostly members of the lactobacillales 27.2.fungal core microbiome during forage ensilingthe diversity of fungi also tended to decline during the ensiling process fig.

the fungal core microbiome was not consist- ent among terminal silages as the relative abundance of saccharomycetales increased by 1.52 in barley silage as compared to an increase of 73.95 to 96.37 otus in other silages fig.

the greatest decline was observed in barley and oat silages but the sporidiobolales pleospor- ales puccinales tremellomycetes agaricales and cysto- filobasidiales also declined in all silages after aerobic exposure fig.

the relative abundance of otus belonging to saccharomycetales also increased by55.33 and 2.85 in barley and triticale silages respect- ively whereas these populations decreased in oat and intercropped silages -29.35 and -27.51. saccharo- mycetales still represented 70 of the fungal core genome after aerobic exposure primarily due to the high abundance of kazachstania 62 and pichia 8 additional file figure s5.

bacterial population sequencing in ryegrass whole crop corn and alfalfa silages also illustrated the intensive selection process that occurs during ensiling as bacterial diversity in initial forages dramatically declined with leuconostocaceae and lactobacillaceae representing about 70 to 95 of the bacterial population in terminal silages bao et al.

this suggests that some of the microorganisms associated with triticale silage were nonculturable using plating techniques within the laboratory an observation that may also account for the slightly higher numbers of lab as compared to total bacteria in this silage.the limitations of using culture-based approaches to document the impact of fungal populations in small grain silages is illustrated by our inability to culture molds and to only detect yeast in oat triti- cale and intercropped silages.

in contrast the temperature of oat triticale and intercropped silages increased and high ph values were reached in these silages after aerobic exposure.

contrary to the observa- tions in other silages diversity of lactobacillales and xanthomonadales increased in barley silage during aerobic exposure and far fewer otus were assigned to bacillales as compared to other silages.
