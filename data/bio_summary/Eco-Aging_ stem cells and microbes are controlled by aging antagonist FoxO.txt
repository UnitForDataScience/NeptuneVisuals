Inversely an overex- pression in the interstitial stem cell lineage caused not only an increase in cell proliferation but also expression of stem cell marker genes in terminally differentiated cells .

FoxO's capacity in other model organisms Drosoph- ila  C. elegans  to delay the onset of age-related processes and to extend life span underlines its conserved potential in stem cell control and tissue maintenance especially in the absence of classical stem cell factors like Oct-34 or SOX2 .

In the newly discovered world of metaorganisms stem cell proliferation and immunity are part of a global program here proposed as 'Eco- Aging' which seeks to fuse stem cell biology with eco- logical concepts and the rules governing the interactions between an organism and its microbial environment.Conflict of interestWe wish to confirm that there are no conflicts of interest associated with this publication.AcknowledgementsWe apologize to all colleagues whose work could not be cited due to space limitations.

Due to three everlasting stem cell lineages that give rise to about 20 cell types  the animals are able to continuouslyreproduceasexuallyviabudding a.

Available online at ScienceDirectEco-Aging stem cells and microbes are controlled by aging antagonist FoxOBenedikt M Mortzfeld and Thomas CG BoschThe review highlights the dual role that the conserved master regulator FoxO has in aging by coordinating both stem cell proliferation and antimicrobial peptides effector molecules of the innate immune system.

In young organisms aged and damaged components of a tissue can be replaced due to a high number of self-renewing stem cells whereas stem cell exhaustion and cellular senescence contribute to the onset of common age-associated diseases for example cardiovascular disease CVD Alzheimer's dis- ease or cancer in humans .

Recent research also underlines the importance of bacterial colonization on host behavior  as well as fundamental develop- mental processes involving cell proliferation and immune system maturation 44..Interestingly the human microbiome is not stable throughout life but experiences significant changes with age.

In the short-lived African turquoise killifish the microbial community of young donors is able to extend life span in older individuals by preventing the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging 58... Concordantly latest research in C. elegans describes the positive impact of certain bacterial genotypes on host life span and health as non-essential bacterial compounds for example colanic acid are able to regulate mitochondrial dynamics and unfolded protein response UPRmt 59...Non-senescent model organisms to study the interaction between FoxO and microbes While most aging research has been done in short-living models some animals show no aging phenotype and are considered as non-senescent.

Here certain bacterial taxa could predict the coral host response bleaching in a heat stress experiment 86.. Underlining the importance of the microbiome a study with germ-free animals showed that Hydra is protected from fungal infections by its bacterial colonizers.

As observed in non-senescent Hydra continuously high activity of the transcription factor FoxO contributes to continuous stem cell proliferation and could support robust colonization of epithelia with a stable microbiome.
