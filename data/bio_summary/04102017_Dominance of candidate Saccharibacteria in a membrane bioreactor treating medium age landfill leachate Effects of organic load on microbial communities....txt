This may be indicative of stable operating condi- tions during MBR operation with 75 vv since either limited available organic content at 50 vv or increased organic load at 100 vv leachate applied may increase the abundance of candi- date phylum Saccharibacteria at both concentration edges.

In addition a sharp increase in protein content was detected during concentration shift from 75 to 100 vv leachate which decreased after an adaptation period of 15 days to the levels determined at the previous operating condi- tions using 75 vv leachate.

This rela- tionship can be attributed to either enhanced proteolytic and b- glucosidic activity under low organic carbon availability experi- mental period with leachate concentration of 50 vv in order to sustain cell maintenance or to the higher organic load during MBR operation with 75 and 100 vv landfill leachate where there was no need to induce such enzymes.

Proteinous and carbohydrate extracellular polymeric substances EPS and soluble microbial product SMP were strongly correlated p  0.01 with organic load salinity and NH-N. Exceptionally high b-glucosidase activities 6700-10100 U g-1 were determined during MBR operation with 50 vv leachate as a result of the low organic carbon availability that extendedly induced b-glucosidases to breakdown the least biodegradable organic fraction.
