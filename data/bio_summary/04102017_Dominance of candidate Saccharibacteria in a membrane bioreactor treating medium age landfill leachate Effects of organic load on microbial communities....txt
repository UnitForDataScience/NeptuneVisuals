this is in accordance with the increase in ne-n concentration levels which remained unoxidized at the last month of system operation b. moreover reported that mlss increase from 4.5 to 11.5 g l-1 resulted in a decrease in nitrifying population by at least two orders of magnitude.eps and smp dynamics in the intermittently aerated and fed membrane bioreactor treating medium age landfill leachateproteinous eps and smp remained stable during mbr operation with 75 and 100 vv leachate although smaller values were2000160012008004000120010008006004002000tcodinscodincodefbodinfbodef50 vv landf ill leachate75 vv landf ill leachate100 vv landf ill leachatenh4-ninnh4-neftknintknefno3-neftn removal50 vv landf ill leachate75 vv landf ill leachate100 vv landf ill leachateab10090807060504030201000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250experimental period daysfig.

and members of the candidate divisions sha- 109 jg30-kf-cm45 and tk10 followed the same trend reaching the highest abundance during mbr operation with 75 vv lea- chate a. this may be indicative of stable operating condi- tions during mbr operation with 75 vv since either limited available organic content at 50 vv or increased organic load at 100 vv leachate applied may increase the abundance of candi- date phylum saccharibacteria at both concentration edges.

in addition a sharp increase in protein content was detected during concentration shift from 75 to 100 vv leachate which decreased after an adaptation period of 15 days to the levels determined at the previous operating condi- tions using 75 vv leachate.

this rela- tionship can be attributed to either enhanced proteolytic and b- glucosidic activity under low organic carbon availability experi- mental period with leachate concentration of 50 vv in order to sustain cell maintenance or to the higher organic load during mbr operation with 75 and 100 vv landfill leachate where there was no need to induce such enzymes.

proteinous and carbohydrate extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial product smp were strongly correlated p  0.01 with organic load salinity and nh-n. exceptionally high b-glucosidase activities 6700-10100 u g-1 were determined during mbr operation with 50 vv leachate as a result of the low organic carbon availability that extendedly induced b-glucosidases to breakdown the least biodegradable organic fraction.

thus the aim of this work was to study issues regarding the performance of an intermittently aerated and fed membrane bioreactor treating young to medium age leachate a by examining nutrients removal efficiencies under various landfill leachate concentrations 50 75 and 100 vv b by determining the fluctuations of smp and eps and their role on membrane fouling c by recording through- out the entire operating period the hydrolytic activities of acti- vated sludge microbiota and d by extensively characterizing both bacterial and fungal community structures through next gen- eration sequencing approaches.materials and methodsoperation and design of membrane bioreactor mbrfresh to medium age landfill leachate was treated in a mem- brane bioreactor operational volume 20 l supplementary fig.

leachate derived from anthemounta landfill site north-ern greece was fed to the mbr at three different concentrations 50 75 and 100 vv corresponding to organic loading rates of 0.192 - 0.017 0.211 - 0.017 and 0.297 - 0.04 g cod l-1 d-1.

in particular bod removal was equal to 90.2 - 2.1 and 93.0 - 1.6 at landfill leachate concentrations of 50 and 75 vv respectively a. moreover bod removal still remained stable even 80 days after the use of undiluted leachate although its efficiency was reduced by 15 at the last 25 days of mbr opera-tion a. cod removal efficacy was lower during both the star- tup period and the concentration shift from 50 to 75 while the respective cod removal values under stable operating conditions were 56.8 - 4.8 and 39.9 - 4.9 a. in contrast no negative effects on cod removal occurred when undiluted leachate was applied for a period of 80 days whereas bod and cod removal abil- ity of the mbr unit was reduced in a similar manner at the last 25 days of operation a.effluent ph 8.57 - 0.16 was higher than influent ph 8.21 - 0.22 throughout the three experimental periods supple- mentary fig.
