The loss of bacterial diversity often related with an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria is associated with increased severity in most chronic respiratory pathologies and it is very likely that this change in the composition of the microbiome is one of the factors that influences the course of the disease as has already been demonstrated in idiopathic pul- monary fibrosis.Recently introduced techniques such as analysis of bacterial RNA and metagenomics will help provide functional information about the respiratory microbiome clarify interactions between viruses fungi and bacteria and potentially facilitate the design of interventional studies aimed at conserving the mutual- ism of the microbial flora thus maintaining the functionality of the respiratory system against the respiratory pathogens that progres- sively substitute the microbiota in the case of COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.AcknowledgementsThis editorial was prepared in part with assistance from the Fondo de Investigacion Sanitaria PI1500167 SEPAR and the Fun- dacion BRN.References Bassis CM Erb-Downward JR Dickson RP Freeman CM Schmidt TM Young VB et al.

Culture-independent microbiological tech- niques have confirmed that the bronchopulmonary tree hosts a wide range of microorganisms known as the microbiome com- posed of bacteria viruses and fungi.

The microbiome composition is usually expressed in terms of relative abundance understood as the proportion of 16S rRNA gene copies that corre- spond to each OTU identified.

Recent same- day testing of samples taken using different oropharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage techniques aimed at preventing crossover contamination have confirmed the similarity of the oropharyngeal and the bronchopulmonary microbiome in healthy individuals a Please cite this article as Monso E.

Studies of the bronchopulmonary microbiome in patients with stable COPD have found clear differences compared to the typi- cal flora of a healthy individual.

The study of the microbiome in respiratory secretions duringexacerbations reveals an increase in the relative abundanceof specific genera while colonizing flora remain unchanged.In some of these episodes this increase in abundance of the causative bacteria is not identified on culture which only recovers microor- ganisms that have not changed in relative abundance compared to samples obtained during periods of stability even though these may be potentially pathogenic such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Thus examination of the respiratory microbiome confirms that in some exacerbations the increase in a bacterial pathogen is not detected by conventional microbiology due to its limited sensitiv- ity.

Viral infections help promote these changes in the bacterial composition of the respiratory microbiome during exacerbation since in the weeks immediately subsequent to a common cold the relative abundance of Proteobacteria increases.
