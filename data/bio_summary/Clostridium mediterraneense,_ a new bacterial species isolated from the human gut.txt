the study was approved by the institut federatif de recherche 48 agreement 09-022 marseille france and the patient's consent was obtained.the culture of strain marseille-p2434t was achieved by preincubation of the stool specimen in an anaerobic blood culture vial becton dickinson le pont-de-claix france at 37deg c supplemented of 5 sheep's blood and 5 ml filter-sterilized rumen for 5 days.

as part of the culturomics study  while the patient was asymptomatic we isolated from his stool sample a bacterial strain that could not be identified by our systematic matrix-assisted laser desorptionionization time-of- flight mass spectrometry maldi-tof ms screening on a microflex spectrometer bruker daltonics bremen germany .

thecolonies were circular beige and nonhaemolytic with a diam- eter of about 1.0 mm after 3 days of incubation on 5 sheep's blood agar.

a molecular identification was per- formed by sequencing the complete 16s rrna gene using a 3130-xl sequencer applied biosciences saint aubin france and the fd1-rp2 primers as previously described .
