The main characteristics of inulin are its prebiotic properties because it selectively stimulates beneficial bacteria partic- ularly bifidobacteria.Because of these properties inulin is thought to have a stabilizing effect on the normal gastro- intestinal function.We hypothesized that Orafti HSI inulin would improve functional digestive symptoms by influencing the key pathophysiological factors described above gut con- tent reflex dysfunction and hypersensitivity.

Orafti HSI inulin is a highly soluble inulin and is an ingredient in food derived from chicory.

Girth changes were measured at 15-minute intervals during the gas test while the subjects were breathing comfortably and the changes were refer- enced to the mid-point of respiratory displacements.Outcomes MeasuresThe primary outcome was the effect of inulin intake change from baseline with inulin vs. placebo on the tol- erance of the gas challenge test which was measured as the perception of digestive sensations during the gas challenge test.

Secondary outcomes included the effects of inulin intake on a intestinal gas retention volume infused minus evacuated which was measured as the average value over the last 60 minutes of the test b digestive well-being digestive symptoms and bowel habits which were measuredas the average values of the 6 daily evaluations and c colonic transit time.Sample Size CalculationAnticipating a positive response defined as Z30 improvement in perception during gas infusion in 10 of the placebo control and 57 of the inulin group a sample size of 14 subjects per group was estimated to detect dif- ferences between the groups with a power of 80 and a significance level of 5 2 sided.

In previous studies repeat experiments yielded reproducible results but the order effect of baseline and intervention test could explain the reduced perception with both inulin and placebo as compared with the initial baseline test.When measuring retention of the gas infused as a physiological marker of intestinal function inulin but not placebo exhibited a significant effect versus the baseline tests.

Subjects with abdominal symptoms and reduced tolerance of intestinal gas selected by a pretest received either inulin 8 gd n  18 or maltodextrin as a placebo 8 gd n  18 for 4 weeks.

Inulin led to a higher relative abundance of bifido- bacteria counts P  0.01 vs. placebo.Conclusions A daily dose of inulin that promotes bifidobacteria growth and may improve gut function is well tolerated by subjects with gastrointestinal complaints.Key Words intestinal motility intestinal sensitivity intestinal microbiota intestinal gas functional gut symptomsJ Clin Gastroenterol 201751619-625Received for publication March 11 2016 accepted August 16 2016.From the Digestive System Research Unit University Hospital Vall d'Hebron Barcelona wCentro de Investigacio'n Biome'dica en Red de Enfermedades Hepa'ticas y Digestivas Ciberehd Virtual Center for Biomedical Research Hepatic and Digestive Diseases Madrid Department de Medicina Universitat Auto noma de Barcelona Department of Medicine Autonomous University of Barcelona Bellaterra Cerdanyola del Valle s Spain and yBENEO-Institute Obrigheim Germany.Supported by a grant from Beneo-Institute Germany and by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness Direccio'n General de Investigacio'n Cienti'fica y Te'cnica SAF 2013-43677-R Ciberehd is funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III.M.S.

Inulin is a mixture of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides composed of fructose units connected by b 2-1 links.The total number of fructose and glucose units of chicory inulin ranges mainly between 2 and 70.
