Interestingly other groups have found HFD decreases bone mass and increases osteoclast numbers in C57BL6J mice but these studies used older mice shorter term diets or both - suggesting that HFD initi- ation age and duration affect osteoclast response likely from the high energy requirements of growing mice or increase in mouse weight and hence bone loading in longer term HFD feeding.There has been extensive research into the effects of obesity on bone health with most findings suggesting that obesity increases mechanical loading on bones resulting in increased bone volumes  Interestingly obesity has also been shown to correlate with increased risk of fracture and increased visceral adipose spe- cifically is inversely associated with bone mechanical properties in adult males Our data suggest that obesity in growing mice leads to cortical bone expansion and increased endocortical resorption resulting in a net increase in the long bones' moments of inertia and thus greater rigidity in response to increased body weight.

Statistical analysis performed with two-way ANOVA using n  9 for all groups.between all groups -We compared HFD vs chow 1 HFD  metformin vs chow  metformin 2 HFD  metformin vs HFD  and chow  metformin vs chow 4.

Interestingly 72 OTUs including taxa from Lactococcus Coprococcus Ruminococcus Staphylo- coccus Akkermansia Streptococcus Oscillospira Lac- tobacillus Allobaculum Clostridium and Dorea were found to be differentially abundant in HFD mice treated with metformin vs HFD mice alone 7E.

For the following 6 weeks mice were also treated with or without 300 mgkg metformin in drinking water as described previously Metformin HCl 1000 mg tablets Drug NDC 683820030 PHR1084-500MG Sigma-Aldrich were crushed and added to mouse drinking water 2 gL for an equivalent dose of 300 mgkg per day based on estimates that mice drink1.5 mL10 g body weight per day.Body compositionDual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for whole-body compo- sition exclusive of the head were performed on mice at 16 20 and 22 weeks at age using the PIXImus GE Lunar Fairfield CT as described previously The PIXImus was calibrated daily with a phantom provided by the manufacturer.Bone histomorphometryFemur and tibia were dissected from mice fixed in 10 formalin for 48 hours transferred to phosphate-buffered saline dehydrated embedded in methyl methacrylate sectioned into 4-mm slices and stained with von Kossa as described previously Consecutive sections were stained by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and toluidine blue to quantitate structure and cellular parameters by bone histomorphometry.

HFD also significantly increased total marrow adipose tissue volume 2I and even when normal- ized to marrow volume which was also increased by HFD 2J HFD increased MAT as seen in the rel- ative marrow adipose tissue volume 2K.

Overall the HFD femoral bone cortical phenotype was partially corrected through metformin treatment.Similar to tibia static histomorphometry osteoblast numbers were decreased in HFD vs chow and partially rescued with metformin in femora -Femoral osteoclast parameter changes were undetectable sug- gesting that the increased medullary area was mostly driven by a decrease in osteoblast number and activity induced by HFD rather than osteoclast activation 4D.

HFD also significantly increased VAT adipocyte cell size but metformin did not rescue this response and However there was less inflammatory cell infiltra- tion in HFD adipose depots when these mice were treated with metformin suggesting that metformin's anti-inflammatory properties specifically affected VAT FB.

Some findings show that hypercholesterolemic mice also present anTable 3.Serum Metabolites Significantly Different for HFD  Met vs HFD N  3osteoporotic phenotype and statins the first-line drug for hypercholesterolemia increase BMD and in some studies reduce fracture risk in humans Yet other studies found no long-term effects of cholesterol low- density lipoprotein or high-density lipoprotein levels on BMD after correcting for confounding variables What is becoming clear through numerous studies however is that the net negative effect of obesity on the skeleton appears to be driven by a myriad of inter- connected pathologies and local as well as systemic humoral and neuronal signaling factors such as leptinand chemerin This report demonstrates a reduction in MAT in DIO after treatment with metformin.

In sum metabolomic analysis revealed more examples of the drug-by-diet interaction effect in which metformin induces different effects on mice based on their diet and provided data of type andnumber of metabolite class molecules altered by HFD and metformin.Lipidomic profiles are affected by obesity and metforminMultivariate statistical analysis was used to identifythe alteration of global serum metabolites associated with obese mice as compared with healthy controls and dif- ferential responses to drug treatment.
