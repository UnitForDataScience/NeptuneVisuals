Variation among hosts or b-diversity was significantly greater in solitary hosts than mixed hosts with separated hosts overall more similar to soli- tary than mixed hosts Fig.

We hypothesized that dispersal among heterogeneous hosts would dilute the effects of local host factors and therefore the relationship would be strongest for solitary hosts and weakest for separated and mixed cohoused hosts.

Contrary to our initial predictions we observed a homogenization of host microbiomes regardless of whether dispersal was limited to within host geno- types separated or allowed to occur between host genotypes mixed.

Understanding how microbiomes contribute to host physiology and how to manipu- late this relationship to promote host health requires a compre- hensive understanding of the mechanistic drivers of microbiome variation across hosts.

Gordon Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis St. Louis MO and approved September 7 2017 received for review February 15 2017The diverse collections of microorganisms associated with humans and other animals collectively referred to as their microbiome are critical for host health but the mechanisms that govern their assembly are poorly understood.

We predicted that the effect of host factors such as innate immunity would depend on the degree of interhost dispersal due to the homogenizing ef- fects of exchanging microbial taxa among host types Table 1.

This reaffirmed our assumption that interhost dispersal primarily altered the degree of filtering of the microbiome by the local host environment rather than changing the host environment itself.

S5A especially when a trade-off was imposed between dispersal rates and host specificity such that species with high dispersal rates would be found in a wider range of host types thereby homogenizing com- munities Fig.

Variance partitioning on microbiome composition by host factors standard length and il-1b and c3 gene expression was done by canonical redundancy analysis to measure both the unique and shared contributions of each host factor 44.
