the higher cell abundance in the biofilms of the modern marine water was consist- ent with the greater doc in this water type table for comparison calculated planktonic cell concentra- tions for the modern marine borehole was 2.8 x 104 cells ml-1 the planktonic cell concentration was not measured for the old saline water but water from an adjacent borehole with similar chemical characteristics was estimated to hold approximately 100 cells ml-1 hence the biofilms were quantitatively signifi- cant components of these deep aquifer systems and should be considered if we are to understand the interplay between the biosphere and geosphere.even with the extremely oligotrophic conditions in the aspo hrl fracture waters earlier data from cell growthin response to addition of putative substrates such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide suggests that deep bio- sphere microorganisms are viable  in the present study direct measurements of atp showed that the investigated microbial communities were metabolic- ally active additional file table s4.

this search included genes involved in chemo- taxis presence of methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein mcp and all cheabwry genes which provides an advan- tage during biofilm formation genes for flagella presence of at least 20 of flglkdghibce flidcefgmn- hiopqr flhab and both motab genes for the flagellum motor which aid in bacterial attachment and genes to produce eps galu or both galue and export these polymers to the cell surface hlybd plus tolc for type i secretion or eps for sec-dependent secretion a trait thatprovides mechanical stability and facilitates adhesion to the surface table and additional file  table s7.

all of these energy conservation strategies are supported by carbon dioxide and hydrogen as carbon and energy sources  - recent metagenomic studies also point to extensive metabolic versatility with heterotrophic mixotrophic and autotrophic metabolic strategies however as a substantial fraction of the microbiome in the deep biosphere is likely to live in biofilms 5 the earl- ier work may provide an incomplete and possibly mislead- ing description of this biome.despite biofilms in rock fractures being present in the deep biosphere - the factors controlling biofilm formation are poorly understood especially in deep subsurface environments.

this is further corroborated by the cells attaching to and colonizing solid surfaces within a 33-day period without any experi- mental manipulation of resources and with respective numbers of cells per square centimeter in the modern marine garnet and glass biofilms being 164 and 7000 fold greater than the number of planktonic cells in a milliliter of water.microbial diversity from 16s rrna gene sequencing and metagenome binningthe rarefaction curves of 16s rrna amplicons sug- gested that the sequencing depth was sufficient to de- scribe the communities in all samples additional file figure s3.

the deep biome is the largest microbial ecosystem on earth and the deep continental biosphere is estimated to host 2 to 19 of earth's total biomass although a large proportion of the earth's microbial cells reside in the deep bio- sphere our knowledge of the biology and identity of these organisms is scarce one reason for this is the difficulty to obtain uncontaminated samples.

the rnf complex at least four of rnfabcdeg had higher frequencies in modern marine biofilms f  16.5 p  0.05 for the sum of the rnfabcdeg genes and combined with the widespread occurrence of these genes across both water types we propose that this respiration mechanism may constitute a generic adaptation to oligotrophy in the waters at the aspo hrl.

the second alternative was deemed unlikely as previous experience from aspo hrl and other underground research labora- tories suggests that microbial communities in deep groundwaters remain stable over longer periods  both the species richness chao1 and ace and diversity shannon-weaver and inverse simpson were lower in the modern marine biofilms compared to the free-living planktonic cells additional file table s5.

the mags contained 31 of the 36 concoct single-copy genes with an estimated bin completeness of 86 additional file table s3.estimation of biofilm and planktonic cell numbersbased upon normalized atp measurements for the dif- ferent conditions in the two contrasting groundwaters the modern marine water flow cells had consistently higher estimated cell abundances with 4.6 x 106 and2.0 x 108 cells cm2 on the garnet sample name defined as mmr and glass surfaces defined as mmg respectively.

potential for biofilm formationthe flow cells were run for a total of 33 days and generation times for attached microbial populations in the studied deep hard rock fractures have been extrapolated from cell counts to be between 16 and 90 days therefore the cells attached to the solid surfaces had likely not proliferated more than at most one generation and largely represent cells imported from the aqueous phase.

this type of groundwater within the aspo hrl has had overall stable chloride concentrations since the early 21st century  and therefore the geochemical measurements of this groundwater 2003-2008 can be considered representa- tive of the prevailing geochemistry in the borehole during the microbiological experiments.sampling and sequencing dataflow cells were directly connected to boreholes and the groundwater was allowed to pass under in situ temperature and pressure for 33 days.

osgbin16 showed the potential ability to reduce sulfate to sulfide fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen and generate a proton motive force via the rnf complex.potential metabolism in deep biosphere biofilmsall mags were scrutinized for genes encoding electrondonor and acceptor use as well as carbon dioxide and ni- trogen fixation table and additional file13 table s7.populations in both the modern marine and old saline water biofilm formers were putative carbon- and nitrogen- fixers mmgbin93 representing 11.73 of the reads and osgbin24 representing 2.15 of the reads.
