The higher cell abundance in the biofilms of the modern marine water was consist- ent with the greater DOC in this water type Table For comparison calculated planktonic cell concentra- tions for the modern marine borehole was 2.8 x 104 cells mL-1 The planktonic cell concentration was not measured for the old saline water but water from an adjacent borehole with similar chemical characteristics was estimated to hold approximately 100 cells mL-1 Hence the biofilms were quantitatively signifi- cant components of these deep aquifer systems and should be considered if we are to understand the interplay between the biosphere and geosphere.Even with the extremely oligotrophic conditions in the Aspo HRL fracture waters earlier data from cell growthin response to addition of putative substrates such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide suggests that deep bio- sphere microorganisms are viable  In the present study direct measurements of ATP showed that the investigated microbial communities were metabolic- ally active Additional file Table S4.

This search included genes involved in chemo- taxis presence of methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein MCP and all cheABWRY genes which provides an advan- tage during biofilm formation genes for flagella presence of at least 20 of flgLKDGHIBCE fliDCEFGMN- HIOPQR flhAB and both motAB genes for the flagellum motor which aid in bacterial attachment and genes to produce EPS galU or both galUE and export these polymers to the cell surface hlyBD plus tolC for Type I secretion or eps for Sec-dependent secretion a trait thatprovides mechanical stability and facilitates adhesion to the surface Table and Additional file  Table S7.

The presence of sulfate that acts as an electron acceptor in both waters supports that these groundwaters were substrate-limited and likely feature slow cellular growth rates.KA2198A had high magnesium and potassium con- centrations which are tracers of marine waters and also had slightly lower values for chloride and d18O compared to modern brackish Baltic Sea water Table This implies that this groundwater mainly consisted of infiltrated brackish Baltic Sea water to some extent diluted with meteoric water and was classified as modern marine sample name defined as MM.

The biofilm contained a mixed community dominated by hydrogen-fed autotrophs able to fix nitrogen that reflected the oligotrophic conditions in the waters of deep terrestrial aquifers.MethodsDescription of the Aspo HRL siteThe Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company SKB operated Aspo HRL is situated on the southeastern coast of Sweden Lat N 57deg 26' 4'' Lon E 16deg 39' 36'' in a bedrock dominated by 1800 Ma gra- nite and quartz monzodiorite The structure of the Aspo HRL tunnel has been shown in a previous study and the geology chemistry and hydrology of the boreholes extending from the tunnel have been de- scribed The boreholes were sampled for planktonic cells and flow cells attached to investigate for biofilm development described below.Chemical and isotopic composition of the water Descriptions of the analytical techniques and precision of the variables are given elsewhere Cl- and d18O  Na K Ca Mg Cs and NH 2 Fe2 Fe-total dissolved or-ganic carbon DOC and HS-  and Mn SO2- HCO-43There were no major differences in the predicted meta- bolic pathways for MAGs implicated in initial biofilm formation between either the water types or surfaces.The metabolic potential of the surface attached com- munities' implied organic carbon e.g.

Three MAGs from the modern marine water garnet surface totaling 1.2 of the mapped reads and three MAGs from the modern marine water glass surface 13.4 of the mapped reads contained genes implicated in EPS production and export assigned to Group B. MMRBin36 MMRBin41 andMMGBin48 were affiliated with the Verrucomicrobia and MMGBin22 was from candidate division OP3.

Although the modern marine water wasostensibly anaerobic both MMGBin17 and OSGBin16 were most closely related to Sideroxydans lithotrophicus an iron-oxidizing bacterium that grows at oxic-anoxic inter- faces The old saline water contained one MAG OSRBin1 0.22 of the reads that was suggested to code for all genes required for biofilm formation group A.

OSGBin16 showed the potential ability to reduce sulfate to sulfide fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen and generate a proton motive force via the Rnf complex.Potential metabolism in deep biosphere biofilmsAll MAGs were scrutinized for genes encoding electrondonor and acceptor use as well as carbon dioxide and ni- trogen fixation Table and Additional file13 Table S7.populations in both the modern marine and old saline water biofilm formers were putative carbon- and nitrogen- fixers MMGBin93 representing 11.73 of the reads and OSGBin24 representing 2.15 of the reads.

The Rnf complex at least four of rnfABCDEG had higher frequencies in modern marine biofilms F  16.5 p  0.05 for the sum of the rnfABCDEG genes and combined with the widespread occurrence of these genes across both water types we propose that this respiration mechanism may constitute a generic adaptation to oligotrophy in the waters at the Aspo HRL.

The deep biome is the largest microbial ecosystem on earth and the deep continental biosphere is estimated to host 2 to 19 of earth's total biomass Although a large proportion of the earth's microbial cells reside in the deep bio- sphere our knowledge of the biology and identity of these organisms is scarce One reason for this is the difficulty to obtain uncontaminated samples.
