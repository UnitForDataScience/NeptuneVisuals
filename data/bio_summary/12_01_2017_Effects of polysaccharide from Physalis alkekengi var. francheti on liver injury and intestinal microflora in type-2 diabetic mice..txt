N normal mice treated with water L diabetic mice with 50 mgkg of PPSB H diabetic mice with100 mgkg of PPSB D diabetic mice with distilled water E diabetic mice with 600 mgkg of dimethylbiguanide.Effects of PPSB on ALT and ASTALT and AST in the serum have been commonly used as bio- chemical markers for liver injury.

francheti on liver injury and intestinal microflora in type-2 diabetic mice Pharmaceutical Biology 551 2020-2025 DOI 10.108013880209.2017.1345953To link to this article c 2017 The Authors.

The chemical drugs used have some serious adverse reactions such as hypoglycaemia anaphylactic shock liver dam- age and cardiovascular toxicity Xiao et al.

The liver in turn affects intestinal functions through bile secretion into the intestinal lumen.

The significantly elevated AST and ALT expression levels indicated the increased permeability and damage of liver.

The expression levels of TGF-b1 and TNF-a decreased in PPSB- treated groups in addition the expression of DCN increased as compared to D group.It is clear that side effects of T2D are associated with whole intestinal microflora and liver injury.

At the early stage of diabetic liver injury DLI clinical symptoms were unobvious which is due to the powerful compensatory function of liver.

Moreover once the patients developed liver fat deposition and fibrosis the structure and function of liver were susceptible to damage Domitrovi .

Accumulating evi- dences have demonstrated that natural extracts possessed the ability to prevent liver fibrosis by reducing the expressions of TGF-b1 and tumour necrosis factor-a TNF-a and increasing the expression of DCN in the liver Thu et al.

There is a strong rela- tionship between liver and gut the portal system receives blood from the gut and intestinal blood content activates liver func- tions.
