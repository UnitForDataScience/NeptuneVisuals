in addition the significant difference in group l and e was shown from the 2nd to 5th weeks.figure 1. levels of blood glucose a alt and ast b of normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice x- 6 s n 10. ddp  0.01 dp  0.05 vs. the blank control group n p  0.01 p  0.05 vs. the diabetic model group d. n normal mice treated with water l diabetic mice with 50 mgkg of ppsb h diabetic mice with100 mgkg of ppsb d diabetic mice with distilled water e diabetic mice with 600 mgkg of dimethylbiguanide.effects of ppsb on alt and astalt and ast in the serum have been commonly used as bio- chemical markers for liver injury.

.experimental designthe streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were randomly divided into four groups groups 2-5 together with blank control group group 1 10 mice in each group.

obviously b was found in streptozotocin- induced diabetic mice groups group 2-5 the intensity of the band was highest in d group especially but it did not exist in normal group.

the shannon-wiener indexes of h0 reflecting the structural diversity of the bacterial community were calculated on the basis of the number and relative intensities of bands on the gel .it was clearly shown that diversity in ppsb-l ppsb-h d and e groups decreased as compared to n group with statistical significance p  0.05. compared to n group the numbers of bands were lower in streptozotocin-induced diabetic groups andtable 1. microflora diversity index analysisa x- 6 s n 14 10.e13.00 - 0.820.8667 - 0.02060.3382 - 0.0101 l10.00 - 0.821.8825 - 0.02080.8192 - 0.0207 h12.25 - 1.260.8351 - 0.00630.3342 - 0.0112n normal mice treated with water d diabetic mice with distilled water e diabetic mice with 600 mgkg of dimethylbiguanide l diabetic mice with 50 mgkg of ppsb h diabetic mice with 100 mgkg of ppsb.ap  0.01 vs. the blank control group n.h0 14 - ppi lnpi where pi was the proportion of the bands in the track andthere were three main clusters in the dendrogram the first wasce 14 h0ln s where s was the number of bands.figure 2. representative dgge profiles a and upgma dendrograms b of blank control diabetic mice diabetic mice with 50 and 100 mgkg of ppsb and positive control groups.

they were administered for five weeks and the arrangements are as followsgroup 1 blank control group n normal mice treated with water.group 2 diabetic model group d diabetic mice with distilled water.group 3 diabetic mice with 600 mgkg of dimethylbiguanide e yang et al.

compared to group d the level of bg in group h decreased regularly from 25.38 - 2.21 mmoll to 18.01 - 2.53 mmoll during five weeks which showed extremely significant hypoglycaemic effects p  0.01 at the 3rd week.

alt and ast decreased to 24.67 - 4.86 ul and 30.84 - 7.50 ul in ppsb-h-treated group respectively.dgge analysisthe dominant intestinal microflora of group n l h d and e was examined by dgge analysis with universal primers targeting the v3 region of the 16s rrna .

lane 1 was the sample from blank normal group while lane 2 represented those from diabetic model group lane 3 represented those from strep- tozotocin-induced diabetic mice with 600 mgkg of dimethylbi- guanide and lanes 4 and 5 represented those from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice with 50 and 100 mgkg of ppsb respectively.

other bands almost existed in all groups and in the different groups the intensity of the bands in the same position was similar.the clustering analysis based on the values of dice coefficientswas visualized in an upgma dendrogram to study general pat- terns of community similarity among the different groups bylane 2 related d group the second was lane 4 related ppsb-l group and the 3rd was lanes 1 3 and 5 related n e and ppsb- h groups.

in the present study  the alt and ast serum concentrations were increased to 211.07 - 13.72 ul and 65.70 - 6.26 ul in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice group which indicated streptozotocin had severely damaged liver tissues.

at the early stage of diabetic liver injury dli clinical symptoms were unobvious which is due to the powerful compensatory function of liver.
