Our results suggest that solar panels even on high latitudes can shape a microbial ecosystem adapted to irradiation and desiccation.IntroductionThe microbial ecology of some artificial structures including solar panels has been poorly explored up to date Shirakawa et al 2015 Dorado-Morales et al 2016.

These reports suggest that photovoltaic surfaces display a diverse microbial community highly tolerant to thermal fluctuations ultraviolet UV irradiation and desiccation Dorado-Morales et al 2016.

One of these was iden- tified as R. mucilaginosa a cold-adapted with activity at up to 25 8C carotenoid-producing cosmopolitan meso- philic yeast that has previously been isolated from a wide range of remote environments including Antarctical ice cores or 11 000 m deep sea vents Gadanho and Sampaio 2005 Amato et al.

2009 Moline et al.

2012 Nunes et al.

The most frequent isolate able to resist two minutes of UV irradiation was R. mucilaginosa in which carotenoid accumulation may play an essential role in photoprotec-conditions that characterize these artificial environ- ments UV-radiation and desiccation.The taxonomic profiles obtained through NGS of three panels from each location were analysed Breitwieser and Salzberg 2016 Kim et al.

R. mucilaginosa was present among these 38 isolates an expected result when considering previous studies that describe this species as highly resistant to desiccation Connell et al.

The large heteroge- neity in UV-resistance is in contrast with the high irradiance in the sampled site suggesting that a tridi- mensional biofilm-like structure may play an important role not only in survival under desiccation conditions but also in UV-protection in the natural biocenosis Gorbushina 2007 Villa et al.
