In this review we have discussed potential interactions between the gut microbiome and host microRNAsmicroRNAs and gut diseases and gut diseases and the gut microbiome.

Three important interactions between the host and gut microbiomeinvolving microRNAs are clear however including i microRNAs regulate host gene expression Figure 1A ii gut microbiota influences host microRNA expression Figure 1B and iii the host influences the gut microbiota through the release of microRNAs Figure 1C.

Though the relationship between microRNA expression and gut diseases has been extensively studied the full extent of this relationship and the importance of the gut microbiota on this is less clear.MICROBES ASSOCIATED WITH GUT DISEASESDysbiosis of gut microbial communities that results in the loss of host-microbiota symbiosis often results in a shift from symbiont to pathobiont.

Though the relationship of microRNA expression to gut diseases as well as the relationship of gut microbiome dysbiosis to gut diseases has been studied their investigation together namely the communication that may be occurring therein has not.

As both microRNAs and gut microbes are important in the development of certain gut diseases it is evident that role of microRNAs cannot be overlooked in studies focusing on gut microbiome associated diseases.LINKS BETWEEN EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS MICRORNA EXPRESSION AND THE GUT MICROBIOMEExposure to environmental contaminants can increase the risk for many diseases.

Analysis of gut microbial regulation of host gene expression along the length of the gut and regulation of gut microbial ecology through MyD88.

We also examine potential links between host microRNA-microbiota communication and exposure to environmental toxicants by reviewing connections between i toxicants and microRNA expression ii toxicants and gut diseases and iii toxicants and the gut microbiome.

2011 the maximum fold change for downregulated microRNAs was 0.2 and for upregulated microRNAs was 4.6.One of the earliest reports of the impact of the gut microbiome on microRNA expression used germ-free mice colonized with gut microbiota from specific pathogen-free SPF mice Dalmasso et al.

UC mice with high IL-12IL-23p40 expression also had lower expression of miR-10a in intestinal tissues compared with healthy mice suggesting the importance of miR-10a in disease though this may not be due to direct affects.The gut microbiome may also be regulating host microRNAs and function in regions beyond the gut.

The importance of commensals in maintaining overall gut homeostasis is clear as evidenced by the success of fecal transplantation in the treatment of gut diseases such as UC Borody et al.
