Compared with our former study the TMAO level in Chinese atherosclerosis patients was similar to the control group but was deceased in strokepatients 2.92 mmolL 2.68 mmolL and 1.91 mmolL respectively illustrating that in our study the TMAO level of the healthy controls was relatively normal and comparable whereas the TMAO level was significantlyFigure 4.

Interestingly in the Framingham Heart Study TMAO was a predicative marker of CKD at 8 years of follow-up that was not related to the baseline GFR suggesting that TMAO may be a surrogate marker for the GFR and have nephrotoxic properties.In accordance with the alteration in TMAO severe dysbiosis of the gut microbial community was observed in the CKD patients.

The low GFR group showed significantly higher TMAO concentra- tions than the high GFR group which showed significantly higher TMAO concentrations than the control group.Obvious dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in CKD patients including reduced bacterial a-diver- sity and biased community constitutions.

The plasma TMAO concentrations were quantified using stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 6460 Series Triple Quadrupole LCMS Agilent as previously described.The molecular weight of TMAO is 75.22 gmol.

reported that the TMAO levels were signifi- cantly elevated in CKD patients indicating that TMAO also played a role as a risk factor in these patients.

Thus we could assume that the elevated TMAO levels are caused by the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and impaired renal functions in Chinese CKD patients.Recently we reported that the TMAO level in Chinese atherosclerosis patients was similar to the levelobserved in the control group but was deceased in stroke patients which was different from data reported from studies in the USA .

In the present study we evaluated the gut microbial com- munity and the TMAO levels in Chinese CKD patients and explored the underlying explanations through the animal experiment.ResultsCKD patients showed worse clinical manifestations and significantly elevated TMAO concen- trations compared to the healthy participants.

To investigate the clinical conditions and plasma TMAO concentrations of the CKD patients we collected basic clinical indices and measured TMAO concen- trations for analysis.

In con- clusion the FMT from CKD patients led to increased TMAO levels and the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in mice receiving this.DiscussionCKD has become an important public health problem and our study provides new information about the TMAO levels and gut microbiome in Chinese CKD patients.

reported that the TMAO levels in CKD 3-4 and CKD 5 patients and controls in Sweden were73.5 mML 14.6 mML and 5.8 mML respectively and that the renal functions were a major determinant of the TMAO level.
