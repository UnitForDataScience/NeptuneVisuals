combined with the apparent gd t cell regulatory capacity the specific expression pattern of individual btnl molecules in distinct epithelial tissues such as skin and intestine has revealed a role for these molecules in shaping local gd iel compartments by selectively promoting maturation and expansion of tissue specific gd t cells7-9in this review we focus on the gd iel compartment in the two largest epithelial tissues in the body namely the epidermis and intestine with particular emphasis on the murine system and discuss just how crucial the contributions of gd iel at these sites are to tissue integrity host homeostasis and host protection in the context of the symbiotic relationship with the microbiome and during pathogen clearance.

in contrast to mouse skin where detc are the only t cells in the epidermis the iel compartment of mouse and human intestine is more comparable and both are composed of gd and ab t cells which are interspersed between epithelial cells and also just below the basement membrane17 fig.1b.gd t cells in the epithelial layer of skin and intestinemouse gd t cell development initiates at the time of seeding of the fetal thymus at embryonic day 13 e13 with distinct gd t cell subsets developing in overlapping sequence and while the earlier emerging subsets are restricted to development in the embryonic thymus the latter are replenished from the thymus throughout life18 19. the early emerging populations are exported to the periphery where they migrate into and populate epithelial tissue while the majority of latter developing populations circulate the blood and secondary lymphoid organs20 21. the murine gd t cell subsets are distinguished by their use of different vg usage whereas human gd t cell subsets are often distinguished by vd usage.

vg3 thymocytes are solely generated during the early fetal stages of thymic development from e13-e18 and migrate to the epidermis where a defined homeostatic density is maintained throughout life24 25. in mice intestinal homing gd iel populate the gut around birth and while capable of paring with several vd-genes intestinal gd iel almost exclusively express a vg5 tcr24 26. the developmental route of gut gd iel has been the subject of controversy for many years and a number of studies showing both thymic dependence and independence have been published fig.2.1 27 28. il-7 receptor il-7r signaling is necessary for v-j recombination and transcription of the tcrg gene during thymic development and both il-7 deficient and il-7 receptor deficient animals arenielsen et al.page 4devoid of gd t cells29-31.

in the adult mouse small intestinal homing of newly developed vg5 gd t cells is also dependent on integrin a4b7 which mediates recirculation through the gut- associated lymphoid tissue where specific priming of vg5 iel reinforces small intestinal tropism by further inducing ccr9 and a4b7 expression61.tissue homeostasis and repairpresent at the very frontier and in close contact with neighboring epithelial cells tissue- resident gd t cells are ideally positioned to partake in the upkeep of tissue homeostasis and epithelial repair and detc and intestinal gd iel share several common features that aid in maintenance of their respective epithelial barriers62-64.epidermal gd t cellsin steady-state skin detc dendrites extend both basally and apically towards the stratum corneum and while apical dendrites are immobile and anchor detc to the tight junctions formed by keratinocytes basal protrusions are highly mobile65.

combined these studies suggest that intestinal gd iel are early responders essential to limiting mucosal penetration by intestinal bacteria during both tissue homeostasis and following epithelial damage.small intestinal gd iel transcriptional profiles show high expression of several cytolytic genes such as granzyme a and b indicating a cytotoxic potential towards pathogens andnielsen et al.page 11infected cells118 119. even so evidence of direct lysis by gd iel in vivo is sparse but using a cd3-redirected lysis assay pioneering experiments found that small intestinal gd iel can constitutively kill target cells120.

thus much like detc both epidermal gd and ab t cells facilitate wound closure in human skin and the unresponsive state of epidermal t cells in chronic wounds further solidifies the importance of skin-resident t cells to wound healing and possibly provide therapeutic targets for improving wound healing.intestinal gd ielsince the intestinal epithelium is composed of a single cell-layer gd iel are only able to directly interact with two epithelial cells at any given time.

production of kgf-1 by gd iel is in part mediated through cd100 and dss induced colitis in cd100-- mice closely resembles that of gd-deficient mice showing increased colon ulceration and mucosal infiltration by inflammatory cells62 88. gut gd iel also express jaml and car is constitutively expressed by intestinal epithelial cells74 89. given that jaml ligation leads to kgf-1 production by detc it is likely that jaml alsonielsen et al.page 8aids in gut gd iel-mediated tissue repair74.

furthermore the protective role of gd iel is evident in infectious mouse models and despite the fact that gd and ab small intestinal iel have similar cytolytic gene expression profiles119 only gd- but not ab-deficient mice are more susceptible to infection86 113 118.the limited knowledge on effector functions of intestinal gd iel has in large part been due to the inability to sustain viable cells in vitro especially upon receiving tcr stimuli.

given the fact that dermal gd t cells are also capable of producing il-17a133 134 and because s. epidermis is also found in the dermis of healthy skin135 the decreased number of il-17a skin residing gd t cells in germ-free mice129 is likely to be caused by decreased il-17a production by both dermal gd t cells and detc fig.4b.detc also demonstrate anti-bacterial activity through recruitment of neutrophils to the skin upon staphylococcus aureus infection.

in this review we focus on the intraepithelial gd compartment in the two largest epithelial tissues in the body namely the epidermis and intestine and provide a comprehensive overview of the crucial contributions of intraepithelial gd cells at these sites to tissue integrity and repair host homeostasis and host protection in the context of the symbiotic relationship with the microbiome and during pathogen clearance.

however specific subsets of gd t cells are present in much higher numbers 10-100 in epithelial tissues such as the epidermis of the skin the gastrointestinal tract and the reproductive track where they express tissue-specific t cell receptors that in many cases show little to no diversity1.epithelial gd t cell subsets are part of a larger group of epithelial residing lymphocytes termed intra-epithelial lymphocytes iel2.

furthermore this review touches upon the emerging role of butyrophilin-like btnl molecules in gd t cell activation and how the tissue specific expression of these molecules possibly contribute to shaping organ-specific gd t cell compartments.epithelial tissues - skin and intestineepithelial tissues of tightly linked cells collectively create a barrier to the environment both outside e.g.

in regard to murine gd t cells it is important to note the existence of two different gd nomenclatures22 23. while we employ the garman nomenclature22 in this review a comparison of the two classifications is provided in table1.development and homeostasisexpressing a canonical vg3vd1 tcr detc precursors are the very first t cells to develop in the mouse thymus.

the composition of iel in the large and small intestine differ and while gd iel are found in both compartments the small intestine is particularly enriched for gd iel55.

that gd t cells in general constitute a crucial part of the immune response against tumors is evident from a recent seminal study reporting that intra- tumoral gd t cells are the most favorable prognostic immune population across 39 cancernielsen et al.page 7types in humans79.
