lastly the review will consider the possible alleviation of chronic alterations to hippocampal neurogenesisand cognitive function through interventions with modifiablelifestyle factors such as exercise and diet 1.the impact of stress during adolescence on hippocampal neurogenesisimmediate effects of adolescent stress on neurogenesiswhile it is well established that stress has a detrimental effect on neurogenesis in adulthood the effect is relatively short-lived asrecovery can occur in as little as 10 days.the effects of stress during adolescence on hippocampal neurogenesis in rodent models remain relatively unexplored however what data there are indicate that stress during this time can produce much longer- lasting effects on neurogenesis and related cognitive function.

recently studies have begun to emerge that suggest a role for the microbiota in regulating both hippocampal neurogenesisand cognitive function.interestingly changes to the microbiota in adult female mice resulted in impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and decreased cognitive performance in a novel object recognition task an effect that was rescued by 10 days of voluntary running.thus it appears that there is a relationship between exercise the microbiota and neurogenesis and as such microbiota changes may be one mechanism through which exercise can exert effects on hippocampal function and cognition in adolescence.

for example in rodent models male mice fed a hfd for 11 weeks throughout adolescence starting at pnd21 exhibited decreased cognitive performance in the radial arm maze and decreased numbers of new neurons in the dg while neither of these changes were observed when the diet was administered during adulthood.similarly a hfd fed to male rats during adolescence for 11 weeks starting at pnd21 decreased long-term memory performance in the morris watermaze while a hfd during adulthood did not result in any of these changes.in addition human adolescents consuming 'western' diets have decreased performance in visual-spatial learning and memory tasks both of which are associated with hippocampal function.in support of the link between nutritional state and hippocampal function consumption of diets lacking in vitamin a and e resulted in decreased proliferation of new neurons in the dgand reductions in spatial learning and memoryin adult male rats.some studies have examined the positive impact of nutrition on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in adulthood.low- calorie diets have been shown to increase memory performance in aged human subjects.findings from studies using adult male and female rodents suggest that low-calorie dietsor diets with increased flavonoids omega-3 fatty acids polyphenolsmagnesiumor zinccan increase proliferation and survival of newly born neurons in the dg628 as well as performance on hippocampal-related learning andmemory tasks.

likewise most rodent studies examining the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive function have employed male rats however puberty may lead to the onset of sex differences in hippocampal neurogenesis.

moreover this period of the lifespan may be important in the programming of future hippocampal connectivity thus it is essential to better understand how potential modulators such as stress diet and exercise could affect adolescent hippocampal neurogenesis and subsequently have an impact upon cognitive function throughout the rest of the lifespan.

for example male rats that had been exposed to social instability stress pnd30-45 had increased hippocampal cell proliferation and numbers of new neurons when examined at pnd46while female rats exposed to the same stress challenge had decreased hippocampal cell survival and no change in proliferation when examined at pnd49.male mice exposed to chronic isolation stress 5 weeks starting at pnd24 exhibited a decrease in the survival of newly born cells as well as a reduction in the proportion of newly born neurons in the cellular populationwhen examined at pnd53.unlike the effects of social isolation in rats no change in cell proliferation within the dg was observed.

in a non-human primate model 8-10-month-old male and female marmoset monkeys showed a decrease in cell proliferation and in the number of new neurons within the dg immediately after either 1 or 3 weeks of social isolation stress.chronic social or physical stress in male rats 4 weeks starting at pnd28 did not result in changes to dg volume or neuronal density at pnd56 while male rats at pnd28 showed a reduced induction of long- term potentiation following elevated platform stress suggesting impaired hippocampal function.however dg volume neuronal density and long-term potentiation are all indirect measures of neurogenesis and as such may not be reflective of changes in hippocampal neurogenesis levels per se.

there also appears to be a sex difference in the impact of chronic stress on neurogenesis during adolescence as chronic restraint stress pnd30-52 decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and survival in female rats but increased cell survival in male rats.thus an overall trend for an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis in early adulthood is reported after adolescent stress exposure in males while the opposite effect is observed in females and in males later in life.

however in adolescence shorter stress challenges may be able to produce longer effects as evidenced by a study in which adolescent male rats were subjected to a relatively short chronic stress paradigm 15 days altered hippocampal neurogenesis up to 30 days later.the impact of stress during adolescence on hippocampal-dependent cognitive functionimmediate effects of adolescent stress on cognitive function stress in adulthood results in deficits in cognitive behaviours suchas spatial learningand novel object recognitionwhich have been shown to be dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis.

however other tests that are believed to be dependent on hippocampal function such as context based fear-conditioningand radial arm maze do not result in clear cut deficits following stressor exposure during adolescence.one explanation for this discrepancy in performance inhippocampal-dependent tasks in response to adolescent stress is that even though these tasks require hippocampal-dependent types of memory they may not be definitively associated with changes in hippocampal neurogenesis.

these discrepant findings may reflect recent research which has indicated that hippocampal neurogenesis may be involved in the forgetting of old information rather than the addition of new memories.in support stress in early life can decrease extinctionfactors that may contribute to stress-induced alternations in hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognition during adolescencehpa axis response to stress during adolescencein response to stressor exposure the hpa axis is activated resulting in the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone acth from the anterior pituitary gland which in turn stimulates the release of corticosterone cort from the adrenal cortex into the bloodstream.

because of the uncertainty still surrounding the association between hippocampal neurogenesis and different types of cognitive tasks as well as the potential for this association to change throughout the lifespan the best course of action to assess the effect of stress on adolescent neurogenesis and cognitive function would be to correlate cognitive performance in multiple tasks carried out at various times throughout the adolescent period with measures of hippocampal neurogenesis.beneficial effects of cort on neurogenesis and cognition are believed to occur with low occupation of gr receptors and high occupation of mralterations in the mr to gr ratio across adolescence may regulate the potential effects of cort at this time.

thus the increased hpa and cort response to stress in adolescence may be a mechanism through which stressor exposure at this time of life may exert long-lasting effects on both hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition.neuroinflammatory response to stress during adolescencestressor exposure also results in increased expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines such as il-1b il-6 andincreased cellular survival within the dg.interestingly these changes are opposite to those observed in adulthood as adult male rats show a decrease in neuronal proliferation following acute stressas well as a decrease in survival of new neurons after chronic stress.in adult female rats however an increase in the survival of new neurons and no change in proliferation was observed following chronic stress.these results suggest that adolescent females may have an inherent vulnerability to chronic stress compared to adolescent males while adult females appear to be resistant to the detrimental effects of chronic stress on hippocampal neurogenesis.

adult male mice 5 months overexpressing the il-1 receptor antagonist showed decreased hippocampal cell proliferation compared to wild types yet this difference dis- appeared with ageing 22 months.however it remains to be determined whether there are differential cytokine signalling pathways that have an impact upon neurogenesis during adolescence compared to adulthood and indeed whether there are sex differences in the response to inflammatory-induced changes in neurogenesis and associated cognition.sex differences in the response to stress during adolescencesex is an important contributor to differences in basal levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesisfor example at pnd35 male rats exhibit higher levels of cellular proliferation in the dg than femaleswhile adult female rats have higher levels of proliferation than males.moreover as there are bi-directional interactions between the hpa and hpg axes starting during puberty which allow for sex-dependent stress responsesit is important to consider sex differences in the response to stress during adolescence in rodents and that these responses may differ from those seen in adulthood.

thus it will be important in future studies of adolescent hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function to note the pubertal state of the animals and the phase of the oestrus cycle not only at the time of cognitive testing but also at the time of stress challenge and tissue collection.potential interventions during adolescence that could ameliorate stress-induced impairments in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitionepidemiological studies have revealed that human adolescence is often associated with altered meal intake patterns and changes in physical activity levels.studies have indicated that less than 50 of teens receive the daily-recommended intake of fruit vegetable dairy or protein while intake of fats and sugars during adolescence is well above the recommended levels.
