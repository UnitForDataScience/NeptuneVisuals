Recently studies have begun to emerge that suggest a role for the microbiota in regulating both hippocampal neurogenesisand cognitive function.Interestingly changes to the microbiota in adult female mice resulted in impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and decreased cognitive performance in a novel object recognition task an effect that was rescued by 10 days of voluntary running.Thus it appears that there is a relationship between exercise the microbiota and neurogenesis and as such microbiota changes may be one mechanism through which exercise can exert effects on hippocampal function and cognition in adolescence.

For example in rodent models male mice fed a HFD for 11 weeks throughout adolescence starting at PND21 exhibited decreased cognitive performance in the radial arm maze and decreased numbers of new neurons in the DG while neither of these changes were observed when the diet was administered during adulthood.Similarly a HFD fed to male rats during adolescence for 11 weeks starting at PND21 decreased long-term memory performance in the Morris watermaze while a HFD during adulthood did not result in any of these changes.In addition human adolescents consuming 'Western' diets have decreased performance in visual-spatial learning and memory tasks both of which are associated with hippocampal function.In support of the link between nutritional state and hippocampal function consumption of diets lacking in Vitamin A and E resulted in decreased proliferation of new neurons in the DGand reductions in spatial learning and memoryin adult male rats.Some studies have examined the positive impact of nutrition on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in adulthood.Low- calorie diets have been shown to increase memory performance in aged human subjects.Findings from studies using adult male and female rodents suggest that low-calorie dietsor diets with increased flavonoids omega-3 fatty acids polyphenolsmagnesiumor zinccan increase proliferation and survival of newly born neurons in the DG628 as well as performance on hippocampal-related learning andmemory tasks.

Likewise most rodent studies examining the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in cognitive function have employed male rats however puberty may lead to the onset of sex differences in hippocampal neurogenesis.

Moreover this period of the lifespan may be important in the programming of future hippocampal connectivity thus it is essential to better understand how potential modulators such as stress diet and exercise could affect adolescent hippocampal neurogenesis and subsequently have an impact upon cognitive function throughout the rest of the lifespan.

Lastly the review will consider the possible alleviation of chronic alterations to hippocampal neurogenesisand cognitive function through interventions with modifiablelifestyle factors such as exercise and diet 1.THE IMPACT OF STRESS DURING ADOLESCENCE ON HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESISImmediate effects of adolescent stress on neurogenesisWhile it is well established that stress has a detrimental effect on neurogenesis in adulthood the effect is relatively short-lived asrecovery can occur in as little as 10 days.The effects of stress during adolescence on hippocampal neurogenesis in rodent models remain relatively unexplored however what data there are indicate that stress during this time can produce much longer- lasting effects on neurogenesis and related cognitive function.

For example male rats that had been exposed to social instability stress PND30-45 had increased hippocampal cell proliferation and numbers of new neurons when examined at PND46while female rats exposed to the same stress challenge had decreased hippocampal cell survival and no change in proliferation when examined at PND49.Male mice exposed to chronic isolation stress 5 weeks starting at PND24 exhibited a decrease in the survival of newly born cells as well as a reduction in the proportion of newly born neurons in the cellular populationwhen examined at PND53.Unlike the effects of social isolation in rats no change in cell proliferation within the DG was observed.

In a non-human primate model 8-10-month-old male and female marmoset monkeys showed a decrease in cell proliferation and in the number of new neurons within the DG immediately after either 1 or 3 weeks of social isolation stress.Chronic social or physical stress in male rats 4 weeks starting at PND28 did not result in changes to DG volume or neuronal density at PND56 while male rats at PND28 showed a reduced induction of long- term potentiation following elevated platform stress suggesting impaired hippocampal function.However DG volume neuronal density and long-term potentiation are all indirect measures of neurogenesis and as such may not be reflective of changes in hippocampal neurogenesis levels per se.

There also appears to be a sex difference in the impact of chronic stress on neurogenesis during adolescence as chronic restraint stress PND30-52 decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and survival in female rats but increased cell survival in male rats.Thus an overall trend for an increase in hippocampal neurogenesis in early adulthood is reported after adolescent stress exposure in males while the opposite effect is observed in females and in males later in life.

However in adolescence shorter stress challenges may be able to produce longer effects as evidenced by a study in which adolescent male rats were subjected to a relatively short chronic stress paradigm 15 days altered hippocampal neurogenesis up to 30 days later.THE IMPACT OF STRESS DURING ADOLESCENCE ON HIPPOCAMPAL-DEPENDENT COGNITIVE FUNCTIONImmediate effects of adolescent stress on cognitive function Stress in adulthood results in deficits in cognitive behaviours suchas spatial learningand novel object recognitionwhich have been shown to be dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis.

However other tests that are believed to be dependent on hippocampal function such as context based fear-conditioningand radial arm maze do not result in clear cut deficits following stressor exposure during adolescence.One explanation for this discrepancy in performance inhippocampal-dependent tasks in response to adolescent stress is that even though these tasks require hippocampal-dependent types of memory they may not be definitively associated with changes in hippocampal neurogenesis.
