Analysis of the products of agarose AP degraded by B. uniformis L8 a TLC analysis of degradation of AP by B. uniformis L8 at 0 48 96 144 and 192 h b HPLC chromatography of final products of AP degraded by B. uniformis L8 at 96 h 1. monosaccharide standard Man mannose Rha rhamnose GalA galacturonic acid Glc glucose Gal Galactose Xyl xylose 2. final products of AP degraded by B. uniformis L8 at 96 h.Table 2.

Profile of degradation position and mode of action of enzymes on marine carbohydrates.a degradation position of carrageenan oligosaccharides by enzymes secreted by 38F6 B. xylanisolvens and E. coli b degradation position of agarose AP by enzymes from B. uniformis L8 c degradation position of alginate by enzymes from B. ovatus G19.Chemical Structures of the Intermediates Produced by the Degradation of Alg MO and GO byB.

According to B. ovatus G19's degrading ability of Alg MO and GO the enzymes from B. ovatus G19 contain both a-14-guluronanlyase and b-14-mannuronanlyase resulting in unsaturated alginate oligosaccharides Figure c. For MO and GO because the original substrate was prepared using acid hydrolysis the saturated oligosaccharides are from the hexuronic acid residues at the non-reducing end.Table 4.

Here the degradation characteristics of carrageenan agarose alginate and their oligosaccharides by Bacteroides xylanisolvens Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides uniforms isolated from human gut microbiota are studied.Keywords carrageenan agarose alginate oligosaccharides Bacteroides xylanisolvens Bacteroides ovatusBacteroides uniformsIntroductionMarine carbohydrates contain a great deal of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides some of them have been used as food additives for a long time such as carrageenan agarose and alginate all play an important role in Asian food however these marine carbohydrates cannot be digested by the enzymes encoded by the human genome.

We attempted to purify B. xylanisolvens from the complex isolate but the degrading ability of the single B. xylanisolvens is much weaker than that of the complex .

Thin-layer chromatography TLC analysis of degradation of neocarratetraose NK-DP4 and neocarrahexaose NK-DP6 by 38F6 2 neocarrabiose NK-DP2 4 NK-DP4 6 NK-DP6 4J NK-DP4 fermentation by 38F6 6J NK-DP6 fermentation by 38F6.Chemical Structures of the Intermediates Produced by the Degradation of AP by B. uniformis L8TLC patterns showed that the intermediates produced from the degradation of AP by B. uniformis L8 contained a range of fragments with different molecular weights after 48 h of incubation Figure a.

However the end product of AP degradation by B. uniforms L8 is D-galactose so it is possible that during the later period of hydrolysis B. uniforms L8 secreted another glycoside hydrolase which could help to hydrolyze neoagarobiose to D and A.

Negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ESI-MS analysis of the fragments generated from alginate Alg degradation by B. ovatus G19 at 144 h.Experimental SectionN  b-D-mannuronic acid M or a-L-guluronic acid G.Polysaccharide and Oligosaccharide MaterialsAP was obtained from Qingdao Judayang Seaweed Co. Ltd. Qingdao China.

Medium with k-carrageenan oligosaccharides NK-DP4 NK-DP6 and K-DP17 AP and alginate type Alg GO MO were autoclaved and inoculated with 38F6 B. uniforms L8 and Bacteroides ovatus G19 separately then incubated at 37 C in an anaerobic chamber.

Drugs 2017 15 92 doidespite the fact that they have been used as food additives for a long time little is known regarding their degradation and utilization by specific bacterium from human gut microbiota.Our previous results showed the degradation of agaroligosaccharides  alginate and alginate oligosaccharides  by Chinese gut microbiota.
