The larger differences in the fungal versus bacterial microbiome were also evident in relative abundance plots of the top 100 most abundant bacterial and fungal taxa organized by genus  A and  A. Additionally we found several correlations between bacterial and fungal OTUs suggesting potential ecologic synergistic and antagonistic associations occurring in the infant gut see in this article's Online Repository at .Given extensive metadata collected in this cohort we captured the effect of the gut microbiome on the atopic wheeze phenotype used as a surrogate for asthma risk while controlling for potential confounding using MaAsLin.

Here we show that bacterial and fungal dysbiosis can be detected in early life in babies who go onto have atopic wheeze in later childhood in a nonindustrialized setting.METHODSStudy designWe conducted a case-control study nested within the ECUAVIDA birth cohort study designed to study prospectively the effects of early-life parasite infections on the development of atopy and allergic diseases.

Notably more than twice number of fungal OTUs 19 were significantly different between AWs and control subjects compared with bacterial OTUs with 7 of them identified as the yeast P kudriavzevii  B.

In particular modulation of the mycobiome has been shown to increase the severity of murine lung inflammation.Moreover antibiotic-induced blooms of Candida species were associated with increased experimental murine lung inflammation.This effect has been shown to be mediated by Candida species-produced prostaglandin E2an arachidonic acid derivative known play an important role in orchestrating immune interactions relevant in asthmatic patients.Among the 19 fungal OTUs associated with the AW phenotype twice as many as the differential bacterial OTUs detected 7 of them corresponded to the yeast P kudriavzevii.

Levels of the fecal short-chain fatty acids acetate and caproate were reduced and increased respectively in the 3-month stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze.Conclusions Our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of atopic wheeze and provide additional support for considering modulation of the gut microbiome as a primary asthma prevention strategy.

A more recent microbiome study in a US pediatric cohort also showed bacterial dysbiosis in 1-month-old infants at high risk of asthma.Interestingly this study also measured the fecal fungal community and found several fungal taxa also involved in the gut dysbiosis associated with asthma.Traditionally not included in microbiome studies fungi are important members of the gut microbiome especially in the first months of lifeSupported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research CIHR and Allergen grants to BFF and the ECUAVIDA cohort by the Wellcome Trust grant 088862Z09Z.
