notably more than twice number of fungal otus 19 were significantly different between aws and control subjects compared with bacterial otus with 7 of them identified as the yeast p kudriavzevii  b. the larger differences in the fungal versus bacterial microbiome were also evident in relative abundance plots of the top 100 most abundant bacterial and fungal taxa organized by genus  a and  a. additionally we found several correlations between bacterial and fungal otus suggesting potential ecologic synergistic and antagonistic associations occurring in the infant gut see in this article's online repository at .given extensive metadata collected in this cohort we captured the effect of the gut microbiome on the atopic wheeze phenotype used as a surrogate for asthma risk while controlling for potential confounding using maaslin.

a more recent microbiome study in a us pediatric cohort also showed bacterial dysbiosis in 1-month-old infants at high risk of asthma.interestingly this study also measured the fecal fungal community and found several fungal taxa also involved in the gut dysbiosis associated with asthma.traditionally not included in microbiome studies fungi are important members of the gut microbiome especially in the first months of lifesupported by the canadian institutes of health research cihr and allergen grants to bff and the ecuavida cohort by the wellcome trust grant 088862z09z.

here we show that bacterial and fungal dysbiosis can be detected in early life in babies who go onto have atopic wheeze in later childhood in a nonindustrialized setting.methodsstudy designwe conducted a case-control study nested within the ecuavida birth cohort study designed to study prospectively the effects of early-life parasite infections on the development of atopy and allergic diseases.

levels of the fecal short-chain fatty acids acetate and caproate were reduced and increased respectively in the 3-month stool samples of children who went on to have atopic wheeze.conclusions our findings support the importance of fungal and bacterial microbiota during the first 100 days of life on the development of atopic wheeze and provide additional support for considering modulation of the gut microbiome as a primary asthma prevention strategy.

notably we found a small yet significant increase in 18s rrna gene copiesin the aw samples  c suggesting that fungi are overrepresented in the gut microbiome of babies who go on to have atopic wheeze.functional microbiome alterations in babies who had atopic wheezeto determine the functional potential of the bacterial dysbiosis detected by using 16s sequencing we predicted the microbiomej allergy clin immunol volume nnn number nnarrieta et al 9metagenome using picrust.

most variables were distributed similarly between the 2 groups with the exceptions of mode of delivery caesarean delivery 37 for aws vs 16 for control subjects p 5 .022 and number of documented acute respiratory tract infections which were more frequent in aws compared with control subjects p 5 .011. there were no significant differences with respect to baseline characteristics between aws included in this analysis and those not included for lack of a 3-month stool sample see in this article's online repository at .bacterial and fungal alterations associated with aw phenotypeas expected the gut microbiome between 3-month-olds in the canadian child study and ecuavida study differed substantially see in this article's online repository at .

by using both statistical approaches it was evident that fungal alterations were more marked than bacterial dysbiosis.because of the strength of the association between the yeastp kudriavzevii and atopic wheeze risk we validated thej allergy clin immunol volume nnn number nnarrieta et al 7fig 2. fungal dysbiosis associated with development of atopic wheeze.

in particular modulation of the mycobiome has been shown to increase the severity of murine lung inflammation.moreover antibiotic-induced blooms of candida species were associated with increased experimental murine lung inflammation.this effect has been shown to be mediated by candida species-produced prostaglandin e2an arachidonic acid derivative known play an important role in orchestrating immune interactions relevant in asthmatic patients.among the 19 fungal otus associated with the aw phenotype twice as many as the differential bacterial otus detected 7 of them corresponded to the yeast p kudriavzevii.

notably qpcr analysis in all the samples detected not only an increase in p kudriavzevii but also an increase in fungi-specific 18s gene copies suggesting also for the first time that fungal overrepresentation in the infant gut microbiome is associated positively with the development of atopic wheeze.

we compared the bacterial and fungal microbiomes and levels of short-chain fatty acids scfas as a measure of bacterial carbohydrate metabolism in fecal samples collected at 3 months and contrasted our findings with those obtained from a canadian cohort.

these findings should be replicated in other human cohorts before considering gut fungal overrepresentation as associated with asthma risk.evidently fungal dysbiosis was more pronounced than bacterial dysbiosis in this study.
