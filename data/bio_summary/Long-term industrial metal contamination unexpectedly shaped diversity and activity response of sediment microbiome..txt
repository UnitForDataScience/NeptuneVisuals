s3 which is coherent with previous observations another phenomenon potentially participating to the increasedrichness at the polluted site is the extra-cellular metal precipitation ability carried by specific bacteria like pseudomonas and bacillus members via metallophores eps biogenic sulphides or calcite these bacteria may be considered as providers of so-called pub- lic goods benefiting the whole community by creating local safe micro-niches for sensitive bacteria to thrive indeed lacto- bacillus members which are present in our sediment communities and in frg2 have this ability to bind and sequester metals pro- viding local safe spots where other sensitive community members could be protected other members from frg2 and frg4 are known to be able to ensure metal removal like clostridium rhodobacter and acinetobacter our results based on frgs strongly suggest that such local microscale facilitation mechanisms could indeed enhance the survival of sensitive andor new comers toward metals contributing to an overall increase in diversity.in relation to this aspect recruitment of new species coming from different inlet sources along the water stream e.g.

s2 and with an overall high beta-diversity similarity level between profiles indeed the permanova on the bray-curtis dissimilarity index with 10 000 permutations  revealed significant but moderate site r2  0.23 p  1.0e-5 and dnarna effects r2  0.14 p  2.9e-4 followed by a minor but sig- nificant interaction between the two factors r2  0.06 p  0.04. no effect of the sampling core was detected indicating overruling site and dnarna effects compared to biological sampling heterogene- ity r2  0.05 p  0.11. nested analyses at the nucleotide level dna vs rna revealed a quasi-similar and significant discrimi- native power for both dna r2  0.36 p  8.2e-3 and rna r2  0.37 p  2.2e-3 in differentiating the two sites.

this is coherent withevenness analysis showing similar shannon index levels between dna and rna profiles  on the other hand the dnarna differences at each site seemed to be more explanatory and sig- nificant at metaleurop r2  0.38 p  2.2e-3 compared to the ferin site r2  0.22 p  0.01. this makes sense as the river dynamic flow between the upstream control site and the downstream polluted one would continuously contribute in maintaining the microbial diversity longitudinally with new inoculum material carried by the water stream proteobacteria was very prominent which is expected in these ecosystems gammaproteobacteria enterobacteri- ales pseudomonadales and aeromonadales clearly dominated all samples  although they significantly dropped in metal contaminated samples table s3 as previously observed con- versely alpha- and betaproteobacteria classes were enhanced in the metal-contaminated sediments table s3 but only alphapro- teobacteria were enriched at the rna level table s4 implying potentially enhanced activity.

it features fresh-water bacteria associated to metal- tolerance like aeromonas and shewanella leadbetterella haliscomenobacter and anaerolinea some were previously iden- tified in metal contaminated sediments and soil like flavobacterium methylobacter and arenimonas some members from sideroxydans thiobacillus or spirochaeta have already been identi- fied as typical slow-growing chemo-autotrophic bacteria reinforcing the idea that the low rna representation might be a characteristic lifestyle feature of this group.the groups characterized as upcoming bacteria were recruited in the polluted site for their obvious tolerance to metals  either under potentially active frg2 or passive frg3 states.

overall these contrasting observations call for better alternatives to investigate and understand the ecology and modalities of microbial adaptation to metals.in the present study we have revisited the sediments from the deule river sites in northern france previously investigated by a metaproteogenomic approach sediments were exposed to long-term metal releases from the industrial site of metaleurop a former foundry operating from 1893 to 2003 in noyelles-godault metal concentrations in these sediments are currently up to 30-fold higher compared to control upstream locations at the sensee canal in ferin.

members from rhizobiales the second dominant phylum in metal-contaminated sediments was firmicutes  as previously described this group is particularly active in metal contaminated sediments and includes mainly known metal- coping bacteria from clostridiales and lactobacilliales bacteroidetes were mainly represented in the passive part of the community and are known to be impacted by metals although often associated with anaerobic niches some mem- bers are affiliated to oxygenated environments like representatives from flavobacterium which were indeed detected here in the oxic upper sediment parts.

one possibility to explain this observation may be linked to the toning down of some dominant sediment gammaproteobacteria members gammaproteobacteria are often characterized as fast growing copiotrophs and some of them like mem- bers from pseudomonas are well-characterized strong competitors aka weed-species prone to dominate nevertheless the effect of metals on pseudomonas members frg5 and also com- petition with better-fitted groups frg3 and 4 supports the idea of a microbial competition for niche occupation.

some active proteobac- terial members were also described as harboring metal-resistant representatives like rhodobacter pseudomonas raoul- tella and acinetobacter the lack of phylogenetic signal inside frg2 and frg3 imply that their adaptive response to metal selection is either due to genetic parallel evolution co- evolutionfacilitation processes or the involvement of horizontal gene transfer via broad host range mobile genetic elementsspread- ing across phylogenetic barriers as previously highlighted with conjugative plasmids fecal-related bacteria frg4 has a pronounced rna represen-tation in the polluted site with a significant phylogenetic relatedness between the main constituting members clostridium and enterobacteriaceae  fig.

presence of clostrid- ium members in polluted and pristine sediments was previously observed likewise for metal-resistance they also have the capacity to form endospores that can at low tempera- ture produce a high amount of rrna which may explain their rna prevalence both clostridium and enterobactericeae are typical bioindicators of fecal contamination in water ecosystems our results suggest that fecal-related microorganisms could tolerate metal pollution in sediments representing an inter- mediate environmental niche where they could potentialy thrive after environmental release from wastewater treatment plants wwtps andor agricultural sources.

identification of slow-growing olig- otrophic microbes in the polluted sediments is supporting this assertion like sphingomonadales members from upcoming bac- teria frg2-3 involved in biodegradation of metal associated compounds moreover other oligotrophic specialists were detected with higher rna prevalence in the metal contaminated sediments including acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and plancto- mycetes fig.
