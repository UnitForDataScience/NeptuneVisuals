S3 which is coherent with previous observations Another phenomenon potentially participating to the increasedrichness at the polluted site is the extra-cellular metal precipitation ability carried by specific bacteria like Pseudomonas and Bacillus members via metallophores EPS biogenic sulphides or calcite These bacteria may be considered as providers of so-called pub- lic goods benefiting the whole community by creating local safe micro-niches for sensitive bacteria to thrive Indeed Lacto- bacillus members which are present in our sediment communities and in FRG2 have this ability to bind and sequester metals pro- viding local safe spots where other sensitive community members could be protected Other members from FRG2 and FRG4 are known to be able to ensure metal removal like Clostridium Rhodobacter and Acinetobacter Our results based on FRGs strongly suggest that such local microscale facilitation mechanisms could indeed enhance the survival of sensitive andor new comers toward metals contributing to an overall increase in diversity.In relation to this aspect recruitment of new species coming from different inlet sources along the water stream e.g.

members from Rhizobiales The second dominant phylum in metal-contaminated sediments was Firmicutes  as previously described This group is particularly active in metal contaminated sediments and includes mainly known metal- coping bacteria from Clostridiales and Lactobacilliales Bacteroidetes were mainly represented in the passive part of the community and are known to be impacted by metals Although often associated with anaerobic niches some mem- bers are affiliated to oxygenated environments like representatives from Flavobacterium which were indeed detected here in the oxic upper sediment parts.

It features fresh-water bacteria associated to metal- tolerance like Aeromonas and Shewanella Leadbetterella Haliscomenobacter and Anaerolinea Some were previously iden- tified in metal contaminated sediments and soil like Flavobacterium Methylobacter and Arenimonas Some members from Sideroxydans Thiobacillus or Spirochaeta have already been identi- fied as typical slow-growing chemo-autotrophic bacteria reinforcing the idea that the low RNA representation might be a characteristic lifestyle feature of this group.The groups characterized as upcoming bacteria were recruited in the polluted site for their obvious tolerance to metals  either under potentially active FRG2 or passive FRG3 states.

Some active Proteobac- terial members were also described as harboring metal-resistant representatives like Rhodobacter Pseudomonas Raoul- tella and Acinetobacter The lack of phylogenetic signal inside FRG2 and FRG3 imply that their adaptive response to metal selection is either due to genetic parallel evolution co- evolutionfacilitation processes or the involvement of Horizontal Gene Transfer via broad host range mobile genetic elementsspread- ing across phylogenetic barriers as previously highlighted with conjugative plasmids Fecal-related bacteria FRG4 has a pronounced RNA represen-tation in the polluted site with a significant phylogenetic relatedness between the main constituting members Clostridium and Enterobacteriaceae  Fig.

Investigating sediment microbiomes represents a good opportunity to understand resistancetolerance adaptation and molecular mechanisms involved with important applications in the field of bioremediation and biostimulation Metal- contaminated sediment bacteria highlighted by previous studies were mainly affiliated to Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Actinobacteria Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria are the essential Proteobacterial classes including respectively microbial members from Burkholderiales and PseudomonadalesXanthomonadales Total microbial biomass activity and phylogeny are the moststudied traits when investigating the response of environmen- tal microorganisms to metals.

One possibility to explain this observation may be linked to the toning down of some dominant sediment Gammaproteobacteria members Gammaproteobacteria are often characterized as fast growing copiotrophs and some of them like mem- bers from Pseudomonas are well-characterized strong competitors aka weed-species prone to dominate Nevertheless the effect of metals on Pseudomonas members FRG5 and also com- petition with better-fitted groups FRG3 and 4 supports the idea of a microbial competition for niche occupation.
