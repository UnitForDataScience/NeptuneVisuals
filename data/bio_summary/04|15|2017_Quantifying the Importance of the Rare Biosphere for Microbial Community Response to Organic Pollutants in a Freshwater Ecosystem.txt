The median sequence depth for each single-copy gene was determined based on the number of reads mapped to a gene cutoffs used length 80 bp and identity 97 divided by the length of the gene reads per base pair.

The representative 16S rRNA gene sequence of this OTU showed 99.6 nucleotide identity to the previously identified Delftia acidovorans strain P4a  which can completely degrade 24-D using its tfd gene clusters contained on a catabolic transposon this sequence was not among the ones recovered in our metagenomic data set.A total of 1157 and 925 OTU were estimated to be present in TPE samples from mesocosms II and III Table S3 which represented an 56.2 and 64.9 reduction in OTU richness compared to that at T  0 respectively.

The results from the 24-D mesocosms are preferentially reported below for simplicity purposes since similar results were largely obtained with the caffeine and 4-NP mesocosms unless noted otherwise.The three replicate mesocosms revealed three distinct 24-D biodegradation profiles.

Thus these gene alleles were not discussed further although several of them increased in abundance during our incu- bation indicating that they might be involved in 24-D biodegradation or the by- products.In addition to tfd genes the cad gene cluster was also enriched during selective growth in all 24-D mesocosms especially in mesocosms II and III .

The relative coverage x axis of genes y axis was calculated by summing the length of all reads mapping on the gene a minimum cutoff for a match of 80 bp alignment length and 97 nucleotide identity was used and dividing it by the length of the gene sequence.

whether the unknownquery sequences clustered with previously characterized reference ones or formed distinct clades instead.Metagenomic reads encoding 16S rRNA gene fragments were extracted using Parallel-Meta version 2.4  with default settings except that the RDP database was used as a reference option -d R. The 16S rRNA gene coding sequences were identified taxonomically using the QIIME pipeline version 1.8.0  with full-length closed-reference operational taxonomic unit OTU picking at 97 nucleotide sequence identity based on the August 2013 Greengenes release 13-5 database.

The tfdA gene abundance in mesocosm DNA estimated by qPCR was calculated by taking the direct gene count from the instrument and factoring in the dilution factor of the DNA assayed the volume of diluted DNA used per reaction 2 ul the total volume of DNA extracted and the volume of sample from which the DNA was extracted as described previously .

The 24-D mesocosms II and III exhibited similar profiles except that enriched genes also included genes encoding proteins involved in phosphate metabolism which might represent a sign of phosphorus limitation in these mesocosms.

Variability was also observed in the 4-NP and caffeine mesocosms albeit degradation profiles were more similar among the three replicate mesocosms in these cases than in the 24-D mesocosms Fig.

The relative abundances of the degraders during the mesocosm incubation were assessed based on the number of metagenomic reads from each sampling point mapping onto their genome sequence at high stringency 99 nucleotide identity excluding the rRNA gene operon which is highly conserved.
