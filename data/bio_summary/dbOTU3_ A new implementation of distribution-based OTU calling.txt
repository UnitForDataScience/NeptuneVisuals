if this kind of computation is efficiently implemented in pythonsequence count information for the case in which the simulated kh2 test and likelihood-ratio test disagree.in this case the simulated kh2 test determines that the otu top row and candidate sequence bottom row are identically distributed but the likelihood-ratio test determines that they are differently distributed both with respect to the threshold p  0.001.likelihood-ratio test at varying p-value thresholds.the likelihood-ratio test perfectly reproduces the results of the kh2 test for a smaller p-value threshold 5 x 10-6. in these comparisons the kh2 test's p- value threshold was fixed at 0.001 and the likelihood-ratio test's threshold was adjusted to intermediate values appearing in the list of p-values the test computed.

among these sequence pairs the levensh- tein metric is slightly better correlated with the true distance than the dbotu2 metric metric .the likelihood-ratio test is fast and mostly reproduces the previous distribution criterionthe likelihood-ratio test used in dbotu3 was markedly faster than the distribution criteria used in dbotu1 and dbotu2 .the likelihood-ratio test also performed similarly to the gold standard kh2 test with 107 sim- ulations.

to check if the likelihood-ratio test would perform better when using a different threshold we varied the likelihood-ratio test's threshold keeping the kh2 test's threshold fixed and computed the new test's accuracy .

this implementation uses a likelihood-ratio test that performed similarly to the simulated kh2 test when using the samevalue threshold and adjusting the threshold for the likelihood-ratio test to twenty-fold smaller perfectly reproduced the criterion emerging from the kh2 test.

an external call to r's chisq.test command with 104 simulations the method of dbotu2 the same r com- mand as for dbotu1 but called using rpy2 and dbotu3's likelihood-ratio test.to evaluate the performance of dbotu3's likelihood-ratio test we compared the p-valuescomputed by this new test against a gold standard the simulated kh2 test with 107 simulations.resultsthe new implementation is faster and performs similarly to the previous onewhen processing this relatively small mock community dataset dbotu3 was also about ten- fold faster than dbotu1 and dbotu2 .

in previous implementations the simulated kh2 test which is computationally demanding was used in place of the asymptotic kh2 test which is not computationally demanding because the asymptotic kh2 test is not accurate when some cells have low counts i.e.

the dbotu2 metric is prone to erroneously asserting that two sequences are too dissimilar to be considered for merging while the dbotu3 metric is prone to erroneously asserting that two sequences are sufficiently similar to be subject to the distribution test and potentially merged.to evaluate the second role of the genetic dissimilarity we computed the correlation between the dbotu metric and the gold standard for sequences pairs that passed the genetic criterion at the default 10 dissimilarity threshold.

the merit of these choices for the genetic and distribution criteria are discussed in the results.methodsnew genetic and distribution criteriathis implementation evaluates the genetic criterion using the levenshtein edit distance a can- didate sequence will not be merged into an otu if 2el1  l2 is greater than some threshold where e is the levenshtein edit distance l1 is the length of the candidate sequence and l2 is the length of the otu's sequence.

each point represents a comparison between a pair of sequences that were subjected to the genetic criterion while running dbotu3 on the mock community data.accuracy of the genetic classification.the genetic similarity metrics used in dbotu2 and dbotu3 were used to classify pairs of sequences as sufficiently genetically similar to be subjected to the distribution criterion.

those points in for which the true dissimilarity is at most 10. ranges are 95 confidence intervals.benchmarks for the speed of the distribution criteria.the time reported is the time required to evaluate the distribution criterion for the 47 otusequence pairs that were evaluated while running dbotu3 on the mock community data.up to this point the p-value threshold for the likelihood-ratio test was fixed at the same value as was used for the gold standard the simulated kh2 test.

the likelihood-ratio test performs best relative to the kh2 test when its p-value threshold is about twenty-fold smaller.discussionthis implementation is overall more user-friendly than previous implementations.

here dissimilar means that the test returned a p-value below the threshold supporting the conclusion that the otu and sequence are distributed differently a similar result means that test returned a p-value above the threshold not contradicting the conclusion that the otu and sequence are distributed similarly.

if the sequences are aligned and contain gaps the gaps are not counted in the denominator.the genetic criterion in dbotu1 was articulated as the minimum of the aligned and unaligned jukes-cantor distances which was a work-around for the fact that using the aligned sequences sometimes led to a greater distance between two sequences than would be computed by comparing the unaligned sequences.the distribution criterion was evaluated using the p-value from the kh2 test of independence as implemented in the chisq.test function in r  which was called in a separate process from a perl script.

the level is the genetic dissimilarity threshold used for the test.

it took unaligned sequences aligned sequences and the sequence count table as input.like dbotu1 dbotu2 used the minimum of the aligned and unaligned genetic dissimi- larities for its genetic criterion.
