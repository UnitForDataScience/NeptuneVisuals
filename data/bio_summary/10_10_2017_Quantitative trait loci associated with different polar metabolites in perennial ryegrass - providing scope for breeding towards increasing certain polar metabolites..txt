The compound with the most num- ber of significant correlations was L-serine which had positive correlations with L-glycine L-aspartate and GABA 0.60 0.52 and 0.54 respectively.QTL detectionThe SNP genetic linkage map used for QTL analysis had a map length of 783 cM and contained 1211 markers Table A further 326 DArT markers were placed on this map between the SNPs with which they had the strongest association as detailed in Table There was a high level of agreement between the DArT ordering from this approach and that in the DArT-only map of .There was good agreement in position between the QTLs detected using the SNP-only map on the popula- tion subset and those detected using the combined SNPand DArT map for most metabolites Tables and QTLs were detected by both methods for L-leucine LG1 L-serine LG3 myo-inositol LG2 and fructose LG3.

This clearly highlights the potential of improving theTable 4 Correlation matrix for the metabolites based on the F2 genotype means on a log scaleCorrelations 0.5 are highlightedTable 5 Identification of quantitative trait loci QTL polar components by interval and rMQM mapping using the SNP map onlyFor each trait the linkage group position on genetic map and nearest genetic marker on genetic map LOD scores means of the three genotype classes mA mH and mB percentage of variation explained and additive and dominance effects with standard errors have been given.

The results presented in this study provide supporting evidence that levels of specific organic acids are genetically regulated and could be exploited in novel breeding programs with the aim of generating novel forage varieties that improve the efficiency of feed utilisation.ConclusionsWe have used a targeted gas-chromatography mass spectrometry GC-MS approach to profile the levels of 25 polar metabolites from different classes sugars amino acids phenolic acids organic acids and other nitrogen- containing compounds present in a large L. perenne F2 population consisting of 325 individuals.

Higher levels of fructose could contribute towards rumen acidosis and the breeding and selection of varieties with decreased levels of fructose constitutes a potential mitigat- ing strategy to control the prevalence of rumen acidosis in dairy cattle.Table 6 Identification of quantitative trait loci QTL polar components by mapping using SNP and DArT data in the full population N  325 with simulation of missing genotype dataFor each trait the linkage group position on genetic map and nearest genetic marker on genetic map LOD scores means of the three genotype classes mA mH and mB percentage of variation explained and additive and dominance effects with standard errors have been given.

In addition a meta-analysis highlighted that crude protein content is the most important dietary factor influencing milk protein synthesis in dairy cows .However studies aiming to map key basal nutrient com- ponents have been largely confined to protein content and sugar and fructan composition with very little attention devoted to polar small molecules including important classes of compounds such as individual amino acids and organic acids.

However free amino acids interact with ruminal bacterial and protozoa communities ex- periencing extensive degradation and modification  Therefore although the levels of free amino acids in the diets of ruminants are unlikely to be nutritionally relevant its presence could have an important effect at microbiome level Interestingly it has been pro- posed that the levels of organic acids such as malate present in ruminant diets could have implications to the rumen microbiome and has been proposed as a strategy for the management of ruminant acidosis  .

In this study we used a targeted gas-chromatography mass spectrometry GC-MS approach to profile the levels of 25 polar metab- olites from different classes sugars amino acids phenolic acids organic acids and other nitrogen-containing com- pounds present in a L. perenne F2 population.

The first analysis used only the 149 out of the total of 325 F2Table 1 Composition of the F2 genetic map grouped by linkage group LG and detailed by number of SNP markers number of non-redundant SNP markers map lengths in cM number of SNP markers per scaffold map length for each of the seven chromosomes based on multiple SNPs and 1 SNP per scaffold and number of DArT markers added per chromosomeLGFull mapMap with one marker per scaffoldDArTgenotypes for which SNP data was available.

Indeed there is evidence that the rumen microbial population contrib- utes greatly to amino acid catabolism which indicates that the majority of amino acid supplementation will not survive ruminal degradation In recent years as the number of identified hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria species have reported it has been hypothesized that the presence of high levels of free amino acids in the diet could benefit these microbial populations Indeed these species are highly specialized in using amino acids as their sole source of energy and cannot utilise proteins as source of energy and as result they are extremely effi- cient in deaminating amino acids leading to the produc- tion of ammonia .
