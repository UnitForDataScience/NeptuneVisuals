the additive and dominance effects and standard errors come from the analysis of the log-transformed data but the genotype means have been back-transformed to the natural scaletolerance of perennial ryegrass to a range of different abi- otic stresses by selecting genetic markers that are involved in the control of the levels of fructose and myo-inositol.genetic locus controlling accumulation of fructans besides having potential involvement in responses to stress fructose is an important carbohydrate in perennial ryegrass.

the objectives of the current study was to compare the efficacy of two mapping approaches mapping with a denser snp map in a subset of the f2 population and mapping with acombined snp and dart map in the full population to test for qtls for polar metabolites several of which had not been previously mapped or reported on in perennial ryegrass.methodsplant material and experimental designthe f2 progeny consisting of 325 genotypes was gener- ated from the cross of two inbred lolium lines as de- scribed by .

higher levels of fructose could contribute towards rumen acidosis and the breeding and selection of varieties with decreased levels of fructose constitutes a potential mitigat- ing strategy to control the prevalence of rumen acidosis in dairy cattle.table 6 identification of quantitative trait loci qtl polar components by mapping using snp and dart data in the full population n  325 with simulation of missing genotype datafor each trait the linkage group position on genetic map and nearest genetic marker on genetic map lod scores means of the three genotype classes ma mh and mb percentage of variation explained and additive and dominance effects with standard errors have been given.

the findings presented in our study indicate that the levels of some free amino acids in perennial ryegrass are genetically controlled and could therefore be valid targets for the development of novel im- proved perennial ryegrass varieties.qtls for organic acidscitric acid is a central metabolite in the krebs cycle and is ubiquitous in the animal and plant kingdoms whereas 2 3-dihydroxypropanoic acid is a key metabol-organic acids as feed additives is unlikely to be economic- ally feasible  however optimising the levels of these compounds in the feed through selecting diets including grasses andor grains with improved levels of organic acids remains a far more achievable strategy.

in- deed a perennial ryegrass genotype that displayed im- proved tolerance to a water-induced stress was found to accumulate increased levels of several compounds includ- ing myo-inositol and fructose the latter with a qtl on lg3 and lg7 compared to the control conditions .
