This can be coupled to both pathological processes and healthy ones.In this review we chose to examine potential associated disorders that may be coupled to the microbiome from the perspective of their bidirectional communication with eukaryotic cells in the gut.

The appearance of similar adaptive phenomena may also be functionally linked to significant dietary alterations.Morphine SystemsFurthermore we surmise the endogenous morphine systems may play a key role in gut gut-brain and bacterial commu- nication.

In summary the literature demonstrates that the microbiome does affect host processes via in all probability common chemical messengers whose appearance and synthesis depends on normal ratios of specific bacteria which can be modified via the microbiome environment e.g.

Finally the potential association of aberrant metabolic and communica- tion processes in the microbiome to the etiology and persis- tence of psychiatric disorders may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies and therapeutic agents directly fo- cused on re-establishing a functionally competent microbiome.ReferencesEsch T Stefano GB Proinflammation A common denominator or initiator of different pathophysiological disease processes.

Resultant adaptive responses of in- trinsic strains of gut microflora appear to mediate necessarychanges which underlie the maintenance of homeostatic co- habitation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic components of the gut.

The gut in the last 1.5 million years has become extensively innervated and highly developed for immune sur- veillance innate immunity as well as neuroimmune com- munications 89.

The veracity of these observations is substan- tiated by another therapeutic treatment which influences gut brain-gut communication e.g.

The manifestation of acute andor chronic psychiatric conditions following antibiotic us- age may provide unique insights into key etiological factorsof major psychiatric syndromes that involve bidirectional com- munication between the microbiome and the brain 3539.
