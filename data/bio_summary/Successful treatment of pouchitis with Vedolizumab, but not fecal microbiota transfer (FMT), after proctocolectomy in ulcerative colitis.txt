The authors describe a case with sustained response to treatment of chronic pouchitis with a single fecal microbiota transfer FMT.

Clinically the patient is now in excellent condition reports about ten daily stools without any abdominal discomfort.Treating suspected dysbiosis by reestablishing homeo- stasis of intestinal microbiota is a successful concept in the treatment of pouchitis given the efficacy of VSL3598Int J Colorectal Dis 2017 32597-598and antimicrobial therapy.

Data on Vedolizumab for treatment of chronic pouchitis is limited.

given the well known dysbalance of microbiota in chronic pouchitis.In our patient a 54-year-old Caucasian male restor- ative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch anastomosis IPAA had become necessary 17 years ago in severe refractory ulcerative colitis.

Our findings are in keeping with a recent report and abstract evaluating eight pa- tients with chronic refractory pouchitis changes in the composition of the microbiome were seen but FMT via nasogastric administration was not effective in achieving clinical response or remission at 4 weeks after FMT .

Following our own encouraging results of FMT in Clostridium difficile colitis we were similarly enthusiastic about this new treat- ment option as Fang et al.
