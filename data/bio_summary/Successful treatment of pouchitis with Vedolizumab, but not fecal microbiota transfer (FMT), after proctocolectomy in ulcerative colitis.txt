pouchitis was first diagnosed in march 2014 and stenosis with chronic inflammation at the outlet of the feeding limb had necessitated balloon dilatation for several times.

chronic inflammatory diseases of the donor and prior antimicrobial therapy in the past 3 months were ruled out.

our findings are in keeping with a recent report and abstract evaluating eight pa- tients with chronic refractory pouchitis changes in the composition of the microbiome were seen but fmt via nasogastric administration was not effective in achieving clinical response or remission at 4 weeks after fmt .

initial experience with new treatment modalities is frequently enthu- siastic and case reports on fmt in ulcerative colitis naturally report better outcomes than randomised trials .
