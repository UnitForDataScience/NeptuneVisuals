IBAT inhibitors decrease the bile acid pool by increasing fecal bile acid excretion which cannot fully be compensated by enhanced bile acid synthesis .

In this review we discuss bile acid signaling and the interplay with the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of obesity type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the role of surgical and pharmacological interventions on bile acid profiles and metabolism.IntroductionObesity and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD see  are increasing dramatically and intense efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms behind these diseases.

One approach to treat and prevent obesity and its related diseases could be to target bile acid signaling by natural semisynthetic or synthetic drugs that bind to bile acid receptors .

Most of the research on bile acid signaling via FXR and TGR5 has been performed in mouse models and interpretation of such studies must be done carefully since bile acid composition differ substantially between humans and mice .

One study demon- strated increased expression of Cyp7a1 in Tgr5-deficient mice that was further induced after cholic acid CA feeding  while another study found a decreased bile acid pool in Tgr5-deficient mice .

Thus bile-acid-related metabolic changes observed in mouse models so far hardly reflect similar changes in bile acid profiles in humans most likely due to the substantial differences in murine and human bile acid composition  .The only study thus far that has demonstrated a positive effect of bile acids on energy expenditure in humans showed that CDCA administered at 15 mgkg body weight for 2 days increased whole body energy expenditure and increased brown adipose tissue activity in 12 healthy women .

These findings indicate that when providing natural bile acids that are agonists for FXR the gut microbial metabolism might in turn generate ligands for TGR5 which may result in unpredictable treatment responses .Of note depletion rather than enrichment of the human bile acid pool might improve glycemic control as suggested from studies using bile acid sequestrants .

Thus the murine bile acid pool has a much lower hydrophobicity than the human one which substantially affects bile acid receptor activation.
