Do gut microbes possess plant hormone metabolic pathways Are these pathways expressed Is there a correlation with human fitness In future research emerging omics data on the human gut microbiota could be exploited to address these questions.Furthermore plant hormones are key signaling compounds between plant and microbes but have not yet been envisaged to act similarly in animal-microbe interactions.

A poorly appreciated fact however is that both microbes and animals produce and perceive plant hormones and their mimics.

This leads us to wonder whether plant hormones could ensure functions in microbes per se as well as in animal-microbe interactions.

On the other commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microbes secrete and mimic plant hormones to alter their hosts and microbial communities .

We propose here that plant hormones acquired from the diet or produced by the human gut microbes impact on human health .

showed that an ABA-enriched fruit diet correlates with increased glucose tolerance .The degree to which gut microbes produce ABA is unclear .

Similarly microbes produce plant hormones to manipulate host plants.

However the production of plant hormones by microbes in the human gut remains unexplored.

Dietary plant hormones impact on human physiology but their influence on the human gut microbiota is unknown and could affect human health.inoculated with wild-type or ABA-deficient microbes would address the role of microbial ABA production in glucose tolerance and diabetes.Salicylic acid SA and derivatives including aspirin are also known to regulate glucose metab- olism .

However these hormones also affect microbes and presumably would further perturb the imbalanced micro- biota of diabetic patients .Inflammatory Disorders Plant Hormones As ImmunomodulatorsSeveral immune disorders are related to the interplay between dietary habits and the gut microbiota .
