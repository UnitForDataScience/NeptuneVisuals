However patients with mild disease may still benefit from NGT delivery whereas patients with severe disease should receive lower endoscopic delivery unless otherwise contraindicated.Conflict of interest statementNone declared.Funding sourcesNone.Appendix A.

which also found a significant difference between NGT and lower endoscopic cure rates however none of these studies compared the two de- livery methods directly .This study included patients with a wide range of disease severity and suggests that sicker individuals may gain greater benefit from lower endoscopic delivery of FMT.

FMT was performed in patients with two or more recurrences or patients withsevere disease refractory to standard therapy.

However this study sample included relatively healthy out- patients and excluded critically ill or immunocompromised patients .

When patients were stratified by illness severity nasogastric delivery achieved similar cure rates in healthier individuals whereas lower endoscopic delivery was preferred for relatively ill individuals.

Nasogastric delivery may be less effective than lower endoscopic delivery however when taking the cost preparation and potential risk into account this difference may not be clinically significant for patients with mild disease.a 2017 The Healthcare Infection Society.

The goal was to determine overall initial efficacy of each de- livery route and to determine which patients would gain the greatest benefit from different delivery methods.MethodsIn this observational prospective follow-up study all pa- tients receiving FMT for CDI via NGT or lower endoscopy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham UAB from 2013 to 2016 were included in the analysis.

No patients in the lower endoscopic group received repeat FMT in the first two weeks.

All patients were adults and the mean age of those receiving FMT by NGT and lower endoscopy was 63.6 and 58.6 years respectively.
