Stool IgA content was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results We found that IgA levels were significantly higher in stool samples from ASD patients than from healthy children p  0.05 Student's t test.Conclusions This finding may suggest the presence of gut immune abnormalities in ASD patients.

In the present study we found that IgA levels were significantly higher in stool samples from ASD patients than from healthy children we believe our finding may suggest the presence of gut immune abnormalities in ASD patients.

Considering that the gut microbiome affects the intestinal immune system and the patient's behavior and that immunoglobulin A IgA is the main antibody secreted by intestinal immune cells we investigated stool IgA content as a means of understanding the gut immune status of ASD patients.

Since the gut microbiome and intestinal immune function are intimately linked these findings suggest that gut disturbances in ASD patients may lead to intestinal immune ab- normalities.

Most studies of GI dysfunction in ASDs have focused on the gut microbiome and abnormalities in its composition have been identified in children with ASDs .The gut contains 70-80 of the body's immune cells  and interactions between the gut mi- crobiota and immune cells can affect the host's behavior via the gut-brain axis .

Previous studies have associated GI disorders in ASD patients with abnormal gut microbiota although few disease- related microorganisms have been identified.

The IgA level in gut can be used as factor to know the Gene x Environment interactions and diagnose of ASDs.Methods We enrolled 43 ASD patients and 31 gender- and age-matched healthy children.

Numerous studies have shown that GI disturbances are strongly associated with abnormalities in the gut mi- crobiome and harmful bacteria and fungi have been reported to be significantly enriched in the GI tracts of ASD patients    .

Given that the abundance of IgA- related bacteria can be used as an indicator of gut pathogen content  this finding may also suggest that intestinal pathogens are more abundant in ASD patients.

Previous studies have shown that the gut microbiota composition differs between ASD patients and healthy children .
