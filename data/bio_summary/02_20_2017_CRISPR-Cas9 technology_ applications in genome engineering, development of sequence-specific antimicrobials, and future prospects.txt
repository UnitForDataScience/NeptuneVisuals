successful targeting.that CRISPR-Cas may act as an adaptive defense system in bacteria.16 Shortly after in 2007 this hypothesis was confirmed experimentally in a study that established that CRISPR-Cas systems from Streptococcus thermophilus indeed operated as an adaptive immune system against lytic phages.17 In 2008 mature CRISPR RNAs crRNAs were shown to act as guides when present in a complex with Cas proteins and this complex was demon- strated to interfere with phage proliferation in E. coli18 and Staphylococcus epidermidis.19 These studies laid the foundation for the use of CRISPR-Cas as a DNA-targeting tool Table 1.This review provides an overview of the origins and biology of CRISPR-Cas and highlights its use as a tool for genome engineering both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms and its potential as a technology to generate selective sequence- specific antimicrobials.

Although the majority of scientific dis- ciplines note the promise of CRISPR-Cas as a groundbreaking new technology for genome engineering it is important to note that the scientific community has expressed concern about the ethical implications of gene editing in humans particularly when thinking about modifying the germline.20CRISPR-Cas components and biological mechanismTo date six types of CRISPR-Cas systems termed I-VI have been identified based on the different molecular mechanisms for nucleic acid recognition and cleavage used by each system.21Here we focus on the biology of the type II CRISPR-Cas system Fig.

For instance transfer of the type II CRISPR-Cas system by genomic DNA transformation into S. pneumoniae led to targeted genome editing.36 A CRISPR-Cas system consisting of two plasmids was also described to edit the genome of E. coli one plasmid encodedtracrRNA and Cas9 and the other expressed the crRNA array.36 Editing of multiple genes in a single step has also been achieved in the genomes of the bacterium E. coli36 and humans32344748 by using customized target recognition sequences composed of 20-nucleotides in a crRNA array.

On the other hand many bacterial species including Escherichia coli lack a NHEJ pathway and thus rely on the cellular homologous recombination system in con- junction with chromosome or plasmid-borne templates to repair DSBs.27 However exceptions to this rule have been found in Bacillus subtilis Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis which have been shown to undergo NHEJ through the KuLigD pathway.27 Interestingly recent work has challenged the notion that CRISPR-based genome targeting is necessarily lethal to bacteria as E. coli was shown to survive genome editing by Cas9.28During repair NHEJ usually re-ligates the lesion in a process that involves the generation of undefined short insertion or deletion indels of several base pairs in a position near the cutting site.29 This often alters the open reading frame of the target gene for example by causing a frame shift and thereforeGenome engineering tools ZFNs TALENs and CRISPR-Cas9Several sequence-specific nucleases were used before the dis- covery of CRISPR-Cas including zinc finger nucleases ZFNs and transcription activator-like effector nucleases TALENs.

Here we review the bacterial origins of CRISPR-Cas describe several applications derived from this technology and discuss the hurdles that need to be tackled in coming years for this tool to become even more useful.Origins of CRISPR-Cas systemsCRISPRs and Cas genes were first described in the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli in 1987.11 However it was not until the year 2000 that more progress was made in the field when Mojica et al.

In addition type II CRISPR-Cas systems have been engineered to allow straightforward RNA-guided genome editing in numerous eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms.1-3 This system has further been repurposed to substantially improve our ability to regulate gene expression.4-10 One of the keys to the system is the unprecedented ability of the Cas9 nuclease to be guided by programmable small RNAs toa Synthetic Biology Group MIT Synthetic Biology Center Research Laboratory of Electronics Department of Biological Engineering Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyCambridge Massachusetts USA.

This CombiGEM-CRISPR approach identified gene pairs that inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth when they were targeted for knockouts along with drug pairs that targeted these same gene pairs and achieved synergistic activity when used together.46 In addition to all these advantages the speci- ficity of CRISPR-Cas technology towards its target sequence in human cells is comparable to that of ZFNs and TALENs42-44 with high efficiency rates B90 and average off target effect rates of B20.As described previously Fig.

This system can also be multiplexed to target more than one gene simultaneously by introducing multiple sgRNAs into the cell.45 This at least in theory should enable the design and construction of genome-wide array libraries containing sgRNAs each of which targets a specific gene in a given genome.

CRISPRa can be used to enhance gene expression by fusing dCas9-sgRNA complexes with transcriptional activator domains that recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter region of the target gene.dCas9 over wild-type Cas9-based genome editing is that it does not require cellular repair pathways such as NHEJ which makes it a suitable technology for difficult-to-engineer microbes.CRISPRi causes gene repression through the ability of the dCas9-sgRNA complex to bind DNA and sterically hinder transcription of the targeted DNA Fig.

Here we review the origins and mechanistic basis of CRISPR-Cas systems discuss how this technology can be leveraged to provide a range of applications in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems and finish by outlining limitations and future prospects.IntroductionThe clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats CRISPR-Cas system is widespread in the microbial world.1 Indeed it is found in 40 of all bacterial species and 90 of archaea.12 However insights into its biological significance as a genetic adaptive immune system against invading DNA elements such as infectious viruses and plasmids have only recently emerged.
