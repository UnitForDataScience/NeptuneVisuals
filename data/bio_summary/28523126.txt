Using mice with specific ablation of TGF-b in CD4 T cells it has been proposed that the autocrine production of TGF-b by CD4 T cells is essential for Th17-cell differentiation.However a recent study revealed that effector CD4 T cells are unable to convert TGF-b into its bioactive formsuggesting that some other cells able to activate the TGF-b are mandatory for Th17-cell differentiation.

T lymphocytes are key effectors of this autoimmunity as mice specifically lacking TGF-bR in T cells develop a similar inflammation to that observed in TGF-b1-deficient animals.It is worth noting that the intestine is not severely affected in these models probably due to the early onset of the autoimmune disease.

Among bacterial products butyrate a Clostridium-derived short-chain fatty acid not only induces TGF-b expression by IECs and potentially helps enforce pTreg-cell differ- entiation but also acts directly on pTreg-cell differentiation by inhibiting histone deacetylase resulting in histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation H3K27ac on CNS1 and CNS2 at high concentrations of butyrate opening the chromatin and leading to the transcription of Foxp3.It is noteworthy that in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis the levels of butyrate and the capacity of Treg cells to suppress effector T cells are reducedwhereas the levels of TGF-b are largely reported to be increased.This could either be due to the increased expression of smad7 in T cells including Tregs from patients with IBD or to different but complementary roles of TGF-b and microbiota-products in pTreg-cell differentiation.

Transforming growth factor-beta controls development homeostasis and tolerance of T cells by regulatory T cell-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Activation of retinoic acid receptor- alpha favours regulatory T cell induction at the expense of IL-17-secreting T helper cell differentiation.

In this review we define the functional impact of transforming growth factor-beta TGF-b on this complex interplay especially through its modulation of the activity of local regulatory T cells Tregs type 17 helper Th17 cells innate lymphoid cells ILCs and B cells.Clinical  Translational Immunology 2017 6 e136 doi published online 7 April 2017INTRODUCTIONThe host colonization by microbiota is a gradual and complex process initiated by the exposure of newborns to the maternal vagina or skin microbiota according to the mode of delivery which fluctuates throughout life due to external and internal factors including dietary habits antibiotic treatments and host diseases.

These animals born and raised under germ-free conditions display a strong decrease in the expression of most cytokines except type 2 cytokines antimicrobial peptides IgA CD4 T cells and B cells.

In response to microbiota- triggered Toll-like receptor TLR activation CX3CR1 myeloid cells overexpress the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-23 and IL-1bwhich in turn induces IL-22 expression by CD4 T cells and innate lymphoid cell 3 ILC3.IL-22 contributes to the gut barrier integrity and can influence the composition of the microbiota by inducing the expression of antimicrobial peptides within intestinal epithelial cellsfiIECs as well as the restoration of mucus production afterlamentous bacteria SFB.
