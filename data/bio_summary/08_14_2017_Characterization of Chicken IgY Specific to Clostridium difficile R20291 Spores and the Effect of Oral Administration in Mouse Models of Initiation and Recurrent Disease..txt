Consequently the opsonization of C. difficile spores with spore-specific antibodies may be conceived as a possible strategy to reduce C. difficile spore-host interactions and C. difficile spore-load in the host.Chicken IgY has several advantages over other immunoglobulins for the development of passive immunotherapy i current regulations of the Federal Drug Administration FDA classifies the oral consumption of IgY as Generally Recognized as Safe GRAS facilitating the regulations for human consumption of pathogen-specific IgY Rahman et al.

From these results we conclude that opsonization of C. difficile spores with anti-spore IgY does not affect spore viability.IgY-Opsonized C. difficile Spores Exhibit Reduced Adherence to Intestinal Epithelial CellsWe evaluated if opsonization of C. difficile spores with anti- spore IgY affects spore adherence to epithelial cells.

These results indicate that acidic purification of full- length IgY did not affect anti-spore IgY titers against C. difficile spores.Saturation and Level of Binding of Anti-Spore IgY to C. difficile SporesNearly 2-10 of IgY has been reported to be antigen specific Kovacs-Nolan and Mine 2004.

Collectively these results indicate that i anti-spore IgY of batch 7245 not only detects immunoreactive proteins of spore extracts but also cross- reacts with proteins of cell lysates and therefore we reasoned that this batch is unsuitable for further experimentationii anti-spore IgY of batch 7246 uniquely recognizes spore-specific antigens and therefore was used for further experimentation.Characterization of the Variability of Binding of Anti-Spore IgY to C. difficile SporesTo further evaluate the specificity of anti-spore IgY of batch 7246 we performed an ELISA to test whether anti-spore IgY cross- reacted against conformational antigens of C. difficile vegetative cells.

As expected a significant immunoreactivity of anti-spore IgY was observed against C. difficile spores Figure 3A by contrast no significant immunoreactivity was evidenced against vegetative cells indicating the absence of cross-reactivity of anti- spore IgY with conformational antigens of vegetative cells.Recent studies demonstrate that C. difficile forms spores with two different morphotypes of the outermost exosporium layer in the same sporulating culture i spores with a thin- exosporium layer and ii spores with a thick exosporium layer Pizarro-Guajardo et al.

Collectively these observations suggest that despite the ultrastructural differences reported in R20291 spores anti- spore IgY binds to both morphotypes with a normal distribution.Opsonization of C. difficile Spores with Anti-Spore IgY Does Not Affect GerminationNext we evaluated whether opsonization of C. difficile spores would affect their germination ability when incubated at saturated concentrations of IgY.

Western blot analysis with pre-immunized IgY revealed absence of immunoreactive protein species in extracts of C. difficile spores and bacterial cells of microbiota from C. difficile infected and non-infected mice Figure 5A.

Based on these results we speculated that oral administration of anti-spore IgY should be specific against C. difficile spores with a minimal impact against murine gut microbiota.Oral Administration of 600 ug of Anti-Spore IgY Prior to C. difficile Spore Infection Prevents Disease Initiation and ReducedC.

Collectively these results suggest that rapid outgrowth of C. difficile occurs after VancomycinIgY treatment leading to recolonization and toxin production in the cecum.No IGG Response to IgY and C. difficile Spores Was Observed in the Mice during the Course of CDI in Initiation and Recurrence ModelWe also analyzed whether IgG against the administered IgY as treatment were raised.

Therefore given that C. difficile spores play an important role in the initiation and persistence of the infection the goal of this study was to evaluate i whether IgY could be specifically raised against C. difficile spores and ii oral administration of anti-spore IgY during initiation and recurrence of CDI.
