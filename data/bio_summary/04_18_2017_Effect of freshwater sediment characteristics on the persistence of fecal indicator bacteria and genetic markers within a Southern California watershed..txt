Two creek reaches were modeled 1 the upper watershed reach which represented a 1000 m stretch between 6500 m and 4800 m where significant reductions in FIB levels were observed during field sampling and which represented an impacted stream segment and 2 a 1000 m stretch within the lower Topanga watershed 3600 me1700 m. Both reaches are located between the town of Topanga and Topanga State Beach a heavily populated recreational site and have the potential to mediate urban inputs from the town of Topanga.The model applied in this study considered the scenario where there is a constant input from an upstream site of 300 MPN 100 mL-1 cENT and 400 copies 100 mL-1 HF183 marker.Initial concentrations in the sediment and water column were set to zero.The elements modeled include time-variant cENT and HF183 marker sediment and water levels.

In the oven-dried sediment microcosms GB3 marker levels increased over time un- til day 3 indicating initial growth of cells followed by stabilization of the GB3 marker at elevated levels.

In the oven-dried sediments levels of the ENT1A marker initially increased in all four sediments and levels were higher on day 21 than on day 0 for sediments collected from Site S2-OD lower Topanga watershed p 0.06 and site C2-OD Medea Creek p  0.05 indicating cell growth.cEC and cENTIn ambient sediments from Site C1 Ballona FW Marsh and S2 Topanga Creek Lower Watershed increased persistence of cEC and cENT was observed compared to all other sites and both cEC and cENT were detectable until day 21.

In the oven-dried sediment micro- cosms cEC levels measured on day 21 were not significantly different from levels measured on day 0 for all four sediments tested.

Sites S2-OD and C2-OD had significantly higher concentra- tions of cENT at day 21 than at day 0 indicating cell growthp  0.05. cENT levels declined after day 3 in Site S3-OD and S4-OD sediment and levels fell below the LOD by day 21 in S3-OD mi- crocosms .Sediment characteristics and decay ratesIndividual MLR models were run for each indicator normalized concentration ln CC0 was regressed over time and sediment characteristic TN P  fines  organic matter reduced microbiota were included as predictor variables.

These levels were consistent with cENT levels measured during the field survey in the lower watershed 450 MPNg-see Supplemental Information Fig.

Nutrient N and P levels and to a lesser extent percent fines and organic matter levels were associated with increased persistence of culturable FIB and the GB3 marker.

Differences in decay due to changing sediment characteristics led to scenarios where cENT was predicted to accumulate in sediment in the lower Topanga Watershed reach at high levels 530 MPN g-1 and stabilize at lower levels 90 MPN g-1 in the upper Topanga watershed reach.
