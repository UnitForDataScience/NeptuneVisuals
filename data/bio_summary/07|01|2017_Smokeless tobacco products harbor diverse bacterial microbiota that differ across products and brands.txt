completed culture-based detection methods on the smokeless tobacco products and showed that the following species were most commonly isolated from the tested products bacillus pumilus bacillus licheniformis bacillus safensis and bacillus subtilis.in this study we also identified several predicted antibi- otic biosynthesis pathways among bacterial communities within the smokeless tobacco products and these functional attributes might play a role in helping the smokeless tobacco microbiota colonize the oral cavity of users.

several bac- terial otus from the corynebacterium genus were also identified in all smokeless tobacco products in our study however further study is needed to evaluate whether specif- ic corynebacterium species as well as other bacterial groups found in smokeless tobacco play a role in tsna generation.our results also showed that varying smokeless tobacco product types differed significantly with regard to their bac- terial microbiotas and the levels of bacteria that could be cultured from each product type.

other smokeless tobacco constituents including bacteria may also contribute to adverse health effects among smokeless tobacco users.

significant differences in both bacterial community composition and in silico predicted gene content were observed between smokeless tobacco prod- uct types and between brands of specific smokeless tobacco products.

these data are useful in order to comprehensively address potential health risks associated with the use of smokeless tobacco products.keywords smokeless tobacco .

in addition we used traditional culture-based methods to provide evidence that bacteria detected in smoke- less tobacco products can be viable thereby highlighting the potentially critical role that these tobacco-associated commu- nities may play in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens such as tsnas and the resulting human health impacts among smokeless tobacco users.materials and methodssamplesa total of 21 smokeless tobacco products were characterized in this study 15 commercially available product brands and 5 handmade products that included 5 toombak samples and 1 alkalinizing agent used to make the toombak.

smokeless tobacco products have been shown to contain tsnas in the range of 5218-90024 ng g-1 of smokeless tobacco product with significant variations be- tween brands richter et al.

the presence of this otu in all smokeless tobacco product types tested in this study could potentially be due to shedding of skin bacteria by workers during the harvesting processing and factory production of these products.as noted above total viable counts of smokeless tobacco were also assessed in this study and our findings demon- strate that viable bacteria are present in the majority of tested products.

however because we 1 used a dna-based se- quencing approach to assess total bacterial diversity across the tested smokeless products and 2 did not perform bac- terial idenfication methods on our total viable count plates we are presently not able to delineate which proportion of bacteria detected with 16s sequencing represents the active and viable bacterial communities in smokeless tobacco products.
