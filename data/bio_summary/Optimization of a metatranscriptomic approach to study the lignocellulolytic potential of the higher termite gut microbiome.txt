previous metatranscriptomic reports high-throughput mrna sequencing highlight the high representation and overexpression of cellulose and hemicelluloses degrading genes in the termite hindgut digestomes indicating the potential of this technology in search for new enzymes.nevertheless several factors associated with the material sampling and library preparation steps make the metatranscriptomic studies of termite gut prokaryotic symbionts challenging.methods in this study we first examined the influence of the sampling strategy including the whole termite gut and luminal fluid on the diversity and the metatranscriptomic profiles of the higher termite gut symbiotic bacteria.

even though both pipelines preserve well the metatranscriptomic profiles originally observed in non-depleted control rna sam- ple enrichment of mrna transcripts during the library preparation reduces the number of unwanted rna reads being sequenced and therefore we strongly recommend the use of the rz pipeline in the context of the higher termite gut symbionts metatranscriptomic studies.diversity of cazymes identified in the metatranscriptomes of the higher termite symbiontsby optimising the termite gut sampling strategy and metatranscriptomic library preparation pipelines we aimed in this study at designing the best methodological framework for an improved metatranscriptomic analysis of the higher termite gut symbionts with a special focus on their lignocellulolytic potential.

the importance of the de novo transcriptome assembly to reconstruct and functionally characterize abundant transcripts originating from the subsidiary species not well represented in the corresponding metagenomic data sets has been already discussed for termite microbiome highly expressed glucose hydrolases were identified solely from the de novo assembled meta- transcriptome and not from the accompanying metagenome  as well as for other environments including microbial communities in the deep sea  and plankton communities inhabiting surface and subpycnocline waters in the case of the higher termite system mainly amplicon-based and metagenomic studies have been ap- plied up to date - so far mrna sequencing has mainly been employed to study the expression profiles of host or lower termite eukaryotic symbionts  the metatranscriptomics of the higher termite gut pro- karyotic symbionts are in their infancy with only one published study one of the reasons might be that eukaryotic poly-a mrna is relatively easier to enrich with oligo-t affinity methods  other hindering factors are the low average ratio of the prokaryotic mrna in comparison to the other bacterial and host rna species e.g.

for the purpose of this study we used the lf rna preparations to evaluate proposed pipelines of bacterial mrna enrichment.efficient enrichment of bacterial mrna in total rna extracts from termite guts is achievable using a combination of commercially available kitsunlike for model organisms such as human mouse or rat there are no commercially available kits specifically opti- mized to target the prokaryotic mrna of the highertermite gut system.

investigated the luminal content of a specific compartment collected after incising the hind- gut with a needle in another study whole termite guts were collected for the amplicon-based characterisa- tion of gut symbionts the use of a whole gut seems proper when the genetic material of interest is further specifically amplified.

while recent meta- transcriptomic reports showed the high representation and overexpression of cellulose and hemicelluloses de- grading gene transcripts in the termite hindgut several factors associated with the material sampling and library preparation make the metatranscriptomic studies of higher termite gut challenging.here we have covered different aspects including the termite gut sampling strategy wg versus lf and the prokaryotic mrna enrichment pipelines me versus rz with the view of optimising the metatranscrip- tomics of the higher termite symbiotic bacteria.

this lack of method- ology might be the primary reason for the scarce meta- transcriptomic reports concerning the higher termite gut symbionts in comparison to their lower termite counter- parts  -.therefore in this study we have evaluated two pipe- lines for an efficient bacterial mrna enrichment from termite gut rna extracts in order to provide the bestwet-lab methodology to encourage metatranscrip- tomic studies of the higher termite bacterial symbionts.

rrna trna short life-time of mrna and the restrictions of the commercially available kits to efficiently enrich for bacterial mrna the latter limitation is particularly important in the case of non-model organisms such as termites which have only two representatives with sequenced genomes the employed sampling strategy of the termite gut e.g.

importantly for the four analysed metatranscriptomes the cog category related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism was the second most highly represented on average 14 - 4 of all mrna reads additional file figure s7 right after cell motility 26 - 10. this result points towards the relatively high expression levels of different cazymes in relation to other mrna tran- scripts present in the metatranscriptome of the higher termite gut symbionts.

the choice between sampling and sequencing the whole termite gut wg luminal fluid lf or separate gut compartments is another factor that should be addressed in order to minimise the co-extraction of unwanted macromolecules e.g.

however while most of the bacterial gut symbionts live freely suspended in the luminal fluid some might be attached to the hindgut wall or food particles  therefore the prokaryote-oriented metatranscriptomic study should be carefully designedto balance between the best sampling strategy providing the true representation of the symbionts diversity and the optimization of the co-extraction of unwanted macromolecules.in this study we aimed at optimizing the framework for an accurate termite gut prokaryote-oriented metatranscrip- tomics that can be further extended to other multi-omics approaches e.g.

statistical analyses were performed using r and r packages vegan  and mass .results and discussionanalyses of the higher termite whole guts and luminal fluid contents provide comparable profiles of bacterial community structures and transcription levels of protein coding genesfor the purpose of the omic studies different sampling strategies have been used to collect termite gut material making the comparison of the insect gut symbiotic communities between the different studies challenging.

they are not onlyfree living in the luminal fluid but may also be attached to the termite gut walls to fibre-material or located inside the intracellular compartments of the endosymbiotic pro- tists in the case of lower termites  .16s rrna amplicon sequencingto reliably interpret the metatranscriptomic results we first investigated the impact of the termite gut sampling strategies here the use of the whole termite guts versus the luminal fluid extracts.

the presented methodological approach has great potential to enhance metatranscriptomic studies of the higher termite intestinal flora and to unravel novel carbohydrate-active enzymes.keywords carbohydrate-active enzymes cazymes isoptera metatranscriptomics microbiome mrna enrichment termite gut correspondence 1luxembourg institute of science and technology 41 rue du brill l-4422 belvaux luxembourgfull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec the authors.
