In about 20 of patients the presence of diverticula give rise to illness ranging from a syn- drome characterized by recurrent abdominal symptoms- pain bloating and changes in bowel habits in the absence of macroscopically evident signs of acute inflammation - defined as symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease SUDD to an acute inflammation of colonic diverticula defined as acute diverticulitis1Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery Federico II University of Naples Naples Italy2Sofar S.p.A.

In addition we showed a different response of the colonic mucosa of these patients to infectious stimuli and a role of the probiotic LCDG in preventing these effects.NO is an important mediator of direct and indirect smooth muscle relaxation of the wall bowel.17 NO is also involved in gut inflammation and in the antibac- terial response.18 Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in endogenously NO-mediated responses in patients with diverticulosis19 and abnormal nitrergicactivities and an alteration in NOS activity in the gut of patients with SUDD.2021 Longitudinal muscle shows abnormal relaxation responses to NO and contains altered levels of iNOS in uncomplicated DD.21While previous studies usually focused their atten- tion only on a single set of patients--those with diver- ticulosis rather than patients with SUDD or previous AD--in our first set of experiments we sought to deter- mine whether an increase in the severity of the disease matched an increase in the iNOS expression and NO release from the colonic mucosa of patients with a dif- ferent grade of DD.

The differences in iNOS expression and NO release between diverticulosis and SUDD patients are unclear but as proposed by other authors it may be due to a different and altered nitrergic neuro-muscular transmission in these two subsets of patients1921 where other than iNOS nNOS also has a major role in pro- ducing NO.Considering that colonic mucosa of CTRLs and patients showed basal differences in expression and release of NO-related mediators and that changes in gastrointestinal microflora are hypothesized to influ- ence the etiology of DD2425 we asked whether the colonic mucosa of these patients also had a different ''sensitivity'' toward pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria stimuli.

Conversely when EIEC and LCDG were added at the same time iNOS expression was significantly decreased compared toEIEC stimulation -1.73-fold decrease vs EIECpNS Figure 3d.In all participants analyzed LCDG alone did not significantly modify iNOS expression data not shown.Effect of bacteria stimulation on NO releaseIn CTRLs EIEC stimulation significantly increased NO release Figure 4a.

S100B NO release and iNOS expression were then evaluated.Results Basal iNOS expression was significantly increased in SUDD and SUDD AD patients.

In fact it is known that while NO is physiologically released on demand for short periods of time following activation of constitutively expressed endothelial NO synthase eNOS or neuronal NO synthase nNOS iNOS expression is induced only after cell activation and produces NO for long periods of time in a patho- physiological inflammatory context.22 Our data match previous reports that show that the immune cell infil- trates in colonic mucosa are increased according to dis- ease severity.23The presence of this inflammatory gradient appears further confirmed by the analysis of basal cytokine release from the colonic mucosa of our patients.

In SUDD AD basal NO expression was significantly increased compared to CTRLs  7.77-fold increase vs CTRLs p  0.05 Figure 1b.Because in previous works the enteroglial-derived S100B protein expression has been linked to NO release we analyzed whether S100B was differently released in CTRLs and case individuals.

The level of statistical significance was set at p  0.05.ResultsBasal levels of the iNOS expression and release of NO S100B and cytokinesIn diverticulosis patients iNOS expression was increased compared to CTRLs but not to a significant extent Figure 1a.

When LCDG was added before and after EIEC no significant changes in iNOS expression were observed Figure 3a but when LCDG was added atthe same time as EIEC we observed a significant reduc- tion of iNOS expression compared to that induced by EIEC alone -1.50-fold decrease vs EIEC p  0.05 Figure 3a.In patients with diverticulosis EIEC significantly increased iNOS expression  2.86-fold increase vs basal p  0.05 Figure 3b.

When LCDG was added to biopsies before after or together with EIEC iNOS expression results were significantly decreased compared to EIEC stimulation -1.59- -1.79- and 1.61-fold decrease vs EIEC respectively p  0.05Figure 3b.In SUDD patients iNOS expression was signifi- cantly increased by EIEC stimulation th2.14-foldFigure 3. iNOS expression in patients and healthy individuals after bacteria stimulation.
