in about 20 of patients the presence of diverticula give rise to illness ranging from a syn- drome characterized by recurrent abdominal symptoms- pain bloating and changes in bowel habits in the absence of macroscopically evident signs of acute inflammation - defined as symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease sudd to an acute inflammation of colonic diverticula defined as acute diverticulitis1department of clinical medicine and surgery federico ii university of naples naples italy2sofar s.p.a. trezzano rosa italycorresponding authorrosario cuomo department of clinical medicine and surgery federico ii university hospital school of medicine via s. pansini 5 building 6 80131 napoli italy.email ad with its typical complications abscesses stenoses fistulas perforations.4despite the significant burden of the pathology the pathogenesis is poorly understood and several etiological factors may play a role in the onset of this disease.5-7recently changes in the intestinal microbiota have been involved in the pathogenesis of symptoms and related acute inflammation.8 moreover various studies pointed out the role of the enteric nervous system ens in the pathophysiology of dd.7in a recent study by our group in a context of intes- tinal inflammation together with an increased indu- cible nitric oxide no-synthase inos expression and no release we observed an increased release of s100b a protein specifically expressed and released by enteric glial cells egcs.9 previously we demon- strated that the intestinal mucosa of patients with celiac disease and ulcerative colitis was more ''sensi- tive'' to pro-inflammatory and infectious stimuli than unaffected mucosa and that egcs participated in the modulation of mucosal no production via s100b over- expression and release.1011 similarly alteration in the ecgs-mediated inflammatory pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of dd.egcs are able to interact with bacteria and discriminate between pathogens and probiotics via different toll-like receptors expression and no production.12 this different response of ecgs and the beneficial role of probiotics against the gut inflammation sustain the hypothesis of a role of probiotics in the modulation of inflammatoryresponses in dd induced by pathogen bacteria.rrange 59-77 10 patients with sudd three women mean age 63 range 44-92 10 patients with sudd ad two women mean age 60 range 31-77 and 10 people without gastrointestinal diseases six women mean age 53 range 33-75 who served as con- trols ctrls.

moreover we evaluated potential differences in terms of basal release of inflammatory mediators and whether lcdg is able to modulate the inflammatory response.materials and methodspatientsbiopsies were collected during endoscopy in 40 con- secutive individuals divided as follow 10 patients with diverticulosis three women mean age 70 yearsbacterial strainsenteroinvasive escherichia coli eiec atcc rockville md usa was chosen for its deleterious effects on the gastrointestinal tract15 while l. casei dgr lcdg lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-1572 enterolactisr sofar s.p.a. trezzano rosa milan italy deposited by sofar at institute pasteur of paris with number i1572 was chosen for its probiotic effects.14 bacteria were cultured and stocked as previously reported.12outline of the experimentsbiopsies were treated as shown in table 1 and super- natants were collected and biopsies were put in a radio- immunoprecipitation assay ripa buffer lonza both were stored at -80oc for subsequent determinations.protein extraction and western immunoblot analysiswestern blots were performed and analyzed as previ- ously described.12 antibodies used were rabbittable 1. outlines of experiments.h hours eiec enteroinvasive escherichia coli lcdg lactobacillus casei dgr.anti-inos 1500 volvol dilution santa cruz biotechnology santa cruz ca usa or mouse anti- a actin 11000 vv santa cruz.no quantificationno was measured as previously described.12enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa for s100belisa for s100b biovendor rd brno czech republic was carried out on biopsies supernatants according to the manufacturer's protocol.statistical analysisstatistical analysis was performed with analysis of vari- ance anova and multiple comparisons with bonferroni's test.

when lcdg was added to biopsies before after or together with eiec inos expression results were significantly decreased compared to eiec stimulation -1.59- -1.79- and 1.61-fold decrease vs eiec respectively p  0.05figure 3b.in sudd patients inos expression was signifi- cantly increased by eiec stimulation th2.14-foldfigure 3. inos expression in patients and healthy individuals after bacteria stimulation.

the differences in inos expression and no release between diverticulosis and sudd patients are unclear but as proposed by other authors it may be due to a different and altered nitrergic neuro-muscular transmission in these two subsets of patients1921 where other than inos nnos also has a major role in pro- ducing no.considering that colonic mucosa of ctrls and patients showed basal differences in expression and release of no-related mediators and that changes in gastrointestinal microflora are hypothesized to influ- ence the etiology of dd2425 we asked whether the colonic mucosa of these patients also had a different ''sensitivity'' toward pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria stimuli.

rather in patients with diverticulosis when lcdg was added before eiec we observed a significant reduction in no release -2.35-fold decrease vs eiec p  0.05 figure 4b.in sudd ad basal no release was higher com- pared to other groups figure 4d.

in addition we showed a different response of the colonic mucosa of these patients to infectious stimuli and a role of the probiotic lcdg in preventing these effects.no is an important mediator of direct and indirect smooth muscle relaxation of the wall bowel.17 no is also involved in gut inflammation and in the antibac- terial response.18 previous studies have demonstrated an increase in endogenously no-mediated responses in patients with diverticulosis19 and abnormal nitrergicactivities and an alteration in nos activity in the gut of patients with sudd.2021 longitudinal muscle shows abnormal relaxation responses to no and contains altered levels of inos in uncomplicated dd.21while previous studies usually focused their atten- tion only on a single set of patients--those with diver- ticulosis rather than patients with sudd or previous ad--in our first set of experiments we sought to deter- mine whether an increase in the severity of the disease matched an increase in the inos expression and no release from the colonic mucosa of patients with a dif- ferent grade of dd.

although the exact mechanisms of action exerted by the probiotic are unclear the observation that lcdg appears effective in decreasing eiec-induced inos expression and no release further support previous reports indicating pro- mising effects of probiotics' use in dd.13in recent years various studies found an association between distinct abnormalities of the ens and egc and the disturbed motility patterns underlying dd.

when we analyzed the effects of bacteria stimulation on cyto- kines release in patients affected by every degree of the pathology our data were characterized by a highfigure 1. basal inos expression and no and s100b release in patients and healthy individuals.
