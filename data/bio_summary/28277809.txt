A vaccine can prevent episodes of MDD as well as being safe and well tolerated in the long term.The intestinal microbiota has been found to modulate anxiety-like behavior in rodents  but a literature search PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov found no vaccine tested in animal models of anxiety or undergoing clinical trials in anxi- ety disorders.Taken together all the above arguments motivated us to explore the plausibility of a vaccine against MDD or anxiety disorders.What is a vaccine against depression or anxietyThe term 'vaccination' was originally coined a long time ago to characterize the immunization against smallpox and usually refers to the administration of an antigenic material to stimu- late adaptive immunity to a pathogen .

Therefore the development of a vaccine against depression or anxiety likely requires the previous identification of microorganisms suscep- tible to induce MDD or anxiety disorders in humans.Depression or anxiety induced by microorganismsEnteric bacterial pathogensLyte et al.

Mono-association with Blautia Clostridium coc- coides the most dominant inhabitant of the human gut reduced the anxiety level .ConclusionsThe plausibility of a vaccine against anxiety or depression requires the previous identification of the microorganisms susceptible to induce such mental disorders.

Therefore the term 'vaccine' does not apply to the 'Internet-based behavioral vaccine' developed to prevent adolescent depression  or to the anesthetic and antidepressant agent ketamine which was proposed as a 'vaccine for depression' .Reber et al.

These and other emerging concepts regarding periodontal vaccine development could be of help in the search for a vaccine against some inflammatory forms of MDD.A biological preparation 'vaccine' could be prepared with the microbial candidates suggested by current  and future studies and then tested in patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels a marker of inflammatory forms of MDD.

Expert opinionThe discovery of new medicinal agents is a 'show me' situation and no data were found in the literature showing therapeutic efficacy of a vaccine in MDD or anxiety disorders.

A PubMed search found no vaccine tested in animal models of depression.

gov register found only one clinical trial of a vaccine tested against depression NCT01533285 last accessed 6 October 2016.
