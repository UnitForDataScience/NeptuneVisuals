thus the joint effect of alcohol and tobacco use on the increased risk of oscc relies on strong biological plausibility.microbiota and ocrecent epidemiological studies provide evidence of the existence of a complex microbial community in the distal human oesoph- agus made up of approximately 140 bacterial species groupedm.matejcic et al.

novel findings in this direction would allow the discovery of novel susceptibility variants that could potentially be used to estimate the causal role of alcohol intake through mendelian randomization.although the gwas approach has unveiled many snps asso-ciated with oscc there might be yet unidentified risk loci that could influence greatly the risk of the disease through changesm.matejcic et al.

since alcohol consumption is a modifiable factor findings from these studies could also be used to promote changes in alcohol consumption behaviour and reduce the incidence of the disease in the general population.supplementary materialsupplementary data are available at carcinogenesis online.fundingthis work was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the international agency for research on cancer partially sup- ported by the european commission fp7 marie curie actions- people-cofunding of regional national and international programs cofund.acknowledgmentthe authors gratefully acknowledge dr veronique chajes for her contribution in the revision of the manuscript.conflict of interest statement none declared.referencesferlay j. et al.
