Given their key role in C. difficile pathogenesis testing for the presence of toxins A and B is one of the methods used in conjunction with clinical signssymptoms to confirm C. difficile infection CDI with others including tests for C. difficile or its genes .In contrast to asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile a CDI can have varying clinical manifestations ranging from mild diarrhoea to colitis and may also include complica- tions such as toxic megacolon bowel perforation and even death  .

Deeks1Published online 1 September 2017c Springer International Publishing AG 2017Abstract Bezlotoxumab ZinplavaTM is a fully human monoclonal antibody against Clostridium difficile toxin B indicated for the prevention of C. difficile infection CDI recurrence in patients with a high recurrence risk.

Further preclinical data indicate that damagesloughing of the gut epithelium mediated by C. difficile toxins during CDI may allow sys- temic anti-toxin antibodies such as bezlotoxumab to enter the gut and neutralize the C. difficile toxins within .Despite mixed findings in animal models of CDI   bezlotoxumab administered as a single intra- venous 10 mgkg infusion reduced CDI recurrence in adults in two phase 3 trials MODIFY 1 and 2 Sect.

Notably CDI-associated morbidity and mor- tality has increased globally in recent years due to the emergence of hypervirulent C. difficile strains particularly ribotype 027 also referred to as BINAP1  and a CDI that is mild or moderate can rapidly become fatal without prompt treatment .The mainstay treatment for CDI is antibacterial therapy with agents such as metronidazole vancomycin and fidax- omicin with the exact regimen and formulation depending on the CDI severity   .

Recommended treatment options for recurrent CDI include the same antibacterials used for primary infections    with faecal microbiota transplantation FMT also a recommended option for per- sistent recurrence in the most recent guidelines   how- ever optimal management approaches for CDI recurrence remain unclear and the proportion of patients experiencing multiple recurrence events continues to rise .Humoral immunity against C. difficile toxins plays an important role in protecting against primary symptomatic CDI and recurrence  providing rationale for the development of therapeutic anti-toxin antibodies for use in this setting.
