the composition of the microbiota among infants in this study is likely to differ considerably from that of infants in high- income countries 12. given the poor seroconversion rates observed in this trial 31 it is possible that all infants harbored a bacterial community structure inhibitory to rv1 replication.our findings are at odds with a recent study of rv1 in ghana wherein infants who seroconverted exhibited a lower abundance of bacteroidetes a higher abundance of bacteria related to streptococcus bovis and a microbiota composition closer to that of dutch infants compared with non-seroconverters 39. the authors of that paper speculate that bacteria related to s. bovis may be more immunostimulatory than those in the bacteroidetes phylum potentially acting as an adjuvant to the rotavirus vaccine.however we observed no significant differences in microbiota composition including streptococcus abundance according to rv1 seroconversion and greater abundance of bacteroidetes at 10 weeks of age among rotavirus shedders.

1.other enteropathogens were generally more common in rv1 responders than non-responders at 6 weeks  a although no individual comparisons of prevalence or abundance were significant after fdr adjustment supplementary table 1. combining across tac targets 1 enteropathogen excluding eaec enterovirus and rotavirus was observed in 56156 36 responders and 37157 24 non- responders at 6 weeks kh2 p  .017. this discrepancy can be attributed primarily to bacterial pathogenswhich were more common in rv1 responders than non-responders 40156 26 vs 21157 13 excluding eaec kh2 p  .006. these differences were no longer apparent at 10 weeks b. theprevalence of viral enteropathogens other than enteroviruses and of eukaryotic enteropathogens did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders at either dose.we detected up to six pathogens per sample with an average of 1.6 sd 1.0 and 1.8 sd 1.0 at 6 and 10 weeks respectively.

introductioneach year an estimated 215000 children die of severe gastroenteritis associated with rotavirus infection including between 47000 and 79000 in india 1 2. although two internationally-licensed oral rotavirus vaccines rotarix rv1 and rotateq are currently available their efficacy is impaired in low-income countries 3. mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon remain uncertain but may include maternal antibodies histo blood group antigen phenotype malnutrition environmental enteropathy and interference by enteric infections 4 5 6 7. in a systematic review of oral poliovirus vaccine opv trials we observed a reduction in the odds of seroconversion and vaccine virus shedding among individuals infected with non-polio enteroviruses npevs 8. similarly during a recent study in bangladesh enterovirus quantity at the time of immunization was negatively correlated with the immunogenicity of both opv and rv1 9.the composition of the bacterial microbiota may also shape response to oral vaccines.

we extracted dna and rna from 200 mg of the 6- and 10-week pre-vaccination stools from each infant and assessed the presence of 40 enteropathogen targets via real-time reverse transcription pcr rt-pcr using taqman array cards tacs 17 18. a threshold cycle ct value of 35 was used as a cut-off for pathogen detection 17. enterovirus-positive samples were assessed for the presence of sabin polioviruses using multiplex rt-pcr 19. to assess rv1 replication or 'take' we quantified rotavirus shedding in samples collected pre-vaccination indicative of natural rotavirus exposure and 4 and 7 days after the 6-week dose using a vp6-specific real-time rt-pcr assay 20 21.characterization of the intestinal microbiota by 16s rrna gene sequencingour laboratory and bioinformatic pipelines for assessment of the bacterial microbiota have previously been described 22. we amplified the 16s rrna gene v4 region using primers 515f 5'- gtgccagcagccgcggtaa-3' and 806r 5'-ggactaccagggtatctaat-3' in dna extractedfrom stool samples collected at 6 and 10 weeks of age in each infant.

it is worth noting however that the association between bacterial pathogens and rv1 response was contingent on the exclusion of eaec which we omitted from primary comparisons because of its high prevalence and limited association with diarrhea during previous studies in resource-poor settings using tacs 28. irrespective of whether eaec was included our findings do not support the view that bacterial pathogens impair the immunogenicity of rv1 - a conclusion consistent with recent findings from bangladesh 9.infants who shed rotavirus after their 6-week rv1 dose exhibited a higher prevalence of enteroviruses at the time of vaccination.

finally co-administration of opv may have obscured a role for other enteric viruses particularly npevs in shaping rv1 immunogenicity.further study among infants receiving inactivated poliovirus vaccine rather than opv would allow the significance of npevs for rv1 immunogenicity to be tested.overall our findings support a modest inhibitory effect of co-administered opv on the first dose of rv1.

viruses exploit microbiota-derived compounds to replicate efficiently in the intestinal mucosa as evidenced by the reduced pathogenicity of poliovirus and rotavirus in antibiotic-treated mice 10 11. significant geographic variation occurs in the composition of the infant microbiota 12 13 which may in turn contribute to discrepancies in vaccine performance.we carried out a nested case-control study among infants enrolled in a clinical trial of rv1 immunogenicity in india 14. herein we tested the hypothesis that failure to seroconvert would be associated with an elevated pathogen burden and an altered bacterial microbiota composition.2.

these discrepancies may reflect differences in methodology next-generation sequencing versus microarray or baseline microbiota composition and highlight the difficulties that are likely to be faced in identifying mechanistic links between the intestinal microbiota and oral vaccine outcome using observational data.the administration of probiotics had a minimal impact on the intestinal microbiota of these infants as illustrated by the failure of random forest models to accurately distinguish infants by study arm when theotu corresponding to the probiotic strain was omitted.

pathogen prevalence over successive doses compared with infants clear of enteropathogens at both 6 and 10 weeks we observed a significant increase in the odds of seroconversion when 1 pathogen excluding eaec enterovirus and rotavirus was present at both doses or 2.25 95 ci 1.15-4.41 e - an effect that was absent among individuals infected at only one dose or 0.91 95 ci 0.55- 1.50. a similar trend was apparent when considering only bacterial pathogens or 1.32 95 ci 0.76-2.31 and or 1.98 95 ci 0.93-4.23 in association with the presence of 1 bacterial pathogen excluding eaec at one or both doses respectively.association between enteropathogen burden and rv1 takerotavirus shedding at 100 copies per reaction at 4 andor 7 days following the first dose of rv1 was observed in 66278 24 per-protocol infants with complete samples and no pre-vaccination shedding supplementary fig.

this observation is consistent with an inhibitory effect of opv on rv1 although we observed no inhibitory association between the immunogenicity of these vaccines after two doses 37. given their potential to interfere with opv 8 the presence of pathogenic bacteria at 6 weeks of age may perhaps have enhanced rv1 immunogenicity by inhibiting the replication of co-administered sabin viruses.

4 weeks later was lower in rotavirus shedders than non-shedders 3965 60 vs 166210 79 kh2 p  .014 c - a trend that was also evident among sabin viruses 2964 45 vs122209 58 kh2 p  .066. nonetheless after two doses rotavirus seroconversion did not differ by type 3 poliovirus seroconversion status 146447 33 seroconverted among poliovirus sero-responders and26103 25 among non-responders kh2 p  .143. poliovirus shedding at 10 weeks was significantly lower among individuals shedding poliovirus at 6 weeks d.association between bacterial microbiota composition and rv1 outcomewe obtained an average of 25254 sd 13091 sequences per sample encompassing 153 otus.

5. infants who shed rotavirus 4 andor 7 days after the 6-week rv1 dose harbored a greater number of otus before vaccination linear regression p  .007 d.we also observed a significant difference in pre-vaccination microbiota composition according to sheddingstatus based on unweighted unifrac adonis p  .032 e but this accounted for a very small proportion of the variance among samples r2  0.012. rotavirus shedding was not associated withmicrobiota stability between 6 and 10 weeks supplementary fig.

8. prior rotavirus exposure inferred by the presence of rotavirus-specific serum iga at baseline has been linked with impaired rv1 immunogenicity in several previous studies 6 38. here iga seropositivity at baseline was negatively correlated with dose 1 shedding but not with seroconversion after two doses.we observed no differences in the composition or stability of the bacterial microbiota according to rotavirus seroconversion status.

4c nor did we observe any differences in pre-vaccination taxon abundance between shedders and non-shedders non-parametric t test fdr- corrected p values .15. at 10 weeks a modest enrichment of the phyla bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia was observed among infants who shed rotavirus following the 6-week rv1 dose supplementary table 6.random forest models based on otu abundance data failed to accurately predict rotavirus seroconversion mean accuracy 43.4 and 45.7 at 6 and 10 weeks respectively baseline accuracy 50.6 p values.05 but showed modest predictive accuracy for shedding after dose 1 mean accuracy 60.3 and 60.8 based on otus measured at 6 and 10 weeks respectively baseline accuracy 50.0 p  .038 and .040 supplementary fig.

baseline characteristics were comparable between responders and non-responders .in a subset of 170 infants that had been assessed for enteropathogen burden including 85 responders we sequenced the 16s rrna gene v4 region in stool samples collected before each rv1 dose to assess theintestinal bacterial microbiota.
