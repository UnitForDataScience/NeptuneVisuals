At 10 weeks a modest enrichment of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia was observed among infants who shed rotavirus following the 6-week RV1 dose Supplementary Table 6.Random Forest models based on OTU abundance data failed to accurately predict rotavirus seroconversion mean accuracy 43.4 and 45.7 at 6 and 10 weeks respectively baseline accuracy 50.6 P values.05 but showed modest predictive accuracy for shedding after dose 1 mean accuracy 60.3 and 60.8 based on OTUs measured at 6 and 10 weeks respectively baseline accuracy 50.0 P  .038 and .040 Supplementary Fig.

The prevalence of mixed infections did not differ significantly according to seroconversion status at 6 or 10 weeks kh2 P values .05 nor did total pathogen count Wilcoxon's ranksum P values .05 C and 1D.

Their prevalence did not differ significantly according to seroconversion status Supplementary Table 1 although enterovirus abundance was greater among responders than non-responders at 6 weeks Ct 29.5 - 4.5 mean - standard deviation SD vs 31.0 - 4.1 Wilcoxon's rank sum FDR-corrected P  .042.

4 or taxon relative abundance non-parametric t test FDR-corrected P values .15 Supplementary Table 5 according to seroconversion status and no significant clustering of samples based on Unifrac distances adonis P values .05 C Supplementary Fig.

Nonetheless after two doses rotavirus seroconversion did not differ by type 3 poliovirus seroconversion status 146447 33 seroconverted among poliovirus sero-responders and26103 25 among non-responders kh2 P  .143.

Across the 6- and 10-week doses we assessed the association between the number ofdoses in which 1 enteropathogen was present 0 1 or 2 and rotavirus seroconversion via logistic regression.Type 3 poliovirus seroconversion rate was compared according to rotavirus seroconversion status using the kh2 test as was the prevalence of dose 1 rotavirus shedding.

We observed 1 enteropathogen excluding EAEC enterovirus and rotavirus at either 6 or 10 weeks in 70154 45 non-responders and 78155 50 responders odds ratio OR 1.22 95 CI 0.78-1.90.Secondary outcomesEAEC and enteroviruses were the predominant TAC targets at 6 and 10 weeks A and 1B.

Combining across TAC targets 1 enteropathogen excluding EAEC enterovirus and rotavirus was observed in 56156 36 responders and 37157 24 non- responders at 6 weeks kh2 P  .017.

Concurrent diarrhea was documented in 5 of individuals at 6 and 10 weeks this proportion did not differ between responders and non-responders at either dose kh2 P values.05.3.2.1.

We observed no association between intestinal bacteria eukaryotes mixed infections concurrent diarrhea or pathogen count at 6 weeks and the prevalence of shedding P values .05 A Supplementary Table 3.
