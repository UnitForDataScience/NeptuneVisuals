This is in line with reports of a much greater role of gut microbiota on health and reactivity of our immune system and also that the food can influence the diversity of gut microbiota within short periods of time .We also observed differences in isolated primary cell stress response depending on acute stress levels animals were exposed to just before starting of the experiments.

Sys- temic immune responses consistent with increased extra- intestinal commensal exposure were observed in humans with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and patients with terminal liver failure are reported to most commonly die as a result of an over- whelming infection that is caused by commensal bacteria .The hypothesis can be tested through stress responses of vari- ous isolated primary cells based on differences in animal nutrition and through reactivity of immune system by following cytokines and other reactive molecules in the same strain of animals with different microbiomes.

The human gut virome inter-individual variation and dynamic response to diet.

The effect of diet on the human gut microbiome a metagenomic analysis in humanized gnotobiotic mice.

The consequence is that they have lower variability of their microbiota than would their wild type counterparts.Upon studying apoptosis triggering in primary rat liver cells hepatocytes we have observed the quantitatively different cell responses that correlated with the animal batch andor modifica- tion of their diet.

The differences observed in the cohorts of mice seemed far beyond the immune system development and response as the expression data of the top 400 genes upregulated in pet store mice were found also highly significantly enriched in the human adult expression data.

As physiological responses of models seem to highly depend on the breeding conditions microbiome nutrition and stress levels should be systematically recorded and taken into account to ensure that the experimental models better resemble human phys- iological responses.DiscussionThe human body contains ten times the number of bacteria compared to its own cells and ten times more viruses than bacteria .

It was reported that stress was common in caged mice .These factors have to be taken into consideration especially when investigating stress responses as they can alter cell signaling and gene expression which can influence the physiological responses of the models we're investigating.

Furthermore the physiology of primary cells from different strains of animals with the same microbiome could be evaluated as well as whether the changes in diet only influences different short term responses or does a dietary change in a specific period of life also have long term consequences.Changes of cell physiology may go beyond the studies of stress responses.
