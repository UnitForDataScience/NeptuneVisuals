as part of the kluane red squirrel project every red squirrel in the population has been continuously monitored in each year since 1987 and multiple environmental and host factors were recorded including age sex territory membership diet- ary composition and genetic relatedness red squir- rels live in a strongly seasonal environment where recurrent seasonal fluctuations in their diet can be care- fully tracked using behavioral observations both fe- male and male red squirrels defend exclusive territories year round and thus spend most of their time in solitude as such red squirrels represent a unique and at- tractive system to study the effect of dispersal limitation on gut microbial diversity because unlike human and other wild animals studied so far red squirrels generally remain on their exclusive territory after settlement and have very limited social interactions although they do leave their territory for mating and to pilfer food from neighbors in addition females raise young in the absence of any paternal care making it possible to differentiate host genetics from maternal effects on gut microbiota.in this study we tested the hypothesis that red squirrel gut microbiota are strongly influenced by seasonal diet variation.

interestingly but not surprisingly most of the hub species belonged to the core genera.effect of food supplement on red squirrel gut microbiota in three out of the six study grids peanut butter was supplied from october to may in a large-scale food sup- plementation experiment in our 3 years 2008 2009 2010 of sampling feces from squirrels on the three control no food added and three experimental peanut butter added grids the average populationbiogeography of red squirrel gut microbiotato investigate whether red squirrel gut microbiota had any spatial structure we carried out analyses on the same set of samples n  225 described above from fe- males in all six grids that were 0.2-7.3 km apart may 2008. to control for potential confounding effects of food supplementation and host relatedness red squirrels disperse  100 m from their natal territory we only compared samples within the same treatment group from a food-supplemented or control grid and from unrelated individuals relatedness coefficient r0.

finally we ex- pected that individuals living in close proximity would have more similar gut microbial composition than those living farther apart.resultsred squirrel gut microbiota profileby 16s rrna gene sequencing we analyzed the gut microbial communities of north american red squirrels using 905 fecal samples collected from 363 red squirrels.

interestingly the overall microbial species richness decreased from 2008 to 2010 which coincided with the natural decrease in red squirrel population density over these years 2008 1.46 squirrelsha 2009 1.15 squirrels ha 2010 0.93 squirrelsha resulting from several years of low spruce cone production seasonal otu co-occurrence networkto investigate how species interactions and the structure of red squirrel gut microbial community changed over time we reconstructed otu co-occurrence network in each season.

this result is consistent with our present under- standing that the mammalian gut harbors a highly constrained set of bacterial phyla adapted to the gastro- intestinal tract condition unlike wild wood mice apodemus sylvaticus which are dominated by the genus lactobacillus red squirrels have a high level of the genera coprococcus 12.3 and oscillospira 6.2 but very low levels of lactobacillus 0.88. notably red squirrels have remarkably low variation in gut bacterial phyla and shared a core set of genera acrosstime year season host age space study grid and host family fig.

red squirrels in this area have been continuously monitored by the kluane red squirrel project since 1987 using a combination of live-trapping and behavioral observations.

the location of each animal's midden was recorded and used to estimate the distance between individuals.agethe average adult lifespan of wild red squirrels in this population is 3.5 years maximal 9 years juveniles usually leave the natal area 70 days after birth and the mean dispersal distance is 96 - 94 m from the natal area red squirrels reach sexual and reproductive matur- ity at  1 year old.

comparative studies in host species with female uniparental care will be useful for separating the maternal effects from the genetic effects.to determine the relative contribution of seasonal dietary shift host genetics maternal effects and disper- sal limitation to the diversity of gut microbiota we performed a large-scale study on a well-characterized population of wild north american red squir- rels tamiasciurus hudsonicus.

indicating that the most abundant genera were present in almost all samples while rare genera accounted for most of the membership difference in gut microbiota of red squirrel population.

as such these 10 genera constituted the core microbiota of red squirrel gut microbial community.

there was a clear tradeoff of core genera oscillospira and coprococcus which peaked in late spring and summer respectively.the seasonal changes in gut microbiota occurred in parallel with the shift in red squirrel's dietary composition as measured by opportunistic feeding observations of indi- vidually marked squirrels n  1279 observations between 2008 and 2010 additional file figure s3.

in early spring red squirrels mainly consumed seeds from hoarded white spruce picea glauca cones and hypogeous fungi false truffles.

in late spring red squirrels also consumed a sig- nificant amount of fresh white spruce buds and needles.
