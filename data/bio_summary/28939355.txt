These sequential events can alter the composition of normal microbiota in the gut and even the lung due to linkage via the gutelung axis and may allow opportunistic microorganisms to gain a foothold and even thrive at these sites.Alterations in intestinal microbiota affect the outcomes of influenza virus infectionIt has been proposed that immune cells and structures contained in mucosal tissues of the respiratory and intestinal tracts are actually connected throughout the entire body  and therefore bilateral interactions can be expected in that the intestinal microbiota should be able to influence as well as be influenced by the course of influenza virus infections.

Intriguingly the elevation of Th1-related cytokines is not restricted to specific influenza virus strains the effects of probiotics have been observed in the H1N1 influenza virus strains APR834 and ANWS33 as well as the H3N2 virus strain APhilippines82 suggesting that the beneficial effects of probiotics affect general immune mechanisms that broadly apply to influenza virus strains.Immunoregulation of influenza virus infections by intestinal microbiotaImmunoregulation mediated by the metabolites and components of intestinal microbiotaAs previously discussed the metabolites and cell wall components of the intestinal microbiota can interact with host PRRs and immuneinflammatory processes to exert immuno- regulatory effects.

Together these results indicate that the elimination of normal gut microbiota after antibiotic use can lead to increased lung damage during influenza virus infections.Table 1Effects of probiotics on influenza virus infection in mouse models.Probiotics strain ProcessingRoute ofCourse of Administration InfluenzaMiceVirus titerImmunoregulation of probiotics upon virus infectionReferencesstatusadministrationBefore virus inoculationAfter virus inoculationstrainBifidobacterium longum BB536LivingOral 2109 CFUmiceday14 days6 daysAPR834BALBc femalemice 4 weeks old5106 PFU 1.

In this review we discuss the regulatory role of intestinal microbiota in influenza infections and present the latest evidence for strategies seeking to harness gut microbiota for the management of influenza infections.c 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Institut Pasteur.Keywords Influenza virus Gut-lung axis Intestinal microbiota Immunomodulation VaccinationIntroductionStarting from the moment of birth all exposed surfaces i.e.

Additionally antibody titers and the number of plasma cells specific to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine TIV were reduced in TLR5  mice likely due to loss of this key receptor for MAMPs on commensal and probiotic bacteria.Immunoregulation mediated by immune cells and factorsThe protective effects of intestinal microbiota against influenza virus infection are tightly intertwined with local and systemic immune responses.

Importantly the influence of intestinal microbiota is by no means limited to the early years of life as gut microbiota can continue to mediate1286-4579c 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Institut Pasteur.the differentiation and expansion of T cells through the years and mononuclear phagocytes in the intestine and res- piratory tract can sample antigens in the lumen and activate adaptive immunity to promote the clearance of viruses and other pathogens .

These results suggest that a major function of intestinal microbiota is to regulate immune responses appropriately in response to different situations.Based on the promising results derived from research into the immunoregulatory effects of intestinal microbiota re- combinant probiotics have been tested as adjuvants to boost mucosal immunity and T cell response.

The interactions between intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal microbiota are mediated through interaction with metabolites e.g.

T cells from the lung can migrate to the intestine and produce type I IFNs whereupon high levels of type I IFNs then activate Th17 cells and increase the secretion of IL-15 and IL- 17 which subsequently cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells and induce the symptoms observed.

Together these results show that a potential additive or augmentative effect may be derived from the use of probiotics in influenza vaccination but conflicting results should be further assessed and resolved by adjusting the pro- biotic strains used the dosage administered and the timepoint and duration of administration.ConclusionsThe beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota against influ- enza virus infection were first identified more than a decade ago and since then it has gradually become known that these effects depend on immunoregulatory cells and factors circulating through the lymphatic and circulatory system between the gut and the lung the gutelung axis to establish a defensive parameter against incoming infectious agents or allergens.
