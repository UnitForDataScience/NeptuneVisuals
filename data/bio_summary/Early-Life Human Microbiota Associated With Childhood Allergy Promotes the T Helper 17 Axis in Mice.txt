The intestinal microbiota differed markedly between the groups of mice but only exposure to microbiota associated with AH and known future allergy in children resulted in a T helper 17 Th17-signature both systemically and in the gut mucosa in the mouse offspring.

The levels of IgG in serum and IgA in serum and small intestinal content were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA with commer- cially available ELISA kits Mabtech.Quantitative real-time Pcr analysisSections of distal small intestine and mid-colon were snap-frozen at necropsy.

The elevated serum antibody levels show that AH mice displayed altered functional B-cell properties howeverthis was not reflected in changes in the splenic cellular B-cell compartment.allergy-associated Microbiota Does not induce intestinal inflammationConsidering that the AH mice exhibited both increased intes- tinal and systemic Th17 responses this could indicate that they harbored more reactive or pathogenic microbiota.

The intestinal mucosa was therefore examined for alterations in barrier proper- ties or the presence of obvious inflammation.

The major phyla detected through- out the intestinal tract were Actinobacteria BacteroidetesFirmicutes and Proteobacteria  which was in line with a previous study of human gastrointestinal microbiota .FigUre 6  Properties of microbial communities across the gastrointestinal tract.

The slight increase in Th17 responses in AHL mice which did not harbor fungi suggests that bacterial stimuli also contributed to Th17 induction.Murine models are fundamental for investigating complex immune responses to the intestinal microbiota but it is impor- tant to consider the differences in physiology and immune maturation between mice and humans.

The infant mouse is born with a more immature intestinal barrier than human children  which will result in different interactions between immune cells and early gut microbiota.
