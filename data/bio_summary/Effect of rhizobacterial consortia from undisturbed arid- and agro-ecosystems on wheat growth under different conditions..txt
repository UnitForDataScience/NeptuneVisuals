Bacterial consortia were based on previously isolated PGPR and their plant growth-promoting effects studied in pot experiments under growth chamber conditions and in potexperiments placed in an open greenhouse under natural conditions.Results and discussionIn an attempt to study the PGP effect of rhizobacterial consortia from arid- C1 and agro-ecosystems C2 we quantified the biomass production of wheat seedlings growing in unsterile substrate 3  1 perlite  peat and two different Chilean Andisols mixed with perlite 3  1 soil  perlite under chamber 20degC 60 humidity and 8  16 h light  dark cycle and natural conditions for 30 days.Figure 1 reveals the PGP effect of rhizobacterial C1 and C2 in wheat seedlings grown in unsterile substrate under growth chamber conditions.

After 30 days of incubation wheat seedlings were carefully removed from the pots washed with distilled water to remove adhered substrate particles and then dried at 60degC for 48 h to determine total plant biomass as dry weight g per pot.Inoculation assay 2Inoculation assays were carried out under growth chamber and natural conditions with wheat seeds coated with bac- terial consortia as described by Barra et al.

Our results support possible applications of rhizobacterial consortia from arid ecosystems to improve wheat growth in Chilean Andisols under water shortage conditions.IntroductionThe plant microbiome harbours an innumerable wealth of bacterial taxa that promote the stress tolerance and growth of plants suppress plant diseases degrade xenobi- otic compounds or positively influence crop yields Berg et al.

The higher biomass production may have been induced by environmental factors such as improved exposure toa 353252151050ControlC1C2 Consortiab 353252151050ControlC1C2 ConsortiaFigure 2 Effect of rhizobacterial consortia derived from arid- C1 and agro-ecosystems C2 on the formation of wheat seedlings biomass after 30 days of growth at chamber conditions using soils from Piedras Negras a and Freire b.

The PGP effects of C1 and C2 were assayed in wheat seedlings Triticum aestivum L. grown in pots under growth chamber conditions and in pots placed in an open greenhouse under natural conditions using two different Chilean Andisols Piedras Negras and Freire series kept either at 30 or 60 of their maximum water holding capacity MWHC.

In this sense some studies have also isolated PGPR from natural vege- tation and assessed the contribution of PGPR to the growth and stress tolerance drought and salinity induced stress of their hosts including cucumber tomato and pepper plants Mayak et al.

Our results also give promising experimental evidence for the potential application of PGPR consortia to improve the growth of wheat in Chilean Andisols con- sidering arid ecosystems as an alternative source of PGPR.

Here we hence evalu- ated the effect of PGPR consortia isolated from either arid- and agro-ecosystems on biomass production of wheat Triticum aestivum L. seedlings growing in Chi- lean Andisols which are characterized by high contents of Po but low availability for plants.

The growth chamber conditions were established in accor- dance to Anasac S.A. protocol for wheat plants and under supervision of technicians.
