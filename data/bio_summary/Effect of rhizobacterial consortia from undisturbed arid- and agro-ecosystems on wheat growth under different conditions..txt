after 30 days of incubation wheat seedlings were carefully removed from the pots washed with distilled water to remove adhered substrate particles and then dried at 60degc for 48 h to determine total plant biomass as dry weight g per pot.inoculation assay 2inoculation assays were carried out under growth chamber and natural conditions with wheat seeds coated with bac- terial consortia as described by barra et al.

the pgp effects of c1 and c2 were assayed in wheat seedlings triticum aestivum l. grown in pots under growth chamber conditions and in pots placed in an open greenhouse under natural conditions using two different chilean andisols piedras negras and freire series kept either at 30 or 60 of their maximum water holding capacity mwhc.

our results also give promising experimental evidence for the potential application of pgpr consortia to improve the growth of wheat in chilean andisols con- sidering arid ecosystems as an alternative source of pgpr.

in this sense some studies have also isolated pgpr from natural vege- tation and assessed the contribution of pgpr to the growth and stress tolerance drought and salinity induced stress of their hosts including cucumber tomato and pepper plants mayak et al.

2016. nonetheless very little is known on the potential of pgpr from extreme environments as soil inoculants added to traditional crops under environ- mental stress conditions such as drought events and nutrient-poor soils by erosion or degradation of soils.

here we hence evalu- ated the effect of pgpr consortia isolated from either arid- and agro-ecosystems on biomass production of wheat triticum aestivum l. seedlings growing in chi- lean andisols which are characterized by high contents of po but low availability for plants.

the growth chamber conditions were established in accor- dance to anasac s.a. protocol for wheat plants and under supervision of technicians.

our results support possible applications of rhizobacterial consortia from arid ecosystems to improve wheat growth in chilean andisols under water shortage conditions.introductionthe plant microbiome harbours an innumerable wealth of bacterial taxa that promote the stress tolerance and growth of plants suppress plant diseases degrade xenobi- otic compounds or positively influence crop yields berg et al.

we hypothesize that microbial inoculants derived from arid ecosystems such as deserts may contribute to plant tolerance against environmental stress conditions such as water shortage by drought events or nutrient-poor soils by erosion or degradation of soils.
