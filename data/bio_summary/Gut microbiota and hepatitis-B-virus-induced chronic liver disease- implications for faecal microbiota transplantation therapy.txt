revealed that an immunotolerating pathway to HBV prevailed in young mice six weeks old before the establishment of gut bacteria through a Toll-like-receptor-4 TLR4-dependent pathway and that the maturation of gut microbiota in adult mice stimulated liver immunity resulting in rapid HBV clear- ance.

Clinical pro- phylactic treatment to slow the progression of liver disease has made significant advances with the availability of peginter- feron and the nucleostide analogues to sustain suppression of HBV replication e but unfortunately this neglects the role of intestinal microbiota in patients with HBV-induced chronic liver disease .

The exis- tence of a link between HBV-induced chronic liver disease and gut microbiota was suggested by studies in animals or patients with HBV-induced chronic liver disease.

In addition these re- sults provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with HBV-induced chronic liver disease and may potentially serve as guidance for disease interventions by manipulating gut microbiota.Future prospects of FMT therapy for HBV- induced chronic liver diseaseIntestinal microbiota can be manipulated to treat diseases in humans.

Possible mechanisms of action of FMT in these situations include manipulation of the composition of gut microbiota fortification of the intestinal barrier and suppression of patho- gens and immunomodulation  e. A growing body of evidence shed light on the association between dys- biosis of gut microbiota and HBV-induced chronic liver disease.

Changes in intestinal microbiota seem to play an important role in induction and promo- tion of HBV-induced chronic liver disease progression and specific species among the intestinal commensal bacteria may play either a pathogenic or a protective role in the development of HBV-induced chronic liver disease.

Host immune responses induced by HBV infection not only drive disease progression substantially but also significantly influ- ence the efficacy of antiviral treatments .

HBV infection is a preventable disease.

Although chronic HBV infection is highly preventable through vaccina- tion once it has been established the sole option for thwarting long-term liver disease is treatment.

These studies may provide a novel insight into the pathogenesis of HBV infection as well as a potential thera- peutic target for HBV-related disease.
