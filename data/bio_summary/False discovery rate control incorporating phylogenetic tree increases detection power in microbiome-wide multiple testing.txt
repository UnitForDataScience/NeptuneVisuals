To summarize when the phylogenetic tree is informative our procedure dominates BH and ST procedure and when the tree is not informative our procedure is comparable to BH and ST procedure.Real data applicationWe demonstrate our method using a real microbiome dataset from a study of long-term dietary effects on the human gut microbiomeTable 1.

BH procedure is conserva- tive and ST procedure has actual FDRs closer to the nominal ones than BH procedure as the proportion of null hypothesis has been incorporated in ST procedure.

plots the number of identified OTUs with different FDR levels based on our procedure BH procedure and ST procedure.

We then repeated the simulations S1-S5 and compared our procedure to BH and ST. We found that our procedure not only has conservative FDR control under data correlation but also has a much higher power than BH and ST for phylogeny-informative scenarios.Our method is quite flexible and users can specify the prior struc-ture in terms of feature-to-feature distance matrix e.g.

Despite much progress in multiple testing procedures such as false discovery rate FDR control methods that take into account the phylogenetic tree are largely limited.Results We propose a new FDR control procedure that incorporates the prior structure information and apply it to microbiome data.

When the phylogenetic tree is mis-specified or non-informative our procedure achieves a similar power as traditional pro- cedures that do not take into account the tree structure.

Third our procedure has substantial power gain when the phylo- genetic tree accurately describes the dependence structure and achieves a similar power as traditional procedures when the phylo- genetic tree is mis-specified or non-informative.

The ST procedure fixes a threshold value t esti- mates the FDR and chooses t so that the estimated FDR is no larger than a In ST procedure the proportion of null hypothesis is esti- mated through a conservative estimator p0dkTh14 fpi  k i 14 1 ...  mgmd1 - kTh where k is a tuning parameter.

We can see that our procedure significantly outperforms BH and ST procedure for scen- ario 1-3 and has comparable performance with BH and ST proced- ure for scenario 4 and 5.
