the difference in the incidence of detected otus in the stool samples of t2dm-ckd and healthy subjects' samples was statistically significant at p  0.05. out of seven analyzed genera bifidobacterium showed a decrease in t2dm-ckd whereas substantial increases were observed in six otus clostridium escherichia enterobacter acinetobacter proteus and lactobacillus table .table 2. the abundance of the gut microbiota identified in the t2dm-ckd patients and healthy subjects hs increased t or decreased t. mann-whitney u test showed significant difference  in operational taxonomic units otus in the two groups p  0.05.genust2dm-ckd hs bifidobacterium t0.4590.565clostridium t0.1140.102escherichia t0.00070.0001enterobacter t0.000410-5acinetobacter t0.010510-5proteus t0.014210-5lactobacillus t1.030.046five otus that showed a substantial increase in the abundance in t2dm-ckd patients are tma producers clostridium escherichia enterobacter acinetobacter and proteus table .

we hypothesized that chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in t2dm-ckd patients is related to elevated levels of tmao and an enlarged population of gut microbiota-dependent tmao.materials and methodsresearch subjectsforty adult 18 years or older subjects twenty healthy subjects and twenty t2dm-ckd patients were recruited for the study from the outpatient clinic of the texas tech university health sciences center amarillo.

also showed that a high-fat diet although it does not increase fasting plasma tmao concentrations does appear to increase postprandial tmao levels in healthy young men.another interesting observation reported in this study is that t2dm-ckd patients have more than a 2.4-fold elevation of triglycerides 206.9 - 21 versus healthy subjects 85 - 4.1. even though hypertriglyceridemia and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins as risk factors are uncertain an american heart association aha scientific statement showed the pivotal role of triglycerides in lipid metabolism and that triglyceride represents an important biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk .

the gut microbiome in t2dm-ckd patients exhibited a higher incidence of tma-producing bacteria than control p  0.05. the serum levels of tmao in t2dm-ckd patients were significantly higher than controls p  0.05. tmao showed a positive correlation with zo and lps inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers.

an increased abundance of tma-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of t2dm-ckd patients together with excessive tmao and increased gut permeability might impact their risk for cardiovascular disease through elevation of chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.keywords gut microbiota inflammatory markers tmao zonulin t2dm-ckdintroductionchronic kidney disease ckd affects more than 10 of the global population  and approximately 50 of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm .

consequently the altered intestinal permeability can increase the dietary products tma and lps endotoxin trafficking from the intestine to blood.intriguingly in this study the tmao measurements in t2dm-ckd patients median 0.94 interquartile range 0.74-1.72 ugml showed 1.6-fold increase over tmao measurements reported in patients with ckd median 7.9 um 0.593 ugml interquartile range 5.2-12.4 um 0.391-0.93 ugml reported by tang et al.

the subjects' demographics diet body mass index bmi and hemoglobin levels were recorded.dna extraction from stools and sequencingstool samples were collected from t2dm-ckd patients and healthy subjects no more than 24 h before clinic visits.

the mann-whitney u test was used to compare data between the patients' group and the healthy controls and the wilcoxon's paired test was used to evaluate differences within the same group.

the two-way anova test with bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to show the incidence difference of identified bacteria in the two studied groups t2dm-ckd patients and healthy subjects.resultsanthropometric and metabolic parameters in the study groupsanthropometric and metabolic parameters are presented in table .
