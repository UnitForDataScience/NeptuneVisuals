An increased abundance of TMA-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of T2DM-CKD patients together with excessive TMAO and increased gut permeability might impact their risk for cardiovascular disease through elevation of chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.Keywords gut microbiota inflammatory markers TMAO zonulin T2DM-CKDIntroductionChronic kidney disease CKD affects more than 10 of the global population  and approximately 50 of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM .

The abundance of the gut microbiota identified in the T2DM-CKD patients and healthy subjects HS increased T or decreased T. Mann-Whitney U test showed significant difference  in Operational Taxonomic Units OTUs in the two groups p  0.05.GenusT2DM-CKD HS Bifidobacterium T0.4590.565Clostridium T0.1140.102Escherichia T0.00070.0001Enterobacter T0.000410-5Acinetobacter T0.010510-5Proteus T0.014210-5Lactobacillus T1.030.046Five OTUs that showed a substantial increase in the abundance in T2DM-CKD patients are TMA producers Clostridium Escherichia Enterobacter Acinetobacter and Proteus Table .

Thus increased zonulin levels allow more gut bacterial endotoxins and metabolites to cross the gut-membrane blood barrier into the circulatory system .Although the gut microbiota is influenced by diet physical activity and illness the gut microbiome is practically stable in healthy adults .

Although a potential association between gastric bacteria Helicobacter pylori with T2DM-CKD was reported  there is no report of gut bacteria association with advanced T2DM-CKD.Another relevant finding reported here refers to the possible correlation between the disruption in the balance of T2DM-CKD gut microbiota and increased levels of serum TMAO in T2DM-CKD patients.

Taken together we speculate that the changes in the gut microbiota associated with increased levels of TMA and TMAO and increased gut permeability in patients with T2DM-CKD contributed to increased levels of the inflammatory and endothelin dysfunctions biomarkers.ConclusionsT2MD-CKD is a progressive disease associated with cardiovascular complications.

Our study showed the involvement of increased gut microbiota-dependent TMAO production in T2DM-CKD patients and identified the association of TMAO with increased gut permeability and inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers.

The outcome of our study will promote further research toward diet and gut microbiome modification to diminish those risks.Acknowledgments The present study was supported in part by a SanofiGenzyme Pharmaceuticals fellowship grant.

The gut microbiome in T2DM-CKD patients exhibited a higher incidence of TMA-producing bacteria than control p  0.05.

We hypothesized that chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in T2DM-CKD patients is related to elevated levels of TMAO and an enlarged population of gut microbiota-dependent TMAO.Materials and MethodsResearch SubjectsForty adult 18 years or older subjects twenty healthy subjects and twenty T2DM-CKD patients were recruited for the study from the outpatient clinic of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Amarillo.

Exclusion criteria included a pregnancy b any mental state that would restrict the subject from consenting for the study c known chronic gut-related diseases irrelevant to diabetes including but not limited to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis d patients who previously had bariatric surgeries e patients with end-stage liver disease and f patients who were treated with antibiotics for at least three consecutive days for any condition during the month prior to the study initiation.
