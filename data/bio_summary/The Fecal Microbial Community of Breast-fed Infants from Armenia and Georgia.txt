shows a breakdown of the levels of these taxa over time by various metadata categories and shows the breakdown of bifidobacterial species in the same way.individual infants were found to be similar to themselves over time with an adonis r2 value of 0.027 for subject number indicating that individuality was responsible for 2.7 of the variation in the microbiota prf  0.001. to investigate the pattern of bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract over time the compo- sition of the infant microbiota was compared at each time point.

time was found to be a significant influence on the infant microbiota prf  0.001 and was responsible for 2.3 of the variation in the microbiota adonis r2 of 0.023. between days 7 and 90 b. breve b. longum subsp.

country of birth was found be the largest influence on microbial community structure of the factors tested signaling differences in the infant microbiota between the two closely-situated countries and raising the question of the degree to which the developing intestinal microbiota might be influenced by national boundaries and the cultural and genetic differences they represent.

because short amplicon-based sequencing often lacks the ability to resolve species-level taxonomic distinctions the method of lewis et al.
