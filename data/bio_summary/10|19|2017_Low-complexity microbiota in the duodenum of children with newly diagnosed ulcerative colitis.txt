As shown in  patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease could be readily separated from the controls based on the distribution patterns of the OTUs in their microbiota.shows the OTUs that contributed the most towards distinguishing between the patients with ulcerative colitis and the controls.

B Loading plots showing the OTUs that make the strongest contributions to distinguishing between patients with ulcerative colitis and controls C Loading plots showing the OTUs that make the strongest contributions to the distinction between patients with Crohn's disease and controls.

Notably few OTUs were more prevalent in the patients with ulcerative colitis than in the non-IBD controls left-hand side of the diagram and in no case were the differences statistically significant in the univariate analysis.identifies the OTUs that contributed the most to differentiating the microbial com- positions of the patients with Crohn's disease and the controls.

The two groups were highly correlated and Tables in the patients with Crohn's disease r  0.915P  0.029  in the patients with ulcerative colitis r  0.915 P  0.029  and in the controls r  0.866 P  0.005 .Microbial richness at the OTU levelTo assess microbial richness the numbers of OTUs per patient were calculated .

After diagnosis the duo- denal microbiota of subjects with ulcerative colitis N  8 or Crohn's disease N  5 and non-IBD controls N  8 were compared.ResultsPyrosequencing revealed that the duodenal microbiota of children with ulcerative colitis con- tained fewer Operational Taxonomic Units OTUs per individual than the duodenal micro- biota of the controls P  0.005.

This included an increased prevalence of Cupriavidus in patients with IBD com- pared with the controls P  0.046.shows the read abundance in each subject of 17 taxa that displayed significant dif- ferences between children with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease and non-IBD controls see Figs  and .

Samples from patients with Crohn's disease showed levels of richness that ranged from low to as high as the non-IBD controls with no significant difference noted between these children and the non- IBD controls .A low number of OTUs might be a consequence of a low total bacterial population.

Consistent with the findings in patients with ulcerative colitis the genus Collinsella was less prevalent among patients with Crohn's disease than among the controls P  0.007.

Pearson's correlation coefficient analyses between Bacteria only and unclassified reads for a patients with Crohn's disease b patients with ulcerative colitis and c Controls.

Although the children with Crohn's disease tended to have fewer OTUs than the controls across the four major phyla the differences were not statistically significant.We also calculated the relative abundance of taxa using Shannon's index but found no sig- nificant differences between the three groups data not shown.Distribution of individual OTUs in children with IBD and controlsWe attempted to classify each OTU found in the dataset n  322 to the genus level which was possible in 232 72 of the cases.
