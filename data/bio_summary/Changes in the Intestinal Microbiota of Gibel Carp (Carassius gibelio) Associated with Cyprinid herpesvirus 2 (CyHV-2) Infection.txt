Reduced diversity and altered composi- tion of the intestinal microbiota following CyHV-2 infec- tion suggest that either probiotics or prebiotics would be a useful method in the prevention and treatment of CyHV-2 infection and Plesiomonas could be used as a microbial biomarker for disease detection.

Regardless the differences in intestinal microbial community structure after CyHV-2 infection suggest that it may be possible to use probiotics or prebiotics to mitigate infection by restoring the richness of the host intestinal microbiota .Interestingly some studies have found that Plesiomonas is the dominant genus in fecal samples of healthy and anadromous fish collected from freshwater habitats   but studies in gold fish  and grass carp  have confirmed that Plesiomonas is a pathogen.

So in this research we investi- gated the influence of CyHV-2 infection on intestinal microbiota of gibel carp.The microbiota is known to depend on a functional equilibrium between the host the environment and dietary factors.

However information regarding the intestinal microbiota of many aquaculture animals is insufficient elucidating the dynamics of the intestinal microbiota can be beneficial for nutrition immunity and disease control.

Thus characterizing variations in the intestinal microbial communities of healthy and diseased hosts can inform disease prediction and therapy however there is no information available on the intestinal bacterial community in gibel carp infected with CyHV-2.

In this study we used 16S rRNA sequencing to observe changes in the intestinal microbiota of gibel carp Carassius auratus gibelio associated with cyprinid herpesvirus 2 CyHV-2 infection.

Our results indicate that the diversity of the intestinal microbiota was strongly reduced and the com- position was dramatically altered following CyHV-2 infection.

The mechanism of CyHV-2 infection is still unclear in this new fish host and there are currently no effective preventative or treatment measures.Many studies had shown that the intestinal microbiota assist hosts by promoting nutrient absorption stimulating the immune response and disease resistance   .

In this study changes in the intestinal microbiota between the healthy and CyHV-2 infected fish were investigated as well as potential biomarkers for disease.
