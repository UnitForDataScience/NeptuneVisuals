The gut microbe Bacteroides the- taiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants of vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans.

The design of receptor arrays reflects key pro- cesses that shape cellular evolution.

I emphasize broad questions about the characteristics of receptor uptake arrays for nutrient acquisition.This is an open access article under the terms of the License which permits use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.c 2017 The Authors.

The ubiquitous battle for free iron sets the design of siderophore up- take receptor arrays.Glycans are complex carbohydrates with diverse molecular structures.

The cobalt-containing corrin ring defines the group and plays a key role in corrinoid coenzyme ac- tivity.

The other species must take up the vitamin externally.

The cost difference between synthesis and uptake probably explains why uptake is so common even among those species that can make their own.Only prokaryotes can make corrinoids.

The specific numbers are imprecise.

The btuB1 strain won in the presence of two corrinoid variants whereas btuB3 won in the presence of theother four variants.An in vivo experiment colonized germ-free mice with a wild-type strain that expressed all three receptors and a mutant strain with btuB2 knocked out.

The wild type strongly outcompeted the mutant.
