They showed a reduction in abun- dance of fecal Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increased abun- dance of E. coli in patients with IBD or psoriasis compared to healthy controls suggesting that a link between the gut microbiome and psoriasis might exist.

Next-generation-sequencing approaches used to characterize the cutaneous microbiome in healthy skin compared to lesional skin from psoriasis patients revealed signifi- cant differences in the composition of the microbiota.

However a marked decrease in the total diversity of microbial communities an over-representation of Proteobacteria and an under-representation of Actinobacteria has been observed in lesional skin from psoriasis patients compared to corresponding non-lesional skin from the same individual.

Karin Loser Muenster Germany and colleagues characterized the cu- taneous microbiota in lesional and corresponding non-lesional skin from psoriasis patients before and at different time points after the start of treatment with different biologics including TNF-a blockade IL-1223 blockade fumaric acid esters or phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

This approach provides infor- mation about the composition of microbiota at different mucosal sites and their interaction with the host that could potentially be used to in- form clinical decision making during pregnancy.Role of Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Its Extra- intestinal ManifestationsA role for the microbiome in the initiation and maintenance of in- testinal disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease IBD is starting to emerge with a decreased microbial diversity and an increased presence of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria among the most often found dysbiotic components.

Furthermore they showed that impaired host defense mech- anisms in IBD patients can result in an increased presence of adherent invasive Escherichia coli species in the gut mucosa.

IBD is associated with several extra-intestinal manifestations including skin diseases such as psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa.

The researchers therefore examined gut and skin microbiome of patients suffering from IBD IBD and concomitant skin disease or skin disease only.

The authors went on to demonstrate that oral treatment of psoriasis with dimethylfumarates restores2352-3964c 2017 The Authors.
