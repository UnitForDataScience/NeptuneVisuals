Although the similarity between these crAss-like family protein sequences and the large RNAP subunits was limited the strict conservation of several predicted key motifs that comprise the RNAP catalytic site across the crAss-like family the fusion of the putative homologs of two RNAP subunits in a single large protein compatible with the combined lengths of the b and b' RNAP subunits and the compatibility of the predicted secondary structure elements with the RNAP core structure Supplementary Figure3 strongly suggest that the crAss-like family phages encode an active RNAP.The putative b-b' RNAP fusion protein contains another large region of similarity with other phages which in some of them resides in a separate protein e.g.

Only a few groups of phages encode their own multisubunit RNAPs including Lactococcus phage 1706 Rhodococcus phage ReqiPepy6 Bacillus phage SPbeta Thermus phages P74 and P23 and giant phages of Pseudomonas 25-28.

These genes encode a predicted major capsid protein MCP of the HK97 fold portal protein large terminase subunit and two uncharacterized proteins that are conserved throughout thecrAss-like family and given the consistent adjacency to the MCP could be components of the virion or the morphogenetic machinery Table 1 Figure 1 Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 1.Despite the low sequence conservation even within the family and remote similarity to proteins from other phages the gene order in the capsid module of the crAss-like family is nearly invariant Figure 1 suggesting congruent evolution of these genes.

The present analysis changes this by showing that crAssphage belongs to an expansive phage family that is only distantly related to other known phages and has unusual predicted features in particular a previously unknown putative mechanism of RNAP maturation via polyprotein processing.The MCP of these phages a distinct form of the HK97 class of icosahedral capsid proteins 30 is now confidently predicted and amenable for experiments aimed at direct identification and characterization of the phage.

A concatenated alignment of all 5 genes was used to construct a phylogenetic tree of the crAss-like family which includes a strongly supported clade of crAssphage relatives and several other distinct groups of predicted bacteriophages Figure 1.. Three of these groups included previously identified phages namely Azobacteroides phage ProJPt-Bp 13 Flavobacterium psychrophilum phage Fpv3 and Cellulophaga phage phi142 widespread although apparently not highly abundant phages in the oceans 14.

The extracted protein sequences of the putative MCP homologs either complete proteins or fragments longer than 150 aa were clustered with blastclust at 90 identity aligned with MUSCLE 35 and used for the phylogenetic reconstruction shown in Supplementary Figure 1.In addition other conserved crAssphage proteins were searched against GenBank databases by protein blast BLASTP and TBLASTN 33.

Several proteins implicated in phage genome replication have been identified including a family B DNA polymerase DNAP a primase and a flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase but neither the major capsid protein nor other structural and morphogenetic proteins were detected.

We then constructed multiple alignments of the crAssphage proteins and their homologs and used these alignments as queries for profile-profile searches against a comprehensive collection of protein families using the HHPred software one of the most sensitive current methods for protein sequence analysis see Methods for details.

The two most conserved tail proteins encoded by the crAss-like group are homologous to tail components gp4 tubular tail protein and gp10 tail stabilization protein of bacteriophageYutin et al.Page 4P22 18.
