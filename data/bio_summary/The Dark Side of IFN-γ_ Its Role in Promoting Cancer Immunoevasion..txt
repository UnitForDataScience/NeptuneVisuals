Such immune-evaded tumor cells are frequently found to lose their tumor antigen expression which can be a result of reduced expression levels of tumor antigens loss of MHC class I expression or impaired antigen processing machinery in tumor cells .

However findings that endogenous IFN-g not only controls tumor initiation and progression but also shapes tumor immunogenicity and promotes the outgrowth of tumor cells with immunoevasive properties - revealed that this cytokine can have a dual role in shaping cancer's outcome.

As a result of extensive studies over the past three decades it is now evident that first IFN-g can facilitate tumor initiation and subsequently promote changes in tumor cell phenotype towards increased fitness for growth in immunocompetent host and second that it is intimately involved in several homeostatic or cancer-triggered mechanisms that promote establishment of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment Figure .Figure 1.

Within immunogenic or inflammatory tumor microenvironments a chronic presence of IFN-g fails to contribute to tumor cell eradication by its bright side function and instead can induce a selection andor generation of tumor clones with more malignant phenotype by its dark side function.

Sustained low-level expression of interferon-g promotes tumor development Potential insights in tumor prevention and tumor immunotherapy.

In this review we will summarize this multi-functional role of IFN-g in tumor context how it promotes changes in tumor phenotype towards increased fitness for growth in immunocompetent host.

Furthermore we summarize how IFN-g is involved in homeostatic or cancer-triggered mechanisms to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.Keywords IFN-g tumorigenesis tumor immunogenicity immune suppressionBackgroundInterferon-g IFN-g is a pluripotent cytokine discovered as part of a larger family of factors--interferons named after their ability to interfere with the growth of live viruses .

neo-antigens resulting from gene mutations overexpressed cellular antigens or viral antigens  IFN-g stimulates expression of tumor antigen-presenting MHC molecules to increase immunogenicity of tumor cells and makes them more susceptible to immune recognition and destruction -.

Moreover by targeting non-transformed cells present in the tumor microenvironment IFN-g displays its indirect anti-tumor actions acting as an antiangiogenic factor to inhibit tumor angiogenesis andor to promote destruction of established tumor-associated blood vessels -.In past key studies IFN-g has been shown to play a central role for sketching the outlines of immunoediting concept.

This concept frames the transition of the immune system's role from being tumor restrictive to tumor permissive through three sequential phases elimination equilibrium and the escape phase.
