furthermore health behaviours including intravaginal health practice number of sexual partners and other fac- tors may affect the types of vaginal microbiota and their association with risk of persistent hrhpv infection.

it isclear that environmental risk factors such as smoking age at first sexual intercourse age at first full-term pregnancy high parity and use of oral contraceptives which have been implicated in persistent hrhpv infection do not completely explain the association between hrhpv infection and cer- vical cancer and several studies have identified a role for genetics and heritability in its aetiology.-these studies suggest that genetic factors contribute to the risk of persist- ent hrhpv infection and progression to cervical cancer.

other reviews concluded that there is a potential role for genetic factors in cervical cancer in situ and estimated the heritability to be between 11 and 15.-nevertheless there have been few studies of genetic risks of the different components of the pathway to cervical carcinogenesis among all populations particularly in africans.an important yet understudied aspect of hpv carcino-genesis is the role of innate immunity and emerging know- ledge about the vaginal microbiome and the role that these play in cervical carcinogenesis.-vaginal micro- biota may affect the risk of persistent hrhpv infection through rich complex dynamic and individual-specific microbial interaction with the host such as through signal- ling of host cells that affect inflammatory immunologicaland host-defence functions.specific types of vaginal microbiota may sculpt the cervical cytokines in ways that influence the persistence of hpv infection or breach the in- cipient latency of the persistent hrhpv infection state and drive it towards induction of malignancy in the cervix.
