We store fresh frozen samples and paraffin embedded samples of the cer- vical biopsy and collect minimal data from these women they are not enrolled in the prospective cohort.Quality assurance and controlDataTablet computer-assisted survey instruments TaCASI have proved versatile in survey research that incorporates sensitive questions like those on sexual behaviour.-We use real-time data entry into secure RedCap databases with in-built logic and error checks which enables data man- agers to review data and follow-up on missing values and outliers with site research associates promptly.-LaboratoryTwo independent pathologists who are blinded to the HPV status of the participants report on the histological diag- noses.

There have been few studies of the vaginal microbiotaand the interaction between the vaginal microbiota and cervical cytokines and their association with persistent hrHPV infection.The design of the African Collaborative Center for Microbiome and Genomics Research ACCME HPV and Cervical Cancer Cohort Study enables us to study environ- mental microbiomic genetic and epigenetic factors associ- ated with persistent hrHPV infection in order to improve knowledge of the mechanism of HPV carcinogenesis and discover biomarkers of persistent hrHPV infection and cer- vical cancer.

It isclear that environmental risk factors such as smoking age at first sexual intercourse age at first full-term pregnancy high parity and use of oral contraceptives which have been implicated in persistent hrHPV infection do not completely explain the association between hrHPV infection and cer- vical cancer and several studies have identified a role for genetics and heritability in its aetiology.-These studies suggest that genetic factors contribute to the risk of persist- ent hrHPV infection and progression to cervical cancer.

Therefore several co-factors are required to support the cervical car- cinogenesis induced by persistent hrHPV infection.Data from Western series suggest that HPV types 16 and 18 account for most of the cases of cervical cancer in those environments.However there have been few longi- tudinal studies of hrHPV infections and their association with cervical cancer in much of the rest of the world.

Other reviews concluded that there is a potential role for genetic factors in cervical cancer in situ and estimated the heritability to be between 11 and 15.-Nevertheless there have been few studies of genetic risks of the different components of the pathway to cervical carcinogenesis among all populations particularly in Africans.An important yet understudied aspect of HPV carcino-genesis is the role of innate immunity and emerging know- ledge about the vaginal microbiome and the role that these play in cervical carcinogenesis.-Vaginal micro- biota may affect the risk of persistent hrHPV infection through rich complex dynamic and individual-specific microbial interaction with the host such as through signal- ling of host cells that affect inflammatory immunologicaland host-defence functions.Specific types of vaginal microbiota may sculpt the cervical cytokines in ways that influence the persistence of HPV infection or breach the in- cipient latency of the persistent hrHPV infection state and drive it towards induction of malignancy in the cervix.

Given the marked heterogeneity of types and prevalence of multiple hrHPV infection in many parts of the developing world variation in ability of different hrHPV types to es- tablish persistent infection and concerns about the cover- age of existing vaccines longitudinal studies of large numbers of women in the general population in different regions of the world with information on HPV types and risk factors are critical to bridging the knowledge gaps es- pecially in African populations where such studies are scarce.-The aetiology of cervical cancer is multifactorial.

The vaginal microbial species composition and abun- dance will be determined as described by Forney et al.

In the USA theincidence rate of cervical cancer was 6.6 per 100 000 in 2012compared with 23.0 per 100 000 in Nigeriawhich had about half the population of the USA in 2012.Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus hrHPV infection of the cervix is a necessary cause of cervical can- cer.About 80 of sexually active individuals becomeVC The Author 2017.

Where participants cannot be reached by phone home visits are conducted.What is being measuredThe data collection tools were piloted in a study of 1000 women with similar characteristics as the participants of the ACCME study.

Members of the ACCME research group have used these tools for previous research in Africa.- We asked participants about their sexual activities in the past 24 h including his- tory of sexual intercourse vaginal anal oral use of contraceptives sex toys and lubricants and vaginal symp- toms.
