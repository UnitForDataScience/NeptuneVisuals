However at the genus level both increases and decreases were observed within the Clos- tridia class with increases in Defluvitaleaceae UCG-011 p  .03 Eubacterium oxidoreducens group p  .02 Marvinbryantia p .04 and decreases in Lachnospiraceae UCG-009 p  .02 Ocil- lospira p  .03 and Papillibacter p  .02.

SI significantly decreased Clos- tridia p  .03 at the class level this was reflected in decreases in order Clostridiales p  .03 family Clostridiaceae group 1 p  .01 and Peptostreptococcaceae p  .02 .

All post hoc tests and Spearman correlations included correction for multi- ple comparison.ResultsOpen field behaviorSI rats travelled significantly further than GH control rats p  001 A and at a higher overall velocity p  001 B in the whole open field thus demonstrating hyperactivity in a novel arena consistent with development of the isolation-reared behav- ioral syndrome.As expected both GH and SI rats spent significantly more time in the outer than the central more aversive zone of the open field ANOVA main effect of zone p  .0001 C but this was unaf- fected by rearing condition.

Thus two-way ANOVA showed no main effect of housing F120  0.084 p  .77 but a main effect of restraint F120  20.68 p  .001 on plasma corticosterone.Hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesisThe level of neuronal cell proliferation as an index of neuroge- nesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was examined using BrdUNeuN dual-labelled immunohistochemistry see representa- tive image A. SI showed a significant reduction p  .05 Stu- dent's t-test in cells in the dentate gyrus dual-labelled for BrdU and NeuN compared to GH rats 172 - 19 and 243 - 23 respec- tively showing that isolation rearing attenuated the number of cells proliferating into a neuronal phenotype during the study B.Fig.

p  .05 Unpaired Student's t-test from hippocampal GH control.with hippocampal IL-1b A or other cytokines data not shown.Although there were no significant differences in levels of phospho-mTOR or total mTOR in either brain region according to housing condition there was a small but significant increase in the ratio of phospho-mTOR to total mTOR in the PFC p  .05 which was not observed in the hippocampus p  .78.

Mann-Whitney test revealed significant increases in other genra of bacteria in SI com- pared to GH including Bacillus p  .02 Prevotellaceae UCG-001 p  .04 and Veillonella p  .03 .

This positive correlation continued at the family level Ruminococcaceae q  0.57 p  .01 and genus level Papillibacter q  0.57 p  0.01 Oscillospira q  0.47 p  0.02.

In contrast at the end of the trial SI rats had produced significantly fewer p  .05 faecal boli than GH littermates 1.6 - 0.8 and 3.9 - 0.7 respectively D consistent with the development of an anxiogenic profile by SI.Effects of isolation-rearing on exploration and locomotor activityIn accordance with open field data SI rats displayed significantly higher p  .01 E total horizontal locomotor activity over 1 h in the activity boxes compared to GH rats.

ANOVA showed a main effect of arm type Open vs Closed F144  47.89 p  .001 but no main effect of housing F1 44  0.00001 p  .99 on the pattern of exploration of the two arm types.

A very similar profile was seen for both per- centage open and closed arm time and entries ANOVA showed a significant main effect of arm type F14447.89 p  .001 and F144  12.57 p  .001 respectively but no main effect of housing during development and no significant arm type x housing interac- tion for either parameter.
