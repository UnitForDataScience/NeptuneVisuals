Acidic hot springs pH  6.0 are often found in volcanic areas however hot springs in Malaysia are circumneutral or slightly alkaline.

The microbial community structures in the US and SK hot springs are quite similar both sites cluster together in the biplots in Figures 5AB and share similar OTUs such as Thermus Hydrogenobacter and Caloramator.Generally the dominant phyla in the studied hot springs are similar but the sites differ with respect to the overall composition Figures 3A 4A.

The moderate-temperature springs SS SE and AH were more diverse than the higher- temperature springs at US and DT Table 3.

Even though DT US and SK are high- temperature springs the dominant genera in DT are different from those in the other two springs probably owing to low CN ratio.

Additionally the negative correlation between Cyanobacteria and water temperature was shown for high-temperature springs US SK and DT hot springs.

Biological studies of the Malaysian hot springs are rare because of the lack of comprehensive information on their microbial communities.

In this study we report a cultivation-independent census to describe microbial communities in six hot springs.

The Ulu Slim US Sungai Klah SK Dusun Tua DT Sungai Serai SS Semenyih SE and Ayer Hangat AH hot springs exhibit circumneutral pH with temperatures ranging from 43C to 90C.

In total 59 61 72 73 65 and 52 bacterial phyla were identified in the US SK DT SS SE and AH hot springs respectively.
