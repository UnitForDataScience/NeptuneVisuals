Therefore further research is warranted to elucidate the role of carrageenan and CMC in intestinal inflammation which may help identify novel nutritional strategies that hinder the development of the disease or prevent disease relapse post-EEN treatment.Keywords carboxymethylcellulose carrageenan inflammatory bowel disease microbiota Crohn's disease ulcerative colitisinTRODUCTiOnCrohn's disease CD is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory bowel disease IBD that causes damage to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract resulting in abdominal pain bloody diarrhea intestinal ulceration and often progression toward stricturingpenetrating complications requiring surgery malnutrition impaired growth disability and even mortality  .

The commonly used food additives carra- geenan and carboxymethylcellulose CMC are used to develop intestinal inflammation in animal models.

Animal studies consistently report that carrageenan and CMC induce histopathological features that are typical of IBD while altering the microbiome disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier inhibiting proteins that provide protection against microorganisms and stimulating the elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

For example healthy neonatal pigs fed infant formula with car- rageenan for 28 days had no effect on blood cytokine evaluations IL-1b IL-6 IL-8 and TNF-a  but they would not have had any baseline inflammation and were not exposed to pathogens.THe ROLe OF CMC in inTeSTinAL inFLAMMATiOn in AniMAL MODeLSIn mice given relatively low concentrations of CMC low-grade inflammation and obesitymetabolic syndrome was induced in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in IL-10-- and TLR5-- mice.

In this study CMC dramatically altered microbiota composition in both fecal and intestinal-adherent bacteria and the authors con- cluded that chronic exposure to CMC resulted in erosion of the protective function of the mucus increased bacterial adherence and a more pro-inflammatory microbiota .

These results suggest that the microbiota may be a key direct target of CMC to drive chronic intestinal inflammation.Swidsinski et al.

With a healthy gut mucosal barrier an individual maintains a homeostasis where the passage of nutrients ions and water across the intestinal epithelium into the mesenteric blood stream is tightly regulated while translocation of dietary antigens and components of the microbiome is prevented  and the active crosstalk between a diverse microbiome and the intestinal immune system leads to immune tolerance.

more studies of the intestinal response to the widely used emulsifiers carrageenan and CMC together with other features of a Western diet such as reduced dietary fiber intake are eagerly awaited .

CMC is listed in the Food and Drug Administration's database of GRAS substances  and CMC is also included in the Safety and Toxicity of Excipients for Paediatrics STEP database   a resource developed by the European Paediatric Formulation Initiative and the United States Paediatric Formulation Initiative in collaboration for storage and rapideffortless access to the safety and toxicological data of commonly used excipients.ROLe OF DieT in iBD ePiDeMiOLOGY AnD TReATMenTThe increasing incidence rate of IBD worldwide with the highest incidence and prevalence being in Westernized countries  has been associated with increased consumption of a Western diet .

Through large network studies such as the Canadian Institutes for Health Research supported Inflammation Microbiome Alimentation GastroIntestinal and Neuropsychiatric effects IMAGINe considerable efforts are being made to investigate the potential contributions of dietary factors to IBD pathophysiology as a dysregulated interplay of genetic environmental microbial and immunological factors   and so more details on the role of diet including foodadditives such as carrageenan and CMC in IBD may be discov- ered in the near future and inform dietary recommendations and medical treatment of IBD.COnCLUSiOnCarrageenan and CMC administered in animal models consist- entlyresultinintestinalulcerationswithhistopathologicalfeatures similar to human IBD.
