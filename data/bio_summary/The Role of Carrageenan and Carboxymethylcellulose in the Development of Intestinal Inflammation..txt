therefore further research is warranted to elucidate the role of carrageenan and cmc in intestinal inflammation which may help identify novel nutritional strategies that hinder the development of the disease or prevent disease relapse post-een treatment.keywords carboxymethylcellulose carrageenan inflammatory bowel disease microbiota crohn's disease ulcerative colitisintroductioncrohn's disease cd is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory bowel disease ibd that causes damage to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract resulting in abdominal pain bloody diarrhea intestinal ulceration and often progression toward stricturingpenetrating complications requiring surgery malnutrition impaired growth disability and even mortality  .

therefore a perfect storm setting in which cd patients increase their cmccarrageenan intake but limit their intake of other dietary fibers is created which could propagate or exacerbate the existing dysbiosis toward more mucin-degradation and which could enhance the susceptibility for mucosa-associated pathogens.food additives and intestinal inflammation in humansthe reports above of commonly used food additives causing intestinal inflammation in animal models have triggered inves- tigations of how they may lead to inflammation in the human gastrointestinal tract although perfectly corresponding human studies are of course unethical to conduct.

with a healthy gut mucosal barrier an individual maintains a homeostasis where the passage of nutrients ions and water across the intestinal epithelium into the mesenteric blood stream is tightly regulated while translocation of dietary antigens and components of the microbiome is prevented  and the active crosstalk between a diverse microbiome and the intestinal immune system leads to immune tolerance.

kappa-carrageenan induces the disrup- tion of intestinal epithelial caco-2 monolayers by promoting the interaction between intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells.
