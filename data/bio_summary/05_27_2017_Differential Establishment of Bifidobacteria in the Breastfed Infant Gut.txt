Proposed mechanisms for the differential bifidobacterial abundance phenomenon may be broken down into two broad categories mirroring Bass Becking's statement either the gut environments of some infants are differentially selective against bifidobacteria or there are higher barriers to bifidobacteria getting into infants in some places than others bifidobacteria are in fact not everywhere.

Using this conceptual framework we will discuss various hypotheses for how bifidobacteria are acquired by infants and how the gut microbiota is shaped in ways that may impact the immediate and future health of an infant.Environmental Selection in the GutMany factors that influence the gut microbiome of infants fall under the general umbrella of selection-based determination including the antimicrobial ingredients of breast milk lysozyme lactoferrin and antibodies the infant immune system and infant exposure to antimicrobials 23-25.

Influence of maternal bifidobacteria on the establishment of bifidobacteria colonizing the gut in infants.

This lack of colonization may be due either to differences in the environmental conditions in the gastrointestinal tract of uncolonized infants which prohibit the growth of bifidobacteria or a dearth of sources from which infants may acquire these specialized bacterial species.

For these public health reasons among other motivations bifidobacterial levels have been studied in infants across the globe.Interestingly it seems that not all infants have large amounts of bifidobacteria in their stool 14.

Several studies have previously observed a trade-off between the abundance of bifidobacteria and Proteobacteria in infants which may partially be the result of the import-and-degrade strategy of HMG consumption of some bifidobacteria which unlike Bacteroides do not leave behind degradation products for future proteobacterial consumption 4 20 37 46 Fig.

However recent studies have revealed that bifidobacteria are often absent in the gut microbiome of breastfed infants in some locations.

Comparisons of worldwide datasets Norway 15 Sweden 16 Canada 17 Italy18 Switzerland 19 Bangladesh 4 the USA 20 Malawi and Finland 21 show that the gut microbiomes of healthy breastfed infants in some populations had lower amounts of bifidobacteria than others.

Cesarean section birth limits exposure to possible inoculation both via maternal stool during birth and via vaginal contact and as a result cesarean section-born infants often possess distinct gut microbial assemblages which are occasionally lower in bifidobacteria 17 32 54.
