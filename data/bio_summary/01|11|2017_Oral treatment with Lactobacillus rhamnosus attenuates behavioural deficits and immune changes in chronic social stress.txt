Stress reduced the expression of GABAAa2 F1 30  6.126 p  0.019 and GABAB1b mRNA F1 30  5.961 p  0.021 in the frontal cortex in the absence of a treatment effect Additional file Figure S2G H. There were no effects of either stress or treatment on GABAAa2 or GABAAa2 mRNA levels in the hippocampus Additional file Figure S2I J.These data demonstrate that microbial treatment partially corrects the adverse effects of stress on social preference exploration and anxiety-like behaviours.Microbial treatment regulates stress-induced alterations in the immune phenotypeThe immune system represents an important interface for bacteria-host signalling and has been hypothesized as a potential effector of gut-brain communication CSD increased the population of IL-10 CD4 CD25 T cells CD3 F1 16  6.114 p  0.025 Fig.

Statistical significance is denoted as  p  0.05  p  0.01 and  p  0.001.ResultsMicrobial treatment modulates specific stress-induced behavioural deficitsChronic social defeat CSD reveals distinct phenoty- pes--susceptible and resilient--based on behaviour in the aggressor approach-avoidance test  CSD induced expression of both phenotypes in either treat- ment group with no difference in the proportion of re- silient mice 18.1 633 of vehicle-treated defeated mice and 15.6 532 of defeated mice treated with JB- 1 until CSD cessation.

Entries into the light compartment 24 h following the final defeat were significantly different between the CONVEH and DEFVEH groups but not between the CONVEH and DEFJB-1 or DEFVEH and DEFJB-1 groups F1 26  6.738 p  0.004 post hoc CONVEH versus DEFVEH at 24 h p  0.01 further corroborating the anxiolytic- like effects of JB-1 Fig.

However future assess- ment of plasma metabolites may identify circulating fac- tors produced by gut microbes or induced in the host which have more direct effects on the central nervous system.One limitation of the current study is that we only assessed the faecal microbiota and it is possible that JB- 1 stabilized site-specific microbiota for example in the small intestine or specifically associated with the epithe- lium elsewhere that are involved in gut-brain signalling.

Furthermore factors such as birth delivery mode have marked effects on the microbiota community during early life that are no longer distinguishable in adulthood Our own observations suggest that stress-induced disrup- tions in the microbiota appear stable for a prolonged period following stress exposure.

However a direct action of JB-1 on gut-brain signalling is further supported by previous studies using in vivo and ex vivo models demonstrating that it can directly or indirectly activate the vagus nerve and that an intact vagus is required to mediate the effects of this bacter- ium at least on the baseline behaviour of Balbc mice Collectively these data suggest that JB-1 independ- ently of changes in the microbiota can recruit host signalling pathways likely including vagal afferents that mediate the effects of the bacteria on severe CSD- induced neurobehavioural changes.

We selected Lactoba- cillus rhamnosus JB-1TM JB-1 as our test organism as oral treatment with this strain was previously demon- strated to lead to changes in neurotransmitter levels in the brains of mice and to have anxiolytic and anti- depressant-like activity on baseline behaviours--effects dependent on an intact vagus nerve Feeding the JB- 1 strain also modulates enteric nervous system function increases the frequency of vagal afferent firing  and has well-described anti-inflammatory and immuno- regulatory effects -To elucidate metabolites that may drive effects of bacteria on the brain we investi- gated candidate functional pathways using metabolomics profiling.

c.This suggests that administration of JB-1 promoted systemic changes in the immunoregulatory phenotype and influenced the effects of chronic stress on host immunity.Microbial treatment does not prevent stress-induced dysbiosis of the microbiotaMultiple groups have confirmed that stress induces dys- biosis correction of which can impart posi- tive effects on the host Thus we investigated whether JB-1 exerted its neurobehavioural effects on the stressed host by restoring the microbiota.Prior to social defeat although significantly greater levels of L. rhamnosus cells per gram of faeces were detected in mice administered JB-1 Additional file Figure S1D JB-1 did not significantly alter the overall profile of the microbial community Additional file Figure S1E or post-defeat body weight across groups.
