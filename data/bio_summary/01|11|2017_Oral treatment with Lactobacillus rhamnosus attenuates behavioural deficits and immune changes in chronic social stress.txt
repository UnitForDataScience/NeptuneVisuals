to investigate sig- nals that play a role in jb-1-driven vagal signalling we explored for metabolites that were elevated exclusively in jb-1-treated stressed mice however no such metabo-lites were detected q  0.1.we investigated functional pathways that were altered by exposure to csd but not in jb-1-treated mice.

examination of defeated mice 3 weeks following csd revealed en- during structural changes in the faecal microbial community defeated mice continued to show re- duced diversity and richness in the variety of species represented while exhibiting broad-scale changes in overall composition and profile.

furthermore we examined the duration of stress-induced disruptions in the microbiota and the possibility of whether administration of a single bacterial strain during stress exposure can facilitate recovery of the dysbiotic community.methodsanimalsmale c57bl6 mice 8 weeks old and cd-1 retired breeders were acquired from charles river montreal canada.

together these data suggest that jb-1 treatment failed to prevent stress-induced alterations to the microbiota community.stress-induced dysbiosis persists for at least 3 weeks there is growing evidence from human reports indicat- ing co-morbidity between psychiatric conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd and gastrointestinal disorders which are associated with persistent dysbiosis thus 3 weeks following the cessation of csd we examined the endurance of stress- induced microbial disruptions and the possibility of whether treatment facilitated recovery.group differences due to stress exposure were still evi- dent at this time point analysis of similarities ano- sim r  0.1307 p  0.009. within-group distances in conveh were smaller than the distances versus def veh mice indicating separation of conveh and defveh groups due to stress exposure fig.

notably the tempering of stress-induced changes occurred in the absence of any effects of treatment on stress-related dis- ruptions in the microbiota suggesting that jb-1 directlymodulates gut-brain signalling pathways independently of the microbial community.following csd jb-1-treated stressed mice as opposed to vehicle-treated did not show avoidance of novel so- cial stimuli exhibited more frequent rearing behaviour in the oft and showed reduced aversion towards the light chamber ldt.

however a direct action of jb-1 on gut-brain signalling is further supported by previous studies using in vivo and ex vivo models demonstrating that it can directly or indirectly activate the vagus nerve and that an intact vagus is required to mediate the effects of this bacter- ium at least on the baseline behaviour of balbc mice collectively these data suggest that jb-1 independ- ently of changes in the microbiota can recruit host signalling pathways likely including vagal afferents that mediate the effects of the bacteria on severe csd- induced neurobehavioural changes.

indeed along with other groups we have demonstrated the top-down effect of psychological stress on the structure and function of the microbiota resulting in reduced species diversity and richness an altered community profile and shifts in functional pathways 1- given microbial regulation of host signalling at the mucosal interface between microbiota and host disruptions in this community may lead to systemic changes in peripheral signals for instance immune dysregulation has been implicated in psychological stressors and psychiatric disorders however much remains to be determined regarding how bottom-up signalling along the gut- brain axis might be utilized to modulate stress-related changes in behaviour and neural function.the aim of the present study was to investigate therole of microbe-induced gut-to-brain signalling on the central and systemic disruptions induced by chronic ex- posure to a psychosocial stressor.
