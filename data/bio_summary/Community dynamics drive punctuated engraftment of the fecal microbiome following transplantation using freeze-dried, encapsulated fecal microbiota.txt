Therefore complete engraftment successful and sustained trans- fer of donor communities may not be essential for the success of FMT in resolving CDI but is likely nec- essary for rapid reestablishment of gut microbial com- munity structure and function.A preliminary feasibility study recently showed that orally-administered capsules containing frozen donor material which we term capsule FMT resulted in resolution of rCDI in 70 of patients after an initial course and 90 after follow-up courses among patients who relapsed.The authors noted that the time to resolution of symptoms by capsule FMT was significantly longer than that observed for administra- tion via colonoscopy or nasogastric tube FMT P D 0.03.

Among the cured patients the days and weeks time points were significantly different P  0.012 while this was not the case for patients who showed recurrence P 0.542.

Fecal microbiota in samples collected 1 to 2 months post-FMT were significantly differentiated from those obtained from patients who showed recurrence P  0.006 but were similar to samples taken from cured patients after one week post-FMT or samples collected 2 months post-FMT P 0.127.

In addition samples from cured patients taken at least one week post-FMT showed significantly greater donor similarity than that observed in samples from patients who had recurrence P  0.050.

Samples from cured patients are black and patients who had recurrence are gray.similarity to donor fecal microbial community struc- ture determined by SourceTracker was achieved.

However patients who were cured of rCDI showed a significant shift after one week with reduc- tions in these families that were not observed in patients who had a recurrence.

Samples were main- tained in the patients' freezers before collection and were transported to the laboratory on dry ice and stored at 80oC until DNA extraction.Throughout the course of the clinical experience the number and frequency at which patients were asked to collected fecal samples varied Supplemen- tary Table S1.

However only samples col- lected from patients who experienced recurrence within 2 months of FMT were considered members of a recurrence group for microbiota analyses.Due to the uneven nature of sample collection and collection of longer-term samples from patients who eventually experienced recurrence samples were grouped for analysis by the time period in which they were collected.

Unlike standard antibiotic therapy which only worsens gut dysbiosis and leaves patients even more vulnerable to reinfection FMT restores the diversity and functionality of gut micro- bial communities.

Furthermore FMT administered orally using frozen encapsulated donor material has shown similar results to other methods of administration.Characterization of the gut microbiome of pre-FMT rCDI patients has consistently revealed in multipleCONTACT Christopher StaleyBioTechnology Institute University of Minnesota 140 Gortner Lab 1479 Gortner Ave Saint Paul MN 55108.Color versions of one or more of the figures in the article can be found online at .Supplemental data for this article can be accessed on the .yThese authors contributed equally to the work.c 2017 Taylor  Francisstudies reduced relative abundances of taxa within the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes concurrent with increased relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacilli relative to healthy individuals.Following FMT the abundances of several prominent genera increase including Bacteroides as well as Blautia Coprococcus Faecalibacterium Papillibacter and Roseburia in the class Clostridia Firmicutes similar to what is seen in healthy donors.Concurrently the relative abundances of Enterobacteriaceae including Enterobacter Escheri- chia and Raoultella as well as Lactobacillus and Veillo- nella decrease following FMT.
