At the time of ensilage the plant material harbours a range of microorganisms the epiphytic community Muck 2013 but the fermentation process favours the multipli- cation of lactic acid bacteria LAB Ennahar et al.

Attempts have been made to compensate for the low count of LAB in the epiphytic community and also to improve the fermentation efficiency quality and aerobic stability of the silage by applying inoculant of laboratory- expanded LAB to the ensiled plants McDonald 1991 Filya 2003 Holzer et al.

A knowl- edge of which LAB species are key to the production of healthy silage would aid the formulation of silage inoculants designed to bolster the natural epiphytic com- munity.The composition of the silage microbiome has beenexplored using various microbiological and DNA-based techniques Langston and Bouma 1960 Ennahar et al.
