the villus contains entero- cytes goblet cells enteroendocrine cells and tuft cells whereas the crypt houses transit amplifying cells paneth cells and stem cells  .

we will now discuss the various immune cells implicated in nec including t cells tregs th17 cells iels b cells mac- rophages and dcs.t cellsthere is increasing evidence that immune cells have a primary role in the development of nec including but not limited tot cells.

the cells of the intestinal epithelium and immune cells express tlrs and nod proteins which can detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as the lps of gram-negative bacteria and flagella and consequently initiate an appropriate response to these bacterial stressors .specifically in the case of tlr4 activation signaling results in nuclear factor-kb nf-kb activation subsequent cytokine production resulting in an acute inflammatory response .tlrs are expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells of the lamina propria and are involved in epithelial cell proliferation iga production maintenance of tight junctions and amp expression   .

this study highlights the important role of gd iels in intestinal barrier protection and suggests a potential cellular target for nec prevention.b cells and immunoglobulinsb cells are both important antigen-presenting cells apcs and integral members of adaptive immunity with their ability to secrete immunoglobulins as plasma cells most notably iga in the context of neonatal immunity.

thus this study demonstrates the principal role of immune cells in nec specifically cd4 t cells and their relationship to tlr4 signaling.relationship between tregs and th17 cellsthe roles of immune cells in nec are dynamic and there is an imbalance of immune cells that favor a exaggerated pro- inflammatory state.

together these cells comprise the epithelium which we will now discuss in further detail.enterocytesenterocytes iecs are the predominant absorptive cells of the epithelium defined by the presence of microvilli but the role of enterocytes is not limited to nutrient absorption rather they are important cells in the preservation of intestinal integrity and mucosal immunity -.

moreover in defa5 transgenic mice there was a loss of segmented filamentous bacteria and interleu- kin 17 il-17-producing lamina propria t cells substantiating the role of a-defensins and thus paneth cells in influencing the microbiota of the gut and modulating the intestinal immunologic response to pathogens .the role of paneth cells in disease has been well characterized in the studies on inflammatory bowel disease ibd specifically ileal crohn's disease .

nonetheless more studies are necessary to understand the role of enteroendocrine cells during intestinal inflammation and more specifically nec.tuft cellsfinally there is auniquecelltypeoftheintestinalepitheliumcalled tuft cells which are thought to be taste-chemosensory cells found in both the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract  .

this suggests that the tregs serve to provide a protective role in intes- tinal homeostasis which is disrupted in nec.further studies demonstrated that th17 recruitment and treg depletionresultedinapoptosis of lgr5 intestinal stem cells within the crypts of lieberkuhn in an experimental model of nec .after exposure to recombinant il-17 enteroids derived from intestinal stem cells exhibited decreased proliferation decreased differentiation and increased apoptosis .

accordingly enterocytes are vital cells of the epithelium with the roles in the maintenance of the gut barrier and commensal bacteria absorption of nutrients and communication with the immune cells of the lamina propria.goblet cellsgoblet cells are particularly important with their role in generat- ing the mucus layer of the intestine preventing the interaction between pathogenic bacteria and the epithelium while provid- ing support for commensal bacteria antimicrobial peptides amps and secretory immunoglobulin a iga .

rather there are several mechanisms by which these cells cooperate with the microbiotafor example l cells are a subset of enteroendocrine cells that secrete glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 glp-1 and glp-2 .

although there is currently no known role of tuft cells in the pathogenesis of nec these studies provide evidence that these cells are actively involved in the mucosal immunity of the intestine in addition to their chemosensory roles.immune cellsimmune cells that compose the innate and adaptive immunity of the intestine exist in the epithelium and lamina propria .

several cell types inhabit the lamina propria including but not limited to dcs macrophages neutrophils immunocompetent t and b cells and t regulatory cells tregs in addition to mesenchymal cell types such as endothelial cells  .

antigens are delivered by m cells of the epithelium and upon activation generate b cells and plasma cells to maintain mucosal immunity .

moreover goblet cells are also capable of delivering luminal antigens to a subset of underlying dendritic cells dcs cd103 lamina propria dcs which have tolerogenic properties thereby assist- ing with the maintenance of commensal bacteria and intestinal homeostasis .goblet cell differentiation is determined by the activity of the notch signaling pathway .
