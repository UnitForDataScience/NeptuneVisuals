As not enough time has passed to make long-term predictions about the efficacy of these vaccines continued monitoring of the nasopharyngeal microflora and causes of AOM will be important in the future in various parts of the world.Although the total effect on pneumococcal AOM has not been as promising as for invasive disease a major benefit with the current vaccines is that a 10-26 reduction in recurrent AOM and a 24-32 reduction in severe and complicated AOM in- cluding a reduction of ventilation tube insertion have been ob- served  .

The study also shows that H. influenzae was less likely to be isolated from the first incidence of AOM in any individual and also showed that S. pneumoniae was responsible for the majority of recurrent and more compli- cated AOM cases.Heron MP Smith BL.

A fourth pathogen worth mentioning is S. pyogenes which although it only causes a small percentage of AOM cases is the second most common organism associated with AOM complications .

This is despite the 55-77 reduction in vaccine serotype-induced AOM compared to the prevaccine era   and the 35-46 reduction in all pneu- mococcal AOM   .

Interestingly the all- cause AOM is estimated to be reduced by only 0-7 in many regions of the world    despite a reduction inpneumococcal OM which suggest both that a concomitant in- crease in serotype replacement by non-vaccine serotypes is taking place to some extent and that AOM caused by other organisms is increasing.

It also shows that despite a decrease in all-pneumococcal AOM the all-cause AOM remains unaffected suggesting that other organisms replace pneumococci as pathogens in AOM.Moffitt KL Malley R. Next generation pneumococcal vaccines.

Besides causing infection on their own viruses commonly predisposes individuals to bacterial AOM that is generally more symptomatic and primarily caused by the bacterial triad Streptococcus pneumoniae the pneumococ- cus Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis .

pneumoniae the focus of this review accounts for 30- 50 of all AOM cases in different parts of the world which amounts to approximately 300 million cases annually   .

pneumoniae and H. influenzae in vivo is not clear as studies have shown that non-typeable H. influenzae promoted pneu- mococcal biofilm formation in vitro  as well as in the chinchilla model of AOM and reduced the incidence of sys- temic disease .

and an increased colonization and risk for AOM with S. pneumoniae.
