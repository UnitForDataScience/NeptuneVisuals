This article is an open access publicationAbstractPurpose of Review This study aimed to review the literature regarding the mechanisms of transition from asymptomatic colonization to induction of otitis media and how the insight into the pathogenesis of otitis media has the potential to help design future otitis media-directed vaccines.Recent Findings Respiratory viruses have long been shown to predispose individuals to bacterial respiratory infections such as otitis media.

This is the first major study indicating that in areas with high incidence of otitis media more recent conjugate vaccines with higher valency have shown a better protection against all-cause otitis media than in the rest of the world.Block SL Hedrick J Harrison CJ Tyler R Smith A Findlay R Keegan E. Community-wide vaccination with the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate significantly alters the microbiology of acute otitis media.

Trends in antibiotic resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from nasopharyngeal flora in children with acute otitis media in France before and after 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction.

Despite this OM is still a major reason for outpatient antibiotic prescription in the USA  and in many other parts of the world.116Curr Otorhinolaryngol Rep 2017 5115-124In contrast secretory otitis media SOM sometimes referred to as otitis media with effusion is defined as a chronic inflam- matory condition mainly affecting children between the age of 3 and 7.

Development of antibod- ies against pneumococcal proteins alpha-enolase immunoglobulin A1 protease streptococcal lipoprotein rotamase A and putative proteinase maturation protein A in relation to pneumococcal car- riage and otitis media.

An understanding of the pathogenesis of AOM and the bacterial changes associated with virulence has great potential to provide clues to future effective vaccine targets.Acknowledgements This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases USA the Swedish Medical Research Council VR Osterlunds Foundation Lund Sweden APH and the Royal Physiographic Society Lund Sweden and the Swedish Society for Medical Research CB.Compliance with Ethical StandardsConflict of Interest Dr. Caroline Bergenfelz and Dr. Anders P.

Alpha-enolase streptococcal lipoprotein rotamase A putative proteinase maturation protein histidine triad protein D pneumolysin pneumococcal surface adhesin A PsaA and pneumococcal surface protein A PspA are potential proteins that could be used for AOM-specific vaccine protection in the future -.Experiments with PspA have shown that the presence of anti-PspA antibodies in children reduces the risk of AOM .

As not enough time has passed to make long-term predictions about the efficacy of these vaccines continued monitoring of the nasopharyngeal microflora and causes of AOM will be important in the future in various parts of the world.Although the total effect on pneumococcal AOM has not been as promising as for invasive disease a major benefit with the current vaccines is that a 10-26 reduction in recurrent AOM and a 24-32 reduction in severe and complicated AOM in- cluding a reduction of ventilation tube insertion have been ob- served  .
