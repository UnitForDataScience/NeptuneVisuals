In addition Simpson diversity index and Shannon diversity index at 3 distance were calculated in the CL com- munity program Chunlab Inc.. Good's method was used to calculate sequencing coverage.15Random subsampling was conducted to equalize the read size of samples for comparing different read sizes among samples.

Although it failed to reach statistical significance due to the small sample size the proportion of genus Pseudomonas was very high in the samples of patients with stage II-IV CRC compared in the samples of patients with stage I CRC 59.3 vs. 0.3 P  0.064.DISCUSSIONWhen there is change in the gut microbiota in patient with colorectal neoplasm it is very difficult to determine whether it is cause or consequence of colorectal neoplasm.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of mucosa-associated gut microbiota in the colorectal carcinogenesis.Methods We collected biopsy samples of normal rectal mucosa during colonoscopy from healthy control and patients with conventional adenoma SSA and colorectal cancer CRC respectively n  6.

Pyrosequencing for 16S rRNA gene of bacteria was performed to compare gut microbiota.Results The most abundant phylum in total samples was Proteobacteria 55.6 followed by Firmicutes 27.4 and Bacteroidetes 11.6.

The proportion of genus Pseudomonas was very high in the samples of patients with stage II-IV CRC compared with those with stage I CRC 59.3 vs. 0.3 P  0.064.Conclusions Our study suggests no significant role of mucosa-associated gut microbiota in the colorectal carcinogenesis.

Further study for many samples or using fecal material could be helpful.J Cancer Prev 201722108-114Key Words Microbiota Colonic neoplasms Colon cancer Colon adenoma Sessile serrated adenomaINTRODUCTIONChronic inflammation following chronic infection is one of main mechanism in human carcinogenesis.

Because it ismore consistent and interacts with host cells more directly and intimately than fecal-luminal microbiota it is considered more closely related with CRC.49 Nevertheless to acquire it endoscopic biopsy which is invasive procedure is required and bowel preparation for colonoscopy can change mucosa-associated microbiota.12 Therefore studies for gut microbiota and CRC often used fecal-luminal microbiota rather than mucosa-associated microbiota.From this background the aim of this study is to compare mucosa-associated gut microbiota among healthy control pati- ents with conventional adenoma SSA and CRC.MATERIALS AND METHODSSubjects and tissue preparationWe collected biopsy samples of normal rectal mucosa during colonoscopy from four different groups healthy control patients with conventional adenoma SSA and CRC respectively.

Rectal mucosal tissues of healthy control were acquired from samples that were collected for other study IRB No.

Tissues of subjects with SSA were also acquired from samples that were collected for another study IRB No.

All mucosal samples were obtained from normal proximal rectum at approximately 18 cm from anal verge by colonoscopic biopsy.
