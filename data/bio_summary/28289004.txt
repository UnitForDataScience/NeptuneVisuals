Consistent with the effects of dietary exposure impacting microbial function vegetarians and vegans without L-carnitine dietary intake produce less TMAO as compared with omnivorous subjects with correspondingly distinct microbiota composition.2 We have also confirmed a mechanistic role for both gut microbes and TMATMAO generation in atherogenesis tissue cholesterol balance and thrombosis risks.1-4 In micediet-induced increases in systemic TMAO levels decrease reverse cholesterol transport and bile acid transport as well as altering bile acid composition and pool size.2Fulfilling one of the essential Koch's postulates microbial transplantation studies have confirmed gut microbe-dependent TMATMAO involvement in atherosclerosis plaque development and more recently TMAO-dependent enhanced susceptibility for thrombosis.4 This latter finding followed the discovery that TMAO modulates stimulus-dependent calcium mobilization in platelets enhancing platelet responsiveness and thrombosis potential in vivo.4 In recent proof-of-concept studies small molecule inhibitors of microbial TMA and TMAO production have been used to directly inhibit diet-induced atherosclerosis in animal models without altering microbial survival in contrast to antibiotic therapy5 which brings a therapeutic strategy of drugging the microbiome closer to reality.Challenges and Potential PitfallsMany studies explore the gut microbiome's role in cardiovascular diseases by characterizing traditional ecological indicators of microbial community composition and diversity between those with versus without cardiovascular disease.

Using untargeted metabolomics as a discovery platform we identified TMAO as a strong predictor of CAD risk and then through animal studies revealed TMAO's causal link to atherogenesis.1 Our mechanistic studies show an obligatory role for gut microbes in TMAO generation from trimethylamine TMA -containing nutrients such as phosphatidylcholine choline and L-carnitine in both mice and humans.1-3 In humans circulating TMAO levels increase 4-8 hours after ingestion of phosphatidylcholine andor L- carnitine and are largely normalized within 24 hours in the setting of preserved renal clearance.

Even pathogenic pathways with proof-of-Wilson Tang and HazenPage 3concept demonstrations in animal models that fulfill Koch's postulates and have mechanism biomarkers such as TMATMAO will still require prospective validation with clinical studies testing specific interventions targeting these pathways to lower major adverse cardiac events.ConclusionThe TMATMAO pathways likely represent only one of many microbe-dependent pathways that will ultimately be linked to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis and prove to be an important diagnostic and therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.

For example gut microbes help with the digestion of nutrients prevent significant colonization of pathogens and promote gut immunity while the host provides a favorable environment for microbial survival.Gut microbiome changes so-called dysbiosis leading to increased long-term susceptibility to disease can originate early in life similar to that of traditional risk factors.
