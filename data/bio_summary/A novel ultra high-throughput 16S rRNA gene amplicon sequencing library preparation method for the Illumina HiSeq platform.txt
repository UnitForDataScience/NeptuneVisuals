Bias caused by sample indexing both in PCR1 Dataset 1 Additional file Table S3 and PCR2 Dataset 2 Additional file Table S4 reactions as well as the effects of DNA template amount used for PCR and PCR cycle number Dataset 3 Additional file Table S5 were evaluated by sequencing the mock community 160 times in a single MiSeq run.

Finally we compared our sequencing technique with the widely used EMP protocol Dataset 7 Additional file  Table S9.Effect of PCR1 indexingTwelve forward and eight reverse PCR1 primers were used in this design to generate 96 PCR1 index combinationsDataset 1 Additional file Table S3 i.e.

We compared relative species abundances measured in five sets of PCR1 products four per set for a total of 20 samples amplified using 35 cycles with each set of 4 samples using a different PCR2 index pri- mer Dataset 2 Additional file Table S4 and 10 cycles of amplification.

Possible ways of reducing this source of bias are by first using an unindexed PCR followed by either ligation of index and adapter sequences or by using a second step indexed PCR  .

Plasmid concentrations were then measured before blending to equal proportions at a final concentration of 1e9 plasmidsml.Library preparationFor an initial MiSeq sequencing run the PCR1 amplifica- tion was carried out with the following reaction mixture 9 ml H2O 10 ml 5Prime Hot Master Mix Gaithersburg MD USA 2.5 ml of 1 mM PCR1 forward primer 2.5 ml of 1 mM PCR1 reverse primer and 1 ml mock community template at either 2.5e6 or 2.5e7 moleculesml.

We did not observe any significant interaction effects between template amount and PCR cycle number p  0.94 and 0.98 for PCR1 and PCR2 respectively Adonis models or be- tween PCR1 and PCR2 cycle regime p  0.82 Adonis model.

To examine this effect we amplified the same template the mock- community library 2.5e6 input molecules per reaction using 96 PCR1 primer combinations employing 35 cycles of PCR1 and 10 cycles of PCR2 amplification the same PCR2 forward and reverse primer was used for all reac- tions.

A second PCR reaction PCR2 is then per- formed using each amplicon pool as template which primes on the ends of the oligos used for PCR1 Fig.

For later HiSeq sequencing runs Additional files and  Tables S6-8 the library preparation procedure was identical to the MiSeq protocol with 35 and 10 cycles for PCR1 and PCR2 re- spectively with the following exception the repeated melting steps during both PCR amplifications were increased from 10 to 30 s.Illumina sequencingPaired-end sequencing was performed on a MiSeq Illumina San Diego CA USA using v3 reagents generating 300 bp reads per end or on a HiSeq 2500 Illumina in Rapid mode with v2 reagents producing 250 bp reads per end according to manufacturer's in- structions at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre OsloNorway.

Furthermore within each combination of PCR cycle number regimes initial PCR1 amplification was carried out using either relatively low 2.5e6 molecules or high 2.5e7 molecules amounts of DNA template 24 samples per treatment.
