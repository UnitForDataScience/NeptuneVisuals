Furthermore differences have been found in the microbiome in severe asthma compared to non-severe asthma and controls suggesting that the microbial communities in the airway may influence disease phenotype 30.The microbiome in IPFThe first exploratory application of a culture-independent molecular technique in IPF studied the microbiome in BAL from 20 patients diagnosed with an IIP including 17 with IPF and 2 controls 31.

Given the findings of a trial evaluating co-trimoxazole in IPF one of the key questions for future IPF studies will be whether specific microbiome signatures in patients should be targeted with prophylactic antibiotics to improve survival.AcknowledgementsNone.FootnoteConflicts of Interest The authors have no conflicts of interestto declare.ReferencesRaghu G Collard HR Egan JJ et al.

IPF microbiome reviewWillner D Daly J Whiley D et al.

The first study to evaluate the microbiological colonisation of the lower airways in a small cohort of 22 IPF patients using quantitative culture methods found pathogens in 36 IPF patients but nothing in the lavage of control patients.

Interestingly bacterial DNA was not detected in 5 out of 8 patients colonized with pneumocystis jirovecii suggesting this fungus may impair bacterial colonisation of the airways 31.A small study investigated the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota in a heterogenous group of 18 ILD patients including 5 with IIP 6 patients with pneumocystis pneumonia and 9 healthy controls 32.

As our understanding of the IPF microbiome evolves along with refinement and advances in sampling and sequencing methodologies we may be able to use microbial signatures as a biomarker to guide prognostication and even treatment stratification in this devastating disease.Keywords Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF microbiome infection 16SSubmitted Oct 26 2016.

In ex-planted lungs from a cystic fibrosis transplant patient 16s rDNA sequencing of tissue sections revealed regional differences in microbial communities within the lung 43.It is feasible that as our understanding of the IPF microbiome evolves and sampling and sequencing methodologies are refined the composition of a patient's microbiome may act as a biomarker to guide prognostication and treatment stratification.

This review will explore our current knowledge of the role played by the respiratory microbiome in IPF and highlight areas of controversy and future research priorities.Why should we think about infection in IPFImmunosuppression with prednisolone and azathioprine in combination with N-acetylcysteine NAC increased the risk of death and hospitalisation compared with placebo in IPF patients 12.

High- throughput bacterial 16s-rRNA sequencing has been shown to identify bacterial DNA in 95.7 BAL specimens compared conventional culture techniques which detected bacteria in 39.1 BAL samples 23.Annals of Translational Medicine Vol 5 No 12 June 2017Page 3 of 6Applying these molecular techniques to characterise the microbial flora of the respiratory tract in patients and healthy controls has highlighted associations which suggest the interaction between the microbiome and host may be relevant to the aetiology and progression of lung disease 24-29.
