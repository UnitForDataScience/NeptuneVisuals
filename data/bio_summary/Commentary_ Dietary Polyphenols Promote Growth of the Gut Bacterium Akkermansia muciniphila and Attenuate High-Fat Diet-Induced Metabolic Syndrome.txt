Research by Roopchand and colleagues demonstrated that concord grape polyphenols GP led to changes in the gut microbiota and reduction in conditions associated with metabolic syndrome arising from high-fat diet HFD in mice .

Potential mechanisms by which Akkermansia influ- ences the host microbiota leading to these beneficial outcomes are depicted below .These and other studies suggest that dietary polyphenols play a role in the modulation of the gut microbiota that may favor positive outcomes.

This is because two different polyphenols can give complementary and dissimilar effects on the gut micro- biota as observed in black tea and red wine grape extracts .As such more studies are needed to unravel the bioactivity of this class of xenobiotics to fully understand their effects on the host.autHor ContrIButIonSThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and approved it for publication.reFerenCeSRoopchand DE Carmody RN Kuhn P Moskal K Rojas-Silva P Turnbaugh PJ et al.

When compared to the other diet groups mice on the GP-SPI diet had lower body weight and adiposity though the food intake was similar across the groups .Also mice on the GP-SPI diet reduced markers of systemic inflammation as IL-6 was unde- tectable and low levels of TNF-a and bacterial lipopolysaccharide was detected in the serum in comparison to the SPI group.

Glut2 a gene for glucose transport was also significantly lower in the jejunum tissue when compared to the mice on the SPI-diet .Grape polyphenol-based diet led to decreased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and significant increase in the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in the cecal and fecal microbiota .

However another study did not find a causal effect of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in relation to obesity .Similarly the effects of dietary polyphenol from cranberry extract were evaluated in mice fed with high-fathigh-sucrose diet for 8 weeks .

Administration of live A. muciniphila reversed the symptoms of obesity and metabolic syndrome in HFD mice by reducing adiposity inflammatory markers insulin resist- ance and improved gut barrier .
