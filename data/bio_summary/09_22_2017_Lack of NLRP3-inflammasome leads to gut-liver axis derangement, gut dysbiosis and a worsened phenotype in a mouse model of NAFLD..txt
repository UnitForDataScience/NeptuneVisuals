our data expand previous observations from henao-mejia showing that colonic dysbiosis is present in mice lacking asc-inflammasome a downstream of nlpr3 upon mcd diet and bacterial products derived from the intestine trigger hepatic tlr4 and tlr9 activation which was associated with disease progression.several metabolic phenomena could explain the higher degree of steatosis and liver injury in nlrp3---hfhca reduced energy expenditure that could explain the increased body weight and fat mass despite a progressive decrease in the caloric intakebody weight ratio in nlrp3---hfhc compared to other groups b increased expression of ppar g2 and of its downstream effectors that facilitates fat deposition in the liver in the face of positive energy balance- c increased hepatic scd-1 activity a central lipogenic enzyme associated with hepatic steatosis d increased mitochondrial b-oxidation measured by cpt1a expression.

energy harvesting firmicutes were significantly higher in hfhc diet compared to nlrp3-- mice fed chow and proteobateria werefigure 5. nlrp3---hfhc-fed mice showed increased bacterial translocation and amps.

the increased anion superoxide production in nlrp3---hfhc supports the hypothesis that the high ffas flux to the liver leads to ppar a-mediated fatty acid oxidation with excessive ros formation not counteracted by an adequate antioxidant capacity.to our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates microbiota modifications in nlrp3---fed a western-lifestyle diet.

this analysis revealed that hfhc diet decreased faecal excretion of triglycerides com- pared to chow diet independently from the genotype thus indicating that differences in lipid absorption cannot explain the higher hepatic triglyceride content in nlrp3---hfhc mice.

nlrp3-- and wild-type mice were fed a western-lifestyle diet with fructose in drinking water hfhc or a chow diet.

this study is in agreement with and extends previous observations showing that nlrp3-- mice fed mcd diet a model associated with steatohepatitis but with a cachectic phenotype had worsened liver injury and this was attributed to a pathogenetic microbiota.

to assess whether the increased liver weight observed in nlrp3---hfhc- fed mice was associated with higher fat deposition in the liver we evaluated hepatic fat content.

in our model nlrp3-- mice showed increased liver steatosis macrophage infiltration and liver injury nas score.

however cpt1a expression was significantly increased in nlrp3-- compared to wt p  0.05 which was associated with lower mrna levels of the master regulator of the antioxidant responsefigure 1. nlrp3---hfhc mice showed increased weight gain and hepatic steatosis.
