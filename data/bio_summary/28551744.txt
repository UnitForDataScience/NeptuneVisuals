The alpha diversity indices indicated that the more di- verse bacterial OTUs were detected in the germs and cotyle- dons than those in sprouts nevertheless the sprouts contain similar diverse fungi with germs and cotyledons Table .Although the germs and cotyledons were divided from sur- face sterilized seeds and the sprouts are segregated fromenvironmental bacteria and fungi during germination diverse endophytes in these samples were detected.

Humicola Emericella and Penicillium were the dominant fungal genera in germs and cotyledonsTable 1Summary of the features of valid tags of the samples of cotyledons Pcotyledon germs Pgerm of peanut seeds and peanut sprouts PsproutTable 2Summary of species richness estimators of the samples of cotyledons Pcotyledon germs Pgerm of peanut seeds and peanut sprouts PsproutSamplesBacterial OTUsFungal OTUscontained Emericella as the dominant genus.

The peanut seeds consisted of germs and cotyledons however the difference of bacterial and fungal flora between peanut germs and cotyledons is unknown.

Unlike endophytic bacteria the sprouts and germs contained more fungal OTU than cotyledons and 20 OTUs were found in germs and sprouts simultaneously 17 OTUs of cotyledons were still detected in sprouts Fig.

Our results suggested that the more diverse bacteria were detected in germs and cotyledons than those in sprouts never- theless the sprouts contain more diverse fungi than germs and cotyledons.

The dominant fungal genera of germs such as Humicola Emericella and Penicillium were still detected in sprouts and the Emericella was detected in sprouts germs and cotyledons simultaneous- ly.

The Emericella was detected in sprouts germs and cotyledons simultaneously whereas the Emericella detected in cotyledons were at low abundance.Pot experimentsA pure culture of Halothiobacillus was obtained and designated as SOB4.

A total of 102 bacterial OTUs were obtained in cotyledons and 29 OTUs in germs and 4 bacterial OTUs coexisted in germs and cotyle- dons simultaneously.

The results illustrated that diverse bacteria and fungi were detected in peanut germs cotyledons and sprouts.

The assay of each group sprout germ and cotyledon of samples was repeated three times.DNA extractionThe genomic DNA was isolated from the peanut seed germs designated as Pgerm cotyledons designated as Pcotyledon and sprouts designated as Psprout withE.Z.N.A.
