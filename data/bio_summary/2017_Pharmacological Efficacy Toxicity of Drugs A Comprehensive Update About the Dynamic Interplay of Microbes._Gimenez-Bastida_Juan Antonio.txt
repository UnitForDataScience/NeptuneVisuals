liver cells respond to these compounds via different nuclear receptors xenosensors that have been demon- strated in animal studies be susceptible of regulation by the microbiota.these comprehensive analyses revealed transcrip- tional and protein changes in a network connected with the hepatic metabolism of xenobiotics affecting the activity of cytochrome p450 fatty acids and lipid metabolism amino acid metabolism and bile acid synthesis.

responsible for its metabolism.these products have been identified as probably responsible for the bioactivity of ginseno- sides in humans.similarly bacterial-mediated metabolism also occurs on pharmacologically active natural glucuronides such as baicalin from scutellariae radixand glucosinolates like glucor- apharin found in cruciferous vegetables with anticarcinogenic properties.the bacterial-mediated metabolism favors their rapid appearance in the systemic circulation as demonstrated in con- ventional rats in comparison to germ-free animals.

for example gut microbiota has been identified as responsible of a less efficient metabolism of pentobarbital.the impaired metabolism is reflected in a longer time of anesthesia in conventionally raised animals compared to germ-free animals.

drugs metabolism occurs associated to the energetic cell metabolism and the endocannabinoid system ecb participates in the regulation of energy homeostasis and gut permeability increasing the possibility to appear as a metabolic endotoxemia.

notwithstanding xenobiotics and thera- peutic drugs affecting the microbiome's activity also significantly impact metabolism affecting different organs and tissues and thereby drugs' toxicityefficacy effects.

however the study of population-based differences in intestinal microbial- related drug metabolism has been largely inferential.

the evidence that 'environmental' factors greatly impact to a different extent drug metabolism and physiological behavior from one individual to another highlight the need of changing the way the efficacytoxicity of several drugs is being approached.increasing evidence demonstrates that microbiome is a critical determinant in human health.

in fact experimental studies have evidenced differences in the effi- cacy or toxicity of therapeutic drugs because of differences in microbial-mediated drug metabolism.

there have been revealed significant differences in the metabolic activation or inactivation of drugs causing important variations of efficacy.however there is scarce evidence that does demonstrate the population-based differences in microbial- related drug metabolism.

examples of the distinct reactions that have been described  affecting several drugs  are briefly detailed below.reductive metabolisma well-known example of reductive metabolism is the marked decrease in the efficacy of cardiac glycoside drugs such as digoxinwhich is particularly important because of its narrowfigure 1. microbial-mediated biotransformation processes influencing drug disposition.therapeutic interval.

in this sense comparative studies performed on healthy volunteers from southern india and the united states revealed differences in drug metabolism of digoxin associated to the presence of eubacterium lentum.similarly in vitro studies showed that therapeutic drugs such as misonidazole sulfinpyrazone and sulindac are susceptible to undergo reductive-mediated inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract by gut microbiota showing aldehyde oxidase activity.

similarly studies on rabbits reported the incomplete bioavailability and greater forma- tion of the active metabolite of these drugs when are administered orally.similarly some other in vitro studies have demonstrated the capability of different microbial bacillus subtilis mtcc 619 but not escherichia coli mtcc 118 and fungi beauveria bassiana ncim 1216 used as biological insecticide cultures to produce the biotransformation of valdecoxib.the metabolism of metronida- zoleand zomisamidehas also been evaluated in germ-free and antibiotic-treated animals respectively.

animal studies documented that omeprazole administration to rats caused marked shifts in the numbers and genus of enteric bacteria including a significant reduction 80 of jejunal actinobacteria particularly bifido- bacterium spp.considered beneficial to the host's health.hydrolysisimmunotherapythe dramatic impact of microbial metabolism on the toxicity of metabolites derived from drugs was clearly manifested in the death of fifteen patients who were orally administered with sorivudine srv 1-b-d-arabinofuranosyl-e-5-2-bromovinyl uracil within40 days.

this observation could motivate an important decline on drug delivery since glyc- eryl trinitrate is mainly administered through transdermal patches however it is difficult to draw out any conclusion due to the lack of studies evaluating the potential impact of skin microbiome on drug metabolism.

in addition the alteration of amineamide groups by bacterial metabolism can also take place when they are present as thiazole ring for example the biotransformation of levamisoledcoadjuvant in vaccinesdmainly due to bacteroides and clostridium spp.similarly the isoxazole ring of risperidone resulted metabolized by gut microbiota showing oxidative dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen and the scission of the isoxazole in the benzisoxazole ring system.among all the bacteria-mediated alterations on drugs' structure there can be particularly highlighted 2 major metabolic reactions.j.a.
