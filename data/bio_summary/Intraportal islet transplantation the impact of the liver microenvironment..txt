Such lesions are expected both in the islets themselves and in the surrounding liver tissue due to the microembolization of islets in the presinu- soidal veins.Rodent especially mouse models of intraportal islet transplantation do not perfectly reflect the human situa- tion because of the higher islet-to-portal vein diameter ratio with a more proximal embolization of rodent islets.

Future interventions on clinical intraportal islet transplantation need to take into account the global context of the liver microenvironment with multi-point interventions being most likely to improve early islet survival and engraftment.Transplant International 2017 30 227-238Key wordsgut-liver axis instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction ischemiareperfusion islet transplantation liver microenvironmentReceived 20 October 2016 Revision requested 9 November 2016 Accepted 16 January 2017IntroductionThe liver is currently the preferred site for clinical islet transplantation.

It is a complex nonspecific response of the innate immune system that takes place early after transplantation with the constitution of thrombi and a dense lymphocyte and macrophage infiltrate 8.Instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction is ini- tiated by a strong activation of the coagulation cascade which peaks 6-12 h after clinical and large animal transplantation experiments 910.

In the case of liver transplantation an increase in Bacteroidetes associated with a decrease in Firmicutes predicted acute graft rejection in a rat model 76.The impact of pre-existing diabetes-linked microbiota alterations on the success or failure of islet transplanta- tion and the possible modifications of the microbiome after islet transplantation have not been explored thus far.

Total intestinal decontamination partially reduces the severity of the Kupffer cell- mediated ischemiareperfusion injury after mouse liver transplantation 77 and in humans efficiently prevents acute graft versus host disease after clinical hematopoi- etic stem cell transplantation 78.

A similar strategy could be tested in preclinical models of intraportal islet transplantation.Portal congestionIntraportal islet transplantation leads to a transient moderate increase in portal vein pressure which leads to small bowel congestion and increases the risk of LPS release.ImmunosuppressionRapamycin and tacrolimus the most commonly used drugs after islet transplantation increase intestinal per- meability 81 with higher levels of systemic LPS 82.

However despite great pro- gress in isolation and transplantation protocols over the past few years it is still associated with the early loss of some 50-70 of transplanted islets.

The present review focuses on the specifics of the liver microenvironment notably the localized hepatic ischemiareperfusion injury following transplantation the low oxygenation of the portal vein the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction the endogenous liver immune system and the gut-liver axis and how they can each have an impact on the transplanted islets.

In addition early events also have a significant impact as suggested by rodent and human positron-emission tomographystudies with a potential loss of up to 50-70 of islets immediately after transplantation 23.

Studies were included according to their ability to pro- vide insight into the link between islet transplantation and the selected areas of interest and were grouped by chapters in the text below.The instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction IBMIRInstant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction is the most studied consequence of the intraportal route on the transplanted islets.
