Higher numbers of the estimators represent greater diversity which suggests that alpha diversity index was inversely correlated with BMD although there were no significant differences between the OP and ON groups as shown in .With regard to beta diversity unweighted UniFrac analysis indicated that hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analysis PCoA could discriminate the NC samples from OP as well as ON samples.

However there was substantial overlap between the OP and ON groups and most ON samples were positioned in the middle of the OP and NC samples as illustrates.Significance analysis of gut bacterial community abundance in osteoporosis and osteopenia patientsAt the phylum level illustrated in  Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria constituted the four dominant phyla in all samples.

The average ratios of FirmicutesBacteroidetes were 3.326 1.755 and 1.290 in the OP ON and NC groups respectively.

The significance and variance of bacterial communities as determined by sequencing analysis may help discriminate OP or ON patients from NC subjects.DISCUSSIONThe human microbiome referred to as our second genome can influence genetic diversity immunity and metabolism  .

The Lachnoclostridium and Klebsiella genera were more abundant in the OP and ON groups as compared to the NC group.

Differences among the four dominant phyla Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were not statistically significant for comparisons between the OP and ON group or the ON and NC group p  0.05.

The gut microbiota regulates bone mass in mice.

For the remaining components 28.6 the OP group 13.6 accounted for nearly half of all OTUs.Diversity analysis of gut microbiota in osteoporosis and osteopenia patientsTo determine alpha diversity we calculated the mean ace index chao index shannon index and simpson reciprocal index.

The Blautia Parabacteroides and Ruminococcaceae genera differed significantly between the OP and NC groups.
