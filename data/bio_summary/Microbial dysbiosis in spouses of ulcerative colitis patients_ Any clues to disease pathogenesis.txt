Altered microbial function has also been reported in IBD patients-specifically butyrate butanoate and propanoate metabolism are decreased while the oxidative stress the type II secretion system secretion of toxins the transport of both amino acids and sulfates are increased2.Despite these impressive and reproducible alter-ations in the gut microbiome of IBD patients it is unclear whether such dysbiosis is the cause or simply the consequence i.e.

For example disease activity seems to affect the microbial profile in IBD while microbial alterations similar to those described in IBD have been described in patients with nonspecific intestinal injury4.

Thus these findings highlight the potential role of the microbiome in IBD etiology.to play a crucial role in disease etiology - especially in UC - though it is unclear whether it does so by acting through the microbiome.In the paper published in the 25th issue ofthe Journal Chen et al6 studied the influence of cohabitation on the gut microbial community in healthy partners of UC patients using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

The authors' conclusions are reasonable and apparently support an important role of the environment in changing the gut microbiome - in this case the UC microbiome modifying the bacterial profile of their healthy cohabiting partners.

The study does not clarify whether the transfer of the microbiome might occur by direct contact or by other means.To lend more weight to the authors' conclusionSorrentino D. Microbial dysbiosis in spouses of uC patientsin this and similar types of studies IBD and any unrelated upper GI condition should be duly excluded in cohabiting spouses.

Whether this impacts disease development or points to a specific role of the microbiome on IBD etiology remains to be determined.REFERENCESthe similarities between their microbial profile and that of their patient partners.

Furthermore in the Chen et al6 study only the stool bacteria were tested however the stool microbiome might be different from the intestinal tissue microbiome - which more closely represents the intestinal mucosa flora2.

The microbial profile of the Asian population might differ from that of the Western population8 - an important factor to keep in mind in comparative studies.So does this study suggest that the microbiome dysbiosis in IBD might be a primary event rather than the result of the disease The answer is no.

Indeed there is no evidence that cohabitation with IBD patients might increase the risk of disease in the spouses so the results of this study only indicate that the microbiome can be partially transmitted from individual to individual.
