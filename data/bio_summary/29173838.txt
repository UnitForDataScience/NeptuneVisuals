In this light Moeller describes the outcomes of human-gut microbiota co-evolution and how aspects of modern lifestyle substantially decreased gut bacteria diversity in humans.

In their articlepresent the latest advances in culture-based investigation of mammalian gut bacteria and host- microbe interactions.

In this context provide a nice finale for this issue discussing the recent advances and challenges to applying CRISPR- based tools on host-associated bacteria.

In the last decades the research field in 'hostmicrobiota relationships' has witnessed an impressive renewed interest.

In this light the rapid progress in functional studies and sequencing technologies has brought forth a new appreciation of the diversity and ubiquity of microorganisms' influence on animal ecology evolution and physiology.

In fact extending host- microbiota research into simpler and non-traditional organisms represents a healthy move in microbiota research and has allowed us to obtain an extraordinarily detailed yet mostly descriptive view of the microbial impact on the biology of different hosts.

In this regard kick off this issue by presenting an outlook to the complex dynamics connecting plants and their microbiomes which we believe is extremely relevant for animal-microbiota symbiosis.

In turn the beneficial microbes are able to colonize and impact plant physiology by promoting their growth and their immune and metabolic activities.

In this regard discusses the microbial effects in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

In addition new specific molec- ular players have been identified in bacterial protection against viruses and exogenous stresses yet some microbial effects are still debated in Drosoph- ila.
