Interestingly some compositional gut microbiota peculiarities were also shared with human gut microbial ecosystems of centenarians and Hadza hunter-gatherers considered as models of a healthy gut microbiome and of a homeostatic and highly adaptive gut microbiota-host relationship respectively.

In a mutualistic scenario these variations are the result of an adaptive process aimed at the real-time optimization of the gut microbiome services in response to endogenous and exogenous variables.The impact of the gut microbiota on human health is a topic of huge interest for the scientific community as demonstrated by the ever-increasing amount of studies on the microbiological peculiarities of the human gut eco- system within the context of different lifestyles genetic backgrounds or pathologies.

Moreover the within-colony low genetic diversity possibly due to the high inbreeding rate the climatologically stable underground habitats and the constant diet mainly tubers and other under- ground plant storage organs make the naked mole-rat a unique model for studying the microbiota-host interac- tion focusing on the ability of the gut microbes to contribute to health maintenance during aging.Here we characterized the gut microbiota of the naked mole-rat by next generation sequencing based on the16 S rRNA gene regions in comparison to different mammals aiming at understanding of how the rodent's gut microbiota profile aligns with human microbiome and that of other mammals.

We hypothesize that the soil provides the host with a ter- minal election acceptor to support an alternative and peculiar oxidative metabolism in the gut which based on sulfate could represent a new mutualistic configuration of the gut microbiome-host transgenomic metab- olism in the mammalian gut.

This observation suggests a possible gut microbiome contribute to the tolerance of the naked mole-rat to poisonous compounds that have been hypothesized by previous literature based on naked mole-rat cell lines .The gut microbiota also play a pivotal role in the production of metabolites upon food fermentation which have an important impact in maintaining gut health and construction of metabolic signal networks that are involved in the homeostasis of intestinal mucosa.

The gut microbiota can indeed influence the education and homeostasis of the immune system and metabolism as well as brain functionality with unintelligible long-term effects on human health and lifespan .The uniqueness of the different combinations of many impacting variables such as perinatal events lifestyle diet physiology and clinical history result in the outstanding individuality of the gut microbiota not only in terms of phylogenetic composition but also regarding the microbiota assembly and its fluctuations throughout the whole human life.

This confirmed the dominant influence of the mamma- lian phylogeny in determining the gut microbiota structure .The Simpson diversity index calculated on the genus level profiles showed that the naked mole-rat microbiota was approximately as diverse as the human one 0.82 - 0.03 and 0.84 - 0.04 respectively and significantly more diverse than that of wild mice 0.72 - 0.14 Mann-Whitney test P  0.001.The gut microbiome from wild mice western healthy human adults aged 22-48 African Hadzahunter-gatherers aged 8-70and western human supercentenarians aged 105-109were selected as models for a finest comparison with the naked mole-rat microbiome.

Therefore it is feasible to assume that under control of hypoxiaanoxia these transporters might channel the sugars from the intestine into blood in short time.Taken together our data shows that the gut microbiota of the naked mole-rat not only shows peculiarities related to the specific living environment such as the enrichment in bacteria able to metabolize sulfate but it is also well equipped to obtain a relatively high abundance of a wide range of health-promoting metabolites from the possibly limited diversity of dietary substrates which might be available in their subterranean living environment.ConclusionsThe naked mole-rat possesses a unique gut microbiome composition which is the result of the host phylogeny and its peculiar ecology.

Compound groups are labeled using brackets.microbiota as a universal contributor to mammalian health which goes beyond the host phylogeny and ecology constrains supporting health and longevity of the mammalian host.Moreover even if confirmatory functional studies need to be carried out our findings seem to suggest a capacity of the naked mole-rat gut microbiota to utilize soil sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor to sustain an anaerobic oxidative metabolism in the gut.
