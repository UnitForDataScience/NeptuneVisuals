evaluated the effect of feeding Bt MON810 maize on maternal and offspring immunity by feeding nulliparous sows a Bt MON810 maize diet n 12 and a control maize diet n 12 throughout gestation and lactation.

All three groups of animals that were exposed to Bt maize during gestation and lactation andor after weaning were treated as one experimental group in the analysis.e GMnon-GM group was fed Bt maize in first 30 days of experiment only non-GMGM group was fed Bt maize in last 80 days of experiment only.

Parameters measured to investigate the effect of feeding GM maize on the peripheral immune response were cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC no difference between pigs fed GM or isogenic maize immune cell populations no difference between treatments Cry1Ab-specific immunoglobulin production no Cry1Ab-specific IgA and IgG detected in the serum of pigs fed either GM or isogenic maize and haematological parameters.

argue that Bt maize might be even safer for animal health than conventional maize because less pesticide is used to grow the crop and Bt maize contains lower concentrations of highly toxic mycotoxins .

The authors conclude that long-term feeding of sows and their offspring with GM maize affected the intestinal microbiota but that effects were limited and not associated with any health abnormalities in the sows and their offspring  .Although several studies with Bt MON810 maize were per-formed in poultry significant differences between GM maize-fed animals and control animals were only observed by n .

seen in the experimental study of n where they not only observed a significantly lower proportion of T helper and T cytotoxic cells in animals fed GM maize or GM soybean when compared to animals fed the near-isogenic counterparts of these crops but also a significant difference for the same parameters when they compared two different non-GM maize cultivars Clarica and PR39 F58.A well described protocol to evaluate the effects of GM feed on livestock health is even more essential to evaluate health effects of second generation GM crops.

Mammals lack the intestinal receptors for the Cry1Ab protein produced by this gene and are not believed to be affected by this toxin .and described a study in 36 lactating dairy cows that were fed Bt MON810 maize n 18 or its near-isogenic counterpart n 18 during two lactations over a period of 25 months.
