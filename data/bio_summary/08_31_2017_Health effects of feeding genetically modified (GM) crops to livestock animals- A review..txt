evaluated the effect of feeding bt mon810 maize on maternal and offspring immunity by feeding nulliparous sows a bt mon810 maize diet n 12 and a control maize diet n 12 throughout gestation and lactation.

all three groups of animals that were exposed to bt maize during gestation and lactation andor after weaning were treated as one experimental group in the analysis.e gmnon-gm group was fed bt maize in first 30 days of experiment only non-gmgm group was fed bt maize in last 80 days of experiment only.

parameters measured to investigate the effect of feeding gm maize on the peripheral immune response were cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc no difference between pigs fed gm or isogenic maize immune cell populations no difference between treatments cry1ab-specific immunoglobulin production no cry1ab-specific iga and igg detected in the serum of pigs fed either gm or isogenic maize and haematological parameters.

argue that bt maize might be even safer for animal health than conventional maize because less pesticide is used to grow the crop and bt maize contains lower concentrations of highly toxic mycotoxins .

the authors conclude that long-term feeding of sows and their offspring with gm maize affected the intestinal microbiota but that effects were limited and not associated with any health abnormalities in the sows and their offspring  .although several studies with bt mon810 maize were per-formed in poultry significant differences between gm maize-fed animals and control animals were only observed by n .

seen in the experimental study of n where they not only observed a significantly lower proportion of t helper and t cytotoxic cells in animals fed gm maize or gm soybean when compared to animals fed the near-isogenic counterparts of these crops but also a significant difference for the same parameters when they compared two different non-gm maize cultivars clarica and pr39 f58.a well described protocol to evaluate the effects of gm feed on livestock health is even more essential to evaluate health effects of second generation gm crops.

mammals lack the intestinal receptors for the cry1ab protein produced by this gene and are not believed to be affected by this toxin .and described a study in 36 lactating dairy cows that were fed bt mon810 maize n 18 or its near-isogenic counterpart n 18 during two lactations over a period of 25 months.

in gm-fed animals a bt maize is maize containing a gene isolated from bacillus thuringiensis bt that induces resistance to a range of lepidoptera insects including the european corn borer pest resistance.

most of the experimental studies lasted one commercial production round or even shorter although a few multigenera- tional studies have been described for bt maize in sheep   and pigs   and for bt maize and rr soybean in japanese quail coturnix coturnix japonica  .almost half of the experimental studies investigated haema- tology and histopathology whereas about a quarter of the studies investigated organ weight serum biochemistry or the immuneresponse .

less health effects were observed in experiments in which animals were fed a diet of both gm maize and gm soybean if compared to a diet of gm maize only.

de vos m. swanenburg  food and chemical toxicology xxx 2017 1e107health effects of gm soybean were only reported in one experiment with broilers where a significant difference in the immune response was observed n. no health effects of feeding gm rice or gm sugarcane were observed in the few studies that evaluated these gm crops.the effect of bt mon810 maize on the performance of cattle pigs and poultry was most extensively studied e. bt mon810 maize expresses the bacterial cry1ab gene derived from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis conferring resistance to a range of lepidoptera insects including the european corn borer.

these results indicate that feeding gm maize to pregnant sows during gestation and lactation does not adversely affect maternal or foetal immune function.and investi-gated the effects of feeding bt mon810 maize on haematology serum biochemistry and intestinal microbiota of nulliparous sows and their offspring.
