in particular flavonoid conversion reac- tions feature across a diverse range of firmicutes families within the gut microbiome such as lactobacillaceae streptococcaceae enterococcaceae clostridiaceae lachnospiraceae rumi- nococcaceae eubacteriaceae and erysi- pelotrichaceae  this suggests that the human gut microbiome may be shaped to utilize dietary flavonoids efficiently.overall the strong association between the gut microbiome flavonoid levels and weight gain across different rodent models of obesity combined with our improved understanding of microbial metabolism of flavonoids may potentially open new opportunities for testing in humans.trends in molecular medicine april 2017 vol.

flavonoids are involved in several important physiological functions within plants one of which is defense against stressors such as uv radiation and micro- bial infections .flavonoids gut microbiome and metabolic parameters of obesity once ingested flavonoids can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota notonly through antimicrobial activities but also by becoming nutrient sources for particular bacterial species.

indeed dietary supplementation with flavonoids can counteract the increased capacity of the microbiome to metabolize flavonoids thus normalizing intestinal flavonoid levels and resulting in decreased weight regain upon return to an obesogenic diet in mice .

tnf nfkb1 socs3 and il1b in rodents indeed diet-induced memory deficits were associated with specific changes in the relative abundance of microbial taxa members of lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae families as well as with the expression of hippocampal inflammatory genes .however flavonoids have also been pro- posed to harbor neuroprotective func- tions improve cognitive flexibility and ameliorate cognitive decline .

4sprague-dawley rats the mechanism was reported to involve suppression of hippocampal inflammation and oxidative stress as well as reversal of reduced autophagy .overall while obesogenic diets have been shown to lead to a decrease in cognitive performance dietary intake of flavonoids appears to reverse these deficits.the gut microbiome and extra- gastrointestinal effects of flavonoid-derived metabolites from these findings another thought- provoking research question emerges.

however further research is warranted to support this hypothesis.concluding remarksgiven these novel and exciting findings and the considerable interest in the prebiotic potential of flavonoids the chal- lenge now will be to confirm if flavonoids are crucial to the gut microbiome-brain axis in obesity and beyond .

flavonoids are plant compounds that have been asso- ciated with improved metabolic parameters in obesity and reversal of cognitive decline.

these findings emphasize the central role that the gut microbiome plays in the utilization of fla- vonoids by the host and the negative impact that obesogenic diets may have on this activity.our understanding of microbial conver- sion of flavonoids has improved signifi- cantly over the past few years.

in support another study in older women demonstrated that a higher intake of berries and flavonoids was found to be associated with a delay in cognitive aging relative to individuals with lower intake .

4 293flavonoids gut microbiome obesity and cognitive function from a different perspective the influence of the gut microbiota on brain function through the gut-brain axis has garnered significant interest in recent years.

other studies have also shown cognitive bene- fits such as improved cognitive function e.g.

further these diets have been shown to negatively impact on host cognitive performance through a mechanism that involves the gut microbiome.

for exam- ple a cranberry extract high in flavonols anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins oligomeric flavonoids given over 8 weeks has been found to reduce weight gain and visceral obesity as well as improve other metabolic parameters e.g.

similar results have been observed in mice on a high-fat diet hfd supplemented with 1 concord grape polyphenols high in anthocyanins flavan-3-ols and flavonols .notably there is now a growing interest in the microbial contribution to intestinal flavonoid levels in particular the ability of the gut microbiota to convert flavonoids to active compounds that benefit the host.

although warranting further investigation it has been suggested that flavonoids might exert their activities on cognition via mechanisms that include anti- inflammatory effects e.g.
