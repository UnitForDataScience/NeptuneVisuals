GF-fc mice had decreased expression of Nr4a1 and Nr4a3 that are a class of nuclear receptor transcription factors that are important for the formation of long-lasting memory as blockade of these receptors impairs long-term but not short- term memory in the hippocampus and are up-regulated following cued and contextual fear conditioning.Scrutinizing further down-regulated genes unique to GF-fc mice shows a decrease in many activity-related pathways and transcription factors that further supports that GF-n amygdala is primed for a different transcriptional response to fear retention.Research from our group has previously demonstrated that there is marked volumetric expansion in the amygdala of GF mice.In addition the basolateral amygdala nuclei GF animals displayed increased spine density specifically in mushroom spines that are critical for formation of glutamatergic synapses.This suggests that these cells receive more excitatory inputs.Though our transcriptomic study is not exclusive to the basolateral amygdala hyperactivity in this specific nucleus may underlie the inability to regulate fear memory retention or in many behavioural responses that depend on this brain region.

CON conventionally raised mice CON-n CON naive GF germ free GF-n GF naive.Enrichment in genes related to neuronal transmission and nervous system development in the amygdala of GF naive miceWe performed unbiased deep sequencing of mRNA in the amygdala of naive and fear conditioned GF and CON mice.

However there is a paucity of information about whether the microbiome could regulate amygdala-dependent fear behaviours or modify the expression of miRNAs in the central nervous system.To this end we investigated amygdala-dependent fear memory in GF and an additional group of GF colonized mice ex-GF.

This further suggests elevated neuronal activity in the amygdala in naive GF animals whereas no significant enrichment in GO terms was noted among down- regulated genes in GF-n mice.Unique transcriptional response to fear retention stimulus in CON and GF miceWe found a number of genes to be differentially regulated in both CON-fc and GF-fc 1 h after the retention test when compared with their unconditioned counterparts c.

In addition we see a number of immediate-early responding genes Fos Fosb Egr2 Arc and Nr4a1 and genes involved in neurotransmission Drd2 Syt2 Chat and Adora2a to be up-regulated in naive GF mice in line with our previous finding indicating hyperactivity in the amygdala of GF naive mice.To further investigate this potential hyperactive state present in naive GF amygdala we compared differentially regulated genes under naive conditions CON-n vs GF-n to genes that are differentially regulated upon the fear retention test in control conditions CON-n vs CON-fc 3e.

Cohort 2 was used to confirm the memory retention deficit and assess gene expression priming and changes using both naive and fear conditioned CON and GF animals 1 h after a cued fear stimulus n  5-12group 2.

An adjusted P-value of 0.1 Padj Benjamini- Hochberg method was considered significantly differentially regulated as per previously published sequencing data.A false discovery rate cutoff of Padjo0.1 is commonly used in transcriptome-wide studies using the DESeq2 package it is the default setting in this analysis pipeline.In order to further highlight the consistency of our data and test for potential statistical confounding we have also analysed our data using an even more stringent cutoff of Padjo0.05 Supplementary Figure 3.RESULTSOne-day cued fear conditioning in CON miceWe successfully established a 1-day fear conditioning protocol adapted from Izquierdo et al.This was necessary because of the logistical and practical constraints of GF facilities and in order to reduce potential for colonization.
