gf-fc mice had decreased expression of nr4a1 and nr4a3 that are a class of nuclear receptor transcription factors that are important for the formation of long-lasting memory as blockade of these receptors impairs long-term but not short- term memory in the hippocampus and are up-regulated following cued and contextual fear conditioning.scrutinizing further down-regulated genes unique to gf-fc mice shows a decrease in many activity-related pathways and transcription factors that further supports that gf-n amygdala is primed for a different transcriptional response to fear retention.research from our group has previously demonstrated that there is marked volumetric expansion in the amygdala of gf mice.in addition the basolateral amygdala nuclei gf animals displayed increased spine density specifically in mushroom spines that are critical for formation of glutamatergic synapses.this suggests that these cells receive more excitatory inputs.though our transcriptomic study is not exclusive to the basolateral amygdala hyperactivity in this specific nucleus may underlie the inability to regulate fear memory retention or in many behavioural responses that depend on this brain region.

however there is a paucity of information about whether the microbiome could regulate amygdala-dependent fear behaviours or modify the expression of mirnas in the central nervous system.to this end we investigated amygdala-dependent fear memory in gf and an additional group of gf colonized mice ex-gf.

this further suggests elevated neuronal activity in the amygdala in naive gf animals whereas no significant enrichment in go terms was noted among down- regulated genes in gf-n mice.unique transcriptional response to fear retention stimulus in con and gf micewe found a number of genes to be differentially regulated in both con-fc and gf-fc 1 h after the retention test when compared with their unconditioned counterparts c. very little overlap between con-fc and gf-fc mice 11 down-regulated and1 up-regulated was present after fear retention col8a2 lbp thbs4 capn11 rp17a foxj1 dnahc6 aqp1 hbb-1b dynlrb2 and ccdc135 4c.

in addition we see a number of immediate-early responding genes fos fosb egr2 arc and nr4a1 and genes involved in neurotransmission drd2 syt2 chat and adora2a to be up-regulated in naive gf mice in line with our previous finding indicating hyperactivity in the amygdala of gf naive mice.to further investigate this potential hyperactive state present in naive gf amygdala we compared differentially regulated genes under naive conditions con-n vs gf-n to genes that are differentially regulated upon the fear retention test in control conditions con-n vs con-fc 3e.

an adjusted p-value of 0.1 padj benjamini- hochberg method was considered significantly differentially regulated as per previously published sequencing data.a false discovery rate cutoff of padjo0.1 is commonly used in transcriptome-wide studies using the deseq2 package it is the default setting in this analysis pipeline.in order to further highlight the consistency of our data and test for potential statistical confounding we have also analysed our data using an even more stringent cutoff of padjo0.05 supplementary figure 3.resultsone-day cued fear conditioning in con micewe successfully established a 1-day fear conditioning protocol adapted from izquierdo et al.this was necessary because of the logistical and practical constraints of gf facilities and in order to reduce potential for colonization.

we found that mir-211-5p mir-204-5p and mir-200b-3p dis- played significant enrichment for select go terms that overlapped with those from mrna sequencing d. supplementary table 3 indicates which of our observed dysregu- lated mrnas in gf-n mice these mirnas are predicted to target.unique mirna response to fear retention stimulus in con and gf mice with predicted interaction with dysregulated mrnaswe found a number of mirnas to be differentially regulated after the retention test in both gf-fc and con-fc when compared with the unconditioned counterparts respectively supplementary tables 4 and 5. the con-fc mice after fear retention test had altered expression of 25 mirnas 7 up-regulated and 18 down- regulated and supplementary table 4. after retention gf-fc mice had 7 altered mirnas in the amygdala 2 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated and supplementary table 5. mir-34b-5p mir-34c-5p and mir-34b-3p were down-regulated in both con-fc and gf-fc mice 5e.

in addition it is worth noting that gf mice display reduced anxiety-related behaviours in a variety of approach-avoidance tasks.thus the relative contribution of this reduced anxiety response to the observed differences in cued fear conditioning is unclear although it is worth noting that the neurobiological basis of learned fear and ethological anxiety responses in such rodent paradigms are quite distinct.moreover we did not see a difference in freezing response during the acquisition training between groups.

in addition future studies should investigate the role of the dysfunctional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axisevident in gf animalsin potentially driving the altered response to fear conditioning given the relationship between stress hormones such as glucocorticoids and memory formation.accompanying this impairment in fear memory recall was a marked reshaping of the transcriptional landscape in the amygdala of gf-n mice when compared with con-n mice.

deficits in social behaviour are more commonly observed in autism spectrum disorder models and this is also a feature of the gf phenotype.the valproic acid model of autism spectrum disorder also showed increased amygdala volumewith evidence of hyperactivity.in this model offspring of mothers exposed to valproic acid during gestation display increased memory retention with evidence of increased fear as valproic acid-exposed rats were unable to extinguish cued fear memory.this could be related to the increased anxiety displayed by these animals although this model is also associated with microbiome alterations.clearly amygdala hyperactivity and dramatic reshaping of the dendritic landscape can have detrimental effects on amygdala-dependent memory.the most unique and surprising finding in our rna sequencing was in relation to the impact of the retention test on down- regulated gene in the amygdala of con-fc mice.
