By 16S rDNA sequencing and data analysis we found GE treatment can break the structural balance of gut microbiota increasing the abundance of Desulfovibrio genus and Mycoplasma genus as well as several rare genera.

P  0.05 compared to Control group  P  0.05 GEH compared to EBH or GEL compared to EBL group.disturbance verified the change of Desulfovibrio genus induced by GE.GU-EB combination changes the metabolic genes in metagenomesMetagenomes of gut microbiota is the basis of metabolic function of microbiota.

Recently TCM researches have been increasingly focused on the mechanisms of the interplay between herbs and gut microbiota .Our study will provide a new insight in gut microbiota to better understand the disadvantages induced by improper herbal combina- tion.

S1.GU-EB combination induces gut microbiota dysbiosisWe re-consider that GU-EB combination may cause more adverse effect to the gut microbiota.

Fecal lipid metabolomics study was conducted by GC-MS analysis to confirm the change of metagenomes and Mycoplasma abundance.Results Gancao-Gansui combination did not exacerbate GI tract tissue or functional damage but caused gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased some rare genus's abundance including Desulfovibrio and Mycoplasma.

Mycoplasma genus pro- liferation and the metagenomes changes were both confirmed by metabolic profile analysis of fecal lipids especially cholesterol.Conclusions Gancao-Gansui combination can impact the gut microbiota diversity and related metabolic Correspondence to Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine 138 Xianlin Road Nanjing 210023 Jiangsu Province China.E-mail addresses J.

The wide spread exposure of GU in the society makes it more urgent to study the interactions between GU and other herbals in gut microbiota.ConclusionsGancao-Gansui combination can impact the gut microbiota diversity and related metabolic functions such as lipids and H2S metabolic homeostasis.

The GU-EB mixture were prepared by simply mixing GU extracts and EB extracts in the saline the concentrations of GU and EB in the mixture were kept the same as the GU or EB single suspension.Plant name The plant names have been checked with on March 30rd 2017.Animals and treatment procedureAdult ICR male mice weighting 18-22 g were kept in a temperature controlled environment 22 - 2 degC with 55 - 5 relative humidity with a 12-h 12-h light-dark cycle and fed with standard chow.

Extended error bar plot was gen- erated in STAMP software .ResultsGU-EB combination does not exacerbate EB induced toxic effect on GI tractConsidering that GI tract irritation is the major toxicity of EB we assumed GU-EB combination could exacerbate EB induced intestinal damage.

In this study we found that host cholesterol metabolism is impaired after GE treatment and the higher cholesterol content in the intestinal tract is consistent with higher Mycoplasma genus abundance.DiscussionWith concerns about TCM safety our research group have focused on the EIM theory aiming to uncover the disadvantages and mechan- isms behind incompatible herbal pairs and providing clues for deeper understanding of TCM theories these studies have reminded medical scientists and clinical doctors to re-assess potential problems induced by herbal-herbal or herbal-drug interactions   .In our previous report we found that when GU and EB were ex- tracted together this combination can accelerate the dissolution of diterpenes from EB and may increase the toxicity of this herb  .
