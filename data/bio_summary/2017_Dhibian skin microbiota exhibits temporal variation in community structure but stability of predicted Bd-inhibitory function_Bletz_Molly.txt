The rarified OTU table of skin microbiota samples contained 3503 unique bacterial OTUs predominately from five main phyla Proteobacteria Bacteriodetes Actino- bacteria Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia.Newt microbiota exhibits variation through time Phylogenetic diversity varied through time for all three newt species analysis of variance  Po0.001 1.

This finding makes sense in the context of other studies that have found amphibian microbial communities are dominated by bacterial taxa that are rare in the environment thus wecan expect different dynamics between these two communities.The lack of association between the temporal dynamics of environmental microbiota and that of newts suggests a heightened role of host-associated factors such as changes in skin morphology and mucosal characteristics in driving temporal patterns of newt skin microbiota.

To explore drivers of the observed temporal variation in skin microbiota we tested for associa- tions between newt microbiota and environmental variables including water temperature and aquatic bacterial community structure.

Some studies support this hypothesis whereas others support that structure and function are not inherently linked These alternative findings necessitate the following questions if a bacterial community exhi- bits structural variation temporally what are the functional implications Does functional potential of the community parallel these structural changes orremain unchanged despite altered community struc- ture To determine whether temporal variation in amphibian skin microbiota influences protective function we must study these communities across a time-series.For amphibian microbiota much of the available knowledge comes from isolated sampling events providing snapshots of community structure and important insights into the factors structuring these communities.

To test for associations between the temporal patterns of newt and aquatic bacterial communities Kendall's tau rank correlations were performed for each of the PCA-identified OTUs that is for each of these OTUs we tested for correlation between the temporal pattern in mean relative abundance on each newt species and its relative abundance in pond water.

From the PCA results we identified the OTUs most responsible for the temporal variation as those yielding factor loading values of 40.1 on PC1 or PC2.In addition a hierarchical clustering method unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean along with Similarity Profile Analysis SIMPROF was used to evaluate similarity among individual newt communities and among the temporal pattern of PCA-identified OTUs.

At the start of sampling newts had just migrated into breeding ponds the period from mid-March to early April likely coin- cided with changes in skin morphology from the terrestrial to aquatic phase This transitional process also involves increased skin sloughing which is known to affect skin microbiota Microbial changes may also be in part related to host immune system differences Furthermore skin restructuring may include changes in innate immune system function skin pH or other components of the mucosal layer similar to changes at metamorphosis which have a role in structuring host micro- biota The influence of skin morphology in temporal variation of skin microbiota is further exemplified by the distinct communities characterizing terrestrial and aquatic newts.
