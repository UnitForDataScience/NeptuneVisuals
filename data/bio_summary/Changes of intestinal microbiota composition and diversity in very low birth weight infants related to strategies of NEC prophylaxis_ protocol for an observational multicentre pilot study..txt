recent studies suggest the presence of a microbiome within the placenta and foetal meco- nium the delivery mode has been found to significantly influence the intestinal colonisation of infants - data suggest that the development of the intestinal microbiome may also be influenced by genetics intestinal colonisation patterns established within the first week of life are thought to have an impact on the composition of the individual's future intestinal microbiota - in term infants the intestinal microbiome undergoes rapid maturation throughout the first year of life and is considered to be securely estab- lished by the age of three.

furthermore development of barrier func- tion integrity and immune function is aided by the intes- tinal microbiome.intestinal microbiota in preterm infantsthe intestinal microbiome of the preterm infant shows reduced microbial diversity with a concurrent increase in colonisation with pathogenic organisms it is less stable compared to that of term born infants and it shows delayed transition to an adult colonisation pattern gestational age may contribute to intestinal colonisation pattern evolution of the preterm infants' intestinal microbiome is marked by periods of abrupt population changes in preterm infants facul- tative anaerobes such as enterococcus enterobacter and lactobacillus spp.

while some studies have found a unique community structure of the intestinal microbiome in preterm infants prior to and at the time of disease onset   others have not the intestinal microbiome of nec-infants appears to first diverge from that of healthy controls as early as 3 weeks prior to disease .

differences in intestinal microbiota abundance and diver- sity continue until onset of nec with infants having been characterised by an overall lower diversity index compared to the average preterm infant  the time of onset of nec  22 days of age or  22 days of age seems to discriminate abundance of intestinal microbiota .

thus intestinal microbial diversity and abundance as well as development of the intestinal micro- biome within the first weeks of life in preterm infants should differ depending on the applied regimen.

the individual intestinal micro- biome of adulthood is likely governed by an interplay between initial colonising microbiota genetics gut development diet and environment - nutri- tion i.e.

breastfeeding versus formula milk plays a major role and alters early colonisation patterns of the neonatal intestinal microbiome.

human milk also contains live bacteria  and this too might contribute to the healthy gut microbiome development.the intestinal microbiome interacts in a symbiotic rela-tionship with its host.

in addition the intestinal microbiome can limit nutrient resources available to pathogens specifically by out- competing them for metabolic resources and physical space  .

these can trigger exaggerated inflammatory responses by the infants' still developing immune system which may lead to disease processes such as nec preterm infants' immune dysfunction coupled with low diversity of intestinal microbiota and an overall predominance of pathogenic bacteria within the infants' gut represents a prime example of dysbiosis  .necrotizing enterocolitisnec resembles the most common life-threatening emergency of the gastrointestinal tract in the neonatal period.

although nec is a multifactor- ial disease primarily associated with intestinal immaturity.

aggressive enteral feeding may predispose infants to the development of nec.intestinal microbiota and necamong risk factors prematurity and accompanying intestinal colonisation represent the only consistently identified criteria .

up to date findings on intestinal colonisation and the microbiome aspect of nec have shown to be inconsistent.
