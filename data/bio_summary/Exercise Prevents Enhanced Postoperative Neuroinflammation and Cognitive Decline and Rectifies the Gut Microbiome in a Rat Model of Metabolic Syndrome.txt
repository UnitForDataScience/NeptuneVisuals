Preoperative exercise in the LCR surgical group significantly improved the freezing timecompared to the non-exercise LCR surgical group 49.5 - 3.1 vs.40.5 - 5.1 P  0.05.

Preoperative exercise inthe LCR surgical group significantly improved the dwell time compared to the non-exercise LCR surgical group 53.4 - 7.5 vs.42.2 - 1.9 P  0.05.

Cohorts varied between 5 and 7group.Preoperative exercise Prevented abnormal neuroinflammation in Metabolic syndrome ratsThree days after surgery hippocampal proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 protein expression  was remarkably elevated in LCR and HCR surgical rats with greater elevation in LCR surgical rats than HCR surgical rats 45.72 - 10.88 vs. 32.41 - 1.79 pgmg P  0.001 .

The mRNA levels of the pro-resolving mediators Arg1  and Mrc2  were significantly increased in both HCR and LCR rats although the increase in HCR rats was greater than in the LCR rats 2.5- vs. 1.7-fold increase for Arg1 P  0.05 3.8- vs. 1.8-fold increase for Mrc2 P  0.05.

Exercise significantly improved the b diversity in both the LCR and HCR groups and significantly altered the abundance of two of the major phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the HCR rats See Supplementary Material.DiscussiOn Major FindingsIn LCR rats preoperative exercise attenuated both the exag- gerated acute postoperative decrease in freezing time at daythe HCR rats.

After 35 generations the low capacity runner LCR rats differ 10-fold in their aerobic exercise capacity from high capacity runner HCR rats.

The LCR rats respond to surgical procedure with an abnormal phenotype consisting of exaggerated and persistent PCD and failure to resolve neuroinflammation.

We determined whether preoperative exercise can rectify the abnormal surgical phenotype.Materials and methods Following institutional approval of the protocol each of male LCR and male HCR rats were randomly assigned to four groups and subjected to isoflurane anesthesia and tibia fracture with internal fixation surgery or anesthesia alone sham surgery and to a preoperative exercise regimen that involved walking for 10 km on a treadmill over 6 weeks exercise or being placed on a stationary treadmill no exercise.

At 3 months the remainder of the rats were tested for memory recall by the probe test in a Morris Water Maze.results Postoperatively LCR rats exhibited exaggerated cognitive decline both at 3 days and at 3 months that was prevented by preoperative exercise.
