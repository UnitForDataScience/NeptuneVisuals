exercise significantly improved the b diversity in both the lcr and hcr groups and significantly altered the abundance of two of the major phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes in the hcr rats see supplementary material.discussion major findingsin lcr rats preoperative exercise attenuated both the exag- gerated acute postoperative decrease in freezing time at daythe hcr rats.

after 35 generations the low capacity runner lcr rats differ 10-fold in their aerobic exercise capacity from high capacity runner hcr rats.

the lcr rats respond to surgical procedure with an abnormal phenotype consisting of exaggerated and persistent pcd and failure to resolve neuroinflammation.

we determined whether preoperative exercise can rectify the abnormal surgical phenotype.materials and methods following institutional approval of the protocol each of male lcr and male hcr rats were randomly assigned to four groups and subjected to isoflurane anesthesia and tibia fracture with internal fixation surgery or anesthesia alone sham surgery and to a preoperative exercise regimen that involved walking for 10 km on a treadmill over 6 weeks exercise or being placed on a stationary treadmill no exercise.

at 3 months the remainder of the rats were tested for memory recall by the probe test in a morris water maze.results postoperatively lcr rats exhibited exaggerated cognitive decline both at 3 days and at 3 months that was prevented by preoperative exercise.

similarly lcr rats had excessive postoperative neuroinflammation that was normalized by preoperative exercise.

diversity of the gut microbiome in the lcr rats improved after exercise.discussion preoperative exercise eliminated the metabolic syndrome risk for the abnormal surgical phenotype and was associated with a more diverse gut microbiome.

to further explore the reasons for this enhanced risk we have used a validated animal model in which low capacity runner lcr rats bred for their limited aerobic exercise capacity exhibit each of visceral obesity hypertension hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance the cardinal features of the metabolic syndrome .

after aseptic trauma the lcr rats develop an exaggerated and more persistent form of cogni- tive decline  that is associated with a failure of resolution of inflammation .aerobic exercise training attenuates inflammation by altering signaling in innate immune cells -.

therefore we sought to determine whether exercise rectifies the neuroinflammatory response to surgical trauma in lcr rats and whether the exaggerated and persistent pcd can be mitigated.

as an altered gut microbiome may be a driver for persistent inflammation  we also determined the effect of exercise on the diversity of the microbiome in lcr rats.materials and methodsanimalsall experimental procedures involving animals were approved by institutional animal care and use committee of university of california san francisco protocol no.
