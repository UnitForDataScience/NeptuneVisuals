The hypervariable V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using a barcoded fusion primer set Table  with a thermal cycling program comprising an initial denaturation at 95 degC for 2 min followed by 30-35 cycles of annealing starting at 65 degC ending at 55 degC for 15 s and extension at 68 degC for 30 s. The amplicons in triplicate samples were pooled and purified using an AMPureXP PCR Purification Kit Agencourt Brea CA USA and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit on a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer Invitrogen Carlsbad CA USA.

The microbiomes of pond seawater and shrimp stomachs underwent varied dynamic succession during the period.

The AHPND-causing Vibrio species were predicted to develop a co-occurrence pattern with several resident and transit members within Candidatus Bacilloplasma and Cyanobacteria.

The disease typically affects postlarvaejuvenile shrimp within 20-35 days of stocking a fresh rearing pond and causes progressive degeneration of the hepatopancreas including sloughing of the hepatopancreas tubule epithelial cells in the early stage and necrosis and massive hemocytic infiltration in the terminal stage .

The samples were studied using the high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing approach.

The present study elucidates the dynamics and interaction between microbiomes of pond seawater and shrimp stomachs in association with AHPND.ResultsMonitoring of water quality 16S rRNA gene and toxin gene.

The daily monitoring data demon- strated that pH 7.4-7.7 alkalinity 79-102 mgL ammonia 0.1 mgL and sulphate 79-163 mgL levels were relatively stable in the sampling period from Day 23 Sep 13 to Day 38 Sep 28 Fig.

The concentra- tions of dissolved organic carbon DOC 2.0-5.9 mgL and nitrite 3.0 mgL gradually increased suggesting that eutrophication occurred in the pond seawater.

The results revealed that the concentrations of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were in the range of 105.5-106.4 copies mL which was higher than that of the archaeal counterparts 103.9-105.1 copiesmL.
