Therefore a group of leading US scientists proposed an Unified Microbiome Initiative UMI to research almost all the microbiomes in human plants animals soil and sea Alivisatos et al.

They suggested that interdisciplinary experts should cooperate share standards across borders and disciplines and realize the integration of resources Dubilier et al.

However about 90-99.8 of the microbes in natural environment can- not be cultured with currently available technologies and hence cannot be exploited further for biotechnology with pure culture Streit et al.

Co-culture is developed based on pure culture which normally refers to cultures with multiple mostly two defined species of microorganisms under aseptic con- ditions Sabra et al.

It is a microbial fermenta- tion technology utilizing the different characteristics of microbial growth and metabolism for fermentation Bader et al.

A typical application of co-culture is the production of 2-keto-l-gulonic acid 2-KLG the precursor of vitamin C. In the co-culture system Ketogu- lonicigenium vulgare small strain synthesizes 2-KLG from l-sorbose Bacillus megaterium big strain as an associated bacterium secretes some metabolites to stim- ulate the growth of K. vulgare and thus enhances 2-KLG production Zhang et al.

Biorefinery is a complex system of sustainable environment- and resource-friendly technol- ogy for material and energy comprehensive use or recov- ery of renewable raw materials from green and waste biomasses Kamm et al.

CBP is referred to integrating all biocon- version reactions in one-step biological process Minty et al.
