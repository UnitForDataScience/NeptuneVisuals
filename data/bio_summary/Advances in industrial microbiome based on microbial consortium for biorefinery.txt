jiang et al.

therefore a group of leading us scientists proposed an unified microbiome initiative umi to research almost all the microbiomes in human plants animals soil and sea alivisatos et al.

they suggested that interdisciplinary experts should cooperate share standards across borders and disciplines and realize the integration of resources dubilier et al.

to date many bulk biotechnological products such as amino acids organic acids antibiot- ics and enzymes are almost produced by pure culturesc the authors 2017. this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license  which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.of microorganisms sabra et al.

however about 90-99.8 of the microbes in natural environment can- not be cultured with currently available technologies and hence cannot be exploited further for biotechnology with pure culture streit et al.

co-culture is developed based on pure culture which normally refers to cultures with multiple mostly two defined species of microorganisms under aseptic con- ditions sabra et al.

it is a microbial fermenta- tion technology utilizing the different characteristics of microbial growth and metabolism for fermentation bader et al.

a typical application of co-culture is the production of 2-keto-l-gulonic acid 2-klg the precursor of vitamin c. in the co-culture system ketogu- lonicigenium vulgare small strain synthesizes 2-klg from l-sorbose bacillus megaterium big strain as an associated bacterium secretes some metabolites to stim- ulate the growth of k. vulgare and thus enhances 2-klg production zhang et al.

biorefinery is a complex system of sustainable environment- and resource-friendly technol- ogy for material and energy comprehensive use or recov- ery of renewable raw materials from green and waste biomasses kamm et al.

cbp is referred to integrating all biocon- version reactions in one-step biological process minty et al.

olson et al.

however many experimental results proved that it was a huge challenge to design and optimize a variety of functions in one strain olson et al.

which is converted from organic waste via anaerobic digestion with anaerobic microbial consortia bizukojc et al.

generally the transformation of organic wastes into biogas is considered to occur in four stages sabra et al.

in this reactor methanogenic microbial consortia are present as granules diaz et al.
