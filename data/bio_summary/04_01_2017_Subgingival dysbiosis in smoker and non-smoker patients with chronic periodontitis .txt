The selected patients were then divided into three groups i 8 non-smoker periodontally healthy patients affected by dysodontiasis of mandibular third molar 3 males and 5 females acting as controls CTRLs ii 6 non-smoker patients affected by chronic moderate to severe periodon- titis 1 male and 5 females termed here PCnoS and iii 6 smokers affected by chronic moderate to severe periodontitis 2 males and 4 females termed here PCS.

Among periodontitis patients the samples were classified into 2 groups Samples from smoker patients with chronic periodontitis PCS and samples from non-smoker patients with chronic periodontitis PCnoS.

The different subgingival microbiota compositions in 8 CTRLs 6 PCS and 6 PCnoS patients were studied by high-throughput sequencing of the16S rDNA V3-V4 hypervariable region on an Illumina MiSeq platform.

The present study demonstrated that alpha diversity decreased in both smoker PCS and non-smoker PCnoS periodontitis patients compared with healthy controls.

Notably genes associated with tissue damage were increased in PCS patients while genes associated with amino acid metabolism and nutrient biosynthesis were reduced in PCS patients compared with CTRLs.Although the PCS and PCnoS groups both exhibited a shift in subgingival bacterial composition compared with healthy subjects several results highlight a major alteration in PCSMOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 15 2007-2014 20172013Figure 3.
