five ru- minally fistulated angus x simmental steers 335 - 56 kg bw were used in a 5 x 5 latin square design to de- termine effects of increasing dietary cds on digestion and ruminal fermentation segers et al.

feed samples were composited across period and 50 mg of each dried feedstuff 20 mg for cds was analyzed for fatty acid composition table 1 as previously de- scribed masood et al.

relative abundance of bacterial species was calculated using the geometrical mean of 2 universal primers with theefficiency-corrected d-cycle threshold method ramirez-farias et al.
