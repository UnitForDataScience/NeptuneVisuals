The dichotomy between 2 and 34 DAH larvae- associated bacterial communities was also evident as only 24 OTUs were common to both sample categories while 58 and 110 OTUs from 2 and 34 DAH larvae respectively remained exclusive to each Figure 5A.To more specifically address the relative contribution of live feed and rearing-water as bacterial vectors for mature fish larvae a Venn diagram was constructed using OTUs detected in the live feed pooling of rotifers and artemia nauplii and metanauplii samples 34 DAH rearing-water and 34 DAH fish larvae as discrete OTU pools Figure 5B.

All these OTUs displayed enhanced numbers in 34 DAH fish larvae but occurred at very low abundances in the live feed Table S6.Because OTUs represented by one read are by definition sample-specific removal of singletons from the data led to a substantial reduction in the number of OTUs exclusive to each sample category whereas the number of OTUs commonto all sample categories remained unchanged Figures S2A-C.

Artemia nauplii were given from 15 DAH until 19 DAH and metanauplii from 20 DAH until the end of the rearing trial 34 DAH Figure 1.

In contrast a subtle non- significant Holm-Sidak t  2.371 P  0.06 increase in richness was observed for fish larvae from 2 DAH 40 - 10.14 OTUs to 34 DAH 53.75 - 7 OTUs Figure 2A.

Larvae at 2 DAH hosted 29 specific OTUs within these four sample categories and shared 39 bacterial OTUs with its primary surrounding environment that is 2 DAH rearing-water Figure 5A Table S4 Supplementary Material.

Of note was a striking decrease in rearing-water bacterial richness during the trial with averages - standard deviation of 286.5 - 55.45 vs. 134.75 - 34.05 OTUs detected per sample at 2 DAH and 34 DAH respectively Holm-Sidak t  5.982 P  0.001.

As expected due to their high richness values bacterial communities from 2 and 34 DAH tank water were the most susceptible to the removal of singleton OTUs Table 1 Figure 2B averaging 193.5 - 41.16 and 97.25 - 25.90 OTUs per sample respectively Figure 2B.
