However most of these studies assessed the levels of pharmaceuticals in the influents and 0960-8524c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Again it was reported by and that bacteria could enhance the microalgal growth and help in biomass flocculation by increasing the floc-size of microalgae leading to a rapid settling and harvesting of the biomass.In addition to the ability of microalgae to aid in attaining satis- factory wastewater treatment efficiency the biomass accumulated during this treatment is considered as an important source of bio- products.

A hydraulic retention time HRT of 3 days supported poor treatment because of the formation of p-aminophenol paracetamol toxic metabolite.

Optimizing a suitable and cost effective biodegradation system could combat this emerging problem.In this regard several studies have been conducted on the occurrence and removal of mixtures of different classes of pharma- ceuticals such as analgesics antiseptics natural estrogens beta- blockers lipid-lowering agents antibiotics and psychiatric agents during regular municipal wastewater treatment  .

In this regard and over the last two decades biological treatment of wastewater using microalgal-bacterial systems proved to be the most promising and cost-effective tool  .

Both of the treatment and detoxification efficiencies were monitored and optimized.

The dual-purpose approach of pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and production of valuable bioproducts was attempted through harvesting and analysing the generated biomass to determine its main bioproducts and possible fields of applications.Materials and methodsMicroorganismsAn analgesics-tolerant microalgal strain labelled as A1 and an analgesics-degrading bacterial consortium labelled as K2 were used to construct an artificial microalgal-bacterial consortium A1K2 at a ratio of 5 1 respectively according to .

The brine shrimp lethality assay BSLA was performed according to the protocol described in  this assay was used also to assess the detoxification efficiency of the treatment process.The toxicity of ketoprofen was determined in a previous study  using the same mentioned organisms.Tested analgesicsParacetamol aspirin and ketoprofen were kindly provided by El-Nile Company for Pharmaceutical Industries Al-Amiriya Egypt Chemical Industry Development CID Company Giza Egypt and Al-Amriya Pharmaceutical Industries Company Alexandria Egypt respectively.

The PBR wasfurther operated under various conditions  to investigate the impact of the key conditions and to optimize the treatment efficiency.

The recorded deterioration in the treatment and detoxifica- tion efficiencies of the PBR could be attributed to the formation of a more toxic intermediate p-aminophenol.
