In vitro fecal fermentation experiments have confirmed that 18.3 mg resveratrolL a much higher concentration than obtainable by the diet can be almost completely degraded to metabolites by the gut microbiome of healthy volunteers within 24 h with the main metabolites including lunularin dihydroresveratrol and 34-dihydroxy- trans-stilbene produced by the gut 21.Proposed mechanisms of action of resveratrol on the gut microbiomeModulation of the composition of the gut microbiota.

Considering the importance of the gut barrier function for immunity and in the pathophysiology of several disease processes leaky gut the role of resveratrol in contributing to the mainte- nance of an intact intestinal barrier clearly warrants further investigation.Health effects of resveratrol mediated through the gut microbiotaResearch into the health effects of resveratrol or its metabo- lites that are mediated by the gut microbiota are limited to experimental animal models.

Lower concentrations of tryptamine may reflectResveratrol and the gut microbiome 841TABLE 1 Effect of resveratrol on gut microbial populations in in vitro and in rodent models1model and 1 mg resveratrol  kg21  d21Continueda relative decrease in Firmicutes and therefore a reduction in the functional ability of the gut microbiome to produce tryptophan decarboxylases 41.

Although the composition of the gut microbiome was not measured directly in the hu- man study substantial changes in the production of microbiome-associated metabolites mirrored trends found in animal studies in which resveratrol was found to modu- late the gut microbiota 40.The effect of a resveratrol supplement in combination with the dietary polyphenol epigallocatechin gallate EGCG on the gut microbiota has been investigated in a single clin- ical trial conducted in 37 healthy untrained overweight and obese adults 37.

Preliminary studies have shown that resveratrol can modulate gut microbiota composition undergo biotransformation to active metabolites via the intestinal microbiota or affect gut barrier function.

Hence plasma concentrations of free resveratrol are considerably lower than its metabolites which calls into question whether results obtained from in vitro exper- iments with the use of resveratrol can be used to elucidate the mechanisms behind improvements in human health.With the increased interest in the role of the gut micro- biome in the maintenance of human health and the patho- genesis of many diseases several mechanisms have been proposed by which resveratrol can exert its health effects through modulating the composition of the gut microbiota 17 18.

As a basis for our review we searched the PubMed database with the use of the keywords resveratrol gut microbiota to iden- tify primary research articles that have investigated the effect of resveratrol on the gut microbiome and we support these articles with relevant background citations.

Several changes in the composition of the gut microbiota were noted most importantly it prevented a high-fat diet-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis namely by increasing the BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio.

Moreover the activation of the mTOR2 signal- ing pathway followed by mTOR1 inhibition with resveratrol has been speculated to directly suppress the growth of obesity-associated gut microorganisms such as Lactococcus Clostridium cluster XI Oscillibacter and Hydrogenoanaero- bacterium 33.Resveratrol and the gut microbiome 845Impaired GLP-1 signaling is also thought to play a role in obesity and type 2 diabetes development 83.

The composition of the gut microbiome is complex with a common set of microbial species present in all individuals although the relative pro- portions may vary widely within a much larger set of bacte- ria fungi and archaea that make up the human gut microbiome 86.
