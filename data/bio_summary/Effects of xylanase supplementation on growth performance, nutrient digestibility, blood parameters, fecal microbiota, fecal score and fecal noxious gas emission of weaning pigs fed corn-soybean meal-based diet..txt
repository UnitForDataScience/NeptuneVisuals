In conclusion dietary supplementation of xylanase improved growth performance nutrient digestibility shifted microbiota by increasing fecal Lactobacillus counts decreased BUN concentration fecal score and fecal NH3 and H2S emission in weaning pigs.Key words corn-soybean meal based diet growth performance noxious gas emission weaning pigs xylanase.INTRODUCTIONCorn an important feedstuffs in livestock feeding is a very uniform product and easily digestible with slight variations in protein and energy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of xylanase supplementation on growth performance nutrient digestibility blood parameters fecal microbiota fecal score and fecal noxious gas emission of weaning pigs fed corn-soybean meal based diet.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe experimental protocol used in this study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Dankook University China.Enzyme sourceThe enzyme preparation used in this study was Nutrase Xyla Nutrex Nv Lille Belgium derived from fermentation by Bacillus subtilis.

From weeks 36 there was a linear increasing trend in ADG following weaning and reflects the pigs adapted to the post-weaning diet with increased fecal Lactobacillus counts and nutrient digestibility.Fecal noxious gas emissionThe fecal noxious gas NH3 H2S and total mercaptans are major aerial pollutants originating from animal pro- duction Lesschen et al.

Therefore the reduced fecal NH3 and H2S emissions in this study were probably due to the enhanced nutrient digestibility and Lactobacillus counts.ConclusionsDietary supplementation of xylanase improved growth performance nutrient digestibility shifted microbiota by increasing fecal Lactobacillus counts decreased BUN concentration fecal score and fecal NH3 and H2S emissions in weaning pigs.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support by Department of Animal Resources  Science Dankook University.

Therefore further studies are necessary to investigate the digestibil- ity of amino acid by pigs provided with the experimental diets used in this study.Fecal microbiota and fecal scoreIt has been suggested that non-starch polysaccharide degrading enzyme NSPase supplementation might influence the intestinal microbiota through two main mechanisms reducing the undigested substrates and releasing oligosaccharides from cell wall NSPs with potential prebiotic effects He et al.

From days 29 to 42 and the overall period there were linear increases P  0.05 in ADG and GF associated with the supplementation of xylanase but no significant difference P  0.05 was observed in ADFI.Nutrient digestibility blood parameters fecal microbiota fecal score and fecal noxious gas emissionThere were linear increases P  0.05 in the ATTD of DM N and GE associated with the supplementation of xylanase in the diet Table 3.

No differ- ences P  0.05 were observed on fecal total mercap- tans emission among treatments but NH3 and H2S emission showed linear decreases P  0.05 associated with the supplementation of xylanase Table 7.XYLANASE ADDED IN CORN-SOYBEAN BASED DIET 1401Table 2 Effects of xylanase supplementation on growth performance in weanling pigsUsed 150 weaning pigs with an average initial body weight of 7.85 0.93 kg.

The fecal score was determined by the average value of five pigs of each pen by using a 5-grade score system Hu et al.
