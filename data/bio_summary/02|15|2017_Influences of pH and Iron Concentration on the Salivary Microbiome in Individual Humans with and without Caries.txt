All of these data suggest that either higher or lower pH or iron creates potentially pathogenic conditions and thus a single product for daily oral care probably should be avoided the ranges of pH and iron concentration necessary for maintaining a healthy oral environment require further investigation.Relationships among the DMFT index pH and iron concentration based on correlations with salivary microbiomes.

S4 and the species exhibiting strong correlations are further listed in .Moreover at the species level the salivary pH iron concentration and DMFT index also exhibited substantial effects.

Different distribution patterns at different taxonomic levels were also previously reported in the oral cavity of healthy individuals  and we believe that the interactions of species are complex and that a deeper investigation of microorganisms at the species level is required.Relationships of the bacterial profiles with pH and iron concentration.

Therefore we hypothesize that both a low pH and high iron concentration influence salivary species which further increases the risk of caries.TABLE 1 Details for species with high correlations with the three variablesfPositiveIronNegative pHContinued on following pageaNo.

MICROBIAL ECOLOGYInfluences of pH and Iron Concentration on the Salivary Microbiome in Individual Humans with and without CariesJianye Zhoua Nan Jiangb Zhenzhen Wangc Longqing Lid Jumei Zhanga Rui Mac Hongbing Niea Zhiqiang LiaKey Laboratory of Oral Diseases of Gansu Province Key Laboratory of Stomatology of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission Northwest University for Nationalities Lanzhou Gansu Chinaa Institute of Applied Ecology Chinese Academy of Sciences Shenyang Chinab School of Stomatology Lanzhou University Lanzhou Chinac Institute of Modern Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences Lanzhou ChinadABSTRACT This study aimed to identify the differences in the oral microbial com- munities in saliva from patients with and without caries by performing sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq platform as well as to further assess their relationships with environmental factors salivary pH and iron concentration.

Given thesignificant correlation of the iron concentration with the pH which was not observed with the DMFT index we suspect that the data for the pH and iron concentration represent the real-time conditions of the collected samples whereas the DMFT index represents activities that mainly occurred in the past.

Ten milliliters of supernatant was used for measurement of the pH with a calibrated FE20 FiveEasy Plus pH meter Mettler-Toledo Schwerzenbach Switzerland.

The se- quencing data for the two groups revealed that i particular distribution patterns synergistic effects or competition existed in the subjects with and without caries at both the genus and species levels and ii both the salivary pH and iron concentra- tion had significant influences on the microbial community structure.IMPORTANCE The significant influences of the oral environment observed in this study increase the current understanding of the salivary microbiome in caries.

For example intraoral pH has been reported to have a strong effect on the structure of microbial communities especially for partial dentin caries-associated microbiota such as some Lactobacillus species .

The salivary pH oral iron concentration and DMFT index significantly influenced the bacterial community structure at the genus and species levels P  0.01 .
