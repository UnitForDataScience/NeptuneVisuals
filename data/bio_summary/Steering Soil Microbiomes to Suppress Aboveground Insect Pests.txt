Given that the beneficial effects for the plant are often provided by a consortium of microbes  there is an urgent need for approaches that incorporate the wider diversity that exists in nature into microbe-mediated plant protection strategies .Impact of Soil Microbiomes on Aboveground HerbivoresEvidence for how belowground microbial communities as a whole impact aboveground insects is scarce however given the typically strong responses to only one or two1Department of Terrestrial Ecology NIOO-KNAW Postbus 50 6700 ABWageningen The Netherlands 2Department of Entomology Purdue University 901 W.

Similarly inoculation of distinct microbiomes collected from soils with different plant species altered the leaf metabolome of arabidopsis Arabidopsis thaliana and resistance of the plant to the caterpillar Trichoplusia ni .

B The new microbiome can affect plant growth and resistance to aboveground attackers of not only the plant that is already growing in the soil but also that of plants growing later in the soil.

during intercropping.antagonistically to other microbes that are prohibiting the establishment enhance plant colonization or have a direct effect on plant growth or resistance .

Given that soil microbiomes are complex entities the mechanisms involved are diverse including priming for enhanced defensive responses induction of plant secondary metabolites as well as direct interactions between soil microbes and insects via direct contact of insects with the soil or via colonization of plant by soil microbes.

OpinionSteering Soil Microbiomes to Suppress Aboveground Insect PestsAna Pineda1 Ian Kaplan2 Soil-borne microbes affect aboveground herbivorous insects through a cas- cade of molecular and chemical changes in the plant but knowledge of these microbe-plant-insect interactions is mostly limited to one or a few microbial strains.

soil plant or animal referred to as the microbiome see  imparts crucial functions to all living organisms.

Interestingly the rhizosphere a thin interface between roots and soil can be considered the plant equivalent to the human intestinal tract .Soil is the major source of microbes which determine the plant-associated microbiome .

Soil microbes are not only crucial for enhancing plant survival growth and tolerance to abiotic stress but also induce systemic resistance against pathogens and insects both aboveground and belowground .

Thus the soil microbiome has emerged as a key component of plant immunity  and shapes how plants interact with their abiotic and biotic environments in the so-called 'phytobiome' .
