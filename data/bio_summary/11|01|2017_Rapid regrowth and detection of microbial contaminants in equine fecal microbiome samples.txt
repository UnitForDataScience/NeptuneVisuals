While the identification of human fecal bloom taxa is crucial for studies such as the AGP it is unclear and perhaps doubt- ful that a human derived bloom filter and contaminant detection strategy is appropriate for non-human fecal microbiome studies.In addition to obtaining basic information on horse fecal bloom contaminants knowledge of the timing that bloom occurs would be useful to assess the possibility of collecting fecal sam- ples from horses housed in stalls without having to directly observe time of defecation so long as a time-window is known.

The Hammond and Loranger samples clustered with the initial time points 0 2 and 4 h from the time series samples.16S copy number and bloom taxaUsing picrust's inferred 16S rRNA gene copy numbers OTUs increasing with time in fecal pel- lets had an average rRNA gene copy number of 9.84 - 0.69 while all detected OTUs in fresh feces had an average of 3.94 - 0.69 copies per genome.In comparison to previously reported horse fecal microbiome studies see Supplemental Information  for data compiled from other studies our study found Bacteroidetes to be the most abundant phylum 34.3.

Additionally the effect of time and horse source of manure pile were both significant R2  0.265 p  0.001 and R2  0.329 p  0.001 respectively using PERMANOVA adonis function R vegan package.Identification of bacterial families increasing or decreasing with time objectiveiiFamilies of bacteria that either increased or decreased with time were determined using two methods.

Being able to identify possible 'bloom' taxa in horse fecal samples would give greater confidence to crowdsourced projects where horse fecal samples can be col- lected at many different locations and processed in a single laboratory using a standard lab protocol avoiding many potential biases.We hypothesized that horse feces would likely undergo shifts in microbial community com- position due to blooms of taxa and further hypothesized that these bloom taxa may not be the same as those found in the AGP since the human and horse fecal microbiome have different compositions.

Thus the objectives of this study were to examine the technical reproduc- ibility of two collection methods surface fecal pellet sampling vs. homogenized fecal pellet sampling and to investigate the identities and timing of potential bloom taxa in horse fecal samples using NGS.

The main objectives of this study are i examine the technical reproduc- ibility of 16S rRNA-based NGS surveys of the horse fecal microbiome using two different sam- pling techniques surface sampling of manure or homogenization of manure ii track the changes in horse fecal microbiome post deposition from fresh to 12 h and identify horse fecal regrowth i.e.

In this study we examined the effect of sampling the surface of fecal pellets compared to homogenized fecal pellets and also the effect of time of sampling after defecation on 'bloom' taxa bloom taxa refers to microbial taxa that can grow rapidly in horse feces post- defecation using v4 16S rRNA amplicon libraries.

The weak influence of sampling method on community dissimilarity and lack of significant taxonomic shifts between surface and homogenized samples relative to dif- ferent horses suggest the sampling method to be a weak influence in this study.Changes in horse manure microbiome with time objectiveiiChanges in alpha diversity with time were measured using Shannon diversity H' as a func- tion of time .
