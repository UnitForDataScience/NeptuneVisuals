Indeed the cross talk between the nervous system and the gut immune system can shape the mucosal immune response to gut antigens and contribute to gut homeostasis.

MAIT cells make up 10 of peripheral blood and intestinal lamina propria T cells and express Th17 cells markers.

highlight the role played by epithelial cell NOD2 expression in maintaining gut homeostasis and regulating ileal microbiota composition and address the consequences of a deficient NOD2 variant in gut dysregulation.

It is widely accepted that T cell function par- ticularly the interplay between regulatory and effector T cells is of major importance in the maintenance of gut tolerance to intestinal antigens.

discuss the important role played by a unique human subset of Treg cells the IL-10- producers CD4CD8aa cells present in the intestinal mucosa.

In a mini-review discuss the dynamic balance between intestinal Th17 and Treg cells the plasticity allowing interdifferentiation and the participation of the gut microbiome in driving the differentiation toward each phenotype.

Mucosal- associated invariant T cells MAIT cells are a non-conventional T cell subset possibly playing a role in CD .

In an opinion article elegantly discusses arguments in favor of the participation of MAIT cells in CD pathogenesis and presents two putative mechanisms by which activation of this T cell subset might occur in the gut.In recent years evidence is accumulating in favor of a central role of gut microbiota in CD pathogenesis.

CD and ulcerative colitis UC are the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease IBD which has long been characterized as an exacerbated inflammatory response to common antigenic stimuli in the gut due to immune dysregulation.
