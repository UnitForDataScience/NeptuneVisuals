Formula-fed infants have been reported to have higher morbidity and mortality during the first year of life and have an increased risk of developing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections and diseases such as necrotising enterocolitis and sepsis compared with breast-fed infants.The health promoting effects of human milk have been linked to the abundance of bioactive molecules pres- ent therein including secretory antibodies immune cells antimicrobial proteins such as lactoferrin CD14 and lysozyme regulatory cytokines and human milk oligosaccharides HMOs.

In contrast Staphylococcus was consistently detected at a high fre- quency in all samples with a mean relative abundance of 13 and 19 at week 1 in human milk and infant faeces respectively.A number of niche-specific genera were exclusive to either human milk or infant faeces.

For example the high relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in human milk was largely attributable to the gen- era Pseudomonas and Variovorax and Elizabethkingia and Flavobacterium respectively which were exclusive to human milk.

Shared genera between human milk and infant faeces at each week as average percentage relative abundances and p-values.DiscussionThe benefits of human milk in terms of infant health and development have been well documented.

Although not previously reported in the human milk microbiome Variovorax strains of which have been isolated from the human oral cavity were consistently detected in all samples.The detection of large proportions of typical inhabitants of the skin and oral microbiota may imply that the origin in this case is secondary contamination.

For milk sampling sterile gloves were worn and the nipple and areola of the human were cleaned with chlorhexidane wipes Clinell United Kingdom prior to manual expression of human milk into a sterile tube.

The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial communities in human milk and infant faeces over the first 3 months of life in 10 mother-infant pairs.

The presence of viable Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in human milk was also evaluated.

MiSeq sequencing revealed a large diversity of the human milk microbiota identifying over 207 bacterial genera in milk samples.

Genera shared between infant faeces and human milk samples accounted for 70-88 of the total relative abundance in infant faecal samples supporting the hypothesis of vertical transfer of bacteria from milk to the infant gut.
