As previously reported for the USA cohort the biofilm status of paired normal tissues from MAL1 and MAL2 largely matched the biofilm status of the tumors from the same individual and therefore were called concordant pairs only 221 MAL1 and 323 MAL2 patients had discordant biofilm scores between their tumor and normal tissues all 5 of which were cases in which the tumor was biofilm positive but the paired normal tissue was negative.

S5.The above analysis was then expanded to include all available 16S rRNA gene sequencing data sets on CRC samples including two additional studies involving CRC versus healthy biopsy samples five studies on CRC versus paired normal tis- sueand four stool-based studies.In total eight data sets were analyzed for differences between CRC and healthy biopsies andor stool and eight data sets were analyzed for differences between CRC and paired normal tissue.

Only 211 paired normal tissues that were positive for B. fragilis had tumors that were below the cut-off value while similarly 315 paired normal tissues that were positive for HOMD had tumors below the HOMD cut-off value.

F. nucleatum has gained increasing notoriety in recent years as a potential pathogen in a number of clinical diseases including gastro-intestinal disorders cardiovascular disease adverse pregnancy outcomes respiratory tract infections and oropharyngeal infections where it was firstdiscovered.Mechanistically F. nucleatum is a ubiquitous oral bacterium that is both highly adherent and invasive a property attributed to virulence proteins including the adhesion and invasion protein FadA and the galactose-inhibitable adhesion protein Fap2.-More recently secreted or surface FadA was found to bind to E-cadherin and induce Wntb-catenin signaling in the colons of mice where F. nucleatum accelerated tumorigen- esis.Immune mechanisms including myeloid cell infiltration the balance between FOXP3hi and FOXP3lo Treg populations and checkpoint molecule TIGIT blockade may modulate F. nucleatum- associated carcinogenesis.-However Fusobacterium are enriched in only a subset of tumors and are present at a much lower abundance in paired normal tissue.-Similarly enrichment of Fusobacterium in biofilms occurs in only a subset of tumors and is often undetectable in paired normal tissuesfindings that our additional cohort of Malaysian patients and meta-analyses upheld.

Heterogeneity analysis includes estimates of I2 percentage of variation reflecting true heterogeneity t2 random-effects between study variance and p-value from Cochran's Q test for heterogeneitythan the percentages observed for paired normals and tumors for each feature by Fisher's exact test healthy biopsy vs. paired normal p  0.0001 for biofilms p  0.01 for HOMD p  0.01 for B. fragilis healthy biopsy vs. tumor p  0.0001 for all three features.

In comparison a range of 13-35 of healthy screening colonoscopy patients have been reported to harbor colonic biofilms with equivalent percentages of biofilms on the right and left sides.Notably the prevalence of biofilms in the healthy biopsies in the present meta-analysis was lower than expected 6 however separating these samples by cohort revealed that 212 MAL1 biopsies 17 were biofilm positive while the 21 USA biopsies chosen for sequencing were part of a larger cohort previously published in which 15120 biopsies 13 were biofilm positive.Clearly thereMicrobial features associated with CRCJL Drewes et al.10is a need for a much larger study of biofilms in healthy screening colonoscopy individuals to resolve the true estimated prevalence but the current estimates still point to a much higher rate of biofilms on proximal tumors than on proximal biopsies.

For USA and MAL1 CRC samples were compared to both paired normal as well as healthy biopsies whereas for MAL2 only CRC and paired normal tissues were examined Fig.

High-throughput next-generation sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using 319 F 5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3' and 806 R 5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3' universal primers containing a linker sequence required for Illumina MiSeq 300 bp paired-end sequencing and a 12-bp heterogeneity-spacer index sequence.For the MAL2 cohort a total of 46 samples including paired tumor normal colon tissue samples from 19 CRC patients two unpaired tumors from CRC patients and biological replicates of three MAL1 paired tumor normal samples were evaluated.

While a similar percentage of paired normals were biofilm positive 44 p  0.721 by Fisher's exact test compared to tumors the prevalence of HOMD and B. fragilis in paired normal tissues was approximately half of that found in tumors significantly so for HOMD HOMD 24 vs. 48 p  0.009 B. fragilis 17 vs. 38 p 0.254 respectively Fig.
