We packaged this pipeline under the name of the ancient Greek mythology goddess ''Rhea'' as a reference to its ever flowing modular architecture and make it freely available at .METHODS RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverviewThe Rhea pipeline consists of six main R scripts that perform the tasks of normalization of input tables calculation of alpha-diversity beta-diversity taxonomic relative abundances serial group comparisons and correlations.

All of the existing filters in Rhea are easy to adjust and a log file listing the selections made is created for every run of the script for future reference and for the sake of reproducibility.As graphical outputs of the Serial Group Comparisons Script Rhea offers three possibilities box violin and dot plots that can easily be set by the user in the upper modifiable part of the script.

a specific association between the occurrence of microbes and a specific conditions and because p-values adjustment is still a matter of debate at least in clinical science  Rhea offers interpretation of data both before and after correction of p-values.The rationale behind Rhea is really to share knowledge usable for analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon datasets by providing a ready-to-use transparent pipeline both in terms of scripts structure and detailed documentation that explains choices made for analysis and how to use scripts.

2017 Rhea a transparent and modular R pipeline for microbial profiling based on 16S rRNA gene amplicons.

For the purpose of demonstrating and illustrating the different features of Rhea the publicly available sequence data from the study by  with ENA accession  were analysed with the web platform IMNGS  and the output OTU-table and files also available for download through the GitHub repository were used for analysis.

Those data were also processed with the web platform IMNGS and the OTU-table and all intermediate steps for the analysis of Coefficient of Variation can be find in .The following sections describe in detail each of the main functions of Rhea therebyemphasizing on important concepts underlying data processing using the scripts.

To minimize manual handling of data intermediate files generated during processing are automatically transferred to folders where they are needed for downstream analysis on the condition that the original folder structure of Rhea is kept unchanged.

Illustrations shown in the present manuscript correspond to raw outputs generated by Rhea with very minor post-production manual changes i.e.

In Rhea the issue with this kind of transformation is the incompatibility with some of the downstream analytical functions requiring counts or proportions.
