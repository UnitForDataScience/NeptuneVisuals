those data were also processed with the web platform imngs and the otu-table and all intermediate steps for the analysis of coefficient of variation can be find in .the following sections describe in detail each of the main functions of rhea therebyemphasizing on important concepts underlying data processing using the scripts.

very scattered occurrence we strongly encourage thorough knowledge of input data to be able to identify thresholds that can be set in rhea to avoid analysis of those low relevant taxa as it was shown that pre-filtering data increases the power of analysis .the first step in the present script is transformation of the otu or taxonomic relative abundances table by replacement of near-to-zero values with zero.

a specific association between the occurrence of microbes and a specific conditions and because p-values adjustment is still a matter of debate at least in clinical science  rhea offers interpretation of data both before and after correction of p-values.the rationale behind rhea is really to share knowledge usable for analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicon datasets by providing a ready-to-use transparent pipeline both in terms of scripts structure and detailed documentation that explains choices made for analysis and how to use scripts.

therefore to avoid these pitfalls we recommend treating zeros as missing values during statistical tests in rhea.zeroing values and treating them as missing data as explained in detail in the previous sections can substantially affect the number of positive samples within a group prevalence and thereby markedly influence the interpretation of data.

if relevant all pairwise correlations within meta- variables andor taxonomic variables can be calculated and reported too.sequencing data read counts otus and taxonomies are compositional and therefore data transformation is needed before true correlations across variables can be detected .

for the purpose of demonstrating and illustrating the different features of rhea the publicly available sequence data from the study by  with ena accession  were analysed with the web platform imngs  and the output otu-table and files also available for download through the github repository were used for analysis.

to minimize manual handling of data intermediate files generated during processing are automatically transferred to folders where they are needed for downstream analysis on the condition that the original folder structure of rhea is kept unchanged.

since this is rarely the case for otu-based data we use the non- parametric kruskal-wallis rank sum test in rhea .

we packaged this pipeline under the name of the ancient greek mythology goddess ''rhea'' as a reference to its ever flowing modular architecture and make it freely available at .methods results and discussionoverviewthe rhea pipeline consists of six main r scripts that perform the tasks of normalization of input tables calculation of alpha-diversity beta-diversity taxonomic relative abundances serial group comparisons and correlations.

all of the existing filters in rhea are easy to adjust and a log file listing the selections made is created for every run of the script for future reference and for the sake of reproducibility.as graphical outputs of the serial group comparisons script rhea offers three possibilities box violin and dot plots that can easily be set by the user in the upper modifiable part of the script.

however this rapid popularization is in stark contrast to the slow transfer of knowledge about data analysis.

the hope generated by pioneering next-generation sequencing studies community was high but recent findings have highlighted the needs for standardization in the field     .with respect to data processing important parameters such as the choice of clustering methods and thresholds of relative abundances must be considered for proper analysis of high-throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon datasets  .

there are several options for the processing of raw sequence data down to otus-tables the most popular software or package thereof are qiime  mothur  and uparse method  offered by the usearch package .
