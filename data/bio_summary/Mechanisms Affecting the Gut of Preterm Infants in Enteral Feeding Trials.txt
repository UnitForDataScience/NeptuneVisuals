Stool metabolome is measured using GCMS andor LCMS in samples collected on days 1-3 7 10-14 and 21 -1 days.Pattern of gut microbiota prior to the onset of NEC or LOSmeasured using up to seven daily stool samples in the period immediately prior to disease compared to samples from con- trol cases who do not develop disease.The gut tissue inflammatory response in surgically resected gut tissue affected by NEC and in control tissue either non- affected tissue from the same infant or tissue from an infant requiring gut resection who does not have disease will be determined by immunohistochemistry.

In addition organisms causing blood culture-positive sepsis in preterm infants were frequently detected within the gut prior to LOS onset and typically as an abundant member of the gut microbial community .The MAGPIE aims to explore potential interactions between microbes and metabolites critical for development of gut immune function expanding work from our group and others  .

Additional studies highlight the importance of host-microbe interactions by demonstrating the pivotal role of SCFAs and other compounds in inducing differentiation of gut regulatory T cells - a pathway of major importance in preterm infant NEC and LOS.The MAGPIE may provide insights into the effects of early gut microbehost interactions in establishing gut health and immune function.

We will explore dynamic changes in the gut community structure proportions of key bacterial operational taxonomy units presence of specific pathogenic strains diversity richness and stability of communities.Analyze resected gut tissue using optimized immunohisto- chemistry to determine gut immune response where NEC develops.

Collecting even limited biological samples from all recruited infants would be extremely challeng- ing and expensive.The interventions explored in SIFT and ELFIN both act via effects on the gut and are therefore likely to involve interactions with gut microbiota  -.

In the context of the SIFT trial delayed initiation or slower increases in milk feeds reduce exposure to breast milk which may affect gut epithelial development function and the pattern of gut microbiota.At the time of funding MAGPIE the only existing published RCT in preterm infants n  450 using bovine lactoferrin showed reductions in the incidence of LOS for a range of bac- teria both Gram-negative and Gram-positive as well as fungi .

Our specific aims are to test the following hypothesesTrial interventions will result in detectable differences in gut microbiota that will be directly related to metabolic functionInfants who develop NEC or LOS will have differences in gutCollect a daily stool and urine sample from MAGPIE infants until hospital discharge average duration 40-50 days or transfer back to local neonatal unit.Retrieve any residual resected gut tissue of enrolled infants who undergo intestinal surgery.Identify samples which are the mostinformative--based on trial intervention and disease presencecomprehensive--consistency of daily samplingrepresentative--balanced for trial intervention and other key factors e.g.

There will be detectable differences in gut tissue inflammatory response between surgically resected gut tissue affected by NEC and control tissue.We will achieve these aims by determining the following outcomesGut microbial diversity e.g.

Analysis of the stool metabolome reflects changes in gut microbial activity and may impact on host gut function such as changes in permeability.

Necrotizing enterocolitis NEC a serious inflammatory gut condition and late-onset sepsis LOS are common feeding and nutrition-related problems that may cause death or serious long-term morbidity and are key outcomes in two current UK National Institutes for Health Research NIHR trials.
