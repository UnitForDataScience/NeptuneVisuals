The deteriorated group had lower Bifidobacterium counts q  0.05 FDR correction than the stable group at year 0  suggesting that lower counts of Bifidobacterium at year 0 may be predictive of progression of PD in 2 years.Bacterial counts between years 0 and 2Total fecal bacterial counts were decreased in 2 years in all PD patients as well as in both the deteriorated and stable groups and .

Lack of change in the severity of constipation in 2 years in both groups  may be correlated with lack of change in the counts of Lactobacillus.Retrospective analysis of intestinal microbiota at year 0 revealed that the deteriorated group had a lower count of Bifidobacterium compared to the stable group  although we pre- viously reported no difference between PD patients and healthy cohabitants at year 0 .Similar to C. leptum subgroup and B. fragilis group stated above the Bifidobacterium counts at year 2 were not different between the deteriorated and stable groups .

G H Correlation between a change of LBP concentrations in 2 years and the count of L. brevis at year 0 G and the count of L. plantarum at year 0 H. B C D E and F Pearson's correlation coefficients r are indicated with respective p-values.7 bacteria that were decreased in the stable group Prevotella became lower in 2 years  and.Correlations between the bacterial counts at year 0 and the progression of clinical symptoms in 2 yearsWe predicted a change of total UPDRS scores in 2 years using fecal bacterial counts at year 0 using multiple linear regression models with stepwise selection.

Among the 3 bacteria that were low in PD in our previous study  the counts of C. leptum subgroup and B. fragilis group were further decreased in 2 years in the stable group but not in the deteriorated group.

The deteriorated group had lower counts of Bifidobacterium B. fragilis and Clostridium leptium than the stable group at year 0 but not at year 2 suggesting that the deteriorated group may demonstrate accelerated lowering of these bacteria at year 0.ConclusionsThe total counts of intestinal bacterial decrease in the course of PD progression.

We previously reported that the counts of C. coccoides group C. lep- tum subgroup and B. fragilis group were lower in PD patients than healthy cohabitants .The counts of Bacteroides were also low in PD in Germany  China  and Russia  but not in Finland  or the USA  and high in the USA .

P-value was first calculated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test and was corrected by the Benjamini and Hochberg method to calculate the false discovery rate FDR q-value.aThe counts of the three bacterial groupssubgroups were significantly lower at year 0 in PD patients compared to controls .bThe counts of total Lactobacillus was significantly higher at year 0 in PD patients compared to controls .cFor comparison of total fecal bacterial counts p-value not q-value is indicated.revealed that worsening of thought disorder Item 2 in UPDRS I representing hallucinations and delusions had a negative correlation with the count of Bifidobacterium r  -0.56 p  0.01 .

Similarly serum LBP levels were not different between the 2 groups at years 0 and 2.LED tended to increase in two years in both groups but without statistical significance.Clinical and laboratory features Comparison between years 0 and 2We next compared clinical features and serum LBP levels between years 0 and 2 in the deterio- rated and stable groups .

Similar to C. leptum subgroup and B. fragilis group which were decreased in the stable group the count of C. coccoides group was also decreased in the stable group but without statistical significance.

In the stable group the counts of 7 bac- teria Bifidobacterium Clostridium leptum subgroup Bacteroides fragilis group Atopobium cluster Enterococcus L. gasseri subgroup and Lactobacillus reuteri subgroup became lower in 2 years and.
