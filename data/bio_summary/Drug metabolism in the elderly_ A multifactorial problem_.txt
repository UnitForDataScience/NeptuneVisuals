such situations may compromise the adme enzymes and inflammation has been shown both in vivo and in vitro to regulate the cyp isoforms which carry out phase i metabolism phase ii metabolism may also be affected the sulfation path- way is known to be reduced in inflammation probably by the release of cytokines whilst in vitro studies suggest that forma- tion of glucuronide and glutathione metabolites may be reduced frailty is associated with higher inflammatory markers and lower esterase activity so these findings may be a partial expla- nation of the increased rate of adrs in elderly patients.circadian rhythmscircadian regulation is mediated through the suprachiasmatic nucleus scn which acts as the master controller combining envi- ronmental cues from light and food intake to entrain internal clocks drug absorption is known to have a circadian variation lipophilic drugs are absorbed faster when taken in the morning although there is no circadian variation in absorption of water- soluble compounds.

it should be appreciated that although there may be general trends many fac- tors both genetic and environmental will influence a particular individual's situation and that knowledge of a subject's chronolog- ical age may not be a true indicator of their functional biological age.

during development demethylation occurs with a consequent increase in activity and once adult levels are attained there appears to be no significant variation in cyp3a4 expression nevertheless it may be appreciated that subse- quent methylation in the elderly like the foetal situation could be a mechanism to reduce activity.it has been appreciated for some time that elderly individuals have a reduced enzyme induction capability and are less able to tolerate overdoses this may reflect increased epigenetic gene silencing with age since dna methylation was shown to inhibit sub- sequent attempts at dioxin-mediated induction of the cyp1b1 gene activity.

there is no clear evidence that drug metabolism itself 'the biologically-assisted chemical alteration of the administered parent molecule' is less efficient in healthy old age than at younger ages whereas a decreased capacity may be associated with ill-health and frailty.

it appears that the majority of deleterious clinical outcomes related to drug therapy in an elderly usually ill or frail population may be ascribed to various anatomical and physiological age-related changes.

these may affect both phar- macodynamics and pharmacokinetics but not necessarily drug metabolism.

information gleaned from animal studies undertaken mainly in rodents does not seem to be of relevance to humans and studies in healthy aged human populations may not highlight possible problems.

however certain circumstances may influence metabolic competence and phenotyping rather than genotyping is of more value in identi- fying those susceptible to adverse drug reactions.

as time passes anatomical and physiological changes take place within several body organs and a general alteration of body composition occurs all aspects which may influence drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynam- ics potentially leading to a variety of clinical outcomes this short review concerns itself with one of these aspects namely drug metabolism the 'biologically-assisted chemical alter- ation of the administered parent drug molecule'.

the question therefore arises as totable 1factors that may influence drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in an elderly population.absorptionalteration in gastric and intestinal motilityavariable rate of gastric emptying lower gastric acid secretiona decreased absorptive surface of small intestineadecreased splanchnic blood flowadistributionlowering of total body water contentreduced lean body mass increase in adipose tissue altered plasma-protein bindingametabolismdecrease in hepatic blood flowdecrease in liver size and number of functional hepatic cells changes in enzyme activitychanges in gut microbiomeexcretiondecrease in renal mass reduction in renal perfusion glomerular filtration rate fallstubular excretorysecretory function falls alteration in biliary secretion efficiencyaorgan sensitivitychanges in receptor sensitivity adaptive response to previous exposurealteration in blood-brain barrier shield increased cns sensitivity accumulated damage to cellular functionsother factorsgeneral nutritional status chronic disease stateslife-style habits physical exercise and general fitness previous chemical exposurecompliance overdoseunderdosea the literature contains conflicting reports as to the significance of these effects in the elderly whether or not they have specific patterns of drug metabolism which reduce their ability for detoxification and if so what cir- cumstances might be involved.drug metabolismabsorption of a compound is more readily achieved if it is lipid-soluble whereas excretion is facilitated by water-solubility.

phase ii typically involves masking chemically reactive groups and increasing polarity by linking the parent drug or its metabolite from phase i with some large water- soluble anion from endogenous metabolism such as sulfate or glucuronic acid phase i metabolism and ageanimal modelsthat age may affect drug metabolism was demonstrated over fifty years ago and since that time many studies mainly in rodents have confirmed these initial observations it is widely accepted that the overall trend is for a decrease in metabolism as the animals move from maturity into senescence for those reac- tions involving the mixed function oxidases mainly cyp450 this is generally correct for the male rat although increases have been reported for some compounds.

these values are composites that reflect the many processes influencing the passage of a drug through the body and where drug metabolism may only play a minor role.

the use of test compounds of previously known high hepatic clearance extraction may offset some of these difficulties but the results are still not necessarily indicative of drug metabolism.
