high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation correct gut dysbiosis increase the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria and are associated with lower bp in doca-salt mice.5 stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats exhibit gut dysbiosis and fecal microbiota transplant fmt from stroke-prone spontaneous hypertensive rats to wistar-kyoto normotensive rats increases bp.4 furthermore we noted that htn is associated with profound pathological changes in the gut and increases brain-gut transmission in animal models of htn.6microbial dysbiosis has also been observed in patients with high bp.23 interestingly subjects with htn or pre-htn demonstrate similar characteristic changes in gut microbiota composition.7 in a rh patient antibiotic treatment resulted in bp under control with only an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggesting possible involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of rh as antibiotics alter gut microbiota.8 future work will be needed to determine whether a unique microbial signature in the gut gut pathology and increased brain-gut-bone marrow connection are present in patients with rh.could gut microbiota act as a vector to transmit htn phenotype among family membersfamily history is an important nonmodifiable risk factor for htn and multiple factors account for inheritance of htn.9 is it possible that people with a htn family history inherit their gut microbiota from their parents gut microbiota is more similar among family members versus those who are not related.10 furthermore increasing evidence shows that signals derived from the microbiota can act as environmental determinants to regulate global histone acetylation and methylation in multiple tissues of the host.11 there is growing support to suggest that gut microbiota and their products have the potential to modulate host epigenomics and the role of host epigenomics in htn is under investigation.

however alternate possibilities of prohypertensive factors directly inducing epigenetic changes in gut epithelial cells and in turn influencing the microbiota cannot be discounted.qi et al.page 3could bidirectional influences between gut microbiota and antihypertensive medications contribute to development and progression of rhbidirectional influences between gut microbiota and drug metabolism are important in htn.

taken together they raise an important question worthy of further investigation is sensitivityresistance to antihypertensive medication dependent on gut microbial composition is it possible that microbiota in resistant patients metabolize antihypertensive drugs at a faster rate are sex and race differences in bp control linked to differences in microbiota's ability to metabolize these antihypertensive drugs answers to these questions would be crucial in the development of a new generation of therapies.pre- and probiotics as possible antihypertensive agentspre-and probiotics modulate cholesterol inflammation blood glucose levels and the renin- angiotensin system to lower bp and risk for htn.14 manipulating gut microbiota using pre- and probiotics might prove a valuable adjuvant to traditional antihypertensives.

medications including antibiotics are known to profoundly affect gut microbiota and similarly the microbiota can affect drug pharmacokinetics.12 certain antihypertensives reduce gut smooth muscle contractility to cause constipation.

these facts provide an opportunity to develop novel hypotheses to advance this field.keywordsbiomarker dysbiosis gut microbiota resistant hypertension treatmentover 60 years ago irvine page1 proposed a mosaic theory where interplay of multiple factors integrate to increase blood pressure bp.

furthermore why some factors are prohypertensive in one individual and not in another and where prohypertensive signals originate remains an enigma.in this viewpoint we propose that the gut and gut microbiota could be one missing link and provide a potential unifying concept.

we summarize most recent evidence for involvement of gut microbiota in bp control and htn.

we present our thoughts on the current state and relevant knowledge gaps to be addressed to determine whether targeting gut microbiota and related pathology would be a next frontier in htn therapeutics.are htn or rh associated with a unique gut microbial signaturegut dysbiosis and microbial functions contribute to pathological effects beyond the gastrointestinal system.

gut microbiota play a role in bp regulation and gut dysbiosis has been observed in multiple animal models of htn.2-5 our group was among the first tocorrespondence to carl j. pepine md macc po box 100288 gainesville fl 32610. carl.pepinemedicine.ufl.edu or mohan k. raizada po box 100274 gainesville fl the opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the editors or of the american heart association.disclosuresnone.qi et al.page 2document htn-associated gut dysbiosis and an increased firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio.23 this was associated with a decrease in acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in the lactate-producing bacteria.

furthermorehtn phenotype in microbiota can be transferred by fmt.

for example fmt from dahlsalt-sensitive rats to dahl salt-resistant rats from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive to wistar-kyoto normotensive rats4 and from hypertensive patients to germ-free mice all lead to increased bp.7 it is likely that gut microbiota work at least in part as a vector to transfer hypertensive traits among family members.

thus signals derived from microbiota may induce epigenetic changes in gut epithelial cells to alter gut wall permeability.

recent recognition of the impact of gut microbiota on microbial transformation of drugs has led to a paradigm shift in drug design.

gut microbiota could influence the efficacy and toxicity of antihypertensive drugs in patients and a recent study confirmed this cross talk relationship.

a meta- analysis suggested that they may lower bp by a modest degree with potentially greater effect when bp is elevated multiple probiotic species are consumed the duration is 8 weeks or daily consumption is 1011 colony-forming units.15clearly it is important to better understand the variability of gut microbiota across the population and how this variability relates to specific microbial functions.
