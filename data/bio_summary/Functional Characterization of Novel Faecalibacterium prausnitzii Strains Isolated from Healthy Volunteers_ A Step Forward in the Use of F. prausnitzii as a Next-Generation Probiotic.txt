For example CNCM I-4574 and CNCM I-4543 strains were isolated from the same volunteer and present 99.8 of homology at 16S rRNA level.Interestingly the existence of strains that do not fit in any phylogroup as CNCM I-4541 suggest that biodiversity of F. prausnitzii remains poorly known maybe since only few strains have been isolated.

However this decrease was not equivalent in all the strains and does not correlate either with growth ratio r -0.2857 p  0.344 or butyrate production r  -0.3357 p 0.2869.For the PBMC assay although all the strains tend to increase the production of IL-10 cytokine only four strains two controls and two new isolates from this study were able to induce statistically significant increase production of this cytokine Figure 6B The two most performing strains A2-165 and 4543 belong to the phylogroup II group B.

prausnitzii strain genomes should be established orand a metabolic comparison of several strains in the same culture conditions whether the phylogroups belong to genomovars or genomospecies.Regarding safety concerns this study is the first step toward a better understanding of F. prausnitzii properties.

In this study we described a protocol to isolate novel F. prausnitzii strains from feces of healthy volunteers as well as a deep molecular and metabolic characterization of these isolated strains.

For this reason in this study we have used a new procedure to isolate EOS strains from feces that has enabled us to build a collection of F. prausnitzii strains.

Briefly fecal samples were homogenized and serial dilutions performed in order to plate dilutions 10-8 and 10-9 on YBHI Brain-heart infusion medium supplemented with 0.5 yeast extract Difco agarTABLE 1  Studied cohort of healthy humans' volunteers and new F. prausnitzii strain identified.SubjectSexAge yearsFecal SCFA mMCFUg EOSIdentified F. prausnitzii strainsCultivability of the strainButyratePropionateAcetateAll the isolates were obtained from human fecal samples of healthy volunteers consuming omnivorous diets.

We substantially increased the number of cultured F. prausnitzii isolates from human origin and provided new tools for a better understanding of the diversity and microbial ecology of the colon.Phylogenetic Diversity of Faecalibacterium prausnitziiFull-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined for the 17 isolates of F. prausnitzii from healthy individuals Table 1.Resistance to AntibioticsThe MIC for the different antibiotics tested are represented in the Table 3.

Growth requirements and fermentation products of Fusobacterium prausnitzii and a proposal to reclassify it as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii gen. nov. comb.

Despite its importance in human health only few microbiological studies have been performed to isolate novel F. prausnitzii strains in order to better understand the biodiversity and physiological diversity of this beneficial commensal species.

These F. prausnitzii strains were classified in two phylogroups and three clusters according to 16S rRNA sequences and results support that they would belong to two different genomospecies or genomovars as no genome sequencing has been performed in this work.
