In order to investigate the vaginal and uterine bacterial diversity of healthy giant pandas we used high- throughput sequence analysis of portions of the 16S rRNA gene based on samples taken from the vaginas GPV group and uteri GPU group of these animals.

All rights reserved.microbiological culture testing as well as culture-independent approaches involving microbiome-level analyses based on con- served and informative genes such as the bacterial 16S rRNA gene or whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing  However to the best of our knowledge little information is known about vaginal and uterine bacterial micro- biomes in the giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca.The giant panda is one of the most endangered and rare species in the world.

This may contribute to acquiring a better understanding of the poten- tial influence abnormal reproductive tract microbial communities have on negative pregnancy outcomes in giant pandas.Materials and methodsSamplesThe study sample comprised giant pandas living in a semi- captive environment in the Chinese Conservation and Research Centre for Giant Panda Wolong located in the Sichuan Province in southwest China.

Therefore two types of giant panda samples were ana- lysed in this study namely vaginal GPV group and uterine GPU group.DNA extraction PCR and HiSeq sequencing systemFig.

The sequences were assigned to 1855 OTUs at 97 of the threshold level with 446 of those in existence found in all groups shared by the GPV and the GPU The shared OTUs comprised approximately 24 of the total OTUs while 1072 and 337 OTUs were uniquely identified in the GPV and the GPU groups respectively.In order to determine whether the observed OTUs adequately reflected the true number of OTUs we calculated the mean Chao1 species richness a rarefaction curve and the Good's coverage index The rarefaction curves reached saturation at 97 pairwise identity thresholds except in the case of GPV 2 indicating that most of the microbial diversity present in these samples had already been captured at the current sequencing depth B.

Additionally Simpson and Shannon indices of diversity demonstrated that GPU had lower bacterial diversity which could also be proven by the observed species B.

In the present study we initially characterised the vaginal and uterine bacterial diversity of healthy giant pandas by using 454 pyrosequencing technology in order to provide data forfuture etiological research on reproductive disorders in giant pan- das.Proteobacteria and Firmicutes phyla occupied the most promi- nent positions of all the vaginal samples taken in our study.
