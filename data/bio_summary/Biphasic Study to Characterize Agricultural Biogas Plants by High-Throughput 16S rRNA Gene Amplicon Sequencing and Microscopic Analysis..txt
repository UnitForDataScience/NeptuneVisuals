For each sample DNA from two subsamples was extracted and used as template for construction of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries.Microbial Community Structure Analysis by HT 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon SequencingBiogas-producing microbial communities of the four agriculturalfermenters were taxonomically characterized by HT 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing applying the 16S metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol Illumina Inc. 2014 for sequence library construction.

BGP3 and BGP4 had 10 higher specific gas yields Table 1 indicating high performance.Characterization of Bacterial Subcommunities Residing in Four Agricultural Biogas Plants with HT 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon SequencingTo analyze the composition of the microbial communities prevailing in three mesophilic and one thermophilic production-scale BGP HT 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed using the Illumina MiSeq system.

Statistics of raw filtered and classified 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences obtained for four biogas plants BGP1 to BGP4.Filtering of sequences was done according to the following criteria reads with low quality scores chimera and duplicates were discarded as specified in the Materialsand Methods section.Additional OTU-clustering applying normalization of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon-derived sequences to an equal sample size was performed to compare obtainedOTUs between the datasets.

1 using HT 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed that 4 to 8 of all classified 16S rRNA gene sequences were assigned to the superkingdom Archaea.Members of the phylum Euryarchaeota were shown to be abundant with 100 of all archaeal sequences assigned to this phylum.

Methanosaeta was not detected in the thermophilic BGP4 confirming results obtained for thermophilic laboratory- scale systems 37.An advantage of QMF is the quantification of fluorescentactive methanogens as well as their immediate classification exploiting morphological characteristics which can be usefulto confirm sequencing results based on the 16S rRNA gene.

For this the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain Defluviitoga tunisiensis L3 16 was compared against the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences applying BLASTn https blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.govBlast.cgiPAGETYPEBlastSearch with 97 sequence identity and an e-value of 1 x 10 .The ClustVis 30 and metagenomeSeq tools 31 were used to detect differentially abundant features in the datasets analyzed using Principal Component Analysis PCA as described recently 30.

Principal component analysis plot of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data obtained from biogas microbial communities analyzed.The ClustVis program 30 was applied to detect differentially abundant features in samples representing three mesophilic microbial communities BGP1 BGP2 and BGP3 and one thermophilic microbiome BGP4.

Owing to the lack of Defluviitoga 16S rRNA gene sequences in the RDB database httpsrdp.cme.msu.edu when the analysis was performed additional investigation of all Thermotogae sequences from BGP4 was done.

Two mesophilic biogas plants namely BGP2 and BGP3 and the thermophilic BGP4 were operated by applying the general continuous wet fermentation technology with the addition of pig manure instead of cow manure in the case of BGP3 and BGP4.

1 which represent the relative abundances of classified reads on class family and genus levels.Taxonomic classification of the biogas microbialcommunities resulted in two superkingdoms with 92 BGP1 and BGP4 95 BGP3 and 96 BGP2 of allclassified sequences assigned to the domain Bacteria and 4 BGP2 5 BGP3 and 8 BGP1 and BGP4 archaeal sequences.
