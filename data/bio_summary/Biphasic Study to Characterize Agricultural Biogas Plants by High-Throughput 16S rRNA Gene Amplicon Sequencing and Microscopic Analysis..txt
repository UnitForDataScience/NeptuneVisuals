they mainly comprise the phyla firmicutes 53 in bgp1 45 in bgp2 and 42 in bgp3 followed by bacteroidetes 13 in bgp1 16 in bgp2 and 19 in bgp3 spirochaetes 1 in bgp1 2 in bgp2 and 4 in bgp3 and tenericutes 0.7 in bgp1 2 in bgp2 and 2 in bgp3.

for each sample dna from two subsamples was extracted and used as template for construction of 16s rrna gene amplicon libraries.microbial community structure analysis by ht 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencingbiogas-producing microbial communities of the four agriculturalfermenters were taxonomically characterized by ht 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing applying the 16s metagenomic sequencing library preparation protocol illumina inc. 2014 for sequence library construction.

the most abundant genera in the mesophilic fermenters were clostridium sensu stricto 6 in bgp1 1 in bgp2 and 7 in bgp3 treponema 1 in bgp1 2 in bgp2 and 4 in bgp3 and alkaliflexus 3 in bgp1 and bgp2 and 2 in bgp3.

methanosaeta sequences were detected for the mesophilic bgp1 67 and bgp3 56 and in addition the genus methanosarcina was only detected in bgp1 6 and bgp3 11. the thermophilic bgp4 was clearly dominated by methanogens with the genus methanothermobacter 86 being present only in this reactor.morphological classification of methanogenic archaea by microscopy and image analysisdna isolation from archaeal organisms is a challenging task 35 owing to the presence of cell wall glycoproteins which cause difficulties in cell disruption of some archaeal members such as methanothermobacter 36. therefore archaeal subcommunity profiles determined by ht sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons were additionally evaluated by implementing the qmf method in order toprovide further insights into their composition.quantification of active methanogenic cells was achieved by exploiting the characteristic autofluorescence based on coenzyme f420 tables 4 and 5 figs.

for this the 16s rrna gene sequence of the strain defluviitoga tunisiensis l3 16 was compared against the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences applying blastn https blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.govblast.cgipagetypeblastsearch with 97 sequence identity and an e-value of 1 x 10 .the clustvis 30 and metagenomeseq tools 31 were used to detect differentially abundant features in the datasets analyzed using principal component analysis pca as described recently 30. furthermore to gain an overview on the biodiversity of the studied microbial communities the shannon index was computed based on 16s rrna fragments classified on rank genus as described previously 8.raw sequencing data are available in the ebincbiddbj database under the sample accession number ers1327727.microscopy of biogas microbial communities including image analysisleica dm6000b fluorescence microscope with a motorized and software-controlled three axes cross table and a leica dfc365fx camera were used for microbial image analyses.

bgp3 and bgp4 had 10 higher specific gas yields table 1 indicating high performance.characterization of bacterial subcommunities residing in four agricultural biogas plants with ht 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencingto analyze the composition of the microbial communities prevailing in three mesophilic and one thermophilic production-scale bgp ht 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed using the illumina miseq system.

this is most likely due to the diversity of the bgp1 microbiome as indicated by the number of otus identified table 3 for this reactor 403 and 321 for bgp1 vs. 267 to 301 for bgp2 and 3. it is assumed that the microbial diversity within bgp1 was introduced by the heterogeneity of the fed substrate see table 1 maize silage sugar beet potato and cattle manure in bgp1 in comparison with the less heterogeneous substrates used for bgp2 and bgp3 maize silage rye and grass in bgp2 and maize silage and pig manure in bgp3.moreover the thermophilic fermenter contained a less diverse microbial community compared with the mesophilic fermenters.

according to qmf 87 of the methanogens investigated in bgp2 were of the coccoid type in a size range of 1 and 2 mm a typical size range of methanomicrobiales 47. likewise the dominance of methanomicrobiaceae members 92 was also found by the 16s rrna gene sequencing approach in bgp2.

2. principal component analysis plot of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data obtained from biogas microbial communities analyzed.the clustvis program 30 was applied to detect differentially abundant features in samples representing three mesophilic microbial communities bgp1 bgp2 and bgp3 and one thermophilic microbiome bgp4.

methanosaeta was not detected in the thermophilic bgp4 confirming results obtained for thermophilic laboratory- scale systems 37.an advantage of qmf is the quantification of fluorescentactive methanogens as well as their immediate classification exploiting morphological characteristics which can be usefulto confirm sequencing results based on the 16s rrna gene.

the abundance of the phylum bacteriodetes was with 2 significantly lower in the thermophilic biogastable 3. statistics of raw filtered and classified 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences obtained for four biogas plants bgp1 to bgp4.filtering of sequences was done according to the following criteria reads with low quality scores chimera and duplicates were discarded as specified in the materialsand methods section.additional otu-clustering applying normalization of the 16s rrna gene amplicon-derived sequences to an equal sample size was performed to compare obtainedotus between the datasets.

the rod-type methanogens 87 were mostly between 2 and 6 mm 87 of the 1.7 fraction confirming results previously obtained for other bgps 14.the highest number of methanogens and the highest share of methanogens were found in bgp2 with 4.88e9 cells per milliliter table 4 and fig.

the morphotypes of methanogens in bgp1 and bgp3 were similar but the fraction of the coccoid-type methanogens was slightly higher in bgp1 compared with bgp3.in bgp2 fig.

4. morphological classification of biogas-producing microbial communities in four anaerobic digesters.a bgp1 b bgp2 c bgp3 and d bgp4.2 to 6 mm 37. the coccoid-type methanogens have been shown to occur predominantly in mesophilic digesters which generally produce a relatively high amount of biogas in comparison with sewage digesters 13 14 38 39. the observed high fluorescence intensity of 69 to 79 table 4 of the coccoid-type methanogens from bgp1 to 3 was assumed to be positively correlated with the biogas production rate measured in this study.regarding the order methanosarcinales multicellular packets characteristic for the family methanosarcinaceae were not found in the four biogas plants.

1 which represent the relative abundances of classified reads on class family and genus levels.taxonomic classification of the biogas microbialcommunities resulted in two superkingdoms with 92 bgp1 and bgp4 95 bgp3 and 96 bgp2 of allclassified sequences assigned to the domain bacteria and 4 bgp2 5 bgp3 and 8 bgp1 and bgp4 archaeal sequences.
