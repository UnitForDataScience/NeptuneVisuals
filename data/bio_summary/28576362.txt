It should be noted that marinating temperature and time did not significantly p  0.05 affect pH values.Organic acids analysismean values - standard deviation of four tested samples.cases below the detection limit of the plating method 1.0 log cfug even after short marinating time 1 h E. Regarding marinating time marination for 1 h was less effective against the indigenous microbiota compared to higher marinating time in- tervals.

Each of the marinades was characterized by a distinguishable organic acid profile while the discrimination of the samples based on organic acid concentration between low 1 and 3 and high 6 and 9 marinating time was feasible.

Lactic acid presented a significant decrease 1.5e2.5 mgg from the lowest to the highest marinating time intervals.In the case where different marinades were combined PL PV the concentration of the measured organic acids was approxi- mately the average of the concentration found in samples that were marinated with one main ingredient only PO LE VI.The results of the PCA analysis that visualize the discrimination among marinating times for the five different marinades are pre- sented in .

In addition marination with apple cider vinegar led to an undesirable tenderization of the chicken meat score3 that was significantly p  0.05 moreThe concentration of the organic acids detected in untreated samples was 0.08 -0.01 0.7-0.04 5.6 -0.28 0.1 -0.01 and2.2 -0.03 mgg for citric succinic lactic acetic and butyric acid respectively.The range of organic acids concentration in marinated chicken meat samples is presented in .

Moreover the concentrations of organic acids obtained by HPLC analysis were subjected to Principal Component Analysis PCA to identify any discrimination among the different treatments based on the changes in the profile of organic acids over marination time.

The moderate amount of acid contained in PL and PV mar- inades was responsible not only for microbial reductions but also for desirable sensory characteristics.Lactic acid was the only organic acid that was not included in thecomposition of marinades.

It can be inferred that higher marination times 6 and 9 h were strongly correlated with higher concentration of acids such as citric acetic malic and tar- taric while lactic acid was the acid with the highest contribution in the first 3 h of marination AeE.DiscussionThe active substances of tested marinades e.g.

It should be noted that limited information is available on i marinated chicken meat and marinades con- taining organic acids as active ingredients against microorganismsii the shelf life of marinated poultry meat given that it is a highly perishable foodstuff a'o'  stored under refrigerated conditions  and iii the ef- fect of marinating conditions marinating temperature and time on the microbial succession and physicochemical profile of chicken meat.

B. thermosphacta seemed to be affected by marinating temperature since lower populations were observed after marinating at 20 oC for most marinades and time intervals.Sensory analysisThe effect of different marinades and marinating conditions on the sensory properties of cooked marinated chicken is shown in .

It needs to be noted that lactic acid was not contained in marinades but it was included in the analysis as it is the main organic acid of meat.
