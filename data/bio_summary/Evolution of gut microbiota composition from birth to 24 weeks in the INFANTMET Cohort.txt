Counts increased in all groups ex- cept PT-SVD from week 1 to week 4 from week 4 to week 8 counts were stable in the PT-CS FT-CS and FT-SVD groups while an increase was observed in PT-SVD infants.DiscussionIn this prospective study we compared the gut micro- biota of a cohort of initially breastfed infants from a sin- gle geographical area Cork Ireland who were born under different conditions SVD or CS delivery modes either FT or PT in parallel with clinical data to 2 years.

More work is needed to establish if the microbiota is a causative agent of this al- tered metabolomic profile and if modulation of the infant gut microbiota would restore the metabolomic profile of a PT infant to that of a FT infant.There was a strong temporal separation of the infant gut microbiota showing close grouping together by age particularly for the samples at week 1 and week 24 Fig.

Bacteroidetes increased significantly in pro- portion from week 4 to week 8 p  0.05 and again from week 8 to week 24 p  0.001.

We identified genera which were differentially abundant in at least two of the groups and thus found 21 genera that had dissimilar abundances at week 1 41 genera at week 4 39 genera at week 8 and 25 genera at week 24 Additional file Tables S10-S13.

Pro- longed breastfeeding 4 months was found to impact the gut microbiota of FT-CS infants but not FT-SVD infants.Bacteroides were significantly more abundant in FT- SVD infants compared to FT-CS infants over the first month of life indicating an important role perhapssimilar to the importance currently attributed to Bifido- bacterium in the early development of the infant gut microbiota.Taken together these data highlight the importance of breastfeeding particularly for infants born via Caesarean delivery mode and the data provide new opportunities for optimisation of IMF composition with appropriate new bioactive ingredients such as milk fractions probio- tics and prebiotics to effectively programme the early in- fant gut microbiota in a manner closer to mother's milk.

Thus the FT-CS micro- biota progressed over time to one which is similar to the FT-SVD infants with no differences at phylum level at either 8 weeks or 24 weeks of age.The most pronounced difference between the FT-CS infant gut and the PT-CS gut is evident at 1 week of age when there is a significantly higher proportion of Pro- teobacteria in PT infants p  0.001.

The statistical analysis of PT-SVD gut microbiota development was hin- dered by low subject numbers but notwithstanding this limitation we observed a number of significant changes between week 8 and week 24 with relatively few changes at earlier time points Additional file Table S17.Co-abundance analysis is a useful way to reveal higher- level constraints and associations in microbiota compos- ition We therefore examined the relationship between abundances of genera.

FT- SVD increases in diversity between 1 and 4 weeks of age p  0.001 then diversity reduces slightly between week 4 and week 8 p  0.001 before increasing again between week 8 and 24 p  0.001.

Bifidobacteria numbers increased across all groups from week 1 to week 4 while at week 8 counts were observed to stabilise.
