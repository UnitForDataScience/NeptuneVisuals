furthermore egcg supplementation significantly reduced the methylation status of cpg2 in hfd  egcg group compared to hfd 35. a significant decrease at cpg1 was seen in cd with egcg supplementation compared to cd 62 whereas hfd  egcg was significantly highercpg4 hfd resulted in a hypermethylation of 113 compared to cd.

furthermore supplementation with egcg in the cd decreased the methylation status significantly by 38. cpg5 of mlh1 was significantly higher methylated in hfd 24 and in cd  egcg 75whereas in the hfd  egcg significant hypomethylation.

supplementation with egcg resulted in a significantly reduced gene expression .in colon the relative gene expression of dnmt1 decreasedalthough the decrease of hfd compared to cd is compen- sated by egcg in hfd with a more than three times higher.in the promoter region of dnmt1 in liver and colon four cpgs were analyzed .

mean methylation of dnmt1 in liver cells was higher in cd  egcg 3.21 and hfd  egcg 3.09 compared to each diet cd 2.28 and hfd 2.37. significant differences in methylation status of dnmt1 were determined in cpg1 and cpg3.
