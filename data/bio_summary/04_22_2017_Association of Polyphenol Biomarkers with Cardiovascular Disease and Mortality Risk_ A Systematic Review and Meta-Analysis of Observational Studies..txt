Articles were retained for review if the following inclusion criteria were met 1 investigation of multiple adjusted associations between polyphenol biomarkers and CVD risk or mortality 2 use of an observational study design 3 the study involved humans and 4 the study was published in a scientific journal conference abstracts and comments were excluded.Articles were excluded if they met with at least one of the following criteria 1 a dietary intervention was conducted prior to biospecimen sampling or 2 only a dietary assessment method was used to assess polyphenol exposure.

Inverse associations were also found between ENL and CHD mortality  and kaempferol excretion and acute coronary syndrome ACS  however no associations were observed for the other polyphenols in this study  and between END and CVD mortality in another study .In the meta-analysis of three studies on ENL  no statistically significant association was identified for non-fatal MI.

In contrast to the reduced CVD mortality risk in the current meta-analysis a prospective study from the Netherlands did not find an association with total dietary lignans however matairesinol again tended to be inversely associated .No association was observed for total dietary polyphenols TDP as opposed to the statistically significant inverse association for TUP  in the same study.

Furthermore creatinine normalised spot urine proved to be a suitable biomarker when adjusted for factors modifying creatinine excretion .The aims of the current study were to 1 systematically review the literature for evidence of associations between polyphenol biomarkers and all-cause mortality CVD mortality and CVD incidence in observational studies and 2 conduct meta-analyses of individual biomarkers of polyphenols and outcomes where possible.

Two studies solely investigated all-cause mortality  two studied all-cause and CVD mortality  two studied CVD incidence and mortality  and three CVD incidence .

No constraints were put on the language of the articles.Data ExtractionFrom each article the following details were extracted first author year of publication country where the study was conducted study design and cohort characteristics of the participants age sex number of casescontrols or cohort follow-up time specimen type polyphenol biomarkers outcomes association measure and confounding and matching variables.Quality AssessmentThe quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale developed for non-randomised studies .

The result for stilbenes was not reflected in the resveratrol biomarker study  in the current review.All in all there seems to be some evidence from biomarker studies linking microbiota-derived lignan biomarkers to mortality endpoints but overall only a few studies were available.In agreement with the null-finding for non-fatal MI are the results from the EPIC-Prospect study .

By excluding one study at a time we observed that the study by Kuijsten et al.
