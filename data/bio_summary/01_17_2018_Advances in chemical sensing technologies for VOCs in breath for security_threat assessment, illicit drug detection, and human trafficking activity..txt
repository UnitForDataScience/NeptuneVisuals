Some VOCs are associated with exhaled breath where research is moving from individual breath testing volatilome to cell breath microbiome and most recently to crowd breath metabolites exposome.

Hound labs Inc. have also developed a miniature portable breath THC detection device with a patent-pending approach with low detection limits below 500 pg .Laboratory-based breath testing using bench top instrumentation such as liquid chromatography tan- dem mass spectrometry LC-MS-MS equipped with positive electrospray ionisation and selected reaction monitoring and gas chromatography GC coupled with MS have shown the capability of multiple detec- tion of drugs of abuse in exhaled breath -.

The complexity and richness of human volatilome components from exhaled breath skin emanations urine saliva human breast milk blood and feces has been reviewed  .This article outlines a the chemistry of human body odour with the principal focus being human detection and tracking in security applications b the breath detectable illegal activities associated with exposures to threat compounds e.g.

On-site systems employed in exhaled breath analysis i.e.

Categories of VOCs of interest include a VOCs in human breath associated with exposure to threat compounds and b VOCs characteristic of and associated with human body odour e.g.

breath sweat.

Finally the outlook for rapid and precise real-time field detection of threat traces in exhaled breath is revealed and discussed.IntroductionThe world community is witnessing a complex multi- level and rapidly evolving international security crisis.

On-site drug-testing is also a significant challenge.Human exposome consists of characteristic chemical markers of the human body odour breath and skin which can be applied for non-invasive extraction of molecular information for medical diagnostics psy- chological criminal law enforcement and other applications .
