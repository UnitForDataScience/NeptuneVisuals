4 509-514DRUG EVALUATIONCadazolid for the treatment of Clostridium difficileBradley T. Endres Eugenie Basseres M. Jahangir Alam and Kevin W. GareyDepartment of Pharmacy Practice and Translational Research University of Houston College of Pharmacy Houston TX USAARTICLE HISTORYReceived 20 September 2016Accepted 6 March 2017KEYWORDSAntibiotic anaerobic infections cadazolid Clostridium difficile diarrhea vancomycinIntroductionClostridium difficile infection CDI is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients and the primary cause of death due to gastroenteritis in the USA 1.

Collectively these properties prevent gastrointestinal absorp- tion and render cadazolid's systemic bioavailability negligible with the bulk of the drug confined to the lumen of the intestinal tract.Mechanism of actionUsing a series of macromolecular labeling in vitro transcrip- tiontranslation and topoisomerase studies it was determined that protein synthesis inhibition via the oxazolidinone moiety is the primary mechanism of action of cadazolid 27.

Shown is the chemical structure of cadazolid a along with other antibiotics that are used clinically including metronidazole b vancomycin c and fidaxomicin d.In vitro susceptibility and resistance developmentIn vitro cadazolid was active against 133 C. difficile strains consisting of 33 different PCR ribotypes isolated from patients with primary or recurrent CDI with low mean inhi- bitory concentrations MICs MIC90 0.5 mgmL range 0.125-0.5 mgmL 28.

Neither cadazolid nor vancomycin achieved this a priori clinical cure rate although clinical cure rates were similar with both agents and at all cadazolid doses 68-80 clinical cure rate Figure 2.

For the secondary outcomes cadazolid had reduced recurrence rates 18.2-25 com- pared to vancomycin 50 leading to an improved sus- tained clinical response rate for cadazolid vs. vancomycin 46.7-60 vs. 33 respectively.

Consistent with phase I results cadazolid could be detected in the plasma of patients receiving cadazolid at relatively low concentrations.
