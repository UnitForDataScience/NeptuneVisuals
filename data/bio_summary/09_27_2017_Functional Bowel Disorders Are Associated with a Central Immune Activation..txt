FGID were associated with a proinflammatory immune activation in the central nervous system and a disturbed tryptophan metabolism that could have been mediated by the faecal microbiota.BackgroundComorbidities are common in subjects with depression and subjects with unexplained somatic symptoms Func- tional gastrointestinal disorders FGID are particularly com- mon probably due to the cross talk between the brain and the gut through the brain-gut axis Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder FGID with a prevalence rate of approximately 8 in the Western world The prevalence rates are significantly higher in subjects with depression and unexplained somaticdisorders IBS is characterised by abdominal pain and disturbed bowel functions and a high prevalence of comor- bidities such as muscle-skeletal pain fatigue anxiety and depression The syndrome links the mind and the body and has been described as a biopsychosocial disorder  This term focuses on the bidirectional relations between the mind and the body and puts aside the view of diseases as either somatic or psychological.

The subjects included in this study had symptoms related to the central nervous system and a high prevalence of gastrointestinal comorbidity and were suitable for the study of the gut-brain interaction.The aims of this study were to relate the presence of IBS and the degree of gastrointestinal complaints to the tryptophan metabolism and inflammatory markers in the blood the CSF and faeces in subjects with depression and unexplained neurological symptoms.MethodsStudy Design.

The study included consecutive subjects above 18 years of age with a diagnosis of idiopathic depres- sion according to ICD-10 F 32-34 spectre the depression group and subjects with neurological symptoms thatremained unexplained after thorough examinations the neurological group.

A gastroenterologist the author PGF performed the scoring.IBS symptom severity score IBS-SSS which has been recommended by the Rome Foundation was used to score the severity of abdominal complaints The questionnaire was however responded to by all subjects and not only subjects with IBS and was used as a measure of the bowel symptom severity independent of the presence of IBS.

Spinal puncture was per- formed on nonfasting subjects before 12 a.m. except for two subjects who had the puncture at 1 p.m.

Analysis of IBS-SSS was missing in one patient in the neurological group analyses of the CSF were missing in four subjects in the depression group and analyses of faeces were missing in two subjects in the neurological group and 14 in the depres- sion group.

The central neuroimmune activation shown in this study might be associated with a central sensi- tisation that contributes to the chronicity of the disorder by an exaggerated and long-lasting response to normal and abnormal stimuli.In subjects with IBS a cytokine imbalance in serum and the gastrointestinal mucosa has been shown in several studies Reviews have demonstrated an imbalance of pro- inflammatory TNF and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in serum plasma of subjects with IBS.
