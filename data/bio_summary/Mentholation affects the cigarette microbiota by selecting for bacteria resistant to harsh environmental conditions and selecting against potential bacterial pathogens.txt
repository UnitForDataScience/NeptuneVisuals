However due to the relatively small number of bacterial taxa represented onthe microarray used in the previous study our view of the bacterial diversity within the tested products was limited.Therefore in this study we applied high-throughput next generation sequencing--which provides a much broader view of total bacterial diversity--to characterize five cigarette products Camel Crush user-mentholated Camel Crush Camel Kings custom-mentholated Camel Kings and Newport Menthols.

We included two pairs of mentholated and non-mentholated products custom-mentholated Camel Kings versus non- mentholated Camel Kings and non-crushed Camel Crush cigarettes versus crushed Camel Crush cigarettes as described above so that we could specifically evaluate the influence of the addition of menthol into two different products on the bacterial community composition of those products.

Beta diversity was determined through principle coordinates analysis PCoA plots of Bray-Curtis distance performed through QIIME and tested for signifi- cance with ANOSIM 9999 permutations .Determination of statistically significant differences p  0.05 in OTU bacterial relative abundance between men- tholated cigarette products and their non-mentholated counterpart mentholated Camel Crush vs. non- mentholated Camel Crush and custom-mentholated Camel Kings vs. non-mentholated Camel Kings was per- formed using DESeq2  through QIIME  which utilizes Benjamini-Hochberg multiple-inference correc- tion.

These find- ings have critical implications regarding exposure to po- tentially infectious pathogens among cigarette smokers and can be used to inform future tobacco control pol- icies focused on the microbiology of tobacco an under- studied focus area in tobacco regulatory science.Additional filesAbbreviationsANOSIM Analysis of similarities CC Camel Crush CCM User-mentholated Camel Crush CK Camel Kings CKM Custom-mentholated Camel Kings COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease MAFFT Multiple alignment using fast Fourier transform NMB Newport menthol box OTU Operational taxonomic unit PBS Phosphate-buffered saline PC1 First principal component PC2 Second principal component QIIME Quantitative insights into microbial ecology RDP Ribosomal database projectAcknowledgementsNot applicable.FundingThis work was supported by the University of Maryland Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science UMD TCORS Rapid Response Characterization of New and Manipulated Tobacco Products awarded by the National Institute of Health NIH and the Food and Drug Administration FDA--Award  P50- CA-180523-01.Availability of data and materialsData concerning the samples included in this study have been deposited under the NCBI BioProject accession PRJNA311925 Authors' contributionsARS and EFM contributed to the study design protocol development data analysis and interpretation and manuscript preparation.

In addition to comparing mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette pairs we aimed to identify potential bacterial pathogens that users may be exposed to when they smoke these products and expand our understanding of the scope of bacterial diversity present in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette tobacco.MethodsSample collectionIn the Spring of 2014 menthol and non-menthol ciga- rettes were either purchased from selected tobacco stores in College Park Maryland or provided by our collaborators at The Battelle Public Health Center for Tobacco Research Columbus OH Table The following products were purchased from selected to- bacco stores in College Park MD 1 Camel Crush regular fresh CC Camel Crush R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Winston-Salem NC USA where the capsule within the filter was subsequently not crushed during the study 2 Camel Crush regular fresh CCM where the capsule was subsequently crushed during the study to release a menthol-containing solution into the cigarette filter user mentholated CCM and 3 a commercially mentholated brand Newport Menthol Box NMB Lorillard Tobacco Co. Greensboro NC USA.

In addition six OTUs were at higher relative abun- dance in the custom-mentholated Camel Kings and were composed of two Gram-negative bacteria Schlegelella sp.

A study preformed on murine models showed that exposure to cigarette smoke followed by infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted in delayed clearance of infection and increased morbidity compared to controls Despite the overall decrease in bacterial diversity and potential human pathogens that we observed in custom- mentholated compared to non-mentholated Camel Kings we detected statistically significant p  0.05 in- creases in the relative abundance of four Gram-positive bacterial species Thermus sp.

Unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances were also used to measure beta diversity between the brands Additional file Figure S2 ANOSIM R value  0.25 p  0.0001 and ANOSIMR  0.16 p  0.0001 respectively.Taxonomic analysis by product and menthol statusThere were 173 OTUs at statistically significantly p  0.05 different relative abundances between custom- mentholated Camel Kings and non-mentholated Camel Kings Additional file Table S1 Fig.
