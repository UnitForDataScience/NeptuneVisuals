in addition to comparing mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette pairs we aimed to identify potential bacterial pathogens that users may be exposed to when they smoke these products and expand our understanding of the scope of bacterial diversity present in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette tobacco.methodssample collectionin the spring of 2014 menthol and non-menthol ciga- rettes were either purchased from selected tobacco stores in college park maryland or provided by our collaborators at the battelle public health center for tobacco research columbus oh table the following products were purchased from selected to- bacco stores in college park md 1 camel crush regular fresh cc camel crush r.j. reynolds tobacco co. winston-salem nc usa where the capsule within the filter was subsequently not crushed during the study 2 camel crush regular fresh ccm where the capsule was subsequently crushed during the study to release a menthol-containing solution into the cigarette filter user mentholated ccm and 3 a commercially mentholated brand newport menthol box nmb lorillard tobacco co. greensboro nc usa.

and mycobacterium avium an important respiratory pathogen one study in particular recovered viable m. avium from cigarette tobacco tobacco paper and the cigarette filters before cigarettes were smoked and subsequently recovered viable m. avium from the cigarette filters after the cigarettes were smoked these data provide evi- dence that m. avium can survive exposures to high tem- peratures and gases generated during the cigarette combustion process and potentially be inhaled in main- stream smoke other studies have shown that the mainstream smoke of combustible tobacco products also contains other microbial constituents including lipo- polysaccharides peptidoglycan fragments and fungal components the same study also showed that ciga- rettes kept at 94 relative humidity for over 8 days were characterized by additional bacterial and fungal growth within the cigarette tobacco further demonstrating that microorganisms present in the tobacco are viable and metabolically active moreover in a study by pauly et al.

however due to the relatively small number of bacterial taxa represented onthe microarray used in the previous study our view of the bacterial diversity within the tested products was limited.therefore in this study we applied high-throughput next generation sequencing--which provides a much broader view of total bacterial diversity--to characterize five cigarette products camel crush user-mentholated camel crush camel kings custom-mentholated camel kings and newport menthols.

we included two pairs of mentholated and non-mentholated products custom-mentholated camel kings versus non- mentholated camel kings and non-crushed camel crush cigarettes versus crushed camel crush cigarettes as described above so that we could specifically evaluate the influence of the addition of menthol into two different products on the bacterial community composition of those products.

it is also important to note that chem- ically the only difference between the tobacco content of the custom-mentholated camel king and non- mentholated camel king cigarettes was the addition of l-menthol.

in addition six otus were at higher relative abun- dance in the custom-mentholated camel kings and were composed of two gram-negative bacteria schlegelella sp.

otu 128 and 340 unknownbacillaceae otu 296 unknown bogoriellaceae otu193 and unknown bacillales otu 667. addition- ally 38 otus were at higher relative abundance in the mentholated camel crush samples and consisted of 26 gram-negative otus with species assignments for azospirillum irakense otu 167 and pectobacterium carotovorum otu 48. the remaining 12 were gram-positive and included sporosarcina sp.

a study preformed on murine models showed that exposure to cigarette smoke followed by infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted in delayed clearance of infection and increased morbidity compared to controls despite the overall decrease in bacterial diversity and potential human pathogens that we observed in custom- mentholated compared to non-mentholated camel kings we detected statistically significant p  0.05 in- creases in the relative abundance of four gram-positive bacterial species thermus sp.

today young adults minority groups adult women and mem- bers of low-income households are the primary con- sumers of menthol cigarettes previous studies have provided evidence that menthol smokers are characterized by decreased nicotine metab- olism enhanced systemic nicotine exposure  in- creased serum cotinine levels and increased levels of carboxyhemoglobin  the presence of menthol in some cigarette products has also been shown to in- crease levels of volatile organic compounds in main- stream smoke and inhibit the detoxification of carcinogens in liver microsome studies although results are mixed  it appears that menthol ciga- rettes may be more addictive and may convey a greater risk of cancer and other tobacco-related diseases com- pared to non-mentholated cigarettes however there are relatively few studies that have evaluated other physiological and toxicological health effects associated with exposure to menthol cigarettes including the im- pact of the bacteria associated with these products on smokers' oral health.the antibacterial nature of menthol has been shown to inhibit human and plant pathogenic microorganisms however its reaction with the bacterial constituents of the cigarette microenvironment has yet to be explored the history of microorganisms in tobacco has been documented by several groups  with researchers as early as the late 1890s beginning to characterize the microbiology of tobacco before and during fermentation.

fast-forwarding to the 1950s and 1960s major tobacco companies and researchers began to produce reports describing total numbers of cultivable bacteria in tobacco products -.

bacteria growing on single tobacco flakes from multiple cigarette brands were characterized and the authors hypothesized that these tobacco-associated microorganisms could represent a health risk to the smoker as they are carried to the lungs on the surface of tobacco particulate matter generated during smoking.

the impact of these microbial exposures on tobacco users' health is still unclear as very few epidemiologic studies have focused on the public health impacts associ- ated with the microbiological components of tobacco products.
