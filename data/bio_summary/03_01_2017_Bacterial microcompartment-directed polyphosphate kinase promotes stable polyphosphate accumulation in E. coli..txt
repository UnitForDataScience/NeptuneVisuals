Expression of genes cloned into pET vectors was induced by IPTG in E. coli BL21 DE3 and E. coli BL21 Tunertm DE3 Novagen.

Molecular biology techniquesCloning strains used were E. coli JM109 or E. coli TOP10 Invitrogen.

E. coli BL21 DE3 and E. coli BL21 Tunertm DE3 were used for expression following standard trans- formation techniques 28.

Co-expression of targeted and untargeted PPK1 and PPXThe pCOLADuet-1 coexpression vector Novagen system encoding two multiple cloning sites MCS each preceded by a T7 promoter lac operator and ribosome binding site was used to express targeted and untargeted E. coli PPK1 and PPX ppx from E. coli JM109 in combination pYY005 pYY007 pYY008 and alone pYY002 pYY010 see Table 1.

In E. coli polyphosphate levels are controlled via the polyphosphate-synthesizing enzyme polyphosphate kinase PPK1 and exopolyphosphatases PPX and GPPA and are temporarily enhanced by PPK1 overexpression and reduced by PPX overexpression.

We hypothesized that partitioning PPK1 from cytoplasmic exopolyp hosphatases would increase and stabilize E. coli polyphosphate levels.

Partitioning was achieved by co-expression of E. coli PPK1 fused with a microcompartment-targeting sequence and an artificial operon of Citrobacter freundii bacterial microcompartment genes.
