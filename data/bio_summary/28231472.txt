after treatment the number of heifers culture-positive did not differ between groups on days 1 p  0.63 or 10 p  0.65 but differed on day 5 with fewer heifers culture-positive in the tilmicosin compared to the nors group 4 versus 10 p  0.01.health statussix of the 10 heifers in the nors group were diagnosed with brd during the first 40 d after arrival.

in that study 19 and 36 of high-risk cattle in the tilmicosin and nors groups respectively were subsequently treated for brd.this lower efficacy of nors to control brd may be due to a differ- ence between nors and tilmicosin in duration of antimicrobial action.

there were no fatalities during the study period.within the nors group the composition of the nasopharyngeal mi- crobiota of heifers treated for brd during the first 10 d on feed did not differ from heifers that remained apparently healthy during this interval unadjusted r2  0.10 p  0.46. the 4 heifers diagnosed with brd on day 5 clustered with heifers that were apparently healthy on that day fig.

however effects of nors on the nasopharyngeal microbiota of feedlot cattle at high-risk of develop- ing brd have not been reported.the objective was to compare effects of nasal instillation of nors versus parenteral administration of tilmicosin on the nasopharyngeal microbiota of beef feedlot calves at high-risk of developing brd.

heifers in the tilmicosin group received a subcutane- ous injection of tilmicosin micotil elanco guelph on canada at the labeled dose 10 mgkg of body weight.

the rectal temperature of each heifer was also measured at processing those with a rectal temperature  40 degc were excluded from the study n  2. heifers with a rectal temperature b 40 degc were enrolled in the study and randomly allocated to receive either tilmicosin or nors n  10 per group using a ran- domization table.

there was however a difference between treat- ment groups observed based on culture with more heifers culture pos- itive for pasteurellaceae in the nors group compared to the tilmicosin group at day 5 post-treatment.
