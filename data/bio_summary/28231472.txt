In that study 19 and 36 of high-risk cattle in the tilmicosin and NORS groups respectively were subsequently treated for BRD.This lower efficacy of NORS to control BRD may be due to a differ- ence between NORS and tilmicosin in duration of antimicrobial action.

After treatment the number of heifers culture-positive did not differ between groups on days 1 p  0.63 or 10 p  0.65 but differed on day 5 with fewer heifers culture-positive in the tilmicosin compared to the NORS group 4 versus 10 p  0.01.Health statusSix of the 10 heifers in the NORS group were diagnosed with BRD during the first 40 d after arrival.

However effects of NORS on the nasopharyngeal microbiota of feedlot cattle at high-risk of develop- ing BRD have not been reported.The objective was to compare effects of nasal instillation of NORS versus parenteral administration of tilmicosin on the nasopharyngeal microbiota of beef feedlot calves at high-risk of developing BRD.

Heifers in the tilmicosin group received a subcutane- ous injection of tilmicosin Micotil Elanco Guelph ON Canada at the labeled dose 10 mgkg of body weight.

Nasal instillation of a nitric oxide releasing solution NORS on arrival at the feedlot was recently reported as inferior to a parenteral injection of tilmicosin macrolide anti- biotic for control of bovine respiratory disease BRD in cattle at high-risk of developing BRD.

The objective was to compare nasal instillation of NORS versus parenteral administration of tilmicosin regarding their effects on the nasopharyngeal microbiota of feedlot cattle at high-risk of developing BRD.

High-risk Angus-cross heifers n  20 were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups on arrival at a feedlot and received either NORS or tilmicosin for prevention of BRD.

This difference in ability to inhibit colonization of the nasopharynx by Pasteurellaceae may be the basis for NORS being inferior to tilmicosin for control of BRD in high-risk cattle.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In a re- cent study NORS was non-inferior to the parenteral macrolide antibiotic tilmicosin Micotil Elanco Guelph ON Canada for control of BRD in cattle at low-to-moderate risk of developing BRD  .
