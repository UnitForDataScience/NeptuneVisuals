.we next evaluated dmab expression in immunocompetent balbc mice as they are commonly used as a model for p. aeruginosa infection.

we selected two anti-p. aeruginosa mab genes to be re-encoded for optimal expression into a dna expression vector system based on their previously described potent protective in vivoactivity against lethal p. aeruginosa infection .

fol- lowing confirmation of in vitro expression we investigated expression of dna-delivered dmab-apcrv and dmab-bispa in mice.

although we did not evaluate dmab activity against apanel of p. aeruginosa bacterial strains the experiments outlined in this manuscript demonstrate that dmab is functionally equivalent to protein igg.

these two infec- tious disease models did not require high serum igg levels however optimized dmab formulations to increase expression levels are desirable so as to provide extended coverage after a single dmab administration.

this is facilitated though specific ig heavy and light chain nucleotide sequence optimizations formulation development and by recent advances in in vivo electroporation ep technology that hasdirectly lead to increased dna uptake into cells translating to significantly enhanced dna expression in vivo.employing this pathogen-specific approach we utilized the dmab platform to deliver two well-characterized mabs targeting pseudomonas aeruginosa an environmentally ubiquitous bacter- ium that can cause life-threatening infections in critically ill and immunocompromised patients.

toward this end we sought to optimize serum dmab expression levels for our efforts against p. aeruginosa supplementary fig.

furthermore the low cost of dmab production the favorable safety profile of dna delivery in humans and the ease of administrationwould benefit a wider population of individuals that are at risk for infection.here we describe the development and analysis of synthetic dmabs consisting of a monospecific anti-pcrv igg dmab- apcrv and clinical candidate bispecific antibody medi3902 dmab-bispa for in vivo production and activity.
