We selected two anti-P. aeruginosa mAb genes to be re-encoded for optimal expression into a DNA expression vector system based on their previously described potent protective in vivoactivity against lethal P. aeruginosa infection .

Although we did not evaluate DMAb activity against apanel of P. aeruginosa bacterial strains the experiments outlined in this manuscript demonstrate that DMAb is functionally equivalent to protein IgG.

The remaining animals in each group were then challenged with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa by intranasal inoculation followed by monitoring of survival for6 days post infection 144 h. Animals receiving the control DMAb-DVSF3 succumbed to infection within 24-55 h. In con- trast approximately 94 of animals 1516 that received either DMAb-aPcrV or DMAb-BiSPA survived challenge Fig.

These two infec- tious disease models did not require high serum IgG levels however optimized DMAb formulations to increase expression levels are desirable so as to provide extended coverage after a single DMAb administration.

This is facilitated though specific Ig heavy and light chain nucleotide sequence optimizations formulation development and by recent advances in in vivo electroporation EP technology that hasdirectly lead to increased DNA uptake into cells translating to significantly enhanced DNA expression in vivo.Employing this pathogen-specific approach we utilized the DMAb platform to deliver two well-characterized mAbs targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa an environmentally ubiquitous bacter- ium that can cause life-threatening infections in critically ill and immunocompromised patients.

.We next evaluated DMAb expression in immunocompetent BALBc mice as they are commonly used as a model for P. aeruginosa infection.

Toward this end we sought to optimize serum DMAb expression levels for our efforts against P. aeruginosa Supplementary Fig.
