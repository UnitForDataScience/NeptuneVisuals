ORIGINAL ARTICLESafety and Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplant for Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection in Patients With Cancer Treated With Cytotoxic Chemotherapy A Single-Institution Retrospective Case SeriesMehrdad Hefazi MD Mrinal M. Patnaik MBBS William J. Hogan MBBCh Mark R. Litzow MD Darrell S. Pardi MD and Sahil Khanna MBBSAbstractObjective To study the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplant FMT for Clostridium difficile infection CDI in patients with cancer treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy in a single-institution retrospective case series.Patients and Methods Twenty-three consecutive patients with underlying hematologic n 13 or solid n 10 malignancies who underwent FMT for recurrent CDI from August 1 2012 through June 30 2016 were studied.Results All the patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy a median of 12 months range 1-340 months before FMT.

In another study malignancy was an independent risk factor for CDI recur- rence odds ratio 2.66.Fecal microbiota transplant FMT is a safe and effective treatment in patients with recur- rent CDI with a success rate of approximately 90.Although immunocompromised pa- tients are at increased risk for CDI the use of FMT may be limited in this population because FMT clinical trials generally exclude immunocompromised patients due to con- cerns about its safety particularly the theoret- ical risk of invasive infection through bacterial translocation.Current evidence on the safety and efficacy of FMT in immunocompromised patients is limited.

Overall they found that FMT was effective for CDI in this heterogeneous group of immunocompromised patients with few severe adverse events SAEs and no infec- tious complications attributable to FMT.In 2013 Rubin et alreported 8 patients with cancer who were treated with FMT for recurrent CDI in a cohort of 75 patients.

Despite the strong evidence supporting the use of FMT for recurrent CDI studies in this field have previously excluded immunocompromised patients.Ironically these patients are the ones who are particularly at increased risk for recurrent CDI due to frequent exposure to known risk factors.Previous case series that have described the use of FMT in oncology patients have studied these patients as part of a larger het- erogeneous population without specifically reporting outcomes in the setting of malig- nancy.In the present study all the pa- tients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy for an underlying diagnosis of solid or hema- tologic malignancy before FMT.

This is similar to the interval used for immunosuppression in the study by Kelly et al.Treatment with other immuno- suppressive agents severe or end-stage chronic medical conditions and previous allo- geneic HCT were also adding to the immuno- suppression particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies.Oncology patients have a higher rate of CDI recurrence compared with nononcology patients.

Furthermore long- term data are lacking and there is no control group for comparison of CDI outcomes in oncology patients treated without FMT.CONCLUSIONThis single-institution retrospective case series demonstrates that FMT is a highly effective and safe therapeutic option for recurrent CDI in patients with hematologic and solid malig- nancies with lasting effects in most patients even after exposure to additional chemother- apies and antibiotics.

More recently Webb et al reported the use of FMT for CDI in 7 hematopoietic cell transplant HCT recipients with only 1 of the 7 patients devel- oping a recurrent CDI and no AEs.Although evidence on the efficacy and safety of FMT in immunocompromised pa- tients has started to emerge data in patients with cancer and in the context of treatment with antineoplastic agents are still scant.

Here- in we report a large case series from a single institution evaluating the efficacy and safetyof FMT for recurrent CDI in patients with can- cer treated with cytotoxic chemotherapies.METHODSPatientsA database of 452 consecutive patients with recurrent CDI who had received FMT at Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota from August 1 2012 through June 30 2016 was reviewed.

This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.Fecal Microbiota TransplantThe protocol for donor screening and FMT used at Mayo Clinic has been described previ- ously.Fresh stool from familyfriend do- nors was used in 10 patients and frozen stool from standard unrelated donors was used in 13 patients.

When appropriate continuous vari- ables are reported as medians ranges and cat- egorical variables as proportions.RESULTSPatient PopulationTwenty-three patients median age 66 years age range 23-88 years 43 men including13 patients with hematologic malignancies median age 74 years age range 23-88 years 54 men and 10 with solid visceral malignancies median age 58 years age range 43-82 years 30 men had received FMT for recurrent CDI during the study period.
