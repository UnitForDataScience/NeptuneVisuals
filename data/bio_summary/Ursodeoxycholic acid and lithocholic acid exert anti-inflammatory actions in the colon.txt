Thus given its central role in the development of colitis the epithelium is currently receiving a great deal of interest as a target for the development of new treatments 28 42.Ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA is a naturally occurring sec- ondary bile acid produced in the colon by bacterial metabolismG5500193-185717 Copyright c 2017 the American Physiological SocietyUDCA AND LCA PREVENT COLONIC INFLAMMATIONG551of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid.

These studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of UDCA LCA in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of UDCA is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions.NEW  NOTEWORTHY On the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA has well-established uses in both traditional and West- ern medicine.

How UDCA administration changes themakeup of the colonic bile acid pool is not well defined but studies in humans show that after UDCA treatment LCA becomes the most prominent colonic bile acid 44.

After 24 h of treatment the TER of LCA 10 uM-treated T84 cells was 94 - 2.6 n  5 of that in controls indicating that atUDCA AND LCA PREVENT COLONIC INFLAMMATIONG553AB1210864200123456Time daysn  6-12 UDCA compared to DSS104102100989694920123456Time daysCVehicleDUntreatedDSSE compared to 0 mgkg vehicle compared to 0 mgkg DSS40UDCA 30 mgkgDSS 2.5 VehicleDSS 2.5  UDCA30 mgkg3020100 030030 Vehicle  UDCA mgkgDSS 2.5  UDCAmgkgFig.

Daily treatment with LCA 30 mgkg ip significantly increased cecal LCA levels from 6.1 - 0.5 to 15.7 - 3.1 uM in controls and from 2.0 - 0.3 to 11.5 - 2.1 uM in DSS-treated mice n  5 P  0.05.

We noted that treatment with LCA alone induced a significant loss of body weight by day 5 to 89.3 - 1.0 of that before LCA treatment Fig.

Interestingly in contrast to UDCA administration of LCA also inhibited polyIC-in- duced increases in IFN--y. LCA treatment was not associated with any apparent signs of systemic toxicity as determined by measurements of serum creatinine and ALT.

This finding is supported by our current studies which show exten- sive metabolism of UDCA to LCA in the cecum of normalAB1051210100869549020850123456Time days0123456Time daysCVehicle LCA 30 mgkgDSS 2.5VehicleDSS 2.5LCA 30 mgkgDEUntreatedDSS403020100Fig.

These data are in line with a previous study demonstrating a decrease in fecal LCA levels in DSS-treated mice 3 and a more recent study demonstrating a reduction in levels of both UDCA and LCA in this model of colonic inflammation.

The anti-inflammatory efficacy of UDCA a nonmetabolizable analog 601-methyl-UDCA 6-MUDCA and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic acid LCA was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate DSS model of mucosal injury.
