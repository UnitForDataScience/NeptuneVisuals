thus given its central role in the development of colitis the epithelium is currently receiving a great deal of interest as a target for the development of new treatments 28 42.ursodeoxycholic acid udca is a naturally occurring sec- ondary bile acid produced in the colon by bacterial metabolismg5500193-185717 copyright c 2017 the american physiological societyudca and lca prevent colonic inflammationg551of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid.

furthermore such changes were found to be associated with significant alterations in the colonic microbiota and were partially restored by udca treatment 43. further studies to more precisely determine how changes in the microbiota and related alterations in the colonic bile acid signature contribute to the onset of inflam- mation and how udca administration influences such pro- cesses are warranted.lca is the most lipophilic of the secondary colonic bileacids and is classically considered to be relatively toxic particularly in the liver 15. increased levels of hepatic lca which occur in conditions of cholestasis are thought to con- tribute to liver damage through induction of apoptotic cell death.

daily treatment with lca 30 mgkg ip significantly increased cecal lca levels from 6.1 - 0.5 to 15.7 - 3.1 um in controls and from 2.0 - 0.3 to 11.5 - 2.1 um in dss-treated mice n  5 p  0.05. we noted that treatment with lca alone induced a significant loss of body weight by day 5 to 89.3 - 1.0 of that before lca treatment fig.

these studies identify a new role for the primary metabolite of udca lca in preventing colonic inflammation and suggest that microbial metabolism of udca is necessary for the full expression of its protective actions.new  noteworthy on the basis of its cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory actions the secondary bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid udca has well-established uses in both traditional and west- ern medicine.

interest- ingly one recent study showed that administration of lca to mice by enema can prevent colonic epithelial apoptosis and therefore presumably promote barrier function 18. in the current studies we found that even at concentrations as low as 10 um which approximates its normal physiological range in the colon 13 lca was even more effective than udca in preventing tnf-01 release from colonic epithelial cells in vitro.

in this regard several bile acid receptors are expressed in the colonic epithelium including tgr5 and the nuclear receptors farnesoid x receptor pregnane x receptor and vitamin d receptor each of which has been shown to protect against colonic inflammation in animal models 12 29 35 40. al- though structurally similar udca and lca have very differ- ent actions at these receptors likely underlying different re- sponses to the bile acids.

these data are in line with a previous study demonstrating a decrease in fecal lca levels in dss-treated mice 3 and a more recent study demonstrating a reduction in levels of both udca and lca in this model of colonic inflammation.

indeed several studies have demonstrated that supra- physiological levels of lca cause oxidative stress and dna damage and induce apoptosis in both hepatocytes and colonic epithelial cells 4. thus since udca is normally metabolized to lca in the colon we hypothesized that this may be a factor that limits its therapeutic actions.

the anti-inflammatory efficacy of udca a nonmetabolizable analog 601-methyl-udca 6-mudca and its primary colonic metabolite lithocholic acid lca was assessed in the murine dextran sodium sulfate dss model of mucosal injury.

in udca-treated mice lca became the most common colonic bile acid.

given the lack of apparent local or systemic toxicity we speculate that this couldudca and lca prevent colonic inflammationg557be due to reduced food intake in the lca-treated mice or alternatively might reflect effects of the bile acid on energy expenditure and fat metabolism.

since metabolism of udca appears to be required for the full expression of its protective actions we went on to investigate the effects of its major colonic metab- olite lca in regulating colonic inflammatory responses.

also similar to our own studies udca was found to prevent colonic inflammation in 246-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-treated rats a model of intestinal inflammation distinct from that used in the current studies 25. thus udca has the capacity to prevent the elevated cytokine levels and the in- creased epithelial permeability associated with intestinal in- flammation suggesting that it should be of therapeutic benefit in patients with ibd.however when considering the use of udca for treatment of colonic disease it is important to consider the potential impact of the colonic microbiota on its actions.
