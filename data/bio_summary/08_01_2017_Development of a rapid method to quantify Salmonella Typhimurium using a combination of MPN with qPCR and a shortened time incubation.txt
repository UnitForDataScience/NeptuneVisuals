Since incubation time and background microbiota can be a major factor in the accuracy of enumeration methods microbiome analysis was also conducted on samples from chicken breast inoculated with mixed cultures at various incubation times to determine bacterial compositional shifts occurring over the incubation time period.Materials and methodsBacterial strainSalmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028 marker strain nalidixic acid resistance strain was stored at 20 oC in tryptic soy broth TSB Becton Dickinson and Company Sparks MD supplemented with nalidixic acid NA 20 mgml also containing 20 glycerol.

Typhimurium low bacterial levels could be successfully detected with the MPN-qPCR-SIT.The concept and procedure for the MPN-qPCR-SIT developed in the present study is very straightforward.

Our study differs from these previous studies by integration of a shortened incubation time 4 h thus required detection time for completion is shorter than these previous methods.The MPN-qPCR-SIT retains both the advantages of MPN and qPCR while minimizing limitations associated with both methods such as the poor detection limit with qPCR and the extensive in- cubation time of MPN required for confirmation.

Typhimurium bacteria from chicken rinsate was performed to evaluate the reliability of the MPN-qPCR-SIT when non-target background microorganisms are present.

Some samples could not be enumerated when MPN plates were incubated for 2 and 3 h while MPN-qPCR-SIT at 4 h resulted in similar data with MPN-qPCR-SIT conducted on samples after 5 h of incubation time data not shown.

The MPN-qPCR-SIT includes a shortened incubation time step before confirmation of the bacterial presence with qPCR to reduce detection time.

The R value from the unweighted PCoA plot implied that there was sig- nificant dissimilarity among different incubation time groups in terms of phylogenetic distance.represents bacterial abundance at the phylum and genus level in chicken breast inoculated with mixed culture from the chicken rinsate without S.
