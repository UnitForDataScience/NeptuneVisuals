the solutions were then directly inserted into toxicity bioassays for the germination and development of seeds.toxicity throughout biodegradationa set of experiments on toxicity was performed to evaluate afff toxicity at different concentrations through natural attenuation.

the increase in germination and tissue growth over time caused afff toxicity was less pronounced in arugula seeds hence lettuce is a better toxicity indicator for afff phyto-toxicity.lettuce and arugula tissue elongation data confirmed the influ- ence of biodegradation time in reducing the toxicity of afff.

toxicity tests are based on determining the potential impact of pollutants towards biota in a set environment  thus ecotoxicological datasets have long been used with relative success as an additional tool for monitoring the efficiency of soil bioremediation making it essential to assess environmen- tal hazards in contamination scenarios  however few studies combine the performance of eco- toxicological tests with a detailed study of microbial communities in soil contaminated with firefighting foams.it is consensus that a realistic assessment of afff toxicity should cover as many test organisms as possible.

the redox reactions applied to afff allowed a brief yet responsive analysis of toxicity in various concentrations.to study afff toxicity to the soil microbiota colorimetric assays were setup using 5 g of c0 soil  aliquot suspended in 100 ml of bushnell-haas bh media  initial experiments optimized the dcpipox color change output in bioassays by adjusting afff initial concentration soil microcosm cell density and length of incubation with dcpipox.

models applied to the colorimetric dataset can lead to a better understanding of afff toxicity thereby quickly sorting the level of toxicity of each concentration.the colorimetric dataset was presented as dcpipox discoloration values as the oxidized form decreased though biodegradation.

the model provided the toxicity level for the microbiota within each assay with the s parameter.d  dmax  dmin-dmax1  10logd50-ts3where d  dcpipox concentration dmax  initial dcpipox con- centration dmin  minimum detectable dcpipox concentration d50  relative microbial response r  toxicity score for a specific substrate and environment t  timethe parameters of the sigmoidal equations were useful to obtain physiological activity data for each afff dilution.

the toxicity score s was defined as the time and concentration relationship for the parameter to go from maximum to minimum absorbance which is translated as the toxicity intensity when soil microbiota is exposed to afff.results and discussionstoxicity of afff dilutionsno seeds germinated in bioassays containing pure retail afff.

therefore it is imperative to consider the toxicity of pfcs in soil as a dynamic process where biodegradation and natural attenuation are key processes.arugula  and b however followed a straightforward toxicity pattern.

in general the medium becomes more favorable to seeds growth after natural attenuation but more sensitive organisms may not grow as much as the control assays.there are many references that support low toxicity of non- fluorinated components of afff such as butyl carbitol  the toxicity of many perfluorinated compounds to plants on the other hand is not very well known.

it is known that exposure to them results in hepatotox- icity development problems immunotoxicity adverse hormonal effects and potential carcinogen in animals  based on such previous toxicity studies in other organisms it is safe to associate the toxicity observed in our bioas- says to the presence of perfluorinated compounds.

thus more in depth studies are encouraged to define the influence of afff in the development of many other test organ- isms.the data obtained in toxicity bioassays particularly shown in indicate that despite the initial toxicity of afff released into the environment either as arugula and lettuce have grown in con- taminated soil.

there is a major concern about the bioaccumulation of these compounds in the food chain including in plants  although the arugula and lettuce growth may intuitively appear as an indication that the soil is safe for plants development due to decreased toxicity after 240 days that does not mean that low toxicity is associated with the biodegradation of perfluorinated compounds.

while evaluating the com- pounds through natural attenuation some possible biodegradation metabolites may have appeared and interfered with environmental safety at very specific concentrations.even though short-term experiments toxicity assays such as the colorimetric assays are usually not indicated towards mon- itoring of toxicity in degradation by-products they allowed the precise modelling and quantification of afff effects on the soil microbiota.

there is a significant knowledge gap on pfc toxicity to plants even though such data could be useful towards bioremediation procedures.

it is consensus that a realistic assessment of fire-fighting foam toxicity should cover as many test organisms as possible however few studies combine the performance of ecotoxicological tests with a detailed study of microbial communities in soil contaminated with firefighting foams.
