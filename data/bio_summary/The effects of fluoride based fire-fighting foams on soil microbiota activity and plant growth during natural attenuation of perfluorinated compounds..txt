The solutions were then directly inserted into toxicity bioassays for the germination and development of seeds.Toxicity throughout biodegradationA set of experiments on toxicity was performed to evaluate AFFF toxicity at different concentrations through natural attenuation.

The increase in germination and tissue growth over time caused AFFF toxicity was less pronounced in arugula seeds hence lettuce is a better toxicity indicator for AFFF phyto-toxicity.Lettuce and arugula tissue elongation data confirmed the influ- ence of biodegradation time in reducing the toxicity of AFFF.

The redox reactions applied to AFFF allowed a brief yet responsive analysis of toxicity in various concentrations.To study AFFF toxicity to the soil microbiota colorimetric assays were setup using 5 g of C0 soil  aliquot suspended in 100 mL of Bushnell-Haas BH media  Initial experiments optimized the DCPIPox color change output in bioassays by adjusting AFFF initial concentration soil microcosm cell density and length of incubation with DCPIPox.

The model provided the toxicity level for the microbiota within each assay with the S parameter.D  Dmax  Dmin-Dmax1  10logD50-tS3where D  DCPIPox concentration Dmax  initial DCPIPox con- centration Dmin  minimum detectable DCPIPox concentration D50  relative microbial response r  toxicity score for a specific substrate and environment t  timeThe parameters of the sigmoidal equations were useful to obtain physiological activity data for each AFFF dilution.

The toxicity score S was defined as the time and concentration relationship for the parameter to go from maximum to minimum absorbance which is translated as the toxicity intensity when soil microbiota is exposed to AFFF.Results and discussionsToxicity of AFFF dilutionsNo seeds germinated in bioassays containing pure retail AFFF.

In general the medium becomes more favorable to seeds growth after natural attenuation but more sensitive organisms may not grow as much as the control assays.There are many references that support low toxicity of non- fluorinated components of AFFF such as butyl carbitol  The toxicity of many perfluorinated compounds to plants on the other hand is not very well known.

Fluorinated surfactants in AFFF contribute to its performance when extinguishing fires  The presence of fluorine contributes to the rigidity of perfluorocarbon chains  The fluoro-carbon bond is strongly polarized.

They have been detected in many environmental samples including air surface water  waste waters soil and ground- water PFCs were also found accumulating in biota including mammals and humans The PFCAs PFSAs and their potential precur- sors have attracted attention as global contaminants  PFCAs and long chain PFSAs are described as very problem- atic because they are highly persistent  bioaccumulative and found scattered almost universally in abiotic environments in biota  food and humans  As a result many firefighting foams based on PFCs had their production restricted and were listed as substances of very high concern in European Regulation of Chemicals  The AFFFs are predominantly released in the form of liquid foam which increases the potential of PFAS to penetrate in aquatic envi- ronments.

The germina- tion percentages though time under different AFFF concentrations is shown in The darker areas correspond to the lowest ger- mination rates.1010.1Germination 01010.1a060120180240Time  days01020304050607080901000b060120180240Time  daysFig.

The main group of PFCs include PFOS and has been frequently detected in food products at high concentrations The route of human exposure to PFAS however has not yet been characterized  but may as well come from the consumption of agricultural prod- ucts.
