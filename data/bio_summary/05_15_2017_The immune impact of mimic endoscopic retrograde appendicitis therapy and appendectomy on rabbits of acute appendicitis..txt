acute appendicitis is classified into two categories acute uncomplicated appendicitis and acute complicated appendicitis 4 5. the former consists of acute simple appendicitis and acute suppurative appendicitis the latter kind includes gangrenous or perforated appendicitis and appendiceal abscess 4 5.the main treatments for acute appendicitis areappendectomy and antibiotics 6 7. in 1883 the firstappendectomy was performed by grooves in canada.

it was reported that iga levels in sera and colon decreased significantly when people of different ages received appendectomy 26. randal bollinger r proposed that the human appendix is well suited as a 'safe house' for commensal bacteria providing support for bacterial growth 22. in 2014 an animal experiment demonstrated that iga-secreting cells migrated to the large and small intestines from appendix playing a significant role in the balance of intestinal bacteria 21. a recent study has also ensured the role of appendix in gut immune responses as well as gut homeostasis 23. however nobody has studied the impact of merat and appendectomy on rabbits' immune function after acute suppurative appendicitis and determined whether tlr4 myd88nf-kb signaling pathway was activated in this process.wbc count and preoperative elevated crp levels can aid the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

tlr4myd88nf-kb signaling pathway was activated in acute phase of appendicitis.introductionacute appendicitis is one of the most frequent underlying conditions in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the emergency department 1. previous studies showed that the annual rate of appendicitis was 10.77610000 in taiwan from 2000 to 2011 and the overall incidence of acute appendicitis increased from 7.62 to 9.38 per 10000 per year between 1993 and 2008 in the united states 2 3. acute appendicitis might occur at any age.

statistics suggested that antibiotic therapy was effective to 58.3- 73.4 of patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis 17-20. however the recurrence rate of this treatment in 1 year was up to 15-37 17-20.with the development of immunology and microbiology people gradually realized that appendixplays a crucial role in intestine mucosal immunity and in maintaining the balance of intestinal flora 21-23. to reduce the side effect and achieve minimally invasive treatment in 2009 we established a new therapeutic method-endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy erat for acute uncomplicated appendicitis 24. there are 5 steps in erat 1 endoscopic appendiceal intubation 2 appendiceal decompression 3 retrograde appendicography 4 stent drainage and 5 cleansing the appendiceal lumen 24. our previous study demonstrated that effective rate of erat was up to 97 with few complications 25. to further analyze the impact of erat on immunity of intestine we conducted the animal experiments to compare the immune function after treating acute suppurative appendicitis with mimic erat because colonoscopy can not be performed successfully on rabbit the stent was placed in appendix surgically.

mimic endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy and appendectomy are effective ways for acute suppurative appendicitis.

since then appendectomy has been widely adopted as the predominant treatment of acute appendicitis.

the results indicated that both merat and appendectomy can alleviate inflammation reaction by inhibiting cytokine production and that there was no significant difference in the treatment of acute suppurative appendicitis between the two methods.

hence we conjectured that the immune function and proliferation of appendix of patients were seldomly affected by erat.toll-like receptors tlrs are the most important pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity 29. tlr4 recognizes lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria 30. it was reported that increased epithelial tlr4 expression induced intestinal microbiota changes in mice 31. in the present study relative expression of tlr4 myd88 and nuclear nf-kb increased in acute phase of inflammation but they did not change with immune parameters in the merat group and the appendectomy group.

therefore we will focus on these issues in our further studies.in conclusion both merat and appendectomy are effective ways for acute suppurative appendicitis.
