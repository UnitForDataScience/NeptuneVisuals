The former consists of acute simple appendicitis and acute suppurative appendicitis the latter kind includes gangrenous or perforated appendicitis and appendiceal abscess 4 5.The main treatments for acute appendicitis areappendectomy and antibiotics 6 7.

Acute appendicitis is classified into two categories acute uncomplicated appendicitis and acute complicated appendicitis 4 5.

Mimic endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy and appendectomy are effective ways for acute suppurative appendicitis.

However nobody has studied the impact of mERAT and appendectomy on rabbits' immune function after acute suppurative appendicitis and determined whether TLR4 MYD88NF-kB signaling pathway was activated in this process.WBC count and preoperative elevated CRP levels can aid the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Previous studies showed that the annual rate of appendicitis was 10.77610000 in Taiwan from 2000 to 2011 and the overall incidence of acute appendicitis increased from 7.62 to 9.38 per 10000 per year between 1993 and 2008 in the United States 2 3.

To reduce the side effect and achieve minimally invasive treatment in 2009 we established a new therapeutic method-endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy ERAT for acute uncomplicated appendicitis 24.

48 rabbits were assigned into 4 groups group I the mimic endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy group group II the appendectomy group group III the model group and group IV the blank group.
