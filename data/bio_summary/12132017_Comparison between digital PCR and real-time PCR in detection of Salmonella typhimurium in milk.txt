Compared with qPCR ddPCR ex- hibited more sensitive 10-4 ngml or 102 cfuml and less pre-culturing time saving 2 h. Moreover ddPCR had stronger resistance to inhibitors than qPCR yet absolute quantification hardly performed when target's concentration over 1 ngml or 106 cfuml.

Combined with PCR and fluorescence technique real-time PCR qPCR and digital PCR ddPCR are regarded as suitable tools for detecting foodborne pathogens.

To compare the effect between qPCR and ddPCR in detecting Salmonella typhimurium a series of nucleic acid pure strain culture and spiking milk samples were applied and the resistance to inhibitors referred in this article as well.

Thus be subjected to ager analysis end-point PCR method has obstacles in quantitative analysis .Relying on calculating increment of fluorescence generated by amplified templates instead of agar gel analysis abbreviating the time- consuming to 3 days or less  makes qPCR be widely applied in foodborne pathogens' measurement  .

Owning to its superiority qPCR becomes so common in detecting foodborne Salmonella typhi- murium  but limitations existing in measuring trace sample or absolute quantification.As the latest generation of PCR and one of the most robust methods in molecular quantification several articles in recent years have re- ported ddPCR in the field of food and drug testing bacteria and viruses monitoring gene modification and clinical diagnosis research  .

Compared with qPCR ddPCR has advances in performing absolute quantification procedures without a standard rapid data analysis sensitivity precision and resistance to inhibitors  .

Recent articles have demonstrated the sensitivity and precision of ddPCR in the quantitative detection of bacteria in sediment and commercial poultry processing water samples yet its application for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium in food samples has so far not di- rectly been defined .To our knowledge several methods have related to qPCR in de-tecting foodborne Salmonella spp.

Then a series of 10-fold dilution DNA concentration ranging from 10 ngml to 10-4 ngml were prepared and each gradient DNA sample was analyzed by qPCR and ddPCR .Primer and probeBased on FimY gene of Salmonella spp.

Then each reaction performed qPCR and ddPCR procedure as described above.Spiking sampleTo prepare spiking milk samples 1 ml of each concentration gra- dient of Salmonella typhimurium pure culture added in 24 ml sterile milk.

Flow chart of this research.ResultsLOD of both platformsGenomic DNATo measure and compare LOD of two platforms a serial dilution of genomic DNA samples extracted from Salmonella typhimurium pure culture was both analyzed by qPCR and ddPCR.
