OTUs were selected for an in-depth analysis according to the following criteria 1 OTUs should make up at least 1 of the reads in any of the sinks on at least one occasion 2 OTUs were identified by SourceTracker Model 2 as having the inlet as a source on at least one occasion 3 OTUs should have been identified by SourceTracker analysis Model 2 to have the hypolimnion or the inlets as a source at least at 50 of the sampling occa- sions that is 5 times for the hypolimnion and 3 Lake R or 4 Lake S times for the inlet.

Both lakes are small 1 km2 forest lakes though Lake S is deeper has a greater surface area and a slightly longer water retention time than Lake R Supporting Information Table S1.

Flow of OTUs from the inlet to the lake was estimated at each sampling occasion as the product between the relative number reads of the particular OTU in the inlet by the percen- tages of total transported cells from the inlet in relation to the number of cells in the epilimnion over 48 h see above for method.

However there appeared to be a slight difference between the lakes regarding the importance of sediment resuspen- sion since water samples from the shallower Lake R were more similar to Lake R sediment as opposed to Lake S. Still we found little convincing evidence of a frequent migration of bacteria from sediment to water and commu- nities in general were extremely different.

Independent SourceTracker analyses were carried out for each sink and sampling occasion Lake S hypolimnion Lake S epilimnion Lake R hypolimnion and Lake R epilimnion at ten sampling events i.e.

Modelled flow rates data were not avail- able for Lake R instead outflow rates from the nearby Lake StrandsjoEURn within 4 km from Lake R were used to calculate specific runoff and inflow rate was calculated in the same manner as for Lake S.Fig.

Results from SourceTracker analysis showing the contribution of the different source communities to the epilimnion and the hypolimnion of Lakes RamsjoEURn Lake R and SiggeforasjoEURn Lake S. A Model 1 including inlet sediment the other strata of the lake and the previous sampling occasion 'past' as sources.

The distance to the closest lake upstream is about 900 and 1000 meters away from the inlet of Lake S and Lake R respectively.

There was however no significant correlation between MH-distances between the communities in inlets and epilimnia and the dispersal rates from the inlet to the epilimnion in any of the lakes Spearman rank correlation p  0.05 suggesting an overall small importance of mass effect via the inlet at the community level.

Further there was no difference between the two lakes in the degree of importance of the inlet as a source of bacteria two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test of MH-distances between inlet and epilimnion p  0.05.
