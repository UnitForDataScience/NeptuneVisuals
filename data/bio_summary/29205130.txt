We did not observe significant differences in FGCM levels among the studied groups which is in contrast to Shutt et al.

U1 and U2 unhabituated groups H1 and H2 habituated groups.

Here we evaluate the relationship between FGCM levels and GIM composition in a set of faecal samples from four WLG groups in DSPA characterized by different levels of habitua- tion to humans and thus exposed to different levels of phys- iological stress.

Although we observed variation in the GIM composition profiles among the groups based on the first principal coordinate and FGCM levels with individuals in U2 showing the low- est stress hormone metabolite values this relationship was not significant linear regression model adjusted R20.01 t-1.22 P0.23 Spearman rank correlation p-0.24 P0.12 .

Although a completely unha- bituated group U2 showed the lowest incidence of physiological stress and the GIM compositions among indi- viduals from this group were more similar to one another than those observed in the other studied groups it is unclearFunding informationThis work was supported by the Institute of Vertebrate Biology Acad- emy of Sciences of the Czech Republic RVO 68081766 by the project 'CEITEC - Central European Institute of Technology' CZ.1.05 1.10002.0068 from the European Regional Development Fund and co-financed from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic project OPVK CZ.1.072.3.0020.0300 a NERC ESRC interdisciplinary PhD studentship the Primate Society of Great Britain the International Primatological Society the Bio-Social Society UK Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation and the US National Science Foundation NSF BCS 0935347.AcknowledgementsWe thank the Government of the Central African Republic and the World Wildlife Fund for granting permission to conduct our research in the Central African Republic and the Primate Habituation Pro- gramme Dzanga-Ndoki National Park Dzanga-Sangha Protected Areas for logistical support in the field.

Chronic and acute stress models are widely employed in GI research because stress has been identified as a risk factor for or modulator of the expression of several GI disorders .Many factors including exposure to stressors can cause transient alterations in GIM composition .

The major effects of stress on gut physiology include 1 altera- tions in GI motility 2 increase in visceral perception 3 changes in GI secretion 4 increase in intestinalpermeability 5 impaired regenerative capacity of GI mucosa and mucosal blood flow and 6 negative effects on the GIM .
