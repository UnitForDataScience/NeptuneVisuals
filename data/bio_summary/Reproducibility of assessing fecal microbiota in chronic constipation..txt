our hypotheses were that i assessments of fecal micro- biota in healthy people patients with constipation normal and slow colonic transit are highly reproducible within individuals ii the intra- individual variability of fecal microbiota in patients with constipation and separately with normal or slow colonic transit is not significantly different to that in healthy people and iii the associations between the fecal microbiota and physiologic parameters eg breath methane production and colonic transit are also reproducible.2  materials and methods  study design and participantsfrom february 2013 through april 2014 25 female patients with chronic constipation and 25 healthy women all non-smokers and aged between 18-80 y consented to participate in this study that had been approved by the institutional review board at mayo clinic.

similar approaches have also been used to study the reproducibility and stability of various fecal sampling methods.35-39overall the agreement between two fecal samples for all mea- sures of alpha and beta diversity in healthy people and patients withfigure 2 spearman correlations between observed operational taxonomic unit otu abundances in the second stool sample compared to the first stool sample in healthy controls constipated patients normal colonic transit and slow colonic transitand evenness of fecal microbiota the agreement between two stool samples was moderate.

alterations in colonic transit affect stool consistency.4142 stool consistency is associated with several measures of microbiota composition ie species richness enterotypes and taxonomic compo- sition.43 indeed in a study of 3948 people stool consistency had the largest effect size on the variation of fecal microbiota.44 polyethylene glycol significantly increased the relative abundance of bacteroides in ex-germ free mice colonized with human fecal microbiota.45the univariate associations between the fecal microbiota and other variables were mostly comparable for the first and second stool samples.

indeed because there is an association between stool consistency and the composition of microbiota20 it is conceivable that alterations in the fecal microbi- ota at least partly explain the temporal fluctuation in symptoms most frequently from constipation- or diarrhea-predominant ibs to mixed type ibs or vice versa.21in view of this the objectives of this study were to i compare the intraindividual variability in human fecal microbiota over two samples taken 1 wk apart in healthy people and constipated patients and sep- arately in people with normal or slow colonic transit and ii assess the reproducibility of the association between fecal microbiota and diet and physiological parameters eg colonic transit and breath methane production.

for example to identify a strong difference 25 samples per group are required when the icc is 1.0. as the icc ie reproducibility declines the required sam- ple size increases for example to 63 samples per group for an icc of 0.4.table 3 comparison of intraclass correlation coefficient icc between the two stool samples for abundance of taxa at the genus levelaaall values are intraclass correlation coefficients icc confidence intervals ci values in bold represent iccs that are significantly different from eachother p.05.4  discussion in this study we used icc to quantify the temporal stability of the stool microbiota based on several microbiota measurements.

colonic transit was summarized as the colonic geometric center gc which is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions at 24 gc24 and 48 gc48 h. a higher gc reflects a faster colonic transit.

conceivably this poor reproducibility may be partly explained by the effects of laxatives on colonic transit and stool consistency which to speculate may be more pronounced in people with normal compared to slow colonic transit.

data from the human microbiome project indicate that only approximately 30 of samples as defined by taxa abundance-based metagenomic 'codes' and a mea- sure of beta diversity were stable for up to 450 d.6 conceivably tem- poral variations in the microbiota profile may be related not only to the disease state but also to alterations in diet drugs colonic transit body mass index bmi and antibiotic use.312-15 hence longitudinal assess- ments may be useful to more rigorously characterize fecal microbiota profiles in disease states.16 in ibs particularly in diarrhea-predominant ibs the fecal microbiota evaluated with older methods not 16s rrna techniques was unstable over time.17-19 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the intraindividual stability of the fecal microbiota with 16s rrna techniques in ibs and chronic constipation.

acute changes in caloric intake are known to affect the stool microbiota.1446these data will be useful for selecting the sample size in future studies.1647 the sample size depends on the effect size of the pro- posed intervention of disease state and the intrasubject variability.47 for a conservative icc of approximately 0.5 which is lower than the observed icc for most parameters in this study the ideal sample size required to detect a given effect size will be approximately twice of that required for a perfect icc icc1.0.

the icc for weighted unifrac was noticeably lower p.03 in participants with normal icc 0.0 95 ci 0.0-0.52 as op- posed to slow colonic transit.

as reproducibility decreases ie icc is lower a larger sample size is required to detect all three effect sizes with 80 power at an a level of 0.05. for example when the icc is 0.6 a sample size of 1.525x 1.550x and 1.5100x is sufficient to detect strong medium and weak effects respectivelyreproducibility of the phyla bacteroidetes and firmicutes was also lower in patients with normal colonic transit.

to be noted the icc for the shannon index was numerically lower in healthy people icc 0.43 95 ci 0.10-0.76 than in consti- pated patients icc 0.67 95 ci 0.43-0.90.in contrast to alpha diversity the beta diversity reflects the di- versity between samples.

most measures of alpha and beta diversity were similar across the two stool samples andthis was comparable in healthy participants and constipated patients.75.50.25.00all constipated healthynormal colonic transitslow colonic transitrichness and evenness of microbiota within a sample.
