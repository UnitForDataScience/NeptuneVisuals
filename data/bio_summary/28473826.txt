At the genus- level Prevotella was the most relatively abundant 44.8 while Dialister 8.4 Succiniclasticum 3.5 Lactobacillus 2.6were visualized as principal coordinate analysis PCoA plots using Emperor  .1 TABLE 1  Effects of forage preparation on total gas methane and substrate disappearance in the RUSITEC fermentation.P-valueSEM standard error of mean DM dry matter DMD dry matter disappearance IVDMD in vitro dry matter disappearance.TABLE 2  Effect of forage preparation on pH and volatile fatty acids VFA production.P-valueDifferent lowercase letters indicate significant differences between freeze-dried and ground and frozen minced prepared forages P  0.05.

The archaeal and bacterial diversity and richness in SAM samples were also not affected by the forage preparation P  0.05 .The effect of microbial sample type LAM vs. SAM forage preparation and sampling time on the structure of the archaealand bacterial microbiota was analyzed using unweighted UniFrac distances .

In the present study we examined the effect of FM vs. FDG forage preparation on CH4 total gas and VFA production and on the archaeal and bacterial microbiota using a RUSITEC system.Our findings indicated that forage substrate preparation had very little effect on fermentation parameters.

The model included the fixed effects of forage preparation day and forage preparation day interaction.

However FM preparation of forages achieves a forage particle distritution similar to what occurs in the chewing activity  and .In terms of the molar proportion of VFA a significant increase in butyrate production for FM forage preparation was found a result that is in agreement with  who reported a greater proportion of butyrate in fresh forage compared with conserved forage.

These findings indicate that methane production in the rumen may be influenced by the relative abundance of Archaea rather than the microbial population structure as argued by  and  since the FM forage preparation showed an increased trend on methane production.In the current study the rumen microbiota was dominated by the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla in both FM and freeze- dried preparation samples.

Therefore the higher relative abundance of Prevotella in the FM samples may indicate that thisforage preparation method results in a microbiota that is more similar to the natural rumen.CONCLUSIONWe can partially reject our initial hypothesis since this study demonstrated that fermentation parameters are generally not affected by the type of forage preparation with the exception of butyrate and a small trend in methane production.
