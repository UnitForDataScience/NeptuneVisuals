This study characterized the gut microbiome of R. osteovora compared to the surrounding environment as well as to other deep-sea snails with more typical diets.Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that R. osteovora digestive tissues host a much lower bacterial diversity average Shannon index of 1.9 n  12 compared to environmental samples average Shannon index of 4.4 n  2 and are dominated by two bacterial genera Mycoplasma and Psychromonas comprising up to 56 and 42 average total recovered sequences respectively.

Methylene blue-stained thick sections 0.4 mm were used for R. osteovora tissue morphology and revealed intestinal epithelia columnar cells topped with very long cilia A stomach epithelia contained simple cuboidal cells topped with short cilia B and a digestive gland with ducts of columnar cells C. DAPI-stained nuclei of R. osteovora cells blue a general bacteria-probe Eub338- Alexa green and a Psychromonas-probe NOR2-1453 Cy3 orange revealed that bacteria were attached to the cilia c of the intestinal epithelia D. Large clusters of Psychromonas and other bacteria were also found in the lumen l of the intestine D-inset.

16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that R. osteovora is colonized by a stable and specific microbiome significantly less diverse than the surrounding microbial communities.The unique and specific bacterial community ofRubyspira osteovoraRubyspira osteovora has a specific microbial community domi- nated by three microbial genera Mycoplasma Psychromonas andPsychrilyobacter.

The absence of two of the dominant R. os- teovora microbes from other gastropods supports the idea thatDominant microbes associated with Rubyspira osteovoraMycoplasma phylum Tenericutes class Mollicutes was the most dominant genus in the digestive gland of R. osteovora.

Although the role of the dominant microbes associated with R. osteovora is still undetermined their distinct- ness from microbial communities from the environment and other deep-sea gastropods suggests a specific and exclusive mi- crobiome within the bone-eating R. osteovora.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample collectionSpecimens n  8 were collected in 2004-2011 from a 2893 m depth whale fall in Monterey Submarine Canyon 3636.8N 12226.0W Table .

Analysis was restricted to only R. osteovora samples to evaluate differences among tissue types within R. osteovora4FEMS Microbiology Ecology 2017 Vol.

While this study was able to characterize the microbiome of R. osteovora uniquely domi- nated by Mycoplasma Psychromonas and Psychrilyobacter the role of these microbes within the nutrition and life history of R. os- teovora remains largely speculative.

Sections were ex- amined and photographed using a Nikon E80i epifluorescence microscope and Zeiss EM 109 TEM.RESULTSRubyspira osteovora collections and anatomyRubyspira osteovora specimens were collected between 2004 and 2011 from a whale fall in Monterey Submarine Canyon Table  Fig.

The relative abundance of these three groups remained similar over 6 years of sampling collection date was not shown to be a significant predictor of community structure suggesting a long-term association.Furthermore these bacterial genera were either not present Mycoplasma and Psychromonas or at very low abundance 0.04 for Psychrilyobacter in environmental samples and other deep-sea gastropods supporting the uniqueness of the R. osteovora gut microbiome.Keywords deep sea symbiosis gastropod whalefall Mycoplasma Psychromonas RubyspiraINTRODUCTIONNovel ecosystems often support unique biological communi- ties and their study helps to uncover Earth's true biodiver- sity.
