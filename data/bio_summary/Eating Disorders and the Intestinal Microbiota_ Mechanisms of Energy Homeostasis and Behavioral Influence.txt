Interestingly higher levels of self-reported depression in patients with AN at hospital admission were significantly associated with lower microbial diversity suggesting a brain-gut-microbiota interac- tion in this population.Another PCR-based investigation employing reverse tran- scription quantitative PCR collected stool samples from pa- tients with restricting type AN n  14 binge-eating type AN n  11 and controls n  21 .

Of the three major eating disorders--an- orexia nervosa AN bulimia nervosa BN and binge- eating disorder BED--AN is the only eating disorder to date that has been investigated in relation to the intestinal microbi- ota -  .

Moreover patients with AN often present with other psychiatric and physiological disturbances including anxiety depression and gastrointesti- nal GI distress further complicating the treatment of this disorder  .Treatments for acute AN generally involve a combination of clinical renourishment to promote weight gain and psycho- therapy to address disordered eating cognitions and behaviors  .

Weight relapse the re-loss of weight after refeeding is common and contrib- utes to recurrent presentations .Like all eating disorders the etiology of AN remains incom- pletely understood but as with other complex traits AN is influenced by an array of genetic and environmental factors -.

Deeper insight into the biological underpinnings of AN has the potential to significantly improve the standard of care and ad- vance the development of effective pharmaceuticals or other treatments for AN.

Given that gut microbiotas influence both weight regulation and behavior two hallmarks of AN initial investigations into the intestinal microbiotas of patients with AN have yielded intriguing preliminary results.Energy Homeostasis and the Intestinal MicrobiotaAccumulating evidence from both animal studies and more recently human clinical trials supports the notion that the intestinal microbiota plays a substantial role in nutrient extraction and host metabolism.

was the first group to characterize the intestinal micro- biota of patients with AN using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene comparing female patients with AN before n  16 and after n  10 clinical refeeding at an inpatient specialist unit to healthy controls n  12 .

Most recently results from the largest recruited cohort of patients with AN to date replicated the previously reported dysbiotic enteric microbial communitiy in patients with AN n  55 which also changed following clinical refeeding n  44.

Collectively these results indicate that the in- testinal microbiota of clinically refed patients with AN re- mains metabolically abnormal.MechanismsAlthough these studies establish the presence of a dysbiotic intestinal microbiota in patients with AN the mechanism by which an abnormal enteric microbial community influences either the persistence or the treatment of eating disorders has not yet been fully elucidated.

To date intestinal microbiota re- search in eating disorders has focused solely on anorexia nervosa AN.
