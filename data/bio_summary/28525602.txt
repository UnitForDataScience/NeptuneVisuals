this study highlights the similarities in effects observed for aloin and the aloe vera whole leaf extract and points to a potential mechanism of action to explain the observed pathological changes via modulation of the gut microbiota composition.key words aloe vera aloin gut microbiota gastrointestinal systems toxicology food safetynutrition safety evaluation.aloe barbadensis miller commonly referred to as aloe vera is one of approximately 420 plant species of aloe and is a popular herbal remedy and dietary supplement   .

the aloe vera whole leaf extract contained all com- ponents of the aloe vera plant leaf namely the aloe vera gel from the inner leaf pulp and the aloe vera latex from the outer leaf.

in pairwise comparison tests to the vehicle controls the body weights of animals exposed to aloin in the drinking water at 446 mg aloinkg water were significantly lower begin- ning at week 2 of the study final mean body weights relative to controls were 93 and 90 for the 223 and 446 mg aloinkg dosed water formulation treatment groups.

in comparison tests with vehicle controls the mean daily water consumption of the rats was significantly higher beginning at week 4 for the 223 mg aloinkg water dose group and beginning at week 5 for the 446 mg aloinkg water dose group.

based upon the mean body weights and mean water intakes the average consumption of aloin throughout the 13-week study was 0.7 1.3 2.6 5.5 10.7 26.5 and 57.9 mgkg body weightday for the 6.95 13.9 27.8 55.7 111 223 and 446 mg aloinkg water dose groups respectively.significant dose-related decreasing trends in the mean weekly feed consumption of aloin-treated animals were observed sporadically in the study however feed consumptions of aloin-treated animals were not significantly different from vehicle controls in pairwise comparisons tests supplementary table 2.effects of aloin administration on hematology and clinical chemistryhematology and clinical chemistry parameters recorded for rats exposed to the vehicle and aloin water formulations are pro- vided in supplementary table 3. sporadic differences in the hematological and biochemistry parameters were observed for the aloin treatment groups when compared to the vehicle con- trols.

for example observed that the fecal microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer not only had an increase in bacteroides which belong to the bacteroidetes phy- lum but also had a positive correlation between the abundance of bacteroides species and colorectal cancer disease status.in the current study the fb ratio for rats in the vehicle con- trol group was 2.1 and administration of aloin in the drinking water of male rats induced significant decreasing linear dose shifts in the contributions of these two phyla the fb ratio was1.8 in rats administered the low dose 6.95 mg aloinkg water and 0.8 in rats administered the high dose 446 mg aloinkg water group treatment .colonic fermentation is the anaerobic process by which car- bohydrates and proteins are metabolized by intestinal micro- flora .

the aloin a content was approximately 32 66 and 98 mgkg water in the 0.5 1.0 and 1.5 dosed water solutions of aloe vera whole leaf extract respectively aloin b was not measured.the association between colorectal cancer risk in humansand anthraquinone laxative use remains controversial   .

in a 2-year drinking water study an aloe vera whole leaf extract was administered to rats in their drinking water at doses of 0.5 1.0 and 1.5 by weight.

a secondary goal of the study was to deter- mine whether or not the administration of aloin in the drinking water of male f344 rats for 13 weeks would modulate the micro- biota populations in the large intestine.for this study doses of aloin were selected to include a low dose that was below the level of aloin 10 mg aloinkg used by the iasc in their product certification program and a high dose that was equivalent in aloin a content to a 2 wtwt dose for- mulation of the aloe vera whole leaf extract 250 mg aloin akg water that was used in the previous 13-week study .

in the previous study on aloe vera whole leaf mean water intakes of the 1 and 2 aloe vera whole leaf groups were approxi- mately 174 and 194 of control intake levels.as in the previous study histological evaluations found no incidence of neoplasms in the present study of aloin and non- neoplastic lesions were primarily confined to the large intes- tine the most prominent pathological lesion being mucosa and goblet cell hyperplasia which was observed by microscopy throughout the entire length of the large intestine.

even at an aloin dose of27.8 mgkg water the severities of these lesions were greater than that observed with the 1 aloe vera whole leaf extract--an aloin dose approximately 7.5-fold lower than the aloe whole leaf extract.

the aloe vera whole leaf extract used in the aforementioned studies con- tained the aloe gel from the inner leaf pulp as well as the aloe vera latex from the outer leaf pulp.
