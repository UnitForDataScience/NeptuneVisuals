for example observed that the fecal microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer not only had an increase in Bacteroides which belong to the Bacteroidetes phy- lum but also had a positive correlation between the abundance of Bacteroides species and colorectal cancer disease status.In the current study the FB ratio for rats in the vehicle con- trol group was 2.1 and administration of aloin in the drinking water of male rats induced significant decreasing linear dose shifts in the contributions of these two phyla the FB ratio was1.8 in rats administered the low dose 6.95 mg aloinkg water and 0.8 in rats administered the high dose 446 mg aloinkg water group treatment .Colonic fermentation is the anaerobic process by which car- bohydrates and proteins are metabolized by intestinal micro- flora .

The mean water intakes of rats in the 223 and 446 mg aloinkg water dose groups were 27.9 and 28.5 gratday at week 6 compared to 22.2 gratday for vehicle control rats at the same time points.

The Aloe vera whole leaf extract contained all com- ponents of the Aloe vera plant leaf namely the Aloe vera gel from the inner leaf pulp and the Aloe vera latex from the outer leaf.

The primary goal of the study was to determine whether or not the administration of aloin in the drinking water of F344N rats would replicate the pathophysiological effects that were observed previously in the large intestine of F344N rats in a 13-week study of Aloe vera whole leaf extract.

The microbiota profile in feces was not evaluated in the previous study however in vitro findings showed that the Aloe vera whole leaf extract had differential effects on the growth of representative fecal bacterial species and altered their production of short-chain fatty acids .Although the correlation between aloin and the Aloe vera whole leaf extract is very strong for the pathophysiology of the rat colon the exact mechanism by which colon cancer was induced in rats exposed to the Aloe vera whole leaf remains uncertain.

In comparison tests with vehicle controls the mean daily water consumption of the rats was significantly higher beginning at week 4 for the 223 mg aloinkg water dose group and beginning at week 5 for the 446 mg aloinkg water dose group.

Based upon the mean body weights and mean water intakes the average consumption of aloin throughout the 13-week study was 0.7 1.3 2.6 5.5 10.7 26.5 and 57.9 mgkg body weightday for the 6.95 13.9 27.8 55.7 111 223 and 446 mg aloinkg water dose groups respectively.Significant dose-related decreasing trends in the mean weekly feed consumption of aloin-treated animals were observed sporadically in the study however feed consumptions of aloin-treated animals were not significantly different from vehicle controls in pairwise comparisons tests Supplementary Table 2.Effects of Aloin Administration on Hematology and Clinical ChemistryHematology and clinical chemistry parameters recorded for rats exposed to the vehicle and aloin water formulations are pro- vided in Supplementary Table 3.

The aloin A content was approximately 32 66 and 98 mgkg water in the 0.5 1.0 and 1.5 dosed water solutions of Aloe vera whole leaf extract respectively aloin B was not measured.The association between colorectal cancer risk in humansand anthraquinone laxative use remains controversial   .

In a 2-year drinking water study an Aloe vera whole leaf extract was administered to rats in their drinking water at doses of 0.5 1.0 and 1.5 by weight.
