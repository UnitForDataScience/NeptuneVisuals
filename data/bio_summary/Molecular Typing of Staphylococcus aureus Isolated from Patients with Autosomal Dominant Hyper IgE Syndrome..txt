Our results indicate that patients with AD-HIES may often carry antibiotic-resistant strains that harbor key virulence factors.ResultsPatientsWe swabbed the antecubital fossa and volar forearm of 36 patients with AD-HIES and isolated mannitol-fermenting staphylococci for further characterization from 21 of these patients.

Furthermore two patients with AD-HIES P-10 and P-25 were swabbed on two different occasions and the resulting non-aureus staphylococcal NAS isolates were designated P-10a P10b P25a and P25b respectively Table .Of all 25 mannitol-fermenting strains isolated from patients with AD-HIES 1325 52 were S. aureus as defined by coagulase-positivity Table  and 1225 48 were NAS such ashaemolyticus or S. hominis determined by 16S rRNA sequencing Table .

We sought to provide a more detailed strain-specific analysis of AD-HIES-associated staphylococci since S. aureus strains are known for their varied expression of colonization and virulence factors that can influence disease frequency and severity  and specific strains have been linked to skin infections .We determined three different MLST sequence types in 13 S. aureus isolates from patients with AD-HIES.

However the diversity of AD-HIES strains appears limited compared to what might be expected from the wide number of circulating clinical strains  and our analysis of atopic dermatitis strains.

The most common sequence type was ST8 which accounted for eight of the 13 S. aureus isolates from patients with AD-HIES and three of the nine S. aureus isolates from STAT3-sufficient patients with atopic dermatitis 39.

Our results indicate that patients with AD-HIES may often carry antibiotic-resistant strains that harbor key virulence factors.Keywords Staphylococcus aureus Job's Syndrome STAT3 multi-locus sequence typingIntroductionStaphylococcus aureus colonizes human mucosa and skin and is a major human pathogen that causes a strikingly broad range of infections ranging from relatively minor skin abscesses to potentially life-threatening pneumonia osteomyelitis endocarditis necrotizing fasciitis septicemia and toxic shock syndrome .

Molecular characterization of the staphylococcal strains present on the skin of AD-HIES patients has not been previously described.

Here we identified the species of cultivable mannitol-fermenting staphylococcal strains present on the skin of patients with AD-HIES.
