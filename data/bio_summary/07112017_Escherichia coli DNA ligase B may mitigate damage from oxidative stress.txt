DNA repair invariably ends with ligation of the DNA phosphate backbone making ligases of utmost importance.

Most bacteria encode one NAD-dependent DNA ligase and one to several ATP-dependent DNA ligases .

coli lacking ligB is hypersensitive to hydrogen peroxide and mitomycin CTreatment of E. coli with hydrogen peroxide mitomycin C UV irradiation bleocin or cipro- floxacin each induces specific types of DNA lesions that are repaired with various specific DNA repair mechanisms -.

Therefore the prolonged lag phase seen with overexpression of ligB was not strictly dependent on the ligase activity of ligase B but less wild- type ligB appeared to be needed to cause the phenotype.Overexpression of ligB blocks DNA replication and kills cellsTo test whether the extended lag phase seen with ligB overexpression affected DNA replication andor cell viability we quantified CFUs and methyl-3H-thymidine incorporation .Simultaneously bacterial cell growth  cell viability  and methyl-3H-thymi- dine incorporation were monitored .

The ligB overexpressing cells were elongated at two hours post IPTG induc- tion compared to the cells harboring the empty vector  supportive of a block in DNA replication in the surviving ligB overexpressing cells.Absence of ligB delays recovery following exposure to cadmiumThe growth delay phenotype of cells overexpressing ligB closely matches the growth phenotype of E. coli in response to the addition of cadmium which causes single-strand DNA nicks .

Hydro- gen peroxide produces oxidized DNA bases  and mitomycin C treatment results in the alkylation of DNA bases.
