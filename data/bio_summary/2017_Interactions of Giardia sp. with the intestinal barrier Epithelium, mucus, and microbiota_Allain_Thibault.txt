Transcriptomic studies revealed that after exposure to intestinal epi- thelial monolayers a set of genes coding for surface proteins VSPs and cysteine-rich proteins attach- ment proteins giardins cysteine proteases and pro- teins involved in the clearance of reactive oxygen species were upregulated in several strains of G. duo- denalis WB P-1 NF and GSM.Likewise intra- and extracellular enzymes are synthesized by Giardia following its contact with the host intestinal cells.In particular several parasitic extracellular products have been identified by secretome analysis including metabolobic enzymes involved in arginine uptake and putative enterotoxins.

a- and b-defensins cryptdins lysozyme and chemokines.Antimicrobial peptides AMPs produced by intestinal epithelial cells IECs are critical to intestinal mucosal defense against enteropathogens.

Together these observations demonstrate that epithelial abnormalities in giardiasis are mediated by parasites as well as host factors.Intestinal permeability in giardiasis A combination of tight junctional disruptions apoptosis and arginine starvationDuring peak trophozoite colonization giardiasis increases intestinal epithelial permeability in humans as well as in animal model systems.The alteration of intestinal permeability is the result of Giardia-induced tight junctional protein alterations epithelial cell apoptosis and starvation for L-arginine.The apical junctional complex AJC between enter- ocytes constitutes a selective barrier protecting subepi- thelial compartments from the luminal environment.

Giardia inhibited the Salmonella-induced inflammatory response by degrading intestinal CXCL8 IL-8.Direct inhibition of intestinal inflammation was further demonstrated when inflammatory signaling was triggered by Clos- tridium difficile toxin as well as in human biopsy tis- sues from patients with IBS.These data offer strong support to the hypothesis that Giardia may indeed attenuate pathogen-induced pro-inflammatory responses during co-infections which in turn may explain at least in part why Giardia infections can be associated with a reduction of diarrheal disease in countries with poor sanitation.

Argi- nine consumption by the intestinal parasite giardia intestinalis reduces proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells.

While acute giardiasis may be responsible for diarrhea intestinal malabsorp- tion abdominal pain and weight loss recent evidence also established that the infection can lead to chronic disease and extra-intestinal complications.As an ani- malhuman health concern giardiasis joined the neglected diseases initiative established by the World Health Organization in 2007.Like most foodborne enteropathogens Giardia faces a multitude of hostile factors upon entering the host.

In the gut trophozoites interact with 3 distinct barriers namely the intestinal microbiota the mucus layer and the epithelial barrier .

In turn Giardia has the ability to modulate commensals to pathobionts by inducing virulence factors and also disrupting intestinal biofilms.
