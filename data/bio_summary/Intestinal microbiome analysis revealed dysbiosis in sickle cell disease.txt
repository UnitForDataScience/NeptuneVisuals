The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia.

A mouse model of SCD showed that SEs more commonly adhered to  E91activated neutrophils than endothelium during VOC1 supporting the notion that activated neutrophils are pivotal in the pathogenesis of VOC.At baseline SCD patients have increased levels of activated neutro- phils that could adhere to endothelium.2 The immobilized neutrophils act as niduses for SEs to attach to and cause VOC.

The kinetics of these acti- vatedaged neutrophils has been found in gene-knockout mice to be regulated by the intestinal microbiota through interaction with Toll-like receptor 24 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 Myd88.3 Depletion of the microbiota with broad-spectrum antibiotics reduced the number of aged neutrophils and protected against Lipopolysaccharides LPS- induced fatal VOC.If intestinal microbes regulate aged neutrophils abnormalities in either the integrity of the intestinal barriers or a chronic disequilibrium of the intestinal microbiota or both are likely to occur in SCD patients.

We previously hypothesized that due to recurrent segmental or global subclinical intestinal ischemia that occurs due to VOC in the splanchnic vasculature both the intestinal barrier and the ability of the mucosa to support a normal intestinal microbiota in SCD patients are compro- mised.4 The compromised intestinal barrier renders SCD patients more susceptible to recurrent translocation by bacterial inocula not high enough to cause overt infections but sufficient to activate neutrophils.

To investigate the baseline intestinal microbiome we carried out an analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences from stool samples from 35 sub- jects with SCD 20 were collected by The Biocollective CO for this study.

B The association of LDH with the microbiota represented by the 6 genera Subdoligranulum Prevotella 9 Faecalibacterium Esche- richia-Shigella Pseudobutyrivibrio and Alistipes.clinical parameters were available.

The most significant association was found with LDH adjusted R2 5 0.81 P 5 .03 Figure 1B.

Recent published findings have reported associations between acti- vated neutrophil counts and microbiota composition.3 The abridged model suggested an association with neutrophil counts may exist although the relationship was not conclusive adjusted R2 5 0.45 P 5 .21.
