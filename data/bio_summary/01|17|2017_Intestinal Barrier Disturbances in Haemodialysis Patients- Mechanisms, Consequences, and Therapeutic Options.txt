it is thought that such disruptions result in the translocation of endotoxins digestive enzymes and gut-produced toxic metabolites into the central circulation  -.these observations were initially based on data reporting the presence of inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract including esophagitis gastritis duodenitis enteritis and colitis in a postmortem study of 78 prevalent hdantimicrobialmucusintestinal lumenpeptidestight junctionmucus layerzo-2 zo-3claudin zo-1tight junctionoccludinfigure 1 the intestinal barrier.patients subsequent studies have shown elevated levels of circulating gut-derived endotoxin in hd patients compared to control patients    with the highest levels being reported in hd and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialy- sis pd patients  when compared to chronic kidney disease ckd patients stages 3 to 5 and transplant patients levels of endotoxin in hd patients have been associated with increased levels of systemic inflammation as well as increased cardiovascular events and mortality .the intestinal barrierthe intestinal barrier has two primary functions the first of which is to prevent the transport of harmful substances such as endotoxins gut-produced antigens and digestive enzymes from the lumen to the internal environment .secondly it acts as a semipermeable barrier to allow the selective translocation of essential dietary nutrients elec- trolytes and water from the intestinal lumen into the circula- tion 17. this physical intestinal barrier comprises a contin- uous layer of epithelial cells sealed by intercellular junctional complexes termed tight junctions tjs.

taken together the potential sources of endotoxin within hd patients are vast and may not always indicate changes in the integrity of the intestinal barrier of hd patients.more recent investigations have employed gut bacterial dna fragments as a method to assess intestinal disturbances in hd patients 10  when detecting bacterial dna it is not always possible to confirm the source intestinal or non-intestinal and so studies cannot always characterise the bacterial species present in hd patients.

irt in hd patients may increase microbiota diversity in the presence of iron deficiency or anaemia whether this will have consequences for the intestinal barrier is not known although an increased diversity is generally viewed as a beneficial physiological change.other considerations theassessment of intestinal barrier status in haemodialysis patientsthe measurement of circulating endotoxin levels has been the primary method of assessing intestinal barrier statusin hd patients.

therapeutic inter- ventions that target the intestinal barrier and the micro- biota are promising areas of future research in hd pa- tients.it is clear that there are a number of factors which are distinct to hd patients that can disturb the intestinal barrier including processes related to and independent of the hd process see .

this may be explained by the lower ultrafiltration volumes and rates in the nonconventional hd groups resulting in lower splanchnic ischaemia and hypoxia and less disturbance to the intestinal barrier this study concluded that less aggressive ultrafiltration may be a useful strategy to reduce intestinal barrier disturbances in hd patients.

these include but are not limited to uraemic toxins hypervolaemia hypertension increased amounts of reactive oxygen species ros reductions in antioxidant defence compromised protein energy state increased adipose tissue infection including vascular access related bacterial andviral infection and comorbid conditions such as diabetes - the gastrointestinal tract is another source of inflamma- tion in hd patients which is starting to receive increasing interest significant disruptions to the intestinal barrier are thought to take place in hd patients catalysed by the uraemic environment and importantly the process of hd itself other factors which are unique to this popula- tion such as changes to the composition of diet and medi- cation are also thought to contribute .

as previously mentioned body temperature increases during hd 56 cooled dialysate may protect the intestine not only through haemodynamic mechanisms but also through the direct effect of lower temperature which may itself abrogate any hd induced changes to the intestinal barrier .there is an increasing interest in how changes to the microbiota in hd patients result in the production of toxic metabolites such as pc and is .

alternate investi- gations have shown that plasma intestinal-fatty acid binding protein i-fabp is a marker of intestinal damage and associates with intestinal ischaemia the use of plasma i-fabp to assess intestinal barrier status in hd patients may hold promise.

glutamine bovine colostrum and zinc carnosine to directly target the expression of hsp and protect the intestinal barrier against exercise induced disturbances has recently proven to be effective 9 moreover there is evidence that probiotic supplementation may upregulate hsp expression in vitro 89. whether these nutritional therapies could be successfully implemented in hd patients to modify the microbiota and prevent changes to the intestinal barrier is unclear but they certainly have therapeutic potential and therefore clearly warrant further attention.non-haemodialysis related factorsuraemia.

urea is metabolised by gut bacterial urease to ammoniaprotection against bacterial pathogens by marinating the intestinal barrier it is believed that the mechanisms behind the protective effect of the microbiota on the intestinal barrier include stimulating epithelial cell turnover promot- ing mucus secretion upregulation of antimicrobial peptides restoring tight junction protein structure and production of short-chain fatty acids and bactericidal proteins dietary restrictions in esrd patients significantly alter the microbiota of the intestinal tract restrictions in fruit and vegetable consumption sources of potassium and diets low in symbiont-rich cheeseyogurt promote a predominance of bacteria that produce toxic metabolites  .

as cd-14 plays a role in endotoxin neutralisation this may be a potential mechanism by which circulating endotoxin is reduced although clearly further work is needed to corrobo- rate this.intradialytic exercise has previously been shown to increase aerobic capacity in hd patients  and it would appear that more physically active individuals in the general population with higher aerobic capacity have lower circu- lating endotoxin levels  2. this could contribute to some of the anti-inflammatory effects associated with regular physical activity whether these data extrapolate to the hd population remains to be seen but it does seem plausible that increasing aerobic fitness and physical activity levels through intradialytic exercise in hd patients might lead to lower circulating endotoxin concentrations and improved outcomes.regular exercise training programmes in hd patients may induce favourable changes at a cellular level.

hd patients are subject to a number of unique factors some related to the hd process and others simply to the uraemic milieu but with common characteristic that they can both alter the intestinal barrier and the microbiota.

lastly intradialytic exercise is an increasingly employed intervention in hd patients however the potential implications that this may have for the intestinal barrier are not known therefore future research directions are also covered.introductioncardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with end stage renal disease esrd receiving haemodialysis hd.

this effect is accentuated in patients who have large ultrafiltration volumes during hd this in turn results in disturbances to the intestinal barrier and significant rises in circulating endotoxin 6. the vascular architecture of the intestines makes them particularly sensitive to low oxygen environments both ischaemia and hypoxia  for example when blood flow is shunted away from the splanchnic region during hd.
