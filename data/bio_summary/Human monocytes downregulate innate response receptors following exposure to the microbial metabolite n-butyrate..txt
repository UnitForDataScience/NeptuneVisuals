Peripheral blood monocytes PBMO were enriched by plastic adherence for 2 h. Alternatively PBMO were purified by negative selection using magnetic beads MACS Miltenyi Biotec GmbH Bergisch-Gladbach Germany.N-butyrate treatment of PBMCPBMOPBMC or PBMO enriched by plastic adherence were cultured in RPMI 1640 Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA10FCS Sigma St.-Louis MO2 glutamineThermo Fisher Scientificantibiotics Thermo Fisher Scientific in the presence or absence of n-butyrate 0.5 mM 1 mM Sigma for 4 h andor 24 h. Subsequently cells were lysed and subject to Western blotting or gene expression analysis.

In order to determine a potential regulation of the expression of these receptors by the bacterial metabolite n-butyrate in PBMO peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were exposed to this compound at concentrations of 1 and 0.5 mM respectively for 24 h. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis of PBMO identified as CD45th lineage- CD33th HLA-DRth cells within the PBMC population revealed a dose-dependent downregulation of CD11b CD14 and CD16 in the presence of n-butyrate while the expression of HLA-DR a receptor highly expressed on LPMO 43 44 was upregulated Fig.

In order to determine whether downregulation of surface expression of CD11b CD14 and CD16 on PBMO by n-butyrate is associated with decreased expression levels of the corresponding genes transcript levels of these genes were determined in untreated vs. n-butyrate treated PBMO by qPCR.

The number of annexin V-positive PBMO was on average 12.4 - 7.4 1 mM n-butyrate and 13.6 - 5.6 0.5 mM n-butyrate respectively higher following n-butyrate treatment when compared to medium control Fig.

Note that complete co-localization of the PU.1 signal with the nucleic acid stain Hoechst33342 in PBMO under all experimental conditions indicates a constitutive nuclear localization of this transcription factor in these cells which is in agreement with previous results 54.Compatible with a regulation of PU.1 expression on the level of gene expression PU.1 gene symbol SPI1 mRNA levels were reduced in n-butyrate treated versus untreated PBMO after 4 h of culture Fig.

PBMO were cultured in the absence or presence of different concentrations of n-butyrate 1 mM0.5 mM for 24 h. Apoptosis of PBMO was detected by annexin V staining and subsequent flow cytometric analysis.

A PBMO were enriched by plastic adherence and subsequently cultured in the absence or presence of different concentrations of n-butyrate 1 mM 0.5 mM for 24 h. Surface expression levels of CD11b CD14 CD16 as well as HLA-DR were analyzed on Annexin V- PBMO using flow cytometry.

B PBMO were purified using MACS1 technology negative selection and subsequently cultured in the absence or presence of different concentrations of n-butyrate 1 mM 0.5 mM for 24 h. Surface expression levels of CD11b CD14 CD16 as well as HLA-DR were analyzed on Annexin V- PBMO using flow cytometry.
