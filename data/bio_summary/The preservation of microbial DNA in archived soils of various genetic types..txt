To compare the diversity of archived soils with the modern analogs all the samples of each type archived sod-podzolic archived chernozems modern sod-podzolic and chernozems were pooled and normalized to the lowest number of sequences in dataset of each soil type to estimate the inte- gral differences in their biodiversity .According to the analysis of biodiversity indices the phylogenetic diversity of both types of archived soils was significantly lower than of the modern ones.

Thus this study had two major objectives first to analyze the microbial communities of archived samples of contrasting soil types chernozems and sod-podzolic soils and second to compare the data obtained with the microbiome analy- sis of modern soils formed under similar climatic conditions.Materials and methodsSoil samplesSamples of archived sod-podzolic ASp and chernozem ACh soils were collected from the top horizon 0-25 cm of soil cores of the Central Museum of Soil Science by V.V.

The adonis model showed that sample type and sample age explained the same por- tion of variation in the data.Thus the analysis of biodiversity revealed the substantial loss of archaeal and bacterialdiversity in both types of archived soil samples with most dramatic changes in ASp soils.Taxonomic analysis of microbiomes of archived and modern soilsMost of soil samples were dominated by 8 bacterial and one archaeal phyla they were Actino- bacteria 27.4 Firmicutes 23.2 Proteobacteria 17.4 Verrucomicrobia 9.1 Acido-bacteria 6.6 Bacteroidetes 3.8 Chloroflexi 2.4 Gemmatimonadetes 1.2 and Crenarchaeota 6.5.

Microbiomes of archived chernozems included mainly actinobacteria thermophilic bacteriaTaxa summary of microbiomes of soils investigated at the phylum level including classes ofProteobacteria.Heatmap of fractions of microbial orders in archived sod-podzolic and chernozem soils.

The authors emphasized the preservation of Firmi- cutes in the archived soil samples mainly g. Bacillus as well as a significant loss in the diversity of archived soils in comparison to the modern ones.

The samples of archived sod-podzolic soils were characterized by minimal values of biodiversity the relatively smaller amount of total DNA and 16 S rRNA ribo- somal operons in comparison to the archived chernozem and samples of modern sod-podzolic soil and chernozem.From a fundamental point of view the development of the future research in this direction is of paramount importance for the study of soil genesis and the evolution of the soil micro- biome.

2017 The preservation of microbial DNA in archived soils of various genetic types.

All sequence data were archived in SRA database with accession SRP075197 accession numbers SAMN04978817-48.Funding DNA isolation and sequencing were carried out with the support of the Program of basic research of Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences Depositary functions indication technology of the state and risks of soil degradation in the system of planning and rational environment conservation in Russia no.

10115-54This study is a comparative analysis of samples of archived stored for over 70-90 years and modern soils of two different genetic types-chernozem and sod-podzolic soils.
