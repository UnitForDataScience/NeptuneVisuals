After the city's water source was changed from Lake Huron to the Flint River increases were observed in the lead concentration in Flint's water supply and the blood lead levels in children.5 Children are more susceptible to lead toxicity than adults and cognitive development problems make childhood lead exposure a special public health concern.6 In addition to its neurobehavioral toxicity lead exposure has destructive effects on the reproductive hematopoietic cardiovascular gastrointestinal circulatory immunological and renal systems and deleterious effects on the urinary tract liver and kidney.1 7-10 Lead causes oxidative stress and impairs the antioxidant defense systems.11 Antioxidants such as herbs bioactive peptides vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine have been demonstrated to protect against lead toxicity.12 13The gut microbiome which is also known as our second genome has received much attention recently due to its involvement in human health and disease.14 The gut microbiome plays a key role in gut permeability and inflammation energy harvest and lipid metabolism.15 16 Disruption or dysbiosis of gut bacteria is associated with diverse diseases such as allergies gastric cancer autism obesity anorexia Crohn's disease inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes.17 Host-microbiome metabolic interactions can trigger biological effects both locally and systemically.18 For example the gut microbiome produces short- chain fatty acids acetate propionate and butyrate vitamins and other cofactors through the digestion of polysaccharides.19 The gut microbiome also produces metabolites through amino acid fermentation such as cresol and indole which can be toxic to the host.20 Likewise the gut microbiome biotransforms primary hydrophilic bile acids to secondary hydrophobic bile acids in the large intestine via deconjugation oxidation epimerization and dihydroxylation.21 Bile acids can facilitate fat and fat-soluble vitamin absorption andGao et al.Page 3maintain cholesterol homeostasis.22 Furthermore bile acids are viewed as signaling molecules that bind to nuclear receptor FXR and the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR5.21 23The gut microbiome can be affected by many factors including genetics gender age and antibiotics.

For example what is the dose-dependent response to lead exposure particularly at environmental and human-relevant concentrations What are the health effects of lead-induced gut microbiome perturbations in the host Likewise what are the roles of host responses in mediating the gut microbiome and its functions Future studies are warranted to address these intriguing questions to better understand the complex functional interactions among lead the gut microbiome and the host.Supplementary MaterialRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.AcknowledgmentsFunding InformationThe University of Georgia University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the NIHNIEHS provided partial financial support R01ES024950 for this work.Gao et al.Page 11AbbreviationsGC-MSGas chromatography-mass spectrometryPCoAPrinciple coordinate analysisPLS-DAPartial least squares discriminant analysisCACholic acidUDCAUrsodeoxycholic acidDCADeoxycholic acidCoADRCoenzyme A disulfide reductaseGSRGlutathione reductaseReferencesLockitch G. Perspectives on lead toxicity.

However despite the key role of the gut microbiome in human health the functional impact of lead exposure on the gut microbiome has not been studied.

Taken together these results demonstrated that lead exposure not only altered gut microbiome community structuresdiversity but also greatly affected metabolic functions leading to gut microbiome toxicity.Graphical AbstractCorresponding Authors Kun Lu PhD Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill NC 27599 TSupporting InformationRelative abundance of typical gut bacterial genera in the measurements from the control and lead-exposed mice at weeks 13 and 4.

Recent studies showed that the gut microbiome was disturbed by heavy metals such as arsenic cadmium and lead.24-27 A previous study investigated the impact of eight weeks of oral lead ingestion at a 100 or 500 ppm concentration on the gut bacterial compositions of mice via pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.28 However the functional effects of lead on the gut microbiome remain unknown.

Therefore in the present study we applied 16S rRNA sequencing whole genome metagenomics sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS metabolomics profiling to explore the effects of lead exposure on the gut microbiome and its functions and to define gut microbiome toxicity.

Taken together these system- level approaches reveal that lead exposure has a profound effect on gut microbiome development and numerous key metabolites and metaboliccellular pathways of gut bacteria leading to gut microbiome toxicity.Materials and MethodsAnimals and exposureSpecific pathogen-free C57BL6 female mice 7 weeks old were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and housed at the University of Georgia animal facility for one week before the experiment.

Molecular features with significant changes p0.05 and fold change 1.5 were identified using the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Standard Reference Database and searched against the Human Metabolome Database to obtain function and pathway information.Statistical analysisDifferences in the gut microbiome composition were analyzed using a nonparametric test in the Metastats software as previously described.31 Principle coordinate analysis PCoA was used to compare gut microbiome profiles between the control and treated samples and examine differences in beta diversity based on the UniFrac distance metric.32 Alpha diversity was also analyzed to examine the species richness in given samples.

One of the key features of the gut microbiome is that it is a highly dynamic system with the gut microbiome composition or abundance changing over time Figure S1.

The majority of the altered bacterial genera were reduced due to lead exposure.Lead exposure reduced vitamin E and bile acids in the gut microbiomeSince the gut microbiome plays a key role in metabolic processing next we used metabolomics to examine metabolic changes associated with gut microbiome perturbations.
