In their single-center open-label randomized controlled trial the authors compared the effectiveness of 14 days of oral vancomycin followed by a single fe- cal microbiota transplantation FMT by enema to a 6-week taper of oral vanco- mycin in patients experiencing acute epi- sodes of recurrent Clostridium difficile in- fection.

These are known risk factors for C. difficile infec- tion 5 6 and would favor recurrence in the FMT arm.Other factors that must be taken into consideration include the fact that 37.5 of patients in the FMT group received less than 40 g of stool in the FMT prepa- ration 1.

Finally day 0 in the van- comycin taper arm was defined as day 14 of vancomycin therapy this allowed for patients in the vancomycin group to receive therapy active against C. difficile for 28 days into the follow-up period.While the prospective randomized trial design to evaluate a previously unanswered question brought initial appeal the unaddressed limitations lead to misleading interpretation and conclu- sions.
