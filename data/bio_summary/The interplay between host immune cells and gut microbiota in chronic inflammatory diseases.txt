Taken together the intestinal microbiota essentially serves as 'external metabolic organ' that continuously supplies the host with absorbable nutrients and efficient energy.Role of intestinal microbiota in the development and function of host immune systemStudies using germ-free GF and gnotobiotic animals colonized with defined bacteria have provided direct evidence that the microbiota has a crucial role in the development andmaintenance of the host immune system.Notably GF mice show remarkable defects in the development of the gut- associated lymphoid tissues GALT.For example GF mice exhibit relatively fewer and smaller Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and impaired development and maturation of isolated lymphoid follicles that serve as an inductive site for IgA responses compared with the mice housed under specific pathogen free SPF conditions F.2 However the impaired development of these structures can be reversed by exposing GF mice to intestinal bacteria or peptidoglycans isolated from Gram-negative bacteria showing that the microbiota has a dynamic relationship with the formation of GALT.

The development and maturation of IgA-producing B cells are defective in the intestine of GF mice and sustained exposure to bacteria is required for the continued production of commensal-specific IgA.In addition the intestinal epithelial cells in GF animals are regenerated at a lower rate and form structurally altered microvilli compared with conventionally raised animals.The intestinal mucus layer which functions as a lubricant and protects the epithelium from irritations by luminal contents including certain microbes is thinner in GF animals indicating that resident bacteria are involved in the normal formation of the mucus layer.2 These defects in the intestinal physical barriers in GF animals seem to be associated with more susceptible phenotypes to pathogen infections and excessively heavy and prolonged bleeding during colitis induction.

In this article we review the role of the host-microbe interaction in the host immune system discuss possible links between intestinal dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory diseases and finally propose potential treatments for these diseases through correction of intestinal dysbiosis.FUNCTION OF INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA IN THE HOSTThe 'external' metabolic organThe microbiota assists in the degradation of otherwise indigestible carbohydrates in the human intestine through some digestive enzymes derived from bacteria.Most nutrients produced by host enzymes are absorbed in the stomach and small intestine whereas bacteria residing in the ileum usually utilize only simple carbohydrates as a major energy source.By contrast the indigestible carbohydrates and proteins equivalent to 10-30 of the total ingested energy reach the colon where these otherwise indigestible dietary carbohydrates and host-derived glycans are converted by enzymes produced by strict anaerobic bacteria to simple carbohydrates used as nutrients and energy .

The vitamins synthesized by bacteria are mainly absorbed in the large intestine whereas uptake of vitamins from dietary sources is achieved in the proximal small intestine.Also anaerobic intestinal bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids SCFAs as the end products of fermentation of dietary fibers among which acetate propionate and butyrate are the most abundant.SCFAs are transported from the intestinal lumen into the various tissues where they are used as either a source of energy substrates or signal molecules to aid in the metabolism of lipids glucose and cholesterols .

For example an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and TM7 bacteria in the gut drastically enhanced the permeability of the normally sterile mucus inner layer to more penetrable region resulting in bacterial infiltration into intestinal inner layer close to epithelium.Symbiotic intestinal bacteria have been well known to beessential for the development and function of specific lympho- cyte subsets.

Phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils are tightly regulated to maintain intestinal homeostasis.Intestinal bacteria continuously stimu- late resident macrophages to release large amounts of IL-10 that promotes induction of Treg cells and prevents excessive development of TH17 cells which is critical for maintaining tolerogenic immune responses in the intestine .The stimulation by commensals also upregulates the expression of pro-IL-1b precursor form of IL-1b in intestinal phagocytes without eliciting inflammasome responses and harmful release of mature IL-1b.

For instance more bacteria penetrate the intestinal mucus layer in patients with IBD than that observed in healthy controls indicating possibly more virulent intestinal bacteria in patients with IBD that possess a heightened accessibility to the epithelial mucus layer.

Several studies have reported distinct patterns in the intestinal microbiota infants that developed allergies later in life.The intestinal flora of babies that suffered from allergic inflammation consists of more prevalent Clostridia and Enterococci and less prevalent Lactobacilli Bifidobacteria and Bacteroidetes compared with healthy subjects .

To do that understanding the mechanisms by which pathogens colonize the intestinal tract outcompete commensal bacteria or translocate systemically as well as finding intrinsic factors that can differentiate pathogens from commensals will provide critical insights into the development of effective and specific narrow-spectrum antibiotics that target the pathogens or selective pathobionts whereas remaining innocuous to other commensals.ProbioticsProbiotics are live microorganisms that provide health benefits to the host when consumed in adequate amounts.For many years studies of probiotics have reported prophylactic and therapeutic effects of probiotics in the various disease models associated with intestinal dysbiosis.

Intriguingly this severe inflammation could be restored by colonization with a conventional microbiota in neonatal GF mice but not in adult GF mice.In support of this hypothesis Olszak et al.
