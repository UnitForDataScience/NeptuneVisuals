in this article we review the role of the host-microbe interaction in the host immune system discuss possible links between intestinal dysbiosis and chronic inflammatory diseases and finally propose potential treatments for these diseases through correction of intestinal dysbiosis.function of intestinal microbiota in the hostthe 'external' metabolic organthe microbiota assists in the degradation of otherwise indigestible carbohydrates in the human intestine through some digestive enzymes derived from bacteria.most nutrients produced by host enzymes are absorbed in the stomach and small intestine whereas bacteria residing in the ileum usually utilize only simple carbohydrates as a major energy source.by contrast the indigestible carbohydrates and proteins equivalent to 10-30 of the total ingested energy reach the colon where these otherwise indigestible dietary carbohydrates and host-derived glycans are converted by enzymes produced by strict anaerobic bacteria to simple carbohydrates used as nutrients and energy .

taken together the intestinal microbiota essentially serves as 'external metabolic organ' that continuously supplies the host with absorbable nutrients and efficient energy.role of intestinal microbiota in the development and function of host immune systemstudies using germ-free gf and gnotobiotic animals colonized with defined bacteria have provided direct evidence that the microbiota has a crucial role in the development andmaintenance of the host immune system.notably gf mice show remarkable defects in the development of the gut- associated lymphoid tissues galt.for example gf mice exhibit relatively fewer and smaller peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes and impaired development and maturation of isolated lymphoid follicles that serve as an inductive site for iga responses compared with the mice housed under specific pathogen free spf conditions f.2 however the impaired development of these structures can be reversed by exposing gf mice to intestinal bacteria or peptidoglycans isolated from gram-negative bacteria showing that the microbiota has a dynamic relationship with the formation of galt.
