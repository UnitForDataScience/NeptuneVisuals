The selection criteria for patients to test as well as the diagnostic testing schema used influence diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.In this report we used the GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network database to describe epidemiologic characteristics of CDI and to examine the factors associated with clinical diagno- sis of travel-associated CDI.MethodsData were collected by reporting clinics of the GeoSentinel Global Surveillance Network a global surveillance network of 59 travel and tropical medicine clinics on 6 continents operating at the time the analysis was conducted.To be eligible for in- clusion in the GeoSentinel surveillance database patients must have crossed an international border within the 10 years preced- ing their clinical visit and have sought medical care from a GeoSentinel clinician for a presumed travel-associated illness.

We also surveyed GeoSentinel sites to compare various testing indica- tions approaches and diagnostic modalities.Results We identified 260 GeoSentinel records including 187 that satisfied criteria for analysis confirmed cases in non-immigrant travellers aged 2 years seen 12 weeks post-travel.

The epidemiology of CDI among international travellers is poorly understood and factors associated with international travel such as antibiotic use and changes in gut microbiota could poten- tially put travellers at higher risk.Methods We summarized demographic travel-associated and geographic characteristics of travellers with CDI in the GeoSentinel database from 1997 to 2015.

Antibiotic use is known to cause reduced resistance to C. difficile colonization through disruption of the intestinal microbiotain a duration- dependent manner.Providing travellers with a short course of antibiotics for self-treatment of traveller's diarrhoea is a stan- dard of practice in travel medicine.A recent study of USA- based pre-travel healthcare providers by the Global TravEpiNet clinic consortium showed that 87 of international travellers received an antibiotic prescription for empiric self-treatment for presumptive travellers' diarrhoea although the proportion of travellers using such prescriptions during travel is unknown.In addition to antibiotic use international travel itself has been as- sociated with broad changes in intestinal microbial community structurethough this has not been directly associated with CDI.CDI has been shown to be associated with internationaltravel.

Prospective studies that involve testing all travellers for C. difficile are needed for determination of independent risk factors.The variability of laboratory diagnostic testing practices found in our study illustrates the lack of standardization in the diagnostic approach for travellers' diarrhoea.

First because the find- ings are limited to travellers who present for care to GeoSentinel sites the data are not necessarily representative of all international travellers.

Where needed because of na- tional regulations at individual GeoSentinel sites ethical clear- ance has been obtained.The GeoSentinel database was examined to identify patientswith a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of CDI and a clinic visit date from 1 January 1997 to 31 August 2015.

Of note the number of sites participating in GeoSentinel increased from 9 in 1997 to 31 in 2006 to 56 in 2015 reflective of a steady growth in the GeoSentinel network.
