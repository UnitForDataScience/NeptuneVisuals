The incidence of NEC  Stage II late-onset sepsis and all-cause mortality was compared for an equal period 'before' Period I and 'after' Period II RPS with LGG orL.

Of the VLBW infants with NEC  Stage II eleven received breast-feeding compared with nine who received formula milk for premature infants there were no statistically significant differences.Outcomes for neonates 27-32 weeksAlthough mortality was slightly lower in Period II 149 v. 126  there was a very significant difference betweennewborns who received probiotics and those who did not 106 v. 24  without probiotics v. with probiotics after adjusting for IUGR late-onset sepsis and intraventricular haemorrhage 2.

No significant differences were observed in the age of achieving full enteral nutrition in the days of parenteral nutrition administered 2 or in breast milk nutrition between the study periods 1.The incidence of patent ductus arteriosus left atriumaorticroot ratio  14 or ductal diameter 15 mm with a left-right shunt and the proportion of those who needed treatment did not differ between the two study periods 1.Outcomes for neonates 27 weeksIn all 324 and 345  of the infants with a gestational age27 weeks died during Periods I and II.

In this systematic review although diverse probiotics were used in the different trialsmost used a combination of L. acidophilus and B. bifidus.In our study in patients supplemented with probiotics the incidence of NEC mortality and late-onset sepsis is less than the Vermont Oxford international databasebenchmark for the VLBW data set NEC 36  mortality 37  and the Spanish data for NEC 10 Late-onset sepsisAccording to other authors25 a combination of low-dose probiotics decreases the frequency of late-onset sepsis and thus would be the preferred approach rather than single strains.

U. designed the study and was the study coordinator J. U. and E. N.-L. carried out the study E. A.-R. and M. M.-O.

In all 843 and 858 Period I v. Period II of the mothers received antenatal steroids and the rate of twin births 366 and 394 in Periods I and II respectively was also comparable between the two periods.

During Period II fewer hours of O2 therapy were supplied although the difference is not statistically significant this did result in a statistically significant decrease in episodes of mild broncho- pulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity Stages I and II T1.

Dr. Oloriz 16 18012 Granada SpainSubmitted 5 January 2017 - Final revision received 1 March 2017 - Accepted 6 March 2017 - First published online 26 April 2017AbstractThe aim of the study was to determine whether routine probiotic supplementation RPS with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG LGG or Lactobacillus acidophilus  Lactobacillus bifidum is associated with reduced risk of necrotising enterocolitis NEC  Stage II in preterm neonates born at 32 weeks' gestation.

The study population was composed of 261 neonates Period I v. II 134 v. 127 with comparable gestation duration and birth weights.

In 32 weeks we observed a significant reduction in NEC  Stage II 113 v. 48  late-onset sepsis 16 v. 105  and mortality 194 v. 23 .
