in addition diverse platforms compatible with the com- mercial kits for automated dna extraction are commonly used.studies of dna extraction methods for human microbiome research indicate that the use of different dna extraction kits can generate different microbial profiles for the same fecal sample although the variation between different dna extraction methods was shown in most cases to be no larger than the inter-individual variation one of the major factors in the observed differ- ences was whether or not the kit protocol included mechanical disruption by bead beating in the cell lysis step bead beating improves bacterial dna recovery by effectively lysing not only gram-negative but also gram-positive bacteria which have a thick cell wall modifications to the original extraction kit protocols such as addition of bead beating are thus not uncom- mon since no clear consensus regarding the most effective dna extraction method has been reached and dna extraction tech- niques are constantly advancing it is important to compare newly developed dna extraction methods with established procedures.therefore this study compared a new dna extraction kit the tianlong stool dnarna extraction kit ts with two widely used kits the qiaamp dna stool mini kit qs and qiaamp powerfecal dna kit qp formerly known as the mo bio's powerfecal dna isolation kit.

the samples subjected to bead-beating methods were separated from those processed by no bead-beating methods with pc1 in the pcoa plot 38.14 variation and the dif- ference between bead-beating and no bead-beating groups was statistically significant anosim r  0.695 p  0.001. in addition if the same kit and bead-beating method were used for dna extrac- tion the samples clustered closely irrespective of whether manual or automated extraction was performed anosim r  0.029 p  0.629. replicate samples processed using the same methods clustered together.

when the overallmicrobial community structures between dna extraction meth- ods were compared using three different metrics bray-curtis weighted unifrac and unweighted unifrac distances the values of the first two distances between bead-beating and no bead- beating methods were relatively higher than those between no bead-beating methods or between bead-beating methods while all values of unweighted unifrac distances were quite similar to each other supplementary fig.

however for short-read sequencing technologies such as the illumina miseq platform used in this study the fragmented dna observed in the ts methods may still be appropriate for use.the methods involving bead beating showed a greater number of species than no bead-beating methods .

we tested nine different dna extraction methods using three commercial kits tianlong stool dnarna extraction kit ts qiaamp dna stool mini kit qs and qiaamp powerfecal dna kit qp with or without additional bead-beating step using manual or automated methods and compared them in terms of dna extraction ability from human fecal sample.

therefore nine different methods were employed in the present study - one method for the qp kit and four methods for each of the ts and qs kits.

unlike the ts kit the addition of a bead-beating step in the qs kit resulted in a four-fold increase in nucleic acid yield compared to the methods without bead beating a. there was no significant difference in nucleic acid con- centration between the automated and manual extraction methods p  0.5746 supplementary fig.

open and shaded bars indicate no bead-beating and bead-beating methods respectively.all methods with the exception of qs with bead beating had a 260280 absorbance ratio of 1.8 suggesting the extraction of relatively pure nucleic acids from the fecal sample b. the fragmentation status of the extracted dna was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.

the values of bray-curtis and weighted unifrac distances were lower than those between the different extraction methods but the unweighted unifrac distances between tripli- cates were comparable to those between the different extraction methods.

s3 suggested that for single molecule or long-read sequencing tech- nologies particularly those from pacific biosciences pacbio andoxford nanopore technologies ont extracting dna from fecal samples with qs or qp methods may be more suitable than ts methods.

this observa- tion was in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that bead beating enhanced a more precise determination of microbial diversity by enabling dna extraction of difficult-to-lyse microor- ganisms the microbial community structures of the samples also varied according to whether or not the dna extraction method included a bead-beating step in the samples extracted by methods involving bead beating gram-positive bac- terial genera such as bifidobacterium ruminococcus coprococcus and blautia were more abundant compared to those extracted by methods without bead beating irrespective of the dna extraction kit used.

in addition when comparing microbiome data across studies the dna extraction methods applied to each study should be taken into account.conclusionsthe present study assessed and compared the effects of dif- ferent dna extraction methods with a combination of kits bead beating and automation on the yield and quality of nucleic acidsmicrobial diversity and microbial profiles.

accurate profiling of the highly complex gut microbiome requires dna extraction methods that provide sufficient coverage of the original community as well as adequate quality and quantity.

all methods produced dna in sufficient concentration and quality for use in sequencing and the samples were clustered according to the dna extraction method.
