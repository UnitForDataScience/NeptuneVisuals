In addition diverse platforms compatible with the com- mercial kits for automated DNA extraction are commonly used.Studies of DNA extraction methods for human microbiome research indicate that the use of different DNA extraction kits can generate different microbial profiles for the same fecal sample although the variation between different DNA extraction methods was shown in most cases to be no larger than the inter-individual variation One of the major factors in the observed differ- ences was whether or not the kit protocol included mechanical disruption by bead beating in the cell lysis step Bead beating improves bacterial DNA recovery by effectively lysing not only Gram-negative but also Gram-positive bacteria which have a thick cell wall Modifications to the original extraction kit protocols such as addition of bead beating are thus not uncom- mon Since no clear consensus regarding the most effective DNA extraction method has been reached and DNA extraction tech- niques are constantly advancing it is important to compare newly developed DNA extraction methods with established procedures.Therefore this study compared a new DNA extraction kit the TianLong Stool DNARNA Extraction Kit TS with two widely used kits the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit QS and QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit QP formerly known as the MO BIO's PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit.

This observa- tion was in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that bead beating enhanced a more precise determination of microbial diversity by enabling DNA extraction of difficult-to-lyse microor- ganisms The microbial community structures of the samples also varied according to whether or not the DNA extraction method included a bead-beating step In the samples extracted by methods involving bead beating Gram-positive bac- terial genera such as Bifidobacterium Ruminococcus Coprococcus and Blautia were more abundant compared to those extracted by methods without bead beating irrespective of the DNA extraction kit used.

The MetaHIT project which is based on metagenomic shotgun sequencing esti- mated that each person carries at least 160 species at any one time and that the entire European cohort harbors a total of 1000-1150 bacterial species To profile this complex human gut micro- bial community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing or metagenomic shotgun sequencing it is critical to extract efficiently the DNA of all bacterial species in the community.Human microbiome researchers have employed various DNA extraction methods although the International Human Microbiome Standards project IHMS  has suggested standard operating procedures for DNA extraction from human fecal samples This is necessary because numerous commercial fecal microbiome DNA extraction kits are available and more are continually being developed.

For example both kits commonly showed that the addition of a bead-beating step was associated with higher rela- tive abundances of Bifidobacterium Ruminococcus Coprococcus and Blautia whereas no bead beating was associated with higher rela- tive abundances of Bacteroides Parabacteroides and Prevotella.DiscussionIn this study three commercial DNA extraction kits with or without an additional bead-beating step andor an automated pro- cedure were compared in terms of DNA recovery from the gut microbiome and the effects of DNA extraction methods were described on the quantity and quality of nucleic acids as well as gut microbial community composition.The yield of nucleic acids differed significantly between the DNA extraction kits The QP kit yielded the lowest nucleic acid concentrations in agreement with previous reports Interest-ingly a significantly higher quantity of nucleic acid was extracted using the TS kit possibly due to its use of magnetic beads com- pared to the other kits that employed a filtration column with a silica membrane.

We tested nine different DNA extraction methods using three commercial kits TianLong Stool DNARNA Extraction Kit TS QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit QS and QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Kit QP with or without additional bead-beating step using manual or automated methods and compared them in terms of DNA extraction ability from human fecal sample.

The values of Bray-Curtis and weighted UniFrac distances were lower than those between the different extraction methods but the unweighted UniFrac distances between tripli- cates were comparable to those between the different extraction methods.

In addition when comparing microbiome data across studies the DNA extraction methods applied to each study should be taken into account.ConclusionsThe present study assessed and compared the effects of dif- ferent DNA extraction methods with a combination of kits bead beating and automation on the yield and quality of nucleic acidsmicrobial diversity and microbial profiles.

When the overallmicrobial community structures between DNA extraction meth- ods were compared using three different metrics Bray-Curtis weighted UniFrac and unweighted UniFrac distances the values of the first two distances between bead-beating and no bead- beating methods were relatively higher than those between no bead-beating methods or between bead-beating methods while all values of unweighted UniFrac distances were quite similar to each other Supplementary Fig.

These results indicated that the different DNA extraction methods resulted in differences of community composition but their size effect on the community membership was much smaller with a similar magnitude to that observed between technical repli- cates.Taxonomic profile of the gut microbiomeIn the fecal sample tested Bacteroides was the most abundant bacterial genus irrespective of the DNA extraction method.
