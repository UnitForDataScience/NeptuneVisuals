Bile acids also stimulate the binding of Wnt to the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP-frizzled receptor Fzr-E-cadherin-b-catenin complex which causes release of b-catenin from E-cadherin and into the cytoplasm where it translocates to the nucleus and stimulatesJia et al.Page 39transcription factors such as LEFTCF to increase cell proliferation and cell stemness thus contributing to the development and progression of CRC216.DCA deoxycholic acid CRC colorectal cancer EGFR epidermal growth factor Ras Ras oncoprotein ERK12 extracellular signal-regulated kinase 12 C-Jun C-Jun protein C-Fos C-Fos protein c-Myc myc oncoprotein AA arachidonic acid COX cyclooxygenase LOX lipoxygenase ROS reactive oxygen species PKC protein kinase C MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase NF-kB nuclear factor kappa B IL-1b interleukin-one- beta PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase MDM2 mouse double minute chromosome 2 Wnt Wingless-related integration site LRP low density receptor related protein Fzr frizzled receptor APC adenomatous polypopsis coli LEF lymphoid enhancer factor TCF T-cell factorTable 1Clinical trials and ongoing studies of targeting bile acid signalling in gastrointestinal diseasesAbbreviationsCD Crohn Disease FAP Familial Adenomatous Polyposis FXR farnesoid X receptor IBD inflammatory bowel disease INT-767 23-sulphate derivative of OCA INT-777 6a-ethyl-23S-methylcholic acid NAFLD nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NASH nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Nor UDCA norursodeoxycholic acid OCA obeticholic acid UDCA ursodeoxycholic acid PBC primary biliarycirrhosis PSC primary sclerosing cholangitis TGR5 G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 TUDCA tauroursodeoxycholic acid UC Ulcerative Colitis UDCA ursodeoxycholic acid VDR Vitamin D receptor.

The 'alternative' pathway yields CDCA via the hydroxylation of the cholesterol side chain by CYP27A1 followed by 7-a hydroxylation that is addition of a 7a-hydroxy group by CYP7B141 to form the oxysterol intermediates.Following the conjugation of the primary bile acids CA and CDCA to either taurine predominantly in mice or glycine mainly in humans by bile acidCoA synthetase BACS and bile acid-CoAamino acid N-acyltransferase BAAT to form taurocholic acid TCA taurochenodeoxycholic acid TCDCA glycocholic acid GCA and glycochenodeoxycholic acid GCDCA primary bile acids are secreted from the liver into the bile canaliculus via the canalicular bile salt export pump BSEP34.

Such metabolites include bile acids such as deoxycholic acid DCA and lithocholic acid LCA which are involved in digestive processes or represent etiological agents and mediators of the pathogenic process910 choline which is involved in transportation of lipids methylation reactions and neurotransmitter synthesis11 neurotransmitters such as glycine glutamate g- aminobutyric acid GABA12 and short-chain fatty acids SCFAs such as acetate and butyrate which shape the composition of the gut microbiota and thus influence colon physiology and serve as energy sources by host cells and the intestinal microbiota1314.

Optimally a bile acid pool of about 3 grams 90-95 is recycled between the gut and the liver approximately eight times per day with only 0.2-0.6 grams of de novo synthesized bile acids being produced per day to maintain a stable pool of bile acids3853.Jia et al.Page 5Signalling regulation of bile acid synthesis and transportHepatic FXR is the primary regulator of bile acid biosynthesis and enterohepatic circulation.

2 illustrates the signalling pathway for bile acid synthesis and distribution.Species-specific differences in bile acid synthesis transport and metabolism occur particularly with respect to the composition of the bile acid pool.

However an in vivo mouse study indicated that this rank order may be different under physiological non-hepatotoxic conditions66 the repression of the FXR target gene Cyp7a1 at a bile acid dose of 0.1 of their dietary intake showed a rank order DCA  ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA  CA  CDCA  LCA whereas at a dose of 0.3 the orderchanged to UDCA  DCA  CDCA  CA  LCA thus at higher doses of bile acid CDCA precedes CA as an FXR activator.

In addition modification of gut microbiota profiles using probiotics enhanced faecal excretion of bile acids and promoted hepatic bile acid synthesis in mice the mechanism of which involved decreased bile acid re-absorption from ileum and repression of the enterohepatic FXR-FGF15 axis129 which suggests that dysbiosis and abnormal bile acid metabolism can be reversed with probiotics.

Although TGR5 agonists have shown promise in control of hepatic and gastrointestinal inflammation73193 additional studies are necessary before translation to the clinical setting.Recently bile acid-binding resins or bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine and colestimide have been used to remove bile acids from the intestine via chelating with them and promoting their excretion in faeces leading to decreased enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the accelerated conversion of cholesterol to bile acids via increased bile acid synthesis due to decreased bile acid reabsorption in the intestine197.

Given the complexity of bile acid signalling and the direct biochemical interactions between the gut microbiota and the host a systems biology perspective is required to understand the liver-bile acid- microbiota axis and its role in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis in order to reverse the microbiota-mediated alterations in bile acid metabolism that occur in disease states.
