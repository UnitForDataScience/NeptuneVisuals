The average distribution of these 6.7 million reads among 48 samples was 141444 range 42366 to 391421 with a standard deviation of 84832 contigs.The following microbial diversity composition and association analyses are presented first for all cases versus controls n48 and second for cases versus controls stratified by management group n16 per management group - 8 cases and 8 controls.Fig.

The PCA indicated differences between management groups that were not observed between all cases and controls.Although Mycoplasma was significantly differentially abundant between cases and controls in our model it had a higher fold change in the controls compared to the cases.

However the differences observed related to the amount of an organism rather than the presence of completely different species that might have predisposed calves to or protected calves from IBK.The largest differences in magnitude between cases and controls occurred within the group C calves but overall the largest differences occurred based on management group i.e.

Rarefaction curves are presented below as a method to estimate the sampling depth.AnalysisMicrobial diversity composition and statistical associations were carried out for two sets of comparisons 1 cases versus controls and 2 cases versus controls within each management group e.g.

DNA extraction was processed in three runs and all runs included cases and controls so batch effects should be distributed across the cases and controls.Study sizeThe number of samples collected was pragmatic and based on budget.
