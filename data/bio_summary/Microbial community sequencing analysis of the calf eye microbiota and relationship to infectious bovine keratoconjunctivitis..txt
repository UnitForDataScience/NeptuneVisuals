the average distribution of these 6.7 million reads among 48 samples was 141444 range 42366 to 391421 with a standard deviation of 84832 contigs.the following microbial diversity composition and association analyses are presented first for all cases versus controls n48 and second for cases versus controls stratified by management group n16 per management group - 8 cases and 8 controls.fig.

the family campylobacteraceae had the largest estimated fold-change associated with cases compared to con- trols fc 3.066 ci 1.518 6.191 q 0.023. erysipelotrichaceae was also observed more frequently in the cases compared to the controlsweeksellaceae fc0.310 ci  0.172 0.559 q  0.007 methylobacasmataceae fc 0.435 ci 0.241 0.786 q 0.039 were the three taxonomic families with the most extreme estimated fold changes in the controls compared to cases that had a q-value less than 0.05. the genus mycoplasma family mycoplasmataceae was more abundant in the controls  0.424 ci 0.233 0.769 however this was not statisti- cally significant q  0.468. an unknown genus of the family weeksellaceae note weeksellaceae included a taxonomic change by the database curators was estimated to be significantly more abundant in the control group fc 0.019 ci 0.003 0.095 q 0.001. no other known genera met the false discovery rate threshold of 0.05.moraxellaceae the family that contains the genus moraxella was notcalves based on our model fc0.707 ci  0.399 1.255 q  0.357.classified as unassigned.

the pca indicated differences between management groups that were not observed between all cases and controls.although mycoplasma was significantly differentially abundant between cases and controls in our model it had a higher fold change in the controls compared to the cases.

however the differences observed related to the amount of an organism rather than the presence of completely different species that might have predisposed calves to or protected calves from ibk.the largest differences in magnitude between cases and controls occurred within the group c calves but overall the largest differences occurred based on management group i.e.

rarefaction curves are presented below as a method to estimate the sampling depth.analysismicrobial diversity composition and statistical associations were carried out for two sets of comparisons 1 cases versus controls and 2 cases versus controls within each management group e.g.

overall alpha diversity based on the chao1 estimator indicated there was no significant difference in species0.45 a. similarly species richness based on observed otus was also not significant between cases and controls cohen's d 0.47  1.06 0.12 b. higher microbial diversity was observed in the cases compared to the controls based on faith's pd cohen'sd 0.67  1.27 0.08 c. rarefaction curves based on observed otus by disease group are depicted in d. the rarefaction curves suggest that additional sampling of calf eyes would not likely result in additional observed otus.

cases were randomly selected from ibk positive calves and controls were selected from ibk negative calves i.e.

dna extraction was processed in three runs and all runs included cases and controls so batch effects should be distributed across the cases and controls.study sizethe number of samples collected was pragmatic and based on budget.
