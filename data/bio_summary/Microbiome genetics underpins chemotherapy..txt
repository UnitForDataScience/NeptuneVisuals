These results suggested bacterial ribonucleotide metabolism as the primary mediator of drug toxicity in C. elegans 1.To mechanistically explore the bacterial mediation of 5-FU toxicity on the host we performed in vivo and in vitro measurements together with metabolomic analysis and found that microbes have the capacity to modify and excrete activated toxic fluoronucleotides including FUMP FUTP and FdUMP which are ultimately responsible for the increased efficacy of drug therapy.

Crucially profiles of 5-FU metabolites isolated from worms were identical to profiles of the bacterial strain they were co-cultured with indicating that bacterial metabolism dictates drug metabolism rather than that of the worm.

Disruption of the bacterial B6 and B9-associated pathways glycine cleavage system and one-carbon metabolism which are linked to ribonucleotide metabolism via TS reduced drug efficacy in the host.

These activated compounds as well as the toxic effects of 5-FU were abrogated in a genetically modified bacterial strain lacking genes encoding the enzymes of ribonucleotide salvage upp udk and udp.

Like us worms establish a symbiotic relationship with their microbes requiring them for optimal development and metabolic health 3.We utilised the unique advantages of the C. elegans model to explore how bacteria can change the host response to the antimetabolite pro-drug 5-fluorouracil 5-FU commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer CRC 3.

From more than 55000 individual conditions tested this screen identified vitamins B6 and B9 and ribonucleotide metabolism as key contributors to 5-FU action in the host.

In addition we demonstrated that the ability for bacteria to convert 5-FU leads to reduced germline hyperproliferation and promotes survival in nematode cancer models 1.We also identified a secondary mechanism by which bacteria are able to manipulate fluoropyrimidine efficacy in C. elegans.
