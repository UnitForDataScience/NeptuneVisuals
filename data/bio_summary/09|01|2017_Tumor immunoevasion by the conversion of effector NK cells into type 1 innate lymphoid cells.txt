To investigate the role of TGF-b signaling in the conversion of NK cells we used transgenic mice with TGF-b signaling that was ablated specifically in NKp46 cells Ncr1crewtTgfbRIIflfl mice called 'RIIFL' mice here along with their corresponding controls Ncr1wtwtTgfbRIIflfl mice called 'RIIWT' mice here and transgenic mice with TGF-b signaling that was con- stitutively active specifically in NKp46 cells Ncr1crewtTgfbRICAflfl mice called 'RICA-FL' mice here and their corresponding controls Ncr1wtwtTgfbRICAflfl mice called 'RICA-WT' mice here.

For NK cell or ILC1 in vitro culture freshly sorted liver NK cells or ILC1s labeled with the division-tracking dye CFSE BioLegend were plated at a density of 25000 cells per well in 96-well plates Greiner Bio-One containing RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10 FCS 1 non-essential amino acids Gibco 1 sodium pyruvate Gibco 10 mM HEPES 1 GlutaMAX 0.1 2-mercaptoethanol Gibco and 1 penicillin- streptomycin in the presence of rIL-15 rIL-15-IL-15Ra complex or TGF-b1 all from eBioscience at the appropriate concentrations at 37 degC 5 CO2 for 5 d. For intILC1 and NK cell in vitro culture sorted intILC1s and NK cells from pooled spleens of RICA-FL or RICA-WT mice were cultured in serum-free TexMACS medium Miltenyi Biotec supplemented with 1 Glutamax 0.1 2-mercaptoethanol 1 non-essential amino acids 1 sodium pyruvate 1penicillin-streptomycin and 50 ngml rIL-15 at 37 degC 5 CO2 for 4 d.RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

For assessment of NK cell plasticity in tumors NK cells sorted from pooled spleens of the appropriate transgenic mice were injected intravenously into MCA1956-tumor-bearing Rag2--gc-- mice 5 x 105 NK cells per mouse.

Transferred NK cells also converted into intILC1s in MCA1956-tumor-bearing congenically marked CD45.1 immunocompetent mice given intratumoral injection of splenic NK cells from CD45.2RIIWT mice or RIIFL mice .
