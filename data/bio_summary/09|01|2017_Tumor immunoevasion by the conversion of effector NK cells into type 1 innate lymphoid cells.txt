for assessment of nk cell plasticity in tumors nk cells sorted from pooled spleens of the appropriate transgenic mice were injected intravenously into mca1956-tumor-bearing rag2--gc-- mice 5 x 105 nk cells per mouse.

transferred nk cells also converted into intilc1s in mca1956-tumor-bearing congenically marked cd45.1 immunocompetent mice given intratumoral injection of splenic nk cells from cd45.2riiwt mice or riifl mice .

additionally loss of eomes expression in tumor-infiltrating nk cells is a reported hallmark of nk cell exhaustion and perhaps the transition of nk cells to ilc1sexplains this observation in part.the composition of group 1 ilcs in end-stage mouse tumors as we described was very similar to what has been observed for decidual nk cells dnk cells.

interestingly the conversion of nk cells into intilc1 was also seen after the transfer of wild-type splenic nk cells into lymphocyte-deficient mice as well as for nk cells cultured in vitro in tgf-b.
