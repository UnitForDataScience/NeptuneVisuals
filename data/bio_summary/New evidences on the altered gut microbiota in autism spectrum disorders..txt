despite several reports disclosed an aberrant gut microbiota in asds consensus across studies has not yet been established here we characterized the bacterial gut microbiota and the less studied gut myco- biota of subjects affected by autism through amplicon- based metataxonomic analysis of the v3-v5 regions of the prokaryotic 16s ribosomal dna and of the internal transcribed spacer 1 its1 region of the fungal rdna in order to better understand the microbial community struc- ture associated with asds and its involvement on gi abnormalities.resultsautistic subjects harbour an altered bacterial gut microbiotafor the characterization of the gut microbiota associatedtable 1 characteristics of study participantsautisticneurotypicalsubjects n4040age 1st-3rd quartile10 5-177 3.6-12 gender nfemale22.5 930 12male77.5 3170 28constipation ncars 1st-3rd quartile 47 40-50.5naconstipated50 36-52.0nanon-constipated48 42-50.0na esr 1st-3rd quartile7.5 3.25-17.7 mmhna constipated22.0 12.0-25.0 mmhnanon-constipated7.0 2.7-11.2 mmhnawith autism we recruited 40 autistic subjects 36 out of40 autistic subjects were classified as severe asdsserum iga 1st-3rd quartile131.0 70.0-172.2 mgml nachildhood autism rating scale cars value 37 and 40 neurotypical controls table additional file table s1.

the autistic subjects were consecutively admitted to the child neuropsychiatry unit of the university hospital of siena and asds were diagnosed according with the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5th edition and evaluated using autism diagnostic observation schedule and autism behaviour checklist.

we character- ized the gut microbiota associated with autism disclos- ing an altered microbial community both at bacterial and fungal level.

consistently with these observations an increased firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio has been reported also in subjects with autism further- more we discovered that the relative abundances of the genera collinsella corynebacterium dorea and lactoba- cillus were significantly increased in the gut microbiota of autistic subjects with respect to that of the neurotypical subjects while the relative abundance of the genera alistipes bilophila dialister parabacteroides and veillo- nella were significantly reduced in these individuals.

a re- cent study on a mouse model of asds demonstrated thattreatments with a psa bacteroides fragilis strain restore autism-related behavioural and gi abnormalities also reducing the reported high levels of lachnospiraceae and 4-ethylphenyl sulfate a metabolite produced by this bacterial family related to p-cresol a putative metabolic marker for autism .

further- more none of the published studies on asds' gut micro- biota have assessed the fungal gut community structure associated with autism.

our results therefore encour- age new extensive multicentric studies on the impact of the bacterial and fungal components of the gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal physiology and neuroplastic changes in asds as well as the integra- tion of such data with genetics immunology and metabolomics to further establish the relevance of the gut microbiota in the asds.methodsstudy participants and samples' handling and collection we recruited 40 subjects with clinical diagnosis of autism average age 11.1 - 6.8 sex malefemale 319 and we compared them with 40 age and sex-matched neurotypical healthy subjects average age 9.2 - 7.9 sex malefemale 2812. autistic subjects with clinically evident inflammatory conditions were excluded.

childhood autism rating scale cars scores were calculated by an experienced child neuropsychiatrist.

we thank cesare furlanello and paolo zanini for the insightful discussions on the connection between diet the globalized world microbiota and autism.
