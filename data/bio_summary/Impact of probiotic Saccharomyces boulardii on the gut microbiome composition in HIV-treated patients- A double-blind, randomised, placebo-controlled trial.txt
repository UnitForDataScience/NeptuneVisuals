The proportion of Proteobacteria was higher in immunodiscordant patients the proportion of Lachnospiraceae genera was significantly higher in the INR group OR  3.4 p  0.05 .DiscussionThis is the first clinical trial to use 16S rDNA sequencing to analyze changes in gut microbiome composition following treatment with Saccharomyces boulardii and how these changes are correlated with microbial translocation and inflammation in HIV patients.Microbial imbalance in the gut has been associated with increased microbial translocation leading to chronic inflammation.

In this study we used 16S rDNA tagging to analyze the gut microbiome communities in these 44 patients to assess the impact of probiotic treatment withboulardii compared to placebo.In a sub-study of these patients we explore if the immunological non-response was associ- ated with higher systemic inflammation and microbial translocation parameters and a distinct gut microbiome pattern.Subjects material and methodsStudy designWe performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to analyze the composition of the gut microbiota microbial translocation and inflammation parameters in 44 chronicHIV-infected patients with undetectable plasma viral load 20 copiesmL for at least 2 years and a stable HAART regimen.

The correlations are not statistically significant in probiotic treated group probably because of a decrease in these bacterial communities due to the probiotic effect .Changes in the proportion of Clostridiales after the interventions.Immunological non-response is associated with higher microbial translocation and the presence of some pro-inflammatory speciesThe baseline differences between the INR and IR groups are summarized in .

Taxa in this family were the most enriched  or a significant enrichment was reported - in the untreated HIV-infected subjects compared to HIV-uninfected indi- viduals and was correlated with markers of microbial translocation and systemic inflammation in HIV patients .

Intestinal microbiota microbial translo- cation and systemic inflammation in chronic HIV infection.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if this beneficial effect of the probiotic Saccharo- myces boulardii is due to modified gut microbiome composition with a decrease of some species associated with higher systemic levels of microbial translocation and inflammation.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if this beneficial effect of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii is due to a modification in the gut microbiome composition of this patients with a decrease in some species associated with higher systemic levels of microbial translocation and inflammation.

These probiotic effects on gut microbiota composition were simi- lar in the INR and IR groups.We then investigated the correlation between these different stool bacterial populations parameters of microbial translocation and systemic inflammation and observed a statistically significant correlation between the proportion of Clostridia genera and plasma concentrations of soluble CD14 r  0.63 p  0.03 LBP r  0.71 p  0.009 and IL-6 r  0.69 p  0.0008.

More importantly the gut microbiome can be modified using certain strains of probiotics to generate a less pro-inflammatory profile this new therapeutic target is worthy of further exploration.ConclusionsWe observed a change in gut microbiome composition following probiotic treatment S. bou- lardii with a decrease in some species which are directly correlated with systemic levels of microbial translocation and inflammation.

A recent study have reported that HIV gut microbiome must be controlled for HIV risk factors and after stratifying for sexual orien- tation there was no solid evidence of an HIV-specific dysbiosis but HIV-1 infection remained consistently associated with reduced bacterial richness and the lowest gut bacterial richness was observed in immunologic non-responders patients .Recently the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target for reducing chronic inflammation - and various interventions such as pre-probiotics have been proposed to improve the resident gut microbiome -.
