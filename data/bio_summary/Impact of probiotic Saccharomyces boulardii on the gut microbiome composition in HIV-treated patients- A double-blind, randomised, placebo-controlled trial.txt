a recent study have reported that hiv gut microbiome must be controlled for hiv risk factors and after stratifying for sexual orien- tation there was no solid evidence of an hiv-specific dysbiosis but hiv-1 infection remained consistently associated with reduced bacterial richness and the lowest gut bacterial richness was observed in immunologic non-responders patients .recently the intestinal microbiome has been proposed as a novel therapeutic target for reducing chronic inflammation - and various interventions such as pre-probiotics have been proposed to improve the resident gut microbiome -.

since the specific effects of hiv infection on the particular gut bacterial taxa that contributes to chronic immunoactiva- tion are unclear it seems reasonable to propose treatments to improve the gut bacterial rich- ness and hiv associated immune dysfunction.

half of each group were immunological non-responders inr the median age was 47.5 years 84 were male and the risk factors for acquiring hiv infection were heterosexual htx 46 men who have sex with men mhsm 38 and injection drug users idu 16. the profiles of demographic biological and clinical parameters were similar in the probiotic and placebo groups  .

we recently reported a significant reduction in lbp and il-6 levels in a small cohort of haart-treated hiv patients supple- mented with 12 weeks treatment with probiotic s. boulardii compared to placebo .

previous studies have used pcr or fish techniques rather than 16s rdna sequencing to evaluate the effects of supplementation with specific prebiotics in haart-naive infected hiv adults  and supplementation with probiotic s.boulardii in hiv-negative adults with enteritis  these studies reported a conse- quent reduction in concentrations of pathogenic clostridia-related species which are consid- ered to be pro-inflammatory mucotropic bacteria although these authors did not evaluate if this was correlated with a decrease in systemic inflammation.

while the immunologic driving factors of gut dysbiosis related to hiv infection are likely to be complex interestingly our study showed a significant reduction in these bacterial communities following probiotic treatment.hiv-patients with deficient cd4tcell count recovery despite haart have been defined as immunological non-responders inrs and are estimated to account for up to 30 ofall treated hiv-infected subjects.

effect of 25 weeks probiotic supplementation on immune function of hiv patients.

in this study we used 16s rdna gene amplification and parallel sequencing to analyze the probiotic impact on the composition of the gut microbiome faecal samples in these 44 patients randomized to receive oral supplementation with probiotic or placebo for 12 weeks.

after 12 weeks of probiotic treatment we observed a significant decrease in levels of some clostridiales species with respect to baseline compared with placebocanonical correspondence analysis.. we also observed a significant decreased in catenibacterium communities 2.65 to 0.04 p  0.00003 and an increase in levels of megamonas p  0.02 and desulfovibrionales proteobacteria p  0.05. these probiotic effects on gut microbiota composition were simi- lar in the inr and ir groups.we then investigated the correlation between these different stool bacterial populations parameters of microbial translocation and systemic inflammation and observed a statistically significant correlation between the proportion of clostridia genera and plasma concentrations of soluble cd14 r  0.63 p  0.03 lbp r  0.71 p  0.009 and il-6 r  0.69 p  0.0008. these correlations were present at baseline in inr group but not in the irs probably because irs have a lower relative abundance of clostridiaceae at baseline.

the correlations are not statistically significant in probiotic treated group probably because of a decrease in these bacterial communities due to the probiotic effect .changes in the proportion of clostridiales after the interventions.immunological non-response is associated with higher microbial translocation and the presence of some pro-inflammatory speciesthe baseline differences between the inr and ir groups are summarized in .

in a double-blind randomised placebo- controlled trial we recently showed that compared to placebo 12 weeks treatment with pro- biotic saccharomyces boulardii significantly reduced plasma levels of bacterial translocation lipopolysaccharide-binding protein or lbp and systemic inflammation il-6 in 44 hiv virologically suppressed patients half of whom n  22 had immunologic non-response to antiretroviral therapy 270 cd4tcellsml despite long-term suppressed viral load.

the proportion of proteobacteria was higher in immunodiscordant patients the proportion of lachnospiraceae genera was significantly higher in the inr group or  3.4 p  0.05 .discussionthis is the first clinical trial to use 16s rdna sequencing to analyze changes in gut microbiome composition following treatment with saccharomyces boulardii and how these changes are correlated with microbial translocation and inflammation in hiv patients.microbial imbalance in the gut has been associated with increased microbial translocation leading to chronic inflammation.

recent studies have reported a differences between immunological responders ir and non-responders inr.art antiretroviral therapy pi protease inhibitor nnrti non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor lbp lipopolysaccharide-binding protein scd14 soluble cd14 hs-crp high sensitivity c-reactive protein il-6 interleukin 6 esr erythrocyte sedimentation rate iqr interquartile range.higher proportion of catenibacterium in hiv patients than in healthy individuals .

taxa in this family were the most enriched  or a significant enrichment was reported - in the untreated hiv-infected subjects compared to hiv-uninfected indi- viduals and was correlated with markers of microbial translocation and systemic inflammation in hiv patients .

these data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating in both treated and untreated hiv patients a direct correlation between systemic parameters ofbacterial translocation and chronic immune activation and disease progression -.
