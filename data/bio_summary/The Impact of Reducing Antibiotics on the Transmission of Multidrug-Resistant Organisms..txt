We modeled the effect of antibiotic usage as 1 a microbiome effect for which antibiotic usage decreases competing bacteria and increases the MDRO transmission probability between patients and HCWs and 2 a mutation effect that designates a proportion of patients who receive antibiotics to subsequently develop a MDRO via genetic mutation.setting.

For low-prevalence MDROs absolute reductions in antibiotic usage by 10 and 25 reduced acquisition rates by14.3 P  .001 and 29.8 P  .001 respectively.For the high-prevalence MDROs when considering a microbiome effect of 1.1 ie a 10 increase in transmission probability between patients receiving antibiotics and HCWs and higher acquisition rates were statistically significantly higher than at baseline ie microbiome effect of 1.0 for all experimental levels of antibiotic usage.

Multidrug-resistant organisms MDROs are increasingly prevalent and are associated with significant morbidity mortality and costs.The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes antibiotic usage as the most important factor driving resistance.Antibiotic exposure is known to contribute to resistance it is estimated that the odds of developing a MDRO among patients who received antibiotic therapy is 1.8-5.1 times that of patients who did not receive antibiotics.- Antibiotics are among the most common drugs prescribed in medicine nearly 50 of all hospitalized patients and 75 of critically ill patients receive an antibiotic during a hospital stay.Furthermore up to 50 of those antibiotics prescribed are considered inappropriate.

Then we varied the antibiotic usage and micro- biome effect parameters from their respective baseline levels to explore the effect of decreasing overall antibiotic usage on transmission of MDROs in the ICU.

Our goal was to identify the level at which the microbiome effect causes transmission to become statistically significantly higher as well as the level at which an overall reduction in antibiotic usage causes a statis- tically significant decrease in transmission.We also modeled the effect of antibiotic usage in a second manner.

We first explored this effect using a baseline frequency of antibiotic usage of 75 and then explored the effect on transmission by reducing absolute antibiotic usage by 10 and 25 respectively.

Therefore we applied mathematical modeling to estimate the effect of reducing antibiotic usage on antibiotic resistance.In this study we used agent-based modeling to explore the potential impact of antibiotic stewardship ie specifically reduced overall antibiotic usage on acquisition rates of MDROs and the proportion of patients who acquired a MDRO during their hospital stay.

In addition among patients not receiving antibiotics acquisition rates increased with the microbiome effect for both high- and low-prevalence MDROs.discussion Antibiotic usage and in particular unnecessary usage of anti- biotics is a major driver of antibiotic resistance.

Individual facilities could adapt the model parameters as needed to form more reasonable esti- mates of local prevalence and transmission levels as well as the effect of reducing antibiotic usage on acquisition rates and other secondary outcomes.In a critical-care setting--where nearly 75 of patients receive antibiotics and up to 50 of antibiotic courses may be considered inappropriate--even a moderate reduction in antibiotic usage is expected to cause a clinically significant reduction of MDRO transmission.

Differences between the 2 groups of patients at a microbiome effect of 1.0 no effect are due to genetic mutation effects.conservative estimates particularly for high-prevalence MDROs ie ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 depending on the level of antibiotic usage.
