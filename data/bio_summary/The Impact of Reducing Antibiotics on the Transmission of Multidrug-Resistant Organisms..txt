we modeled the effect of antibiotic usage as 1 a microbiome effect for which antibiotic usage decreases competing bacteria and increases the mdro transmission probability between patients and hcws and 2 a mutation effect that designates a proportion of patients who receive antibiotics to subsequently develop a mdro via genetic mutation.setting.

from 75 to 50 reduced acquisition rates by 28.3 from 8.56 to 6.14 acquisitions per 1000 patient days p  .001. for low-prevalence mdros absolute reductions in antibiotic usage by 10 and 25 reduced acquisition rates by14.3 p  .001 and 29.8 p  .001 respectively.for the high-prevalence mdros when considering a microbiome effect of 1.1 ie a 10 increase in transmission probability between patients receiving antibiotics and hcws and higher acquisition rates were statistically significantly higher than at baseline ie microbiome effect of 1.0 for all experimental levels of antibiotic usage.

acquisition rates for high- and low- prevalence mdros grow exponentially with increasing microbiome effect and statistically significant benefits of decreased antibiotic usage are observed at microbiome effect levels of  1.2 and higher.figure 3. proportion of patients who acquire each class of multidrug-resistant organism mdro during their stay as a function of the microbiome effect and whether they are receiving antibiotics.

multidrug-resistant organisms mdros are increasingly prevalent and are associated with significant morbidity mortality and costs.the united states centers for disease control and prevention recognizes antibiotic usage as the most important factor driving resistance.antibiotic exposure is known to contribute to resistance it is estimated that the odds of developing a mdro among patients who received antibiotic therapy is 1.8-5.1 times that of patients who did not receive antibiotics.- antibiotics are among the most common drugs prescribed in medicine nearly 50 of all hospitalized patients and 75 of critically ill patients receive an antibiotic during a hospital stay.furthermore up to 50 of those antibiotics prescribed are considered inappropriate.

then we varied the antibiotic usage and micro- biome effect parameters from their respective baseline levels to explore the effect of decreasing overall antibiotic usage on transmission of mdros in the icu.

our goal was to identify the level at which the microbiome effect causes transmission to become statistically significantly higher as well as the level at which an overall reduction in antibiotic usage causes a statis- tically significant decrease in transmission.we also modeled the effect of antibiotic usage in a second manner.

we first explored this effect using a baseline frequency of antibiotic usage of 75 and then explored the effect on transmission by reducing absolute antibiotic usage by 10 and 25 respectively.

therefore we applied mathematical modeling to estimate the effect of reducing antibiotic usage on antibiotic resistance.in this study we used agent-based modeling to explore the potential impact of antibiotic stewardship ie specifically reduced overall antibiotic usage on acquisition rates of mdros and the proportion of patients who acquired a mdro during their hospital stay.

when considering a microbiome effect of 2.0 ie that patients who received antibiotics were twice as likely to acquire or transmit a mdro reducing antibiotic usage by 10 ie from 75 to 65 reduced acquisition rates of high-prevalence mdros by 11.2 from 8.56 to 7.60 acqui- sitions per 1000 patient days p  .001. reducing antibiotic usage by 25 i.e.

in addition among patients not receiving antibiotics acquisition rates increased with the microbiome effect for both high- and low-prevalence mdros.discussion antibiotic usage and in particular unnecessary usage of anti- biotics is a major driver of antibiotic resistance.

individual facilities could adapt the model parameters as needed to form more reasonable esti- mates of local prevalence and transmission levels as well as the effect of reducing antibiotic usage on acquisition rates and other secondary outcomes.in a critical-care setting--where nearly 75 of patients receive antibiotics and up to 50 of antibiotic courses may be considered inappropriate--even a moderate reduction in antibiotic usage is expected to cause a clinically significant reduction of mdro transmission.

differences between the 2 groups of patients at a microbiome effect of 1.0 no effect are due to genetic mutation effects.conservative estimates particularly for high-prevalence mdros ie ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 depending on the level of antibiotic usage.

first the use of the antibiogram does not capture changes in resistance patterns over time in a hospital unit as it usually includes only the first isolate from each patient.second reli- ance on clinical cultures to assess changes in resistance patterns is challenging due to the infrequency of positive clinical cultures therefore few studies include development of anti- microbial resistance based on surveillance cultures as a primary outcome.3 the use of transmission dynamic modeling allows for the estimation of the impact of antimicrobial stewardship via experimentation with relevant parameters.in this model we considered 2 effects of antibiotic usage the microbiome effect and the mutation effect.

in our model we examined microbiome effect over a spectrum and noted that benefits are statistically significant even athigh prevalence mdros10860.100.080.06high prevalence mdros40.0420.0201.01.21.41.61.82.0microbiome effect0.001.01.11.21.31.41.51.61.71.81.92.0microbiome effect2.0low prevalence mdros0.020low prevalence mdros1.50.0151.00.0100.50.0050.01.01.21.41.61.82.0microbiome effect0.0001.01.11.21.31.41.51.61.71.81.92.0microbiome effectfigure 2. prevalence-specific multidrug-resistant organism mdro acquisition rates as a function of microbiome effect and antibiotic usage levels.

in addition we only considered a single category of antibiotic usage which ignores differences in outcomes for patients who receive suboptimal dosing.this simplification limited the number of parameter assumptions required for the model and facilitated more direct experimentation regarding the primary interventional parameter ie antibiotic usage.
