A similar protocol has been proposed whereby a Periodontal Summary Score is derived and used to categorize patients into advanced disease moderate disease and health 18.In the proposed Treat to Target model for the man- agement of periodontitis a periodontal inflammation index could be used to determine patients' pre and post treatment status as i high and unstable disease activity ii lowmoderate disease activity or iii suc- cess or remission.

With focus now directed toward the central role of inflammation and host response in the pathogenesis of periodontitis new prospects arise in the areas of diagnosis treatment and monitoring of treatment outcomes.Periodontal inflammation - new opportunities for diagnosisFrom our current understanding of the importance of inflammation in the development of periodontitis and the critical role that periodontal inflammation plays in contributing to overall systemicFig.

Notwithstanding these limitations the periodontal inflamed surface area assessment has been a useful step forward and is con- sidered to be the best tool currently available for assessment of gingival inflammation 39.Periodontal inflammation - new opportunities for treatmentOpportunities for host modulationRecognizing the importance of modulating the inflammatory response new treatment opportunities arise whereby adjuncts to mechanical debridement focusing on controlling or resolving inflammation are being explored for managing the inflammatoryFig.

In light of our current understanding of the central role inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of periodontitis old con- cepts focused solely on controlling the infection to control the inflammation should be reworked to consider controlling the inflammation to control the infection.AcknowledgmentsResearch Support T.E.

Periodontal inflammation treat to targetHypothetical example of how probing pocket depths periodontal inflamed surface area scores periodontal risk assessment scores and inflammatory cytokine levels such as interleukin-1 in gingival crevicular fluid could be utilized to devise a conglomerate periodontal inflammation index and associated disease activity score.Fig.

However the temporal relationship supporting this has not been demonstrated and it is equally as likely that inflammation initiates the dysbiosis.While these are all interesting proposals they do not fully embrace the overwhelming evidence that although periodontitis is a bacterial disease it is not an infectious disease in the classical sense because it results from a complex interplay between the com- mensal microbiota host response and environmental factors 68.

One important model suggests that there is a need to incorporate gene protein and metabolite data into dynamic biologic networks that include inflammation-mediated disease initiation and disease resolving mechanisms 33.Although periodontal inflammation is initiated by components of the subgingival biofilm it is the pro- duction and release of mediators generated and con- trolled by the host's response to the microorganisms that are primarily if not entirely responsible for the periodontal breakdown 66 67.

In the context of understanding the impor- tance of gingival inflammation as a driver of local tis- sue destruction and a contributor to overall systemic inflammatory burden it is probably irrelevant whether the inflammation is associated with gingivitis or periodontitis.

For example in the case of muco- sal biofilms a confounding issue is the relationship between inflammation and disease and it is stillunclear which comes first the immune response or the change in the integrity of the mucosal biofilm 14.
