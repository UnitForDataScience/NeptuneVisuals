For all genes clustered into eggNOG categories although the most abundant category was function unknown many genes were classified in the categories of functional genes .In the viromes the genes involved in transcription cell wallmembraneenvelope biogenesis and inorganic ion transport and metabolism were included in the top five eggNOG categories for all three samples .

In all panels the red green blue and black boxes represent microbial genes viral genes genes shared by microbe and virus and genes undetected in our work respectively.

The viral DNA or microbial DNA was amplified using the GenomiPhi V2 DNA amplification kit which can amplify whole-genome DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions GE Healthcare Life Science Buckinghamshire UK.

The resulting metagenomic DNA was pyrosequenced using Illumina HiSeq 2000 by Shanghai Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd.For the metagenomic DNA sequencing the DNA was checked on a 1 agarose gel purified using the AxyPrep DNA gel extraction kit Axygen China and quantified with the QuantiFluor-ST fluorescence quantitative system Promega CA USA.

Moreover the genes related to replication recombination and repair and amino acid transport and metabolism were more abundant accounting for 3.07 to 8.29 and 5.3 to 9.13 respectivelyFIG 4 Functional genes of viromes and microbiomes from deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

These results reflected the fact that the viral genes of deep-sea vent viruses might participate in the cell metabolism of their hosts.In the microbiomes similar profiles of microbial functional genes were found in the SWIR-S004 SWIR-S021 and SWIR-S024 samples .

To ensure the reliability of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing the DNA was reextracted from the sedimentTABLE 1 Analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes of deep-sea hydrothermal vent sedimentsalci and hci indicate the lower and higher 95 confidence intervals respectively.sample SWIR-S004 SWIR-S021 or SWIR-S024 using the cetyltrimethylammonium bro- mide CTAB method and then the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted for the second time.

These genes could function in the infection DNA replication assembly and lysis of viruses.

To further confirm the reliability of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing the DNA was reextracted from SWIR-S004 SWIR-S021 or SWIR-S024 followed by the second sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes.

It is reported that 15 double-stranded DNA viruses which putatively infect sulfur-oxidizing bacteria contain auxiliary metabolic genes for a and 3 subunits of reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase .
