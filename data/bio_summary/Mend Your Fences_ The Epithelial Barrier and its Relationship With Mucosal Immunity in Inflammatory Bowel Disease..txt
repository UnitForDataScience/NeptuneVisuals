The connection of cell death and cell shedding is still not fully understood but experimental evidences rather implicate that epithelial cell shedding does not require cell death and that caspase activation is rather a consequence than a cause of the shedding process.

In contrast to canonical Wnt signaling and the gradient of Wnt ligands expression of BMPs increases along the crypt villus axis.Conditional deletion of the type I BMP receptor Bmpr1a in mice resulted in disturbed epithelial homeostasis and regeneration with an increase in stem and progenitor cell populations and has led to the conclusion that BMP signaling is essential to control Wnt signaling and to warrant proper stem cell self-renewal.One of the main decisions that have to be made during intestinal epithelial differentiation is the commitment to either the secretory or absorptive cell lineage.

Several studies on Notch signaling in the gut have given rise to a model of how differentiation into the 2 main lineages is organized if 1 progenitor cell expresses the notch receptor and its neigh- boring cell expresses the Notch ligand Delta1 Notch signaling in this progenitor cell leads to the expression of Notch-responsive genes such as Hes1 and Hes5.

Animal study in mice deficient for the xenobiotic trans- porter mdr1a also supported that alterations in the intes- tinal barrier alone can be sufficient to drive colitis.The authors of that study showed impaired phosphorylation of the TJ proteins occludin and zonula occludens-1 in mdr1a- deficient mice which was associated with spontaneous development of colitis.The complex signaling environment of the intestinal epithelium and the sensitive balance between proliferation and cell shedding provides great potential of disturbances.Physiologic epithelial cell shedding is a process that in- volves rearrangement of TJ proteins to extrude the cell from the epithelium.

The intestinal epithelium constitutes a physical barrier by its structural organization by specialized innate immune cell functions and by a tight regulation of the ratio between proliferation and cell death.

Intestinal stem cells were first identified by several groups in the 1970s after using H3-thymidine to label and track proliferating cell populations.During the last decade especially the group of Hans Clever's elegantly refined stem cell fate mapping by creating a mouse-model to lineage trace a candidate marker for actively dividing crypt base columnar cells which where intermingled with Paneth cells at the crypt base.

These studies ultimately led to the iden- tification of a specific marker for crypt base columnar stem cells the leucine rich repeat containing G-protein coupled receptor-5 Lgr5.Since then several other potential stem cell markers have been identified by in vivo linage tracing or by transgenic fluorescent labelling of cells which areresiding either at the crypt base columnar region or at the 4 position fourth cell position from the crypt base center of the crypt.

Stem cells at the 4 position are located directly above the Paneth cells and have been described as quiescent reserve stem cell populations which are reac- tivated into a stem cell fate under specific physiological conditions such as injury.The constant proliferation at the crypt base is thought to provide the steric force that moves cells up the crypt villus axis.

While migrating upward cells start to differentiate into the various mature IECs of the secretory or absorptive cell type.Intestinal epithelial homeostasis not only depends on the ratio between proliferation and cell death but also the balance between proliferating progenitor cells and differentiating IECs.

These can be considered as master regulators of IEC differentiation and their expression drives the cell toward the absorptive cell fate.
