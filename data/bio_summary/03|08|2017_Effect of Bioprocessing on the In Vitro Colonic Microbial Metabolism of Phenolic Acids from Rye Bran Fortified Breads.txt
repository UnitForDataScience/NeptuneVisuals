Bioprocessingof rye bran was performed and the breads were baked as described by Nordlund et al.Shortly rye bran was first treated with a hydrolytic enzyme mixture of Depol 740L biocatalysts dosing 200 nkatg of bran on the basis of xylanase activity and Grindamyl A 1000 dosing 75 nkatg of bran on the basis of amylase activity at 65 water content in 40 degC for 4 h mixing at 0.5 1 2 3 and 4 h intervals.

The bioprocessed wheat bran bread showed a higher concentration of 3-phenylpropionic acid considered as the end product of the colonic metabolism of FA than native wheat bran bread at the end of the incubation.In a human study the bread fortified with native wheat bran had a larger variety of microbial metabolites in plasma compared to native branindicating the importance of the cereal matrix in delivering substrates for the conversion by colonic microbiota as also suggested by Vitaglione et al.Similar observations were also seen in mice fed with the wheat bran aleurone fraction by Pekkinen et al.The lack of significant differentiating metabolites between the NB and BB fortified breads in this study may be due to the saturation of FA metabolism as a result of its slow release from the remaining fiber matrix which could result in the increased FA levels in both bread types compared to fecal background at the end of incubation.

In addition sourdough fermentation of bran increases the amount of folates and free phenolic acids in breads.Bioprocessing of wheat bran with enzymes and yeast fermentation has also been shown to alterthe kinetics of phenolic acids and their microbial metabolites from wheat bran fortified breads via changes in their in vitro bioaccessibility.

The importance of the intake of cereal DF for health is well-established epidemiological studies have indicated that consumption of whole grain foods shows a consistently decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseasesand the DF complex has been suggested to be an underlying factor in the risk reduction.- Among the phytochemicals of the bran DF complex phenolic acids are mostly covalently bound to the bran matrix.Hydroxycin- namic acids are the most abundant phenolic acids comprising mostly of ferulic acid FA but also of sinapic acid SinA and 4-coumaric acid 4-CA.

Bioprocessing of wheat bran has been used for improvement of the properties of wheat dough and bread containing bran i.e.

Subsequently bioprocessing alters the pharmacokinetic profiles of both phenolic acids and their microbial metabolites in healthy volunteers.Bioprocessing of rye bran also has an impact on the release of phenolic acids in humans as shown by Lappi et al.The main microbial colonic metabolites from native and bioprocessed wheat bran fortified breads in vitro are reported to include 3-3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid dihydrocaffeic acid 3-34-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 3-phenylpro- pionic acid.The anaerobic conversion route of isolated 8- O-4-diferulates and 5-5-diferulates in the human in vitro colon model has been proposed earlier by Braune et al.

investigated the microbial metabolite content focusing on lignans and benzoxazinoids of rye bran soluble extract and its non-extractable residue using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time- of-flight-mass spectrometry UPLC-QTOF-MS metabolo- mics platform and showed that the extract and bran residue differed in their metabolic profiles.Applications of mass spectrometry are widely used in metabolomics.

However the same wheat bread was used as a basis for both bread types and the total phenolic acid content in rye bran is nearly 40 times higher than that in white wheat breadwith similar differences existing for other phytochemical classes as well therefore rye bran can be considered the main contributor to the phytochemical pool investigated in this study.

To prepare the wheat bread with native bran NB or bioprocessed bran BB 35 of the wheat flour was replaced with thebran based on dry matter.

NB bread with native rye bran BB bread with bioprocessed rye bran FC fecal control.
