and principal coordinate analysis analysis  revealed no disease-specific clustering indicating that the groups could not be discriminated based on is profiles using these unsupervised method.discussionin this case-control study we found that measured fecal voc profiles appeared to be discriminating for severe bpd compared with matched controls at postnatal age 14 21and 28 days but not at postnatal day 7. intestinal microbiota composition at day 28 did not differ between severe bpd patients and controls.there is currently only one study that assessed vocs as potential biomarker in preterm infants at risk of developing bpd in this study vocs deriving from tracheal secretions were measured between day 1 and day 8 after birth in preterm infants with n  12 and without n  11 bpd using an enose similar to the device used in the present3.83.63.43.232.82.62.42.221.81.61.41.21all phylafafvproteobateriahowever the exact origin of the detected fecal volatiles in bpd infants remains yet to be elucidated in addition to the volatiles deriving from the respiratory microbiota detected alterations in fecal vocs might also be the result of the systemic inflammatory state characterizing bpd development as vocs may be originating from other body parts detected differences in fecal vocs in the current study may reflect metabolic and pathophysiological bodily processes.

de meij6background the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of fecal volatile organic compounds vocs obtained by means of an electronic nose device cyranose 320 as early non-invasive biomarker for bpd.methods in this nested case-control study performed at three neonatal intensive care units fecal samples obtained at postnatal age of 7 14 21 and 28 days from preterm infants with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd were com- pared with fecal voc profiles from matched controls.

intestinal microbiota did not differ between bpd subjects and controls.conclusion fecal voc profiles of infants developing bpd could be differentiated from controls at postnatal day 14 21 and 28. voc differences could not be directed to intestinal microbiota alterations but presumably reflect local and systemic metabolic and inflammatory pathways associated with bpd.ronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd is the most common adverse outcome in preterm very low birth weight infants o1500 g with an overall incidence of approximately 30 bpd is associated with significant morbidity and mortality prolonged hospital stay and increased financial burden furthermore survivors of bpd commonly suffer from impaired cognitive functions and frequently demonstrate prolonged lung function abnormalities 46. interventions that reduce the incidence of bpd are therefore urgently needed.

second previous studies suggest that vocs originating from one part of the body may be transported by blood circulation before being dissolved at other bodily sites as respiratory microbial community alterations in bpd infants become more apparent in time with increasing firmicutes and decreasing proteobacteria compared with non-bpd infants detectable differences in fecal vocs deriving from the respiratory microbiota may simply not be present at a postnatal age of 7 days.

moreover as all included infants both cases and controls received antibiotics directly after birth for a minimum of 3 days this may have influenced pulmonary microbiota composition causing fecal voc profiles originating from respiratory microbiota to be non-discriminative at postnatal age of 7 days.tion we analyzed the intestinal microbiome of all infants at day 28 of life.

fecal vocs are an interesting alternative for exhaled vocs especially because animal and adult human studies have demonstrated the existence of vital cross-talks between different mucosal sites of the body including a bidirectional interaction between gut and lungs the so-called gut-lung axis consequently fecal vocs might be a promising candidate for identifying preterm infants at risk of developing bpd.

the control group was selected from the remaining infants after exclusion of infants with mild or moderate bpd in addition to standard demographic data information about mechanical ventilation supplementary oxygen requirement postnatal infection sepsis medication use and feeding pattern was prospectively collected for each included infant.

another limitation is that bpd infants with a history of necrotizing enterocolitis andor pneumonia were excluded although these infants have an increased risk for developing bpd.

therefore the aim of the current study was to assess whether infants developing severe bpd could be discriminated from controls by fecal voc profiles at different consecutive postnatal time points.

diversity was calculated both per phylum and for overall microbial composition by pooling the phyla fafv bacteroidetes and proteobacteria together.resultspatient populationin total fecal samples were collected from 286 infants and consequently were eligible to participate in this study.

we did so to minimize the risk of false-positive voc profile outcomes infants with necrotizing enterocolitis are characterized by a significantly distinct fecal voc profile compared with controls .

detection of sepsis in preterm infants by fecal volatile organic compounds analysis a proof of principle study.

each fecal sample from an infant diagnosed with severe bpd at 36 weeks pma was strictly matched to one fecal sample of a control subject.
