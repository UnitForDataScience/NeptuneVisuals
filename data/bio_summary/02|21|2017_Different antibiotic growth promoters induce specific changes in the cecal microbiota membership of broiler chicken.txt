the role that the intestinal microbiota plays in this process has been dem- onstrated  and further studies should focus on gut microbiota manipulation in order to improve productivity and animal health.the results of this study add new insights to the current knowledge on how agps affect the cecal microbiota of chicken.conclusionsthe use of several antimicrobials at growth promotion doses caused significant changes in the cecal microbial membership of broiler chicken but not in microbial structure suggesting that those drugs have a stronger impact on the rare species of bacteria present in that environment.supporting informations1 table.

this study used high throughput sequencing to char- acterize the impact of several antimicrobials in broiler chicken under controlled conditions and add new insights to the current knowledge on how agps affect the cecal microbiota of chicken.introductionantibiotic growth promoters agps have been widely used to improve performance of food animals.

antimicrobials are given to broiler chicken in order to control diseases such as necrotic enteritis caused by clostridium perfringens and also to promote faster growth and improve conversion rates -.

there- fore a better characterization of how agps impact the cecal microbiota of chickens could be the keystone for the development of alternative methods to improve growth efficacy in this species .the effects of agps on the chicken microbiota have recently been investigated .however since several factors can impact the intestinal microbiota comparison between stud- ies is difficult and in order to adequately compare the effect of different drugs molecules it is essential to secure that experimental conditions are rigorously controlled.

to date most stud- ies using high throughput sequencing have compared a limited number of drugs with special emphasis given to virginiamycin and bacitracin -.this study was designed to test the hypothesis that different antimicrobial drugs would dif- ferentially affect the cecal microbiota of broiler chicken.materials and methodsstudy designthis study was approved by the university of londrina's animal care and use committee process number 10482014.57.six hundred and twenty four 2 day-old chicks cobb 500 arriving to the poultry farm of the experimental unit of the londrina university londrina parana' state brazil were allo- cated into cages of 1.45 x 1.45 m 26 animals per cage.
