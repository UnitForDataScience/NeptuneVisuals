The role that the intestinal microbiota plays in this process has been dem- onstrated  and further studies should focus on gut microbiota manipulation in order to improve productivity and animal health.The results of this study add new insights to the current knowledge on how AGPs affect the cecal microbiota of chicken.ConclusionsThe use of several antimicrobials at growth promotion doses caused significant changes in the cecal microbial membership of broiler chicken but not in microbial structure suggesting that those drugs have a stronger impact on the rare species of bacteria present in that environment.Supporting informationS1 Table.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of zinc bacitracin 55gton enramy- cin 10gton halquinolr 30gton virginiamycin 165gton and avilamycin 10gton on the cecal microbiota of broiler chicken compared to a control group.

This study used high throughput sequencing to char- acterize the impact of several antimicrobials in broiler chicken under controlled conditions and add new insights to the current knowledge on how AGPs affect the cecal microbiota of chicken.IntroductionAntibiotic growth promoters AGPs have been widely used to improve performance of food animals.

The use of antimicrobials induced significant changes in membership but not in structure of the cecal microbiota compared to the control group sug- gesting a greater impact on the less abundant species of bacteria present in that environ- ment.

Antimicrobials are given to broiler chicken in order to control diseases such as necrotic enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens and also to promote faster growth and improve conversion rates -.
