These thresholds produced a list of 112 candidate mucus-specific fitness genes 171glucose-specific fitness genes and 28 genes that appeared to be important for ExPEC growth in both types of media Data Set S1.Several genes of note were found to be fitness candidates in both the mucus and glucose broth likely due to their essentiality for microaerobiosis a feature that both growth conditions had in common.

Consequently it is feasible that some of the fitness genes that were highlighted by the Tn-seq experiment also contribute to ExPEC fitness within the genitourinary tract.One of the primary goals of our Tn-seq screen was to identify genes that are important for ExPEC colonization of the gut by first defining loci that are critical for ExPEC growth in mucus.

Though the fluctuating fitness levels of competing strains due to spontaneous secondary mutations may obscure subtle mutant defects our gut colo- nization model has proven useful for identifying mutants with more robust phenotypes that may arguably be of greater relevance for understanding ExPEC fitness within the intestinal tract  .Cumulatively our data indicate that ExPEC growth in mucus involves many gene products that are directly or indirectly associated with fatty acid degradation but these genes are not necessarily critical for ExPEC colonization of the gut.

Our Tn-seq screen highlighted 112 mucus-specific candidate fitness genes along with 171 glucose-specific candidate fitness genes and 28 genes that seemed to promote ExPEC growth and survival in both types of broth  see also Data Set S1 in the supplemental material.

Many of these mucus-specific fitness genes are linked with the metabolism of fatty acids and one gene which encodes the rhomboid protease GlpG was found to promote ExPEC survival within the mouse intestinal tract in the presence of the intact natural microbiota.RESULTSA Tn-seq screen for ExPEC genes that are important for growth on intestinal mucus uncovers a role for beta-oxidation.

Five other genes encoding NDH-1 components nuoC nuoI nuoJ nuoM and nuoN were candidate fitness genes in glucose broth but few or no transposon insertions within these genes were detected following growth in the mucus broth making it difficult to assess their importance in that medium.

The DfadL Dfbp and DglpG mutants grew similarly to the WT strain when their respective genes or operons were restored on a plasmid  further solidifying the roles of these genes in promoting F11 growth in mucus broth.Disruptions to the beta-oxidation pathway lead to reduced growth on minimal medium plates supplemented with the LCFA oleate .

Multiple genes that contribute to ExPEC fitness in mucus broth were identified with genes that are directly or indirectly associated with fatty acid beta- oxidation pathways being especially important.

A better understanding of GlpG and other bacterial factors that promote ExPEC growth and survival in the gut will provide a broader view of the ExPEC life cycle and may aid the development of new approaches to target ExPEC before it can disseminate into extraintestinal niches.MATERIALS AND METHODSCreation of bacterial strains and plasmids.

The fitness scores for all of the insertion sites in a given gene across the three replicates were used to calculate a median fitness score which was designated the fitness score for that gene Data Set S1.
