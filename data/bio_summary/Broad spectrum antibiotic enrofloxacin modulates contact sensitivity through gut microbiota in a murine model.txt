transfer of antibiotic-modified gut microbiota inhibits cs but this response can be restored through oral transfer of control gut bacteria to antibiotic-treated animals.conclusions oral treatment with a broad spectrum antibiotic modifies gut microbiota composition and promotes anti- inflammatory response suggesting that manipulation of gut microbiota can be a powerful tool to modulate the course of cs.

the mice that received gut bacteria from antibiotic-treated donors showed decreased cs after tnp-cl sensitization  b group c vs b whereas there was no effect on cs response when the naive recipients were given gut mi- crobes from non-antibiotic-treated donors  b group d vs b. furthermore the suppressed cs response seen in antibiotic- treated mice was reversed by oral transfer of gut microbes from non-antibiotic-treated mice  c group e vs c and d whereas gavage of naive mice with gut flora from non-antibiotic-treated control animals did not affect cs  cshown that microbiota play a crucial role in fostering the development of numerous t-cell subsets including th17 and treg lymphocytes.

we found that the percentage of both tcr ab1cd41cd251foxp31 regulatory t treg and cd191b2201 cd51il-101 regulatory b breg cells in pp were increased in mice orally treated with antibiotic followed by tnp-cl sensitiza- tion when compared with hapten-sensitized mice that had notbeen treated with antibiotic  a group d vs b. moreover we observed nonsignificant increase of tcr ab1cd41cd251 foxp31 treg cells in pp in mice treated with antibiotic without hapten sensitization compared with the antibiotic-untreated mice  a group c vs a. fluorescence-activated cell sorting facs analysis of mln showed that antibiotic treatment and hapten sensitization increased the frequency of both tcr ab1cd41cd251foxp31 treg and tcr ab1cd41il-101 tr1cells when compared with antibiotic-untreated hapten-sensitized mice  b group d vs b. interestingly we also found an increased frequency of tcr gd1 il-101 lymphocytes in aln and spl of antibiotic-treated hapten-sensitized mice compared with the animals with hapten sensitization in the absence of anti- biotic treatment  c and d group d vs b.adoptive transfer of purified regulatory cell popula- tions inhibits cs in vivo.

metagenome sequence analyses of the gut microbiome from patients with ad showed that enrichment of a subspecies of the major species of gut bacteria faecalibacte- rium prausnitzii is strongly associated with ad.it has been re- vealed that operational taxonomic units belonging to f prausnitziifig 7. transfer of gut flora modulates cs response in vivo.

it has become increasingly clear that less exposure to microbiota early in life may contribute to the observed rise in ''immune-mediated'' diseases including autoimmunity and allergy.objective we sought to test whether the change of gut microbiota with the broad spectrum antibiotic enrofloxacin will modulate contact sensitivity cs in mice.methods natural gut microbiota were modified by oral treatment with enrofloxacin prior to sensitization with trinitrophenyl chloride followed by cs testing.

a study in a group of healthy human volunteers showed that treatment with ciprofloxacin for 5 days decreases diversity richness and evenness of fecal microbiota during antibiotic treatment.although the microbiota mostly returned to pretreatment composition following ciprofloxacin treatment several bacterial taxa failed to recover indicating that changes to the microbiota can persist following a short course of oral an- tibiotics.similar to human studies mouse models have revealed that treatment with ampicillin cefoperazone vancomycin or clindamycin causes long-lasting changes in the gut microbiota that persist after cessation of antibiotic treatment.it has become increasingly clear that less exposure to micro- biota early in life may contribute to the observed rise in the diseases characterized by immune dysregulation including allergy autoimmunity metabolic disorders and even neoplastic diseases.a number of studies have demonstrated the increasedrisk of developing asthma and food allergy in children who have been exposed to antibiotics in the first year of life.similar findings are also observed in animal studies such as in the non- obese-diabetic mouse which is known to be very sensitive to the change of the environment such that a cleaner environment enhances the rate of onset and incidence of type 1 diabetes.

among the tested species the relative abundance of enterococcus spp and lacto- bacillus were similar between untreated and antibiotic-treated mice  a group b vs a whereas antibiotic treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of clostridium coccoides cluster xiva and c coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster xivab compared with untreated mice  b group b vs a. antibiotic treatment also increased the relative abun- dance of bacteroidetes and bifidobacterium spp compared with untreated mice  c group b vs a. in contrast anti- biotic treatment significantly decreased the relative abundance of segmented filamentous bacteria sfb compared with the control mice  d group b vs a.direct transfer of gut flora modulates cs response in vivo.

transfer of axillary and inguinal lymph node cells alncs and splcs isolated from tnp-cl sensitized donors that were orally treated with enroflox- acin to naive mice significantly reduced cs when compared with positive control alnc and splc from hapten-sensitized mice not treated with antibiotic  e group c vs b. additionally oral treatment with antibiotic prior to cs induction and elicitation increased production of tnp-specific igg1 antibodies but reduced synthesis of anti-tnp igg2a antibodies  f group c vs b. the ear swelling data were confirmed in further experi- ments showing that oral treatment with enrofloxacin prior to tnp- cl sensitization results in decreased vascular permeability  a and lower ear weight  b. additionally oral appli- cation of enrofloxacin before induction of cs resulted in reduced mpo activity as well as decreased ifn-g concentration in ear ex- tracts  c and d.oral treatment with antibiotic induces cells that inhibit cs in vivo.

increasing evidence suggests that gut microbes which represent an enormous source of interaction between microbes and immu- nity play a very important role in various health problems.how- ever it is not clear what effects are exerted by natural gut microbiota on the course of cs responses.

recent studies indicate that some gut bacteria can promote anti-inflammatory re- sponses whereas others can induce inflammatory reactions.to test whether the observed downregulated cs response in antibiotic-treated mice is the result of dysbiosis we evaluated the composition of some common gut microbiota using rt-pcr.

the involvement of microbiota in the development of autoimmunity and other immune-mediated diseases has also been revealed by observing the effect of removing some gut bacteria with antibiotics.it has been shown that adult mice treated with broad spectrum anti- biotics develop ameliorated forms of animal models of th17- mediated psoriasisand t 1-mediated eaebut show no ef- fects in t 2-mediated allergic responses.on the other hand broad spectrum antibiotics administrated early in life increasesusceptibility to t 17-mediated psoriasisand to t 2-mediatedhhgroup f vs b.discussionthere is mounting evidence that the homeostasis of the gut microbiome is important for the balance and regulation of the immune system in both animals and humans.

finally we show that the anti-inflammatory effect mediated by altered gut microbiota can be reversed by introducing normal gut micro- biota.

more importantly we show that the cs response can be restored through oral transfer of control gut bacteria to antibiotic-treated animals suggesting that changes in the gut flora can revert to a natural homeostatic state through oral transfer.
