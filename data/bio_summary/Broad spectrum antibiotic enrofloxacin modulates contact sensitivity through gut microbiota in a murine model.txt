Transfer of antibiotic-modified gut microbiota inhibits CS but this response can be restored through oral transfer of control gut bacteria to antibiotic-treated animals.Conclusions Oral treatment with a broad spectrum antibiotic modifies gut microbiota composition and promotes anti- inflammatory response suggesting that manipulation of gut microbiota can be a powerful tool to modulate the course of CS.

It has become increasingly clear that less exposure to microbiota early in life may contribute to the observed rise in ''immune-mediated'' diseases including autoimmunity and allergy.Objective We sought to test whether the change of gut microbiota with the broad spectrum antibiotic enrofloxacin will modulate contact sensitivity CS in mice.Methods Natural gut microbiota were modified by oral treatment with enrofloxacin prior to sensitization with trinitrophenyl chloride followed by CS testing.

A study in a group of healthy human volunteers showed that treatment with ciprofloxacin for 5 days decreases diversity richness and evenness of fecal microbiota during antibiotic treatment.Although the microbiota mostly returned to pretreatment composition following ciprofloxacin treatment several bacterial taxa failed to recover indicating that changes to the microbiota can persist following a short course of oral an- tibiotics.Similar to human studies mouse models have revealed that treatment with ampicillin cefoperazone vancomycin or clindamycin causes long-lasting changes in the gut microbiota that persist after cessation of antibiotic treatment.It has become increasingly clear that less exposure to micro- biota early in life may contribute to the observed rise in the diseases characterized by immune dysregulation including allergy autoimmunity metabolic disorders and even neoplastic diseases.A number of studies have demonstrated the increasedrisk of developing asthma and food allergy in children who have been exposed to antibiotics in the first year of life.Similar findings are also observed in animal studies such as in the non- obese-diabetic mouse which is known to be very sensitive to the change of the environment such that a cleaner environment enhances the rate of onset and incidence of type 1 diabetes.

Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbes which represent an enormous source of interaction between microbes and immu- nity play a very important role in various health problems.How- ever it is not clear what effects are exerted by natural gut microbiota on the course of CS responses.

Recent studies indicate that some gut bacteria can promote anti-inflammatory re- sponses whereas others can induce inflammatory reactions.To test whether the observed downregulated CS response in antibiotic-treated mice is the result of dysbiosis we evaluated the composition of some common gut microbiota using RT-PCR.

The mice that received gut bacteria from antibiotic-treated donors showed decreased CS after TNP-Cl sensitization  B Group C vs B whereas there was no effect on CS response when the naive recipients were given gut mi- crobes from non-antibiotic-treated donors  B Group D vs B.

Furthermore the suppressed CS response seen in antibiotic- treated mice was reversed by oral transfer of gut microbes from non-antibiotic-treated mice  C Group E vs C and D whereas gavage of naive mice with gut flora from non-antibiotic-treated control animals did not affect CS  Cshown that microbiota play a crucial role in fostering the development of numerous T-cell subsets including TH17 and Treg lymphocytes.

The involvement of microbiota in the development of autoimmunity and other immune-mediated diseases has also been revealed by observing the effect of removing some gut bacteria with antibiotics.It has been shown that adult mice treated with broad spectrum anti- biotics develop ameliorated forms of animal models of TH17- mediated psoriasisand T 1-mediated EAEbut show no ef- fects in T 2-mediated allergic responses.On the other hand broad spectrum antibiotics administrated early in life increasesusceptibility to T 17-mediated psoriasisand to T 2-mediatedHHGroup F vs B.DISCUSSIONThere is mounting evidence that the homeostasis of the gut microbiome is important for the balance and regulation of the immune system in both animals and humans.

Metagenome sequence analyses of the gut microbiome from patients with AD showed that enrichment of a subspecies of the major species of gut bacteria Faecalibacte- rium prausnitzii is strongly associated with AD.It has been re- vealed that operational taxonomic units belonging to F prausnitziiFIG 7.

Finally we show that the anti-inflammatory effect mediated by altered gut microbiota can be reversed by introducing normal gut micro- biota.
