the degree of phosphorylation of the kinase akt a distal effectorof insulin signalling was found to be significantly lower in both the liver and v-wat of fructose-fed rats while antibiotic treatment reversed this effect partly in liver and fully in v-wat  .ileum liver and v-wat inflammationquantification of occludin in the ileum revealed a significant fructose-induced decrease in this tight- junction protein which was not evident in antibio- tic-treated rats .

antibiotic treat- ment partly reversed the increase in insulin response during glucose load  and in the hepatic insulin resistance index found in fructose-fed rats .significantly higher fasting values of plasma glucose and insulin  as well as higher homa index values  were found in fructose-fed rats compared to controls at the end of the treatment.glucose and insulin  response during the first 30 min following the glucose load were signifi- cantly higher in fructose-fed rats compared to controls.

the metabolic derangement in glucose homeostasis was linked to the gut micro- biota since in antibiotic-treated rats the hyperinsuli- naemia and the increase in hepatic insulin resistance index found after 4 weeks of treatment were both significantly blunted and the hyperglycaemic condi- tion found after 8 weeks of treatment was completely prevented.fructose intake negatively affects liver function since absorbed monosaccharides are first sent to the liver via portal blood and up to 90 of ingested fructose is metabolized in the liver .

metagenomic analysis of gut micro- biota was carried out in the search for a correlation between changes in selected bacteria and altered hepa- tic metabolism.the results clearly indicate that when modulation of gut microbiota by dietary fructose is overcome by antibiotic administration inflammatory flow from the gut to the liver and v-wat together with insulin resistance in the liver and v-wat as well as hepatic mitochondrial derangement can be reversed.methodsanimals and treatmentsmale sprague-dawley rats charles river calco lecco italy about 100 days old were caged singly in a temperature-controlled room 23 - 1degc with a 12 h lightdark cycle 06.30-18.30 h. treatment housing and killing of animals met the guidelines set by the italian health ministry.

in addition in rats fed a high-fat diet it has been found that clostridiaceae abundance correlated with plasma insulin levels 50. thus notwithstanding the differences in the animal model and dietary regimen used to elicit signs of the metabolic syndrome the above members of the gut microbiota appear to play a relevant role in the induction of metabolic syndrome and related liver disease.taken together our data show that a fructose-richdiet promotes alterations in the gut microbiota profile associated with inflammation and metabolic dysregula- tion in the gut liver and v-wat .

however within this family the representativeness of the clostridium genus was differ- ent since it was reduced by the fructose-rich diet and restored to control levels by the antibiotic treatment .discussionin this study we show that inflammation in the gut- liver-v-wat axis with defective insulin signalling and ceramide accumulation in the liver elicited by dietary fructose can be reversed by modulation of the gut microbiota.

all of the above derangements are corrected when a fructose-rich diet is given to rats concomitantly with antibiotics thus strongly suggest- ing that when alteration of the gut microbiota by a high-fructose diet is prevented liver function is maintained.analysis of the caecal microbiota allowed us to iden- tify at least four possible candidates involved in the metabolic link between a fructose-rich diet and hepatic derangement.

then glucose 2 gkg body weight was injected intraperitoneally plasma glucose and insulin were measured after 15 and 30 min and the area under the curve auc for both parameters was calculated c together with the hepatic insulin resistance index d. insulin sensitivity was also measured in the liver and visceral white adipose tissue v-wat by determination of the p-aktakt ratio e f with representative western blots.

energy intake and faecal energy loss were similar in the four groups of rats while energy and lipid gain were significantly higher in fructose-fed rats than in con- trols with no effect of antibiotic treatment .glucose homeostasisafter 4 weeks of treatment fructose-fed rats exhibited significantly higher values of fasting plasma insulin  and homa index  compared to control rats while antibiotic treatment partly reversed these increases  .
