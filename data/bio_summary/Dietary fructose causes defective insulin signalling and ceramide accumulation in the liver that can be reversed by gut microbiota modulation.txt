Finally a significant increase in hepatic levels of ceramide and TBARS was evident in fructose-fed rats and antibiotic treatment reversed this effect while no variation due to diet or antibiotic treatment was found in hepatic pro- tein expression of SPT the first and rate-limiting enzyme in ceramide synthesis  SPTactin ratio0.77 - 0.02 in control rats 0.85 - 0.03 in fructose-fed rats 0.80 - 0.05 in control  antibiotic rats 0.90 - 0.04 in fructose-fed  antibiotic rats.Respiratory capacities ADPO ratio and degree of coupling in isolated liver mitochondriaMitochondrial efficiency was assessed by measuring the ADPO ratio and degree of coupling  and both parameters were found to be significantly higher in fructose-fed rats compared to controls while anti- biotic treatment reversed the effect of the fructose-richFigure 3.

Antibiotic treat- ment partly reversed the increase in insulin response during glucose load  and in the hepatic insulin resistance index found in fructose-fed rats .Significantly higher fasting values of plasma glucose and insulin  as well as higher HOMA index values  were found in fructose-fed rats compared to controls at the end of the treatment.Glucose and insulin  response during the first 30 min following the glucose load were signifi- cantly higher in fructose-fed rats compared to controls.

Energy intake and faecal energy loss were similar in the four groups of rats while energy and lipid gain were significantly higher in fructose-fed rats than in con- trols with no effect of antibiotic treatment .Glucose homeostasisAfter 4 weeks of treatment fructose-fed rats exhibited significantly higher values of fasting plasma insulin  and HOMA index  compared to control rats while antibiotic treatment partly reversed these increases  .

All of the above derangements are corrected when a fructose-rich diet is given to rats concomitantly with antibiotics thus strongly suggest- ing that when alteration of the gut microbiota by a high-fructose diet is prevented liver function is maintained.Analysis of the caecal microbiota allowed us to iden- tify at least four possible candidates involved in the metabolic link between a fructose-rich diet and hepatic derangement.

A significant increase in oxidative damage to mitochondrial lipids and proteins together with a significant decrease in the activity of the antioxidant enzyme SOD was evident in fructose-fed rats while antibiotic treatment reversed all of these effects .Caecal microbiotaWe have recently reported that a fructose-rich diet caused significant changes in the microbial composi- tion of the caecum compared to the control group and that antibiotic treatment caused a general reduction in microbial diversity .
