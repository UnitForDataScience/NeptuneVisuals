in our study various members of desulfobacterales were found in the four samples suggesting a possible participation of these bacteria in sulfate reduction associated with anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbon in the sediments as reported previously .given the detection of toc and ts in the sediments of our study the existence of sulfur-oxi- dizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the microbial communities indicated potential contri- butions of these microbes to sulfur compounds andor organic matter utilization and sulfur and carbon cycles.

it is possible that hydrogen as an energy source may be utilized by microbes in these sediments and that this process is coupled to various metabolic pro- cesses including sulfur oxidation sulfate reduction and methane metabolism as observed in the vent plumes and chimneys from guaymas basin eastern lau spreading center and southwest indian ridge .conclusionsin this study we conducted the first investigation on microbial diversity and potential meta- bolic profiles of the microbial communities inhabiting the sediments of the hydrothermal fields in pacmanus and desmos.

however nothing is known about the microbial populations in the sediments from pacmanus and desmos hydro- thermal fields.the primary goal of the present study was to investigate the composition diversity and metabolism of the microbial communities inhabiting the sediments located at different regions in pacmanus and desmos hydrothermal fields.

the richness of aoa and sob hinted that ammonia and reduced sulfur compounds were potential energy sources fueling the microbial communities in these habitats.metabolic profile-i carbon metabolismthe metabolic profiles of the four samples were comparatively analyzed based on metage- nomic sequencing.

bacterial sulfur cycling shapes microbial communities in surface sediments of an ultramafic hydrothermal vent field.

in this study illumina-based sequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons and metagenomic analysis were conducted to investigate the microbial populations and metabolic profiles in the sediments from four different regions in pacmanus and desmos hydrothermal fields.

there possibly exist different primary sulfur components in the sediments of desmos and pacmanus as supported by the previous reports that pacmanus hydrothermal deposits have polymetallic type of sulfide minerals while desmos hydrothermal deposits contain abundant native sulfur .desulfobacterales has been demonstrated as the dominant and active sfatrb in the elkhorn slough mat .

the taxonomic distribution of otus indicated that proteobacteria and thau- marchaeota were the most abundant bacterial phylum and archaeal phylum respectively.thaumarchaeota was relatively more abundant in the microbial communities of pacmanus than in the microbial communities of desmos suggesting a possibly more important role of these archea in ammonia oxidization in the sediment of pacmanus hydrothermal field.

at the genus level for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria sob sulfurovum was most abundant in the fourcomposition of the microbial communities in the four samples.

c heat map of the microbial compositions of the four samples at genus level drawn based on top 35 abundant genera.

comparative analysis indicated that sob dominated in all samples with relative abundance ranging from 4.6 to 7.8 while the abun- dances of sfurrb and sfatrb ranged from 0.02 to 0.88 and 0.08 to 0.26 respectively.metabolic profiles of the microbial communities based on metagenomic analysisusing an illumina hiseq platform we obtained 52.9 g metagenomic raw reads 13.2 g per sample from the four samples.

these results indicated a diversity of microorganisms responsible for utilization of ammonia and nitrate in the deep-sea sedi- ments of pacmanus and desmos.sulfur metabolismbacterial sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation pathways were identified in the microbial com- munities of our study.

the reduced sulfur compounds in the sed- iments of pacmanus and desmos were likely oxidized to sulfate by rdsr via bacterial reverse sulfate reduction pathway which is known to be present in the microbial communities of vent chimneys .
