The autotrophic prokaryotes in the four communities probably fixed CO2 via four major path- ways i.e.

The relative abundances of the gene in the four samples are shown in the nearby color bar in which the four segments from left to right represent PR1 PR4 DR7 and DR11.

In this study Illumina-based sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and metagenomic analysis were conducted to investigate the microbial populations and metabolic profiles in the sediments from four different regions in Pacmanus and Desmos hydrothermal fields.

The Pacmanus field in Pual Ridge was discovered in 1991 which consists of five discrete high-tem- perature hydrothermal sites Roger's Ruins Roman Ruins Satanic Mills Tsukushi and Fen- way a low-temperature diffuse vent site Snowcap and four new vent sites Mimosa Solwara 6 7 and 8 -.

The chemical compositions of the four samples are summarized in .

The con- tents of TOC and TN were similar in the four sediments while the content of TS was approxi- mately 3 to 8 folds higher in DR7 0.205 and DR11 0.282 than in PR1 0.036 and PR4 0.069.

Aluminum was the most abundant metal ion ranging from 62510 mgg to 75430mgg in the four samples while cobalt was the least abundant ranging from 19.5 mgg to 30 mgg.

A total of 186041 high-quality reads effective tags from the four samples were used for further analysis.

There was no clear difference in Chao1 richness or Shannon diversity among the four samples .Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum relative abundance ranging from 38.7 to 55.8 in all samples and Thaumarchaeota was the dominant archaeal phylum .The abundances of Thaumarchaeota were 38.0 16.2 6.5 and 5.6 in PR1 PR4 DR11 and DR7 respectively.
