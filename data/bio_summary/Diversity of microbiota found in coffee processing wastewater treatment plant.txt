it is estimated that 16.6 billion l of wastewater were generated in 2016 according to international coffee organization ico ico .wastewater from semi-dry coffee processing wrcp is rich in organic matter cellulose hemicellulose pectin sucrose monosaccharides lipids proteins polyphenols and vitamins which is released during coffee pulping and mucilage removal thereby generating high levels 45 kg ton of coffee beans of chemical oxygen demand cod 3.4-50000 mg l- 1 biochemical oxygen demand bod 1.8-20000 mg l- 1 and ph 4.0 in the final wastewater matos et al.

the variation in the values of these parameters is due to the differences in the form of processing and maturation period of the coffee beans the variety of coffee processed and even the coffee growing region.

arabica coffee is usually processed by these methods and accounts for approx- imately 62 of the world coffee market which implies that most of the wastewater generated is from the production of quality coffees itc  mussatto et al.

all of these characteristics particularly in high concentrations classify coffee processing wastewater as highly pollutant.due to the physical chemical composition and large vol- ume of residual waste from coffee processing rwcp it is necessary to have treatment for disposal in the environ- ment or reuse so as to comply with environmental legis- lation as conama resolution 4312011 matos and lo monaco .

the similarity of microbial species with the profile of microorganisms observed during coffee fermentation allowed them to infer that at least part of the microorganisms involved in the rwcp are from coffee cherries and naturally present during the processing.

researches on the microbiota associated with coffee waste- water and their potential for the purification of pollutants are scarce and usually focused on anaerobic treatment processes fia et al.

studies of this nature are innovative and aid to maintain sustainability in production processes in coffee farms ico .
