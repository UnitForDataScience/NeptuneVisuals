It is estimated that 16.6 billion L of wastewater were generated in 2016 according to International Coffee Organization ICO ICO .Wastewater from semi-dry coffee processing WRCP is rich in organic matter cellulose hemicellulose pectin sucrose monosaccharides lipids proteins polyphenols and vitamins which is released during coffee pulping and mucilage removal thereby generating high levels 45 kg ton of coffee beans of chemical oxygen demand COD 3.4-50000 mg L- 1 biochemical oxygen demand BOD 1.8-20000 mg L- 1 and pH 4.0 in the final wastewater Matos et al.

The variation in the values of these parameters is due to the differences in the form of processing and maturation period of the coffee beans the variety of coffee processed and even the coffee growing region.

.ResultsPhysicochemical composition of wastewater from coffee processingThe analysis of chemical physical parameters allowed the characterization of coffee wastewater and the identification and quantification of different compounds with nutrients and metals Table .High BOD 6500 mg L- 1 and COD 13232 mg L- 1values were found in addition to expressive amountsTable 1 Physicochemical parameters analyzed in wastewater from coffee processingof dissolved and total solids 5173 and 7077 mg L- 1.

World J Microbiol Biotechnol 2017 33211 DOI 10.1007s11274-017-2372-9Diversity of microbiota found in coffee processing wastewater treatment plantJosiane Ferreira Pires1  Larissa de Souza Cardoso1  Rosane Freitas Schwan1  Cristina Ferreira Silva1Received 10 June 2017  Accepted 20 October 2017  Published online 13 November 2017c Springer ScienceBusiness Media B.V. 2017Abstract Cultivable microbiota presents in a coffee semi- dry processing wastewater treatment plant WTP was identified.

Arabica coffee is usually processed by these methods and accounts for approx- imately 62 of the world coffee market which implies that most of the wastewater generated is from the production of quality coffees ITC  Mussatto et al.

All of these characteristics particularly in high concentrations classify coffee processing wastewater as highly pollutant.Due to the physical chemical composition and large vol- ume of residual waste from coffee processing RWCP it is necessary to have treatment for disposal in the environ- ment or reuse so as to comply with environmental legis- lation as CONAMA resolution 4312011 Matos and Lo Monaco .

1 Sampling points of residual waste from coffee processing RWCP at the cof-fee producing farm wastewater treatment plant WTP washer output a pond 1 b pond2 c pond 3 d and treatedeffluent ein the treatment plant is constant and there is processing of coffee beans of different varieties.At the time of sampling the spontaneous biological treat- ment of RWCP followed the procedures already established and standardized in the WTP.

The similarity of microbial species with the profile of microorganisms observed during coffee fermentation allowed them to infer that at least part of the microorganisms involved in the RWCP are from coffee cherries and naturally present during the processing.
