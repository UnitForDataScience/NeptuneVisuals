In the present study we investigated the effects of kestose on an AD mouse model to identify the mechanism responsible for the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and mucosal immunity.Materials and methodsMiceFemale BALBc mice weighing 16-20 g 4-week old were purchased from Orient Bio Orient Bio Inc. Seongnam Korea and treated in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC at Asan Medical Center and Ulsan University College of Medicine.Development of AD and administration of kestose in miceIn the AD model OVA sensitization was performed as previously described with few modifications .

In addition TEWL and clinical scores were significantly suppressed by the administration of 5 and 10 kestose treat- ments compared to those by the administration of OVA only b c however there were no significantly different effects on these parameters between the two kestose concentrations.These findings indicate that kestose could suppress skin inflammation thereby improving skin barrier function and clinical symptoms at appropriate concentrations in the AD mouse model.Kestose significantly suppressed systemic immune response and skin Th2 cytokines in the AD mouse modelSerum IgE levels were significantly suppressed by kestose as well as FOS a. Kestose 1 5 10 and FOS 5 administration compared with only OVA administration also suppressed skin Th2-related cytokines TSLP and IL-4 bFig.

All concentrations of kestose worked beneficially and there were no differences in efficacy among concentrations.These findings indicate that allergic systemic response and skin Th2-related inflammation could be suppressed by kestose in the AD mouse model.Kestose significantly increased mesenteric CD4Foxp3Treg cells in the AD mouse modelThe population of CD4Foxp3Treg cells was significantly increased in MLNs and skin lymph nodes by kestose 1 10Fig.

In addition the ability could not correlate with concentration of kestose in the AD mouse model.Kestose significantly increased acetate concentrations in feces in the AD mouse modelConcentrations of SCFA in feces showed increasing tendencies in the 1 kestose treatment compared with those in only OVA treatment .

Particularly for acetate concentrations there was a significant difference between the 1 kestose treatment and the OVA treatment P  0.05 a.This finding suggests that kestose stimulated intestinal micro- biota to generate SCFAs particularly acetate in the AD mouse model.DiscussionThe present study showed that kestose as prebiotics improved clinical signs and Th2- related skin inflammation with systemic allergic suppression in an AD mouse model.

This is the first study described the potential use of kestose as an alternative food ingredient for AD management using AD mouse model.FOS is a well-commercialized and researched prebiotic and several beneficial properties have been reported .

Fructooligosaccharide FOS prebiotics have been reported as activators of the gut microbiota.Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kestose the smallest FOS and FOS on atopic dermatitis in mice.Methods An AD mouse model was developed by ovalbumin epidermal sensitization using BALBc mice.

Results In comparison with the values observed for the control AD mice transepidermal water loss TEWL clinical score and skin inflammation on histopathology were significantly decreased by the oral administration of kestose.
