To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of probiotics macrophages 1 x 106 cellswell were treated with LPS 100 ngmL in the absence or presence of probiotics 1 x 103 or 1 x 105 CFUmL for 90 minutes for NF-kB or 24 hours for TNF and IL-1b.Preparation of mice with HFD-fed obesityAfter 1 week of acclimation mice were randomly divided into 3 groups LD HD and HDB of 8 mice each.

HFD significantly increased the blood LPS level as previously reported whereas IM38 reduced HFD-induced blood LPS level P  .05.IM38 attenuated HFD-induced colitis in miceHFD is a causative factor in the etiology of colitis .

HFD treatment significantly increased LPS levels whereas IM38 treatment significantly decreased HFD-induced LPS production P  .05.Therefore we suggested that suppression of LPS-induced gastrointestinal inflammation by probiotics might decrease the occurrence of obesity and colitis.

Neverthe- less the relationship among obesity colitis and gut microbiota LPS has not been studied thoroughly.In the present study we found that HFD consumption increased obesity colonic inflammation and LPS production in gut microbiota.

Therefore further research on HFD-induced LPS-producing bacteria and the precise mechanism of IM38- mediated inhibition of LPS production and NF-kB activation is necessary.In conclusion HFD treatment altered the profiles of gut microbiota and LPS levels which are positively associated with obesity and colitis.

However when mice were fed HFD for 4 weeks and treated thereafter with IM38 plus HFD for 6 weeks their whole-body and epididymal fat pad weight gains were reduced comparedFig.
