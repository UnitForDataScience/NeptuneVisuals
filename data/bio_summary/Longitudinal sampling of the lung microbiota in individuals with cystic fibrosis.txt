Correlations between thesecollected data and the OTUs present within the microbiome were calculated and significant correlations were reported  a subset of these significant correlations are plotted.doi10.1371journal.pone.0172811.g005Longitudinal dynamics of the CF lung microbiotaTo further understand elements of the patient-specific dynamics of the CF lung microbiota we focused on 2 participants who completed the full study period.

Because antimicrobial therapies often control and resolvethe symptoms associated with pulmonary exacerbations it is important that we understand the longitudinal dynamics of the CF lung microbiota with respect to onset of pulmonary symptoms.In this study when examined as discrete groups samples of the CF lung microbiota obtained during Treatment Intermediate and Stable periods were identified as significantly different from each other PERMANOVA of Bray-Curtis distance p  0.016 though highly confounded by the originating participant.

However longitudinal studies of the dynamics within the CF lung microbiota are important in determining the bacterial compo- nent of pulmonary exacerbation.By studying 6 people with CF for up to a year in a prospective longitudinal study of the microbiota preceding during and following exacerbation we conclude no discernable partic- ipant-wide dynamics which explain the onset of pulmonary exacerbation.

The authors determined that the core microbiota were resistant to exacerbation and associated antimicrobial treatments .In this study we expand on the above by examining relative changes to the CF lung bacte- rial community over the course of one year in 6 participants in the context of clinical status exacerbation treatment versus stability changes in participant reported symptom scores and spirometry values and antibiotic treatments.

A longitudinal representation of the evenness and richness of the CF lung microbiota across study participants indicates patient-specific levels of within-patient diversity.doi10.1371journal.pone.0172811.g004collected samples taken at least 1 month outside of any exacerbation.

These types of changes may result from changes in antimicrobial therapy   changes in pulmonary function   or other undetermined factors.When we focused on the 2 participants in the study who had the most n  4 and leastn  0 number of exacerbations during the study period longitudinal analyses were unable to provide general microbiome patterns predicting exacerbation there were no correlations between exacerbation and alpha or beta diversity FEV1 antibiotic use or symptom scores.Previous longitudinal analyses of the CF lung microbiota's role in pulmonary exacerbation onset have drawn similar conclusions to those observed within this study  .

Of the 6 participants who began the study 3 completed the full 1-year term with the remaining 3 participants drop- ping out of the study due to poor health or non-compliance  however all 6 contrib- uted serial samples and are included in subsequent analyses.At the end of the study participants returned a study log which included the metadata and their stored sputum using -20C freezer packs and insulated transport bags to ensure samples were kept frozen.

Although this sample size is small these findings indicate that the use of alpha diversity metrics to assess the relative health status and stability of the lung microbiota may be complex at the patient-level even though low alpha diversity has been associated with poor lung function at the population-level.Longitudinal dynamics of two select participants C and E. Two participants who were the outliers in terms of the number of pulmonary exacerbations experienced over the course of the study period were chosen for closer examination.

In this study we identified no universal indicator within the lung microbiome of exacerbation onset but instead showed that changes to the CF lung microbiome occur out- side of acute pulmonary episodes and are patient-specific.IntroductionCystic fibrosis CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR gene   which leads to impairments in pancreatic and liver function and intestinal obstruction  .
