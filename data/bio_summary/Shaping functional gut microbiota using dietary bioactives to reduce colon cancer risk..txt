Coordinated proliferation and migration of colonic epithelial cells are necessary for the maintenance of barrier function and epithelial restitution following an injury to the epithelial cells .Adult colon stem cells sustain self-renewal and are target cells forcancer-initiating mutations .

In addition to the concept that cancer stem cells are the direct products of neoplastically transformed normal adult stem cells there is also evidence that transit amplifying cells with mutant genomes can dedifferentiate and enter the stem cell state .

It is apparent that inflammation can impact all stages of colon cancer development and nutritional strategies aimed at modulating inflammation and ROS production may help mitigate disease risk.Changes to microbiomemetabolome and their role in tumorigenesisCurrently investigations into the physiological mechanisms by which the microbiota can influence colon cancer risk are limited due to the diversity and complexity of the microbiota.

However the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein- coupled receptor 5 positive Lgr5 crypt base columnar cells are a strong candidate as these cells undergo cell division daily and their daughter cells constitute the transit-amplifying crypt compartment .

Activation of the intrinsic pathway in response to DNA damage provides a mechanism whereby DNA da- maged cells can be removed from the tissue thus preventing the pro- pagation of transformed cells or retention of mutated progenitor cells .

The mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of naive T cells into Treg cells include direct actions of butyrate on naive T cells i.e.

Thus intestinal stem cells are considered the cell-of-origin of cancer because these cells already exhibit self-renewing capacity and multi- potency .

These findings reinforce the need to consider metabolomic profiles derived from multiple adjacent sampling sites to enhance biomarker discovery and personalized treatment and prevention strategies.To define a beneficial microbiota composition that is capable of suppressing CRC it will be important to first understand the mechan- isms by which the microbiota can predispose host cells to carcinogen- esis.

Application of site-specific sampling techniques in combination with more sensitive analytical approaches in future experiments will improve the ability to detect diet-induced modifications of host-mi- crobe interactions in colon cancer models.Metabolomics analysis of CRC patients versus healthy controls is auseful tool for investigating alterations in co-metabolism or metabolic exchange between host cells and the gut microbiota and permits iden- tification of novel CRC metabolite biomarkers.
