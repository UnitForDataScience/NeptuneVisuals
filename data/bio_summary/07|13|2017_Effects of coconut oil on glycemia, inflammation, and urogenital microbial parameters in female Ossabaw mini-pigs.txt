the major findings of this study are female ossabaw pigs fed an excess calorie high-fat diet high-cholesterol high-fructose diet rich in coconut oil 1 developed obesity but were normoglycemic 2 were in a state of immune homeostasis and 3 had a greater urogenital bacterial diversity that was driven by the high fat diet.although coconut oil has been shown to improve glucose homeostasis   and to improve cholesterol values in lean animals and humans respectively through increasing high density lipoprotein hdl  to date the effects of coconut oil on metabolic parameters in the context of obesity have not been explored.

upon activation this kinase phosphorylates enzymes involved in insulin sig- naling and cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism and is therefore associated with accumula- tion of increased subcutaneous visceral and intramuscular fat and a 'thrifty' phenotype .these pigs serve as an excellent model for obesity as they naturally develop a condition that mimics metabolic syndrome in humans when fed an excess-calorie high-fatcholesterolfruc- tose diet including visceral obesity glucose intolerance insulin resistance dyslipidemia and hypertension -.the goals for this study utilizing female ossabaw pigs as a model of obesity were to 1 mea- sure body weight and measurements glucose and insulin concentrations and plasma free fatty acid composition to assess metabolic function 2 assess systemic immune function through analysis of serum cytokine levels and 3 identify bacterial communities in the urogenital tract associated with obesity.

during the six-month study period lean pigs n  2 were fed approximately 2000 kcal of the pelleted lean diet per pig per day and obese pigs n  3 were fed approximately 4570 kcal of obese diet per pig per day.

based on our results we postulate that coconut oil in the high fat diet might modulate the peripheral immune system possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics.in conclusion when fed an excess-calorie high-fatcholesterolfructose diet rich in coconut oil female ossabaw pigs developed obesity but were normoglycemic demonstrated decreased markers of inflammation and had greater bacterial diversity in the urogenital tracts than lean pigs.

thus our study was more targeted in identifying a signature in obesity associated with diet manipulation specifically.the fact that obese pigs fed a high fat diet rich in coconut oil have decreased inflammation and levels of arachidonic acid is intriguing since obesity alone is known to drive inflamma- tion.

however as we did not feed lean pigs a control diet supplemented with coconut oil we cannot unequivocally support this con- jecture with only the current data set.the free fatty acid profile identified increased levels of vaccenic acid and decreased levels of arachidonic acid in obese pigs compared to lean pigs.

future studies that examine the effectof coconut oil in a control diet fed to lean pigs are warranted to fully assess the potential benefi- cial effect of coconut oil on inflammation and immune function.identification of bacterial taxa that have either increased or decreased abundance in obese compared to lean pigs in the urogenital tract revealed that obese pigs were more protected from inflammation within the urogenital tract.

the lean diet fed in this study was the rund diet univer- sity of illinois at urbana-champaign urbana il usa comprised of corn 57.5 and soy 40.0 supplemented with vitamins and minerals.

obese pigs developed lower plasma insulin concentrations while on diet compared with lean pigs which developed higher plasma insulin concentrations while on diet .

pigs that consumed the high fat diet developed decreased levels of arachidonic acid p  0.04 while on the diet as compared with lean pigs .

and the lean diet was the inclusion of coconut oil in the high fat diet for this current study  .
