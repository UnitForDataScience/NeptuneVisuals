The major findings of this study are female Ossabaw pigs fed an excess calorie high-fat diet high-cholesterol high-fructose diet rich in coconut oil 1 developed obesity but were normoglycemic 2 were in a state of immune homeostasis and 3 had a greater urogenital bacterial diversity that was driven by the high fat diet.Although coconut oil has been shown to improve glucose homeostasis   and to improve cholesterol values in lean animals and humans respectively through increasing high density lipoprotein HDL  to date the effects of coconut oil on metabolic parameters in the context of obesity have not been explored.

In all sta- tistical tests p0.05 was the criterion to indicate statistical significance unless otherwise noted.ResultsMetabolic parametersWeight lean 57.8 - 5.4 kg obese 73.5 - 1.8 kg crown to rump length lean 84.8 - 1.3 cm obese 92.7 - 1.3 cm heart girth lean 85.6 - 1.3 cm obese 99.3 - 1.3 cm and belly girth lean 87.1 - 1.3 cm obese 102.9 - 1.3 cm were all significantly P  0.05 greater in obese pigs compared with lean .

Alpha diversity measures indicated no significant differ- ence in the number of OTUs observed P0.5  between obese and lean animals for either cervical fluid or vaginal swabs indicating that the copy of expression within each bacte- rial taxonomy was driving diversity differences between the induction and maintenance phase of the diet period.To analyze taxonomical diversity we measured the percent abundance of level 6 taxonomy.The three most abundant phyla across all animals were Bacteroidetes lean 51.07 obese 53.23 Firmicutes lean 21.81 obese 17.53 and Proteobacteria lean 18.93 obese 16.40 .

Upon activation this kinase phosphorylates enzymes involved in insulin sig- naling and cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism and is therefore associated with accumula- tion of increased subcutaneous visceral and intramuscular fat and a 'thrifty' phenotype .These pigs serve as an excellent model for obesity as they naturally develop a condition that mimics metabolic syndrome in humans when fed an excess-calorie high-fatcholesterolfruc- tose diet including visceral obesity glucose intolerance insulin resistance dyslipidemia and hypertension -.The goals for this study utilizing female Ossabaw pigs as a model of obesity were to 1 mea- sure body weight and measurements glucose and insulin concentrations and plasma free fatty acid composition to assess metabolic function 2 assess systemic immune function through analysis of serum cytokine levels and 3 identify bacterial communities in the urogenital tract associated with obesity.

During the six-month study period lean pigs n  2 were fed approximately 2000 kcal of the pelleted lean diet per pig per day and obese pigs n  3 were fed approximately 4570 kcal of obese diet per pig per day.

Based on our results we postulate that coconut oil in the high fat diet might modulate the peripheral immune system possibly through regulation of microbial community dynamics.In conclusion when fed an excess-calorie high-fatcholesterolfructose diet rich in coconut oil female Ossabaw pigs developed obesity but were normoglycemic demonstrated decreased markers of inflammation and had greater bacterial diversity in the urogenital tracts than lean pigs.

Thus our study was more targeted in identifying a signature in obesity associated with diet manipulation specifically.The fact that obese pigs fed a high fat diet rich in coconut oil have decreased inflammation and levels of arachidonic acid is intriguing since obesity alone is known to drive inflamma- tion.

However as we did not feed lean pigs a control diet supplemented with coconut oil we cannot unequivocally support this con- jecture with only the current data set.The free fatty acid profile identified increased levels of vaccenic acid and decreased levels of arachidonic acid in obese pigs compared to lean pigs.

Future studies that examine the effectof coconut oil in a control diet fed to lean pigs are warranted to fully assess the potential benefi- cial effect of coconut oil on inflammation and immune function.Identification of bacterial taxa that have either increased or decreased abundance in obese compared to lean pigs in the urogenital tract revealed that obese pigs were more protected from inflammation within the urogenital tract.
