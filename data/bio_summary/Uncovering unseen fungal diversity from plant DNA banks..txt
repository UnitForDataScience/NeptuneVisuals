Thus along with the HPDL's banked plant samples it also has likely and coincidentally preserved a substantial portion of the diversity of Hawaiian fungi acting as a repository for not only plant genetics but their microbiomes as well.Utilizing several plant bank samples from the HPDL we investigated the diversity of unintentionally co-sampled fungi found within banked plant samples.

For example plant DNA bank samples not only preserve the genomic information of the target species but also preserve potentially important cryptic microbial symbionts associated with the host such as fungi known to inhabit the plant phyllosphere   .Despite much work on patterns of plant diversity comparatively little is known about the diversity of fungi.

The main goal of the HPDL is to preserve Hawaiian plant DNA and bank samples for use in future studies of biodiversity  .All naturally occurring plant tissues harbor fungi as both endophytes living in between plant cells  and epiphytes living on plant surfaces  collectively known as phyllosphere fungi .

Similarly fungal diversity based on q  1 exponentialShannon entropy was estimated to saturate at around 2750 and diversity based on q  2 inverse Simpson concentration was estimated to saturate at about 1591 .We investigated patterns of fungal diversity at the phyla and ordinal levels.

In order to obtain more accurate estimates of true fungal diversity increased sampling using high throughput DNA sequencing of many different types of environments is needed and DNA banks may significantly contribute to filling this knowledge gap.Hawai'i is a biodiversity hotspot making it an exceptional location to study patterns of species diversity .

Even with the adoption of next generation DNA sequencing technologies such as high throughput amplicon sequencing from environmental samples observed diversity is often an under representation of true diversity .

2017 Uncovering unseen fungal diversity from plant DNA banks.

As a result of these extinctions and a strong potential for additional future losses the Hawaiian Plant DNA Library HPDL was created to preserve the genetic diversity of the Hawaiian flora .The HPDL was started in 1992 and currently has over 10000 accessions representing over 86 of all of the Hawaiian plant genera and over 50 of all species .

This deep sequencing was done in hopes that the vast majority of fungi from our samples would be recovered from each sample.In this study we utilized historical DNA bank samples to validate the use of plant bank samples as a resource for elucidating phyllosphere fungal biodiversity while subsequently examining plant-associated fungal diversity across space.
