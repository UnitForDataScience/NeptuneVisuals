The level of BAFF was increased in NODhigh compared to NODlow females at 6 weeks of age  consistent with altered B-cell homeostasis as well as with B-cell activation.Exposure of NODlow mice to NODhigh mice after weaning does not increase T1D incidenceTo examine the transmissibility of colony differences in T1D development 3-week-old female NODlow weanlings were co-housed with sex- and age-matched NODhigh mice and both groups were monitored for T1D up to 30 weeks of age .

Co-housing of NODlow with NODhigh mice after weaning did not change T1D development but T1D inci- dence was increased in female offspring of co-housed NODlow mice which were exposed to the NODhigh environment both before and after weaning.

In summary the difference in diabetes development was not due to genetic contamina- tion nor was it related to differences in the degree of insulitis between the two colonies.Low T1D incidence in NODlow mice is unaffected by cyclophosphamide treatment but depends on PD-L1Next we examined mechanisms that could prevent progression to T1D in NODlow mice.

Nonetheless these mice developed T1D with the same low rate of incidence shown by the NODlow colony .These data show that after the age of weaning exposure to transmissible factors in the NODhigh environment including some known pathobionts does not raise T1D incidence in NODlow mice.

While the offspring of co-housed NODhigh mice maintained high rates of T1D incidence the offspring of co-housed NODlow mice showed significantly increased T1D incidence compared to the parental NODlow colony .

This was surprising because post-weaning exposure to various microbial or viral species has previously been shown to alter T1D incidence in NOD mice    .Offspring of co-housed NODlow mice acquire increased T1D incidence microbiota and immune phenotypes similar to NODhigh miceWe hypothesized that in order to affect T1D development exposure to the diabetogenic envi- ronmental factors has to occur prior to weaning.

Of the two genera present in the original NODlow but not in the NODhigh colony Anaerostipes was displaced in the offspring of co-housed NODlow animals whereas Anaeroplasma was retained .The MLNs in the offspring of co-housed NODlow animals also seemed to approach the more activated phenotype of the NODhigh colony.

Principal coordinates analysis a standard biostatistics technique   was performed in order to represent the dissimilarity between any two microbiomes measured by their unweighted UniFrac distances in two dimensions.ResultsNatural history and genetics of NODlow and NODhigh coloniesWe have previously reported that two sister NOD colonies kept in different animal houses develop T1D with low NODlow and high NODhigh cumulative incidence in females  shown here again in .

We concluded that in NODlow mice autoimmunity is maintained in a latent sub-clinical state by PD-1PD-L1 signalling.Environmental differences between NODhigh and NODlow coloniesNext we examined environmental differences that might explain the colony difference in T1D development.

Co-housed NODlow andExposure to a diabetogenic environment after the age of weaning does not modify T1D development in NODlow mice.
