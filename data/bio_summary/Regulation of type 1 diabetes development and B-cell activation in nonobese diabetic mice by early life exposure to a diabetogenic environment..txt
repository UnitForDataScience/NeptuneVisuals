the level of baff was increased in nodhigh compared to nodlow females at 6 weeks of age  consistent with altered b-cell homeostasis as well as with b-cell activation.exposure of nodlow mice to nodhigh mice after weaning does not increase t1d incidenceto examine the transmissibility of colony differences in t1d development 3-week-old female nodlow weanlings were co-housed with sex- and age-matched nodhigh mice and both groups were monitored for t1d up to 30 weeks of age .

co-housing of nodlow with nodhigh mice after weaning did not change t1d development but t1d inci- dence was increased in female offspring of co-housed nodlow mice which were exposed to the nodhigh environment both before and after weaning.

in summary the difference in diabetes development was not due to genetic contamina- tion nor was it related to differences in the degree of insulitis between the two colonies.low t1d incidence in nodlow mice is unaffected by cyclophosphamide treatment but depends on pd-l1next we examined mechanisms that could prevent progression to t1d in nodlow mice.

nonetheless these mice developed t1d with the same low rate of incidence shown by the nodlow colony .these data show that after the age of weaning exposure to transmissible factors in the nodhigh environment including some known pathobionts does not raise t1d incidence in nodlow mice.

while the offspring of co-housed nodhigh mice maintained high rates of t1d incidence the offspring of co-housed nodlow mice showed significantly increased t1d incidence compared to the parental nodlow colony .

female offspring of co-housed nodlow animals exposed to nodhigh-derived environmental factors throughout their life span developed t1d more frequently  50 by 30 weeks of age than their dams or the original nodlow colony  20. in contrast co-housed offspring of nodhigh animals retained their high 90 cumulative t1d incidence.

this was surprising because post-weaning exposure to various microbial or viral species has previously been shown to alter t1d incidence in nod mice    .offspring of co-housed nodlow mice acquire increased t1d incidence microbiota and immune phenotypes similar to nodhigh micewe hypothesized that in order to affect t1d development exposure to the diabetogenic envi- ronmental factors has to occur prior to weaning.

of the two genera present in the original nodlow but not in the nodhigh colony anaerostipes was displaced in the offspring of co-housed nodlow animals whereas anaeroplasma was retained .the mlns in the offspring of co-housed nodlow animals also seemed to approach the more activated phenotype of the nodhigh colony.

principal coordinates analysis a standard biostatistics technique   was performed in order to represent the dissimilarity between any two microbiomes measured by their unweighted unifrac distances in two dimensions.resultsnatural history and genetics of nodlow and nodhigh colonieswe have previously reported that two sister nod colonies kept in different animal houses develop t1d with low nodlow and high nodhigh cumulative incidence in females  shown here again in .

we concluded that in nodlow mice autoimmunity is maintained in a latent sub-clinical state by pd-1pd-l1 signalling.environmental differences between nodhigh and nodlow coloniesnext we examined environmental differences that might explain the colony difference in t1d development.

co-housed nodlow andexposure to a diabetogenic environment after the age of weaning does not modify t1d development in nodlow mice.

the cumulative disease incidence was not as high as that observed in the established nodhigh colony nonethe- less the data suggested that exposure to the nodhigh diabetogenic environment throughout the animals' life span including the pre-weaning period had a dominant effect on increasing t1d development in these mice.in order to examine whether the offspring of co-housed nodlow mice had acquired nodhigh-like gut microbiota intestinal 16s rrna gene sequences from these mice were compared with animals from the original nodhigh and nodlow colonies at 5 weeks of age and .

cd69 expression in mesenteric lymph nodeb cells from second-generation co-housed nodlow mice was similar to that detected in estab- lished nodhigh mice .in summary nodlow animals co-housed with nodhigh animals or successfully infected with at least some of their pathobionts by other routes from weaning age exhibited no change in their t1d incidence in the first generation.

in nodlow females the low rate of t1d was unaffected by cyclophosphamide but increased by pd-l1 blockade.thus environmental exposures that are innocuous later in life may promote t1d progres- sion if acquired early during immune development possibly by altering b-cell activation and or pd-l1 function.

the com- parison to a small control group n  4 in did not reach statistical significancep  0.09 log rank test but the low incidence of t1d in the control group was in line with incidence in the nodlow colony see  whereas the rapid rise in t1d incidence to 56 animals  83 within 3 weeks of anti-pd-l1 treatment was clearly different.
