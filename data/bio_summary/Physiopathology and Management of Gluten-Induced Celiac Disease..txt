As host proteolytic enzymes cannot catabolise gluten completely CD should have occurred in every individual consuming gluten containing diet.

Native molecular weight MW of gluten is between 10 to more than 30 kDa Waga 2004 Wieser 2007.Classification of GlutenBased on relative solubility gluten is classified into Gliadinsprolamins I soluble in 70 ethanol or aqueous alcohol and Glutenins prolamins II soluble only in acid solutions OsborneJFDS-2016-0606 Submitted 4222016 Accepted 1292016.

Even a small quantity of gluten 50 mgd can be immunogenic so all food items and dietary supplements with gluten and its deriva- tives must be withdrawn from the celiac patient diet.

The peptide-based immunotherapy vaccine was able to shift the T- cell response from proinflammatory to regulatory role by inducing immune tolerance for gluten and facilitating digestion of gluten containing food Keijzer and others 2013.

Gluten peptide series was designed by Kapocharan and others in which azidoprolines replaced the proline residues and these modified gluten peptides have 100- to 200-fold enhanced bind- ing affinity compared to natural gluten peptide for HLA-DQ2 Kapocharan and others 2008 Kapocharan and others 2010.

However this therapeu- tic approach is limited by the ability of modified peptides to reach lamina propria of the small intestine as well as competing with immunogenic gluten peptides Veeraraghavan and others 2015.Genetically modified glutenGenetically modified grains are one of the possible ways to over- come the immunogenic gluten in genetically susceptible individ- uals Schuppan and others 2009 Sollid and Khosla 2011 Stoven and others 2012.

AN-PEP may be more effective with lesser amount of gluten but it is not effective to prevent gluten induced mucosal damage Veeraraghavan and others 2015.

Assays inclusive of mass spec- trometry HPLC antigluten T cell and gluten challenge studies confirm their potential for gluten detoxification Hausch and oth- ers 2002 Shan and others 2002 Shan and others 2004 Marti and others 2005 Gass and others 2005 Shan and others 2005.
