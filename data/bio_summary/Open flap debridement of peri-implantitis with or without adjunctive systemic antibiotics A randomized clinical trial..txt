we tested the null hypothesis of no differences in clinical and microbiological outcomes over 12 months between peri- implant surgery with or without systemic azithromycin during 5 days after the intervention.2  materials and methods the regional ethics committee at lund sweden approved the study protocol id  2332007. all enrolled study individuals signed written informed consent.

the consort guidelines for clinical trials were followed.

in individuals with more than one implant the implant with the worst clinical conditions was studied even though all diseased im- plants were treated.
