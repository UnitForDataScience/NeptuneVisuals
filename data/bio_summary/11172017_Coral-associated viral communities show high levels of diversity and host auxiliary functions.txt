Many viral genes involved in latency and viral host infection viral replication propagation and particle assembly were observed particularly in the DNA viromes.

A cellular and viral marker database was generated as described in and used in sequence similarity comparisons via BLAST with default parameters and MEGAN5 LCA default parameters with a minimum support parameter of one match for taxonomic assignment to confirm viral RefSeq taxonomic assignments and identify potential cellular contaminants.

The 50 most abundant Swiss-Prot keywords were identified across all samples and visualized using ggplot in R.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThis study characterised the viral diversity across seven coral species of the central GBR and provided taxonomic and functional information with an additional comparison of viral communities that exist in seawater sampled in the GBR.

Their prevalence in the RNA viromes was unexpected as viral particles were DNase-treated prior to viral genome isolation.

We speculate that these toxin genes acquired by coral-associated viruses may provide a benefit to the coral host by assisting in prey acquisition or repelling predators.CONCLUSIONSMetagenomic analyses of viral assemblages from seven GBR coral species have revealed considerable viral diversity in corals.

The presence of viral genes associated with functions such as nematocyst toxins and auxiliary metabolic processes indicate a potential benefit of viral infection for hosts within the holobiont providing a foundation for further experimental investigation and validation.

2017 Coral-associated viral communities show high levels of diversity and host auxiliary func- tions.

However our knowledge of the identity of most viral communities and their function within corals is still scant.

Several dsDNA viral families have been reported from stony corals including Phycodnaviridae Mimiviridae Poxvirirdae Iridoviridae Herpesviridae Ascoviridae with Caudovirales or tailed bacteriophages being the most dominant order reviewed in .
