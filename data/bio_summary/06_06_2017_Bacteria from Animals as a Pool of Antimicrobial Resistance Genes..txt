On the other hand the studies in companion animals have reported A. baumannii isolates genetically similar to the nosocomial European also called International clones I II and III suggesting its spread from humans to animals directly or via the environment .Regarding the distribution of AMR-genes in A. baumannii in animals some studies have reported the emergence of carbapenemase producing A. baumannii in livestock and companion animals  Table .

This is illustrated by several facts i some studies have suggested that the mecA gene may have originated in animal related staphylococci ii it has recently been observed that two mutiresistance genes cfr and optrA associated to MGEs such as plasmids along with other AMR-genes have a wide dissemination in Gram-positive bacteria from animals and humans iii typical nosocomial resistances linked to ESBLs and carbapenemases are emerging in Gram-negative bacteria from animals and iv the mcr-genes which may probably have emerged in the animal sector are currently spreading among human and animal E. coli isolates.

Some of these rare or novel genes are often on plasmids encoding for other AMR-genes such as the multi-resistance gene cfr Table .One interesting gene found in animal-associated S. aureus is the phenicol exporter gene fexA.

In fact qnr genes have been found in aquatic and waterborne organisms such as Shewanella Aeromonas and Citrobacter species and in the Vibrionaceae family .As the qnr genes PMQR efflux pump genes qepA and oqxAB have also a wide distribution and they have been found in diverse Enterobacteriaceae from animals and humans  Table .

This One Health approach recognizes that the human health is connected to the animal health and the environment .The use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine creates a selective pressure for the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria including animal pathogens human pathogens that have animal reservoirs and commensal bacteria from animals  The bacteria selected by this pressure can spread to humans either by direct contact with animals or food products or indirectly via environmental pathways andor non-food producing animals  Figure .Wildlife rodents birds etc.Companion animalsFood animalsDirect contact FoodCommunityHumansHealth systemVegetables seed crops and fruitsFigure 1.

In animals it caused pyoderma otitis and urinary tract infections in companion animals mastitis in dairy cows endometritis in horses and hemorrhagic pneumoniae in fur-bearing animals -.

ESBL-producing bacteria have been found as disease agents andor colonizers in livestock companion animals zoo animals and wild animals -.

Moreover the same variants of Tn1546 carrying the glycopeptide-resistant gene vanA have been detected in enterococci from human and animal origin underlying that E. faecium from animals can act as a donor of AMR-genes for other pathogenic enterococci .Similar to glycopeptides the use of other antimicrobials as grown promotors may have influenced the emerging of enterococci resistant strains in food animals.

The mecC gene has a wide distribution and positive strains have been found in humans from both infection cases and carriage state as well as in animals including livestock dairy cattle beef cattle sheep farmed rabbits companion cats dogs guinea pigs wildlife birds mammals and zoo mara animals .

Studies in swine fecal samples revealed the existence of at least 149 AMR-genes in non-medicated animals .Although non-exposed animals may already carry bacteria with resistance genes some studies have underlined that their resistome can change after antibiotic exposure.
