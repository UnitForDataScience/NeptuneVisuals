This effect was stronger in the proximal colon for the HF diet and in the distal colon for the HP diet.

In presence of the HP diet this trend was different as compared to the HF diet.

This transient peak in ammonium occurred 1 day after the stress in pres- ence of HP diet up to 500 mgL in the DC and 2 days after the stress in presence of the HF diet up to 400 mgL in the DC.Figure 6 shows the OPLS score plot output of the total dataset of the untargeted metabolomic fingerprints of the proximal Fig.

Finally metabo- lites with a possible negative impact on human health such as indole and cadaverine were preferentially produced in presence of the HP diet while higher levels of glucose were correlated with a HF diet.

Finally in presence of a HF diet and when focusing on SCFA the gut microbiota showed a higher resilience as compared to the HP diet both in the proximal and distal colon Fig.

The effect was stronger and faster with the HP diet as the ammonium production in presence of protein is higher as compared to a diet which favours a saccharolytic fermentation i.e.

Moreover the HF diet was characterized by a higher produc- tion and stability of SCFA and a quicker recovery after the acute stress as compared to the HP diet.
