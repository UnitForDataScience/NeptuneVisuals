the current study extends the previ- ously identified association of bacteroides-dominated fecal microbiome profile with higher likelihoods of bron- chiolitis by demonstrating the functional potential of the gut microbiome in infants.sphingolipids are a class of complex lipids contain- ing a backbone of sphingoid bases.

bronchiolitis per se or treatments for bronchiolitis result in perturbation of the fecal microbiome--is also possible these priorstudies coupled with our findings collectively sug- gest that bacteroides-dominant microbiome in the gut through their sphingolipid production may contribute to inappropriate immune responses and bronchioli- tis pathogenesis in infants.

although bronchiolitis has been considered virus- induced inflammation of small airways  recent stud- ies demonstrate that the pathobiology involves complex interrelations among respiratory viruses host immune response and human microbiome -.

emergingevidence also indicates the existence of gut-lung axis in which the gut microbiome conditions immunologic responses in the lungs to environmental challenges e.g.

indeed we have previously demon- strated in a case-control study of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis and healthy controls  that the tax- onomy profiles of the fecal microbiome were associated with the likelihood of bronchiolitis--e.g.

to address this knowledge gap we determined the predicted function of fecal microbiome in infants with bronchiolitis and healthy infants.main textmethodsthis study was a secondary analysis of the data from a case-control study of infants hospitalized for bronchi- olitis and healthy controls.

our data should encourage future investigations into the mechanisms linking the individual gut microbiome-derived metabolites to the host immune response in the gut and respiratory tract the gut-lung axis.in sum on the basis of the predicted metagenome in this case-control study we found significant differ- ences in the functional potential of fecal microbiome between infants with bronchiolitis and healthy con- trols.

particularly the fecal microbiome in infants with bronchiolitis had consistently higher abundances of gene function related to the sphingolipid metabolic pathways.
