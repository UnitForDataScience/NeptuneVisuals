The pigs fed UVC-treated milk and pigs fed UP showed higher relative weight gain than pigs fed HP-treated milk 5.4 and 3.5 and fewer pigs fed UVC-treated milk had positive bacterial cultures in the bone marrow 28 than pigs fed HP-treated milk 68 P  0.05.

The incidence of bacteremia at the time of death was similar between groups 33 across groups whereas the incidence of osteo- myelitis was higher in pigs fed HP-treated milk than in those fed UVC-treated milk and intermediate in pigs fed UP P  0.05 Figure 4A.Enterobacteriaceae Enterococcus and Staphylococcus were the main bacterial family and genera found in both blood and bone marrow Figure 4B C. In the bone marrow of pigs fed UP the gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae appeared dominant whereas in pigs fed HP-treated milk and pigs fed UVC-treated milk the gram-positive Enterococcus and Staphylococcus were more dominant although the differences were not statistically significant Figure 4C.

NEC lesions in the small intestine were observed only in pigs fed UP and the mean intestinal NEC score was higher in pigs fed UP than that in pigs fed HP- or UVC-treated milk both P  0.05 Table 2.FIGURE 4 Incidence of osteomyelitis in neonatal pigs fed UP HP- treated human milk or UVC-treated human milk for 8-9 d A total bacterial load and the predominant family and genera in blood B and bone marrow C and plasma C-reactive protein and IL-6 concentrations at study end in those with  and without 2 osteomyelitis or bacteremia D.

In the Prox intestine villi were shorter in pigs fed HP-treated milk than in pigs fed UP and those fed UVC-treated milk P  0.05 Figure 5A whereas in the Mid and Dist regions pigs fed HP-treated milk showed decreased villi length compared with those fed UVC-treated milk P  0.05 with intermediate values in pigs fed UP.

The intestinal transit time on day 5 was faster in pigs fed HP-treated milk than in pigs fed UP P  0.05 and was intermediate in pigs fed UVC-treated milk supporting the clinical evaluation of diarrhea.

Dehydration was observed more frequently in pigs fed HP-treated milk than in pigs fed UP P  0.05 with intermediate values for pigs fed UVC-treated milk throughout the study period.

Blood biochemistry variables were generally similar between pigs fed UP and pigs fed UVC- treated milk and some variables showed higher values in pigs fed HP-treated milk than in those fed UP or UVC-treated milk Supplemental Table 4.

At the time of death total blood leukocyte and neutrophil counts were higher in pigs fed UP than in those fed UVC-treated milk whereas lymphocyte counts were higher in pigs fed HP-treated milk than in pigs fed UVC- treated milk both P  0.05 Supplemental Table 5.

The gut microbiota composition was similar among groups except for greater proportions of Enterococcus in pigs fed UVC-treated milk than in pigs fed UP and those fed HP-treated milk in both cecum contents 20 and 10 and distal intestinal mucosa 24 and 20 all P  0.05.

To mimic the feeding strategy in preterm infants pigs received gradually increasing volumes of DM from 24 mL  kg21  d21 at birth to 144 mL  kg21  d21 on day 6 increasing by 24 mL  kg21  d21 and volumes were kept at this amount until the pigs were killed on days 8-9.
