meta-analysis has shown an increased risk by living in an urban environment of 1.2-fold 1.0-1.3 for uc and a 1.4-fold 1.3-1.6 for cd.41 like- wise having a smaller number of siblings leads to a 2.6-fold 1.5-4.6 risk increase of ibd and in contrast sharing a bedroom decreases risk of uc 2.1-fold 1.1-3.9 and cd 2.3-fold 1.3-4.4.42 having a hot water tap at home increased odds of cd 5-fold 1.4-17.3 and having a separate bathroom 3.3-fold 1.3-8.3 whereas no effect was found for uc.43 animal contact an indicator of less hygiene on the other hand might decrease risk of uc and cd in migrants.44 the hygiene hypothesis is not limited to ibd as similar effects are seen in eczema and asthma.40 evidence to explain the association of a higher hygiene level and ibd and other inflammatory diseases proposes that increased hygiene leads to less exposure to harmless microorganisms such as helminthes predominantly found in areas of poor hygiene leading to less induction of dendritic cell maturation and ability to drive the t-cell regulatory system as is shown in animal mod- els and studies in patients with cd and uc.45-49further underscoring the importance of hygiene in disease pathogenesis is the finding that early childhood h. pylori infection is inversely associated with the incidence of ibd.

current use of ocp leads to a 1.3-fold 1.1-1.5 risk increase of uc.109 risk of devel- oping cd with current ocp use increases 1.5-fold 1.3-1.7 and this effect might remain visible in former users 1.4 1.1-1.9 when compared with never-users.109110 postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy also leads to a 1.7-fold 1.1-2.7 increase of risk on uc after correcting for earlier ocp use and increasing with duration of use whereas no effect is seen in cd.111 a dif- ferent study found reverse findings an association with cd instead of uc but used a very small number of cases.112 estrogen promotes the humeral immune system cellular proliferation and mediates the effect of th2-related cytokines and because uc is a th2-mediated disease this could explain the increased risk.

future studies should focus on measuring this exposome yielding the possibility of combining all involved factors to one exposome risk score and our knowledge on genetic susceptibility.inflamm bowel dis 2017231499-1509key words environmental risk factors environmental protective factors exposome environmental exposurenflammatory bowel disease ibd consisting of ulcerative coli- tis uc and crohn's disease cd is a gastrointestinal disease characterized by chronic inflammation.

the type of chronic inflammatory disease that develops afterward may be dependent of genetics and other risk factors.124126127 in ibd the increased risk may be ex- plained by il-6 production nonspecific blockage of regulatory t-cells and activation of self-reactive t-cells as a result of pathogenic infection leading to a chronic inflammatory response.128another way the immune system can be influenced is through exposure to harmless microorganisms as discussed in the childhood exposures section above.drinking tap water on a regular basis seems to lower risk of cd while uc is unaffected.

meta-analysis has shown a 3.3-fold 2.7-4.0 risk reduction for development of uc accom- panied by a decrease of relapse risk in established disease 57.1 versus 78.6 while risk of colectomy seems unchanged.

a positive family history of ibd is the most important risk factor for development of ibd as a concordance rate of 19 and 50 has been shown in monozygotic twins for uc and cd respectively.45 genome- wide association meta-analyses have identified 201 independent loci contributing to an increased risk of ibd.

although it showed no effect on development of uc the risk of developing cd increases in a dose-dependent manner especially when antibiotics are used in the first year of life by an odds increase of 5.3 1.6-17.4.31 this effect tends to decrease 1.6 1.4-1.8 when antibiotics are used later in childhood between 6 and 15 yr old but remains significant.32 the risk- increasing effect varies across different types of antibiotics with the strongest risk increase reported for broad-spectrum penicillin 3.1 1.3-7.4 followed by penicillin v 2.9 1.2-7.0 and ceph-alosporin 1.9 1.4-2.6.32-34 though epidemiological studies show support for a role of antibiotics in ibd biological under- standing is insufficient to explain this relationship.

this hypothesis is supported by our findings describing a higher visceral adiposity at disease diag- nosis and a more complicated disease course.68-71physical activity might also be related to obesity and shows a reverse effect on disease development with a protective role for risk of cd but not uc although reported results are inconsis- tent.6772 prospective analyses have shown a risk reduction of 36 percent 6.0-56.0 when comparing high- and low-activity groups which is supported by findings from other studies.73-75 animal studies have confirmed this effect by demonstrating a pro- tective effect against inflammatory diseases and also insulin resis- tance cancer neurodegenerative disorders infections aging and heart disease by inducing an autophagy pathway a lysosomal cell destruction pathway which allows cells to adapt to changing nutri- tional and energy demands and therefore contributes to beneficial effects of exercise.76-80another lifestyle-associated factor is stress.

when asked 70 of patients have the perception that a flare of their disease is associated with stressful life events and stress is perceived to be the leading causative agent in their disease.8182 this hypothesis was examined by different researchers and findings are inconsis- tent.8384 experiencing depressive feelings however was associ- ated with a 2.4-fold 1.4-4.0 increased risk of cd but not uc 1.1 0.7-1.9 in a large prospective cohort study by ananthak- rishnan et al.85 knowing the adverse effect of stress on sleep the latter might also be a good determinant in terms of ibd risk.86 patients with ibd have an increased risk of sleep disturbances leading to a 2-fold increase of disease flare.8788 up to 83 percent of underlying mucosal inflammation can be predicted by an abnormal pittsburg sleep quality index psqi.89 a possible explanation for this effect is activation of the immune cascade by sleep deprivation because a normal sleeping pattern is crucial for maintaining health and a proper regulation of immune func- tion.9091 therefore the assessment of sleep disturbances in these patients could play an important role in optimal treatment.92the same line of reasoning may be used for examining the role of smoking in ibd.

meta-analysis has shown that current smoking yields a 1.7-fold 1.3-2.2 risk reduction for uc while being a former smoker increases risk of uc 1.8-fold 1.4-2.3 suggesting that smoking might only postpone the arise of uc.93 smoking also leads to a more benign disease course in uc with fewer flares less need for steroids and lower colectomy rates.94-96 the effect of current smoking on cd is more contro- versial because not all studies display the same trend.

howevercombining results of 9 different studies showed a 1.76-fold 1.4-2.2 risk increase of cd.93 former smoking also showed a risk increase although less strong of 1.3-fold 1.0-1.8.93 these risk-increasing effects enlarged with increasing pack-years.97 pas- sive smoke exposure during childhood and prenatal smoke expo- sure due to maternal smoking during pregnancy showed no association with the development of ibd.98 reasons behind the different effects of smoking on both diseases still remain vague because nicotine and smoking both have numerous effects.99 among other things smoking affects the immune system through the cellular and humeral pathways by altering synthesis of proin- flammatory cytokines.100-102 other effects include changes of gut permeability reduction of smooth muscle tone and contractility due to nitric oxide and changes in microcirculation of the gut.103-105gut permeability is also influenced by the use of nsaid use.

using nsaids at least 15 days per month increases risk of uc 1.9-fold 1.2-3.0 and risk of cd 1.6-fold 1.0-2.6. these risks increase with a higher frequency of use greater weekly dosages and a longer duration of use.106 these findings can be explained by the pharmacokinetics of nsaids as they inhibit cyclooxygenase cox leading to a decrease of protective prostaglandins in the gut mucosa and after undergoing hepatic circulation this ensures among other things an increase in mucosal permeability and there- fore intestinal barrier function disturbance.107108besides these analgesics the use of hormone containing medication is likely to play a role in ibd development.

the relation between diet and etiology and treatment of ibd is apparent for patients as well as their physicians but is difficult to prove scientifically.159160 because of the complexity of diet it is often classified as an independent etiologic factor in ibd development and will therefore only be discussed shortly in this review.161 whereas sugar and fat forming important compo- nents of a western diet have been identified as risk factors for ibd development fruits and vegetables seem to hold a protective effect.162-167 however results are inconclusive and no firm con- clusion can be drawn given current understandings.discussionin our working hypothesis environmental exposures either as a part of a western lifestyle or living surroundings play antable 2. level of evidence of environment and lifestyle in cdexposuresample sizeeffectaqualitybtype of studyauthoryear of publicationhygiene hypothesisurban environment30 studiesriskmeta-analysissoon et al412012 bedroom sharing768 cases cohort size 399251protectivecross-sectional study klement et al422008pylori infection23 studiesprotectivemeta-analysisluther et al502010 air pollution no2367 cases 1833 controlsriskcase-controlkaplan et al582010 obesity153 cases cohort size 111498riskcohort studykhalili et al662015 physical activity284 cases cohort size 194711 protectivecohort studykhalili et al732013depressive feelings170 cases cohort size 152461riskcohort studyananthakrishnanet al852013cigarette smokingcurrent9 studiesriskmeta-analysismahid et al932006former9 studiesriskmeta-analysismahid et al932006use of nsaids123 cases cohort size 121700riskcohort studyananthakrishnanet al1062012use of ocpcurrent14 studiesriskmeta-analysiscornish et al1092008 former315 cases cohort size 232452riskcohort studykhalili et al1102013acute gastroenteritis54 cases cohort size 93013riskcohort studygarcia rodriguezet al1242006tap water consumption222 cases 222 controlsprotectivecase-control studybaron et al1292005 living in southern latitudes 257 cases cohort size 175912protectivecohort studykhalili et al1532012vitamin d level122 cases cohort size 72719protectivecohort studyananthakrishnanet al1542012aprotective indicated a decreased chance of developing ibd and risk indicates increased chance of developing ibd.bquality of papers based on the grade approach evaluating limitations inconsistency indirectness imprecision and publication biasindicating high quality moderate qualitylow qualityvery low quality.hrt hormone replacement therapy.

in this theory the coherent effect of all environmental exposures from neonatal period to death named as the exposome by wild plays an important role.15 future studies should focus on measuring this exposome either through biomarkers or questionnaires in a longitudinally manner yielding the possibility of combining all involved environmental risk and protective factors in an exposome risk score.
