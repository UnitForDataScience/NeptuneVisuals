Meta-analysis has shown an increased risk by living in an urban environment of 1.2-fold 1.0-1.3 for UC and a 1.4-fold 1.3-1.6 for CD.41 Like- wise having a smaller number of siblings leads to a 2.6-fold 1.5-4.6 risk increase of IBD and in contrast sharing a bedroom decreases risk of UC 2.1-fold 1.1-3.9 and CD 2.3-fold 1.3-4.4.42 Having a hot water tap at home increased odds of CD 5-fold 1.4-17.3 and having a separate bathroom 3.3-fold 1.3-8.3 whereas no effect was found for UC.43 Animal contact an indicator of less hygiene on the other hand might decrease risk of UC and CD in migrants.44 The hygiene hypothesis is not limited to IBD as similar effects are seen in eczema and asthma.40 Evidence to explain the association of a higher hygiene level and IBD and other inflammatory diseases proposes that increased hygiene leads to less exposure to harmless microorganisms such as helminthes predominantly found in areas of poor hygiene leading to less induction of dendritic cell maturation and ability to drive the T-cell regulatory system as is shown in animal mod- els and studies in patients with CD and UC.45-49Further underscoring the importance of hygiene in disease pathogenesis is the finding that early childhood H. pylori infection is inversely associated with the incidence of IBD.

Current use of OCP leads to a 1.3-fold 1.1-1.5 risk increase of UC.109 Risk of devel- oping CD with current OCP use increases 1.5-fold 1.3-1.7 and this effect might remain visible in former users 1.4 1.1-1.9 when compared with never-users.109110 Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy also leads to a 1.7-fold 1.1-2.7 increase of risk on UC after correcting for earlier OCP use and increasing with duration of use whereas no effect is seen in CD.111 A dif- ferent study found reverse findings an association with CD instead of UC but used a very small number of cases.112 Estrogen promotes the humeral immune system cellular proliferation and mediates the effect of Th2-related cytokines and because UC is a Th2-mediated disease this could explain the increased risk.

The type of chronic inflammatory disease that develops afterward may be dependent of genetics and other risk factors.124126127 In IBD the increased risk may be ex- plained by IL-6 production nonspecific blockage of regulatory T-cells and activation of self-reactive T-cells as a result of pathogenic infection leading to a chronic inflammatory response.128Another way the immune system can be influenced is through exposure to harmless microorganisms as discussed in the childhood exposures section above.Drinking tap water on a regular basis seems to lower risk of CD while UC is unaffected.

Meta-analysis has shown a 3.3-fold 2.7-4.0 risk reduction for development of UC accom- panied by a decrease of relapse risk in established disease 57.1 versus 78.6 while risk of colectomy seems unchanged.

Future studies should focus on measuring this exposome yielding the possibility of combining all involved factors to one exposome risk score and our knowledge on genetic susceptibility.Inflamm Bowel Dis 2017231499-1509Key Words environmental risk factors environmental protective factors exposome environmental exposurenflammatory bowel disease IBD consisting of ulcerative coli- tis UC and Crohn's disease CD is a gastrointestinal disease characterized by chronic inflammation.

A positive family history of IBD is the most important risk factor for development of IBD as a concordance rate of 19 and 50 has been shown in monozygotic twins for UC and CD respectively.45 Genome- wide association meta-analyses have identified 201 independent loci contributing to an increased risk of IBD.

Although it showed no effect on development of UC the risk of developing CD increases in a dose-dependent manner especially when antibiotics are used in the first year of life by an odds increase of 5.3 1.6-17.4.31 This effect tends to decrease 1.6 1.4-1.8 when antibiotics are used later in childhood between 6 and 15 yr old but remains significant.32 The risk- increasing effect varies across different types of antibiotics with the strongest risk increase reported for broad-spectrum penicillin 3.1 1.3-7.4 followed by penicillin V 2.9 1.2-7.0 and ceph-alosporin 1.9 1.4-2.6.32-34 Though epidemiological studies show support for a role of antibiotics in IBD biological under- standing is insufficient to explain this relationship.

This hypothesis is supported by our findings describing a higher visceral adiposity at disease diag- nosis and a more complicated disease course.68-71Physical activity might also be related to obesity and shows a reverse effect on disease development with a protective role for risk of CD but not UC although reported results are inconsis- tent.6772 Prospective analyses have shown a risk reduction of 36 percent 6.0-56.0 when comparing high- and low-activity groups which is supported by findings from other studies.73-75 Animal studies have confirmed this effect by demonstrating a pro- tective effect against inflammatory diseases and also insulin resis- tance cancer neurodegenerative disorders infections aging and heart disease by inducing an autophagy pathway a lysosomal cell destruction pathway which allows cells to adapt to changing nutri- tional and energy demands and therefore contributes to beneficial effects of exercise.76-80Another lifestyle-associated factor is stress.

When asked 70 of patients have the perception that a flare of their disease is associated with stressful life events and stress is perceived to be the leading causative agent in their disease.8182 This hypothesis was examined by different researchers and findings are inconsis- tent.8384 Experiencing depressive feelings however was associ- ated with a 2.4-fold 1.4-4.0 increased risk of CD but not UC 1.1 0.7-1.9 in a large prospective cohort study by Ananthak- rishnan et al.85 Knowing the adverse effect of stress on sleep the latter might also be a good determinant in terms of IBD risk.86 Patients with IBD have an increased risk of sleep disturbances leading to a 2-fold increase of disease flare.8788 Up to 83 percent of underlying mucosal inflammation can be predicted by an abnormal Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index PSQI.89 A possible explanation for this effect is activation of the immune cascade by sleep deprivation because a normal sleeping pattern is crucial for maintaining health and a proper regulation of immune func- tion.9091 Therefore the assessment of sleep disturbances in these patients could play an important role in optimal treatment.92The same line of reasoning may be used for examining the role of smoking in IBD.

Meta-analysis has shown that current smoking yields a 1.7-fold 1.3-2.2 risk reduction for UC while being a former smoker increases risk of UC 1.8-fold 1.4-2.3 suggesting that smoking might only postpone the arise of UC.93 Smoking also leads to a more benign disease course in UC with fewer flares less need for steroids and lower colectomy rates.94-96 The effect of current smoking on CD is more contro- versial because not all studies display the same trend.
