The resistance pattern of human milk and curd LAB isolates cannot be directly correlated owing to their different ecological niche but high resistance in human milk isolates over curd isolates may be clarified with the high usage and exposure level.In our study standard probiotics Lactobacillus strains covering common Lactobacillus species along with refer- ence probiotic strains displayed resistance pattern towards different antibiotic functional groups.

The results for the curd human milk reference LAB standard probiotics lactococci and pathogenic iso- latesstrains have been documented in tabular form Tables    in terms of resistant R and susceptible S. Strains showing intermediate susceptibility ZOI 15 to 19 mm have been depicted by numerical values clearly depicting the marginal values inclined towards either sen- sitivity or resistance.LAB isolates of curd origin showed sensitivity towards ampicillin imipenem meropenem b-lactams chloram- phenicol and erythromycin macrolide and resistance towards methicillin b-lactams and tobramycin amino- glycoside.

Gram-positive lactococci L. lactis and L. cremoris included as non-probiotic controlTable 3 Antibacterial susceptibility profile of curd Lactobacillus isolates to commercial antibioticsTable 3 continuedTable 4 Antibacterial susceptibility profile of human milk Lactobacillus isolates to commercial antibioticsTable 5 Antibacterial susceptibility pattern of different LAB strains reference probiotics and pathogens against commercial antibioticsTable 5 continuedwere also examined for their antibiotic susceptibility pat- tern.

Oxacillin was mildly effective against few curd isolates and Gram-positive pathogens however the scenario was reverse for all the isolates of human milk origin and Gram-negative pathogens.

All the human milk isolates showed resistance towards methicillin and oxacillin other antimi- crobials of same family.

A general susceptibility of curd and human milk isolates towards b-lactams except against methicillin and oxacillin was recorded.

also observed the resistant pattern of human milk L. gasseri isolates towards clindamycin.

This marked differ- ence between curd and human milk isolates' susceptibility towards trimethoprim and co-trimoxazole may be sub- stantiated with the difference in application and usage of mentioned drug in humans.

Gram-positive pathogens gave intermediate pattern towards glycopeptides teicoplanin vancomycin while Gram-negative pathogens were resistant towards the same Table .DiscussionThe study evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility profile of lactobacilli isolated from curd and human milk samples from the different regions of Punjab India against 26 different commercial antibiotic discs belonging to different groups.
