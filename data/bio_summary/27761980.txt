student's t-tests and the 125-fold criterion revealed that 110 genes 137 probes and 82 genes 155 probes were significantly up- and down-regulated in patients with ibs respectively left panel.

b the venn diagram shows 82 down-regulated genes in patients with ibs and 52 significantly up-regulated genes after the 4-week administration of cp2305 in cp2305 responders.

d the venn diagram shows 110 up-regulated genes in patients with ibs and 15 significantly down-regulated genes after the 4-week administration of cp2305 in cp2305 responders.

cp2305 recovered the expression of distinct down-regulated genes in ibs whereas the major- ity of the differentially expressed genes in our patients with ibs did not respond to cp2305.

the majority of the restored genes were related to eif2 signalling.conclusions cp2305 administration is a potential candidate therapeutic option for patients with ibs.significance and impact of the study although probiotics have been proposed to benefit ibs patients objective clinical evidence and elucidation of the functional mechanism remain insufficient.

the correlations between two parameters were evaluated using the pearson's correlation coefficient for parametric data.we identified cp2305-responsive genes and determined if these genes were associated with the disease state of ibs.

only two genes were selected as cp2305-responsive genes when the fold- change in the mean expression level was set at 15-fold 15-fold criterion.

we identified 49 154 probes and four five probes annotated genes as cp2305- and placebo-responsive genes respectively fig.
