In contrast no significant effect of B. lactis NCC2818 supplementation on the metabolic profile of serum was observed at any point during the experiment data not shown.Mucosal cytokines synthesis is affected by both experimental batch and early supplemen- tation with B. lactis NCC2818 while early inflammatory markers predict later cytokine syn- thesis.

In humans administration of B. lactis NCC2818 to newborn infants was shown to promote immune developmentand response to vacci- nationwhilst in preterm infants B. lactis NCC2818 was shown to decrease intestinal permeability.

Here we provide further evidence that B. lactis NCC2818 is able to reinforce intestinal barrier integrity in the first days of life irrespective of the starting status.Although B. lactis NCC2818 had no discernible effects on the composition of the microbiota at the family level it did affect the urinary host-microbial metabolic profile e.g.

lactis B. lactis NCC2818 CNCM I-3446 previously documented for its probiotic properties in human infants- on the intestinal microbiota metabolism and mucosal immune system when supplemented from birth.

In fact animals supplemented with B.lactis NCC2818 induced a more pronounced tolerogenic cytokine response linked to increased 1 day NAG.Supplementation with B. lactis NCC2818 reduced inter-batch variation in mucosal antigen expression.

Nicholson2 Elaine Holmes2  Mick Bailey5Inflammatory and metabolic diseases can originate during early-life and have been correlated with shifts in intestinal microbial ecology.

Immunity intestinal barrier function host metabolism and host-microbiota co-metabolism were further modified by Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 supplementation although composition of the in situ microbiota remained unchanged.

Here we use the neonatal piglet to evaluate the effect of Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 subsp.

Finally we identify immune-metabolic correlations with the aim of exploring potential novel surrogate bio-markers in this tractable model species.ResultsEarly B. lactis NCC2818 administration ameliorates inter-batch differences in intestinal barrier integrity.

Supplementation with B. lactis NCC2818 was associated with increased expression of the tight-cell junction TCJ associated protein ZO-1 in the epithelium of the distal jejunum p  5.7 x 10-5 Fig.
