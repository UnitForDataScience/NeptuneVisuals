here we pres- ent the complete genomic sequence of l. jensenii snuv360 isolated from a vaginal sample from a healthy korean woman.

strains have been shown to decrease patho- genic bacteria in vaginal environments of women diagnosed with bv  .in this study the strain lactobacillus jensenii snuv360 isolated from the vaginas of healthy women shows functional properties in the treatment of vaginal infection caused by lactobacilli deficiency.

here we present the complete genome sequence of this probiotic strain.in order to perform the complete genome sequencing of the strain l. jensenii snuv360 high throughput sequencing technology was implemented using the pacbio platform pacific biosciences menlo park ca.

the l. jensenii snuv360 genome consisted of a 1672949 bp single-chromosome contig with coverage of 420x and gc content of 34.4. no plasmids were detected.the assembled genome sequences were annotated using the prokka annotation pipeline version 1.11  which predicted trna rrna and mrna genes.

the l. jensenii snuv360 genome was compared with the reference strain l. jensenii tl2937 genome accession number nzmdtn01000000 with the rapid annotations using the subsys-volume 5 issue 10 e01757-16 1lee et al.tems technology rast server .

jensenii snuv360 may assist in understanding the mechanisms involved in its effect against bacterial vaginosis.accession numbers.
