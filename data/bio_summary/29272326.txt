The culture-based methods used for the assessment of biodiversity in bioaerosols generally in- volve a first culture step of the sampled microbial pop- ulation a subsequent sub-culture step of the different types of grown colonies and then an identification pro- cess of each selected colony Supplementary Table S1.The criteria used for the identification microbial iso- lates included the classical description of macroscopic and microscopic phenotypes as well as biochemical chemical and bio-molecular features.

The method involves the cultivation of bioaerosol samples on agar media and the pick-up of grown colonies 16S rRNA gene amplification subsequent clon- ing sequencing and identification of bacterial isolates through the assignment against known gene databases.

The aim of the present paper is to discuss the contribution of the proposed method in regards with the already proposed approaches used for identification of cultured bacteria.

The method was first evaluated with an experimental microbiome pre- pared by mixing pure bacterial cultures grown in labo- ratory conditions  and then tested with bioaerosol samples collected in a ducks hatchery .Overview of Published Culture-Based MethodsThe biodiversity of airborne microbial population in occupational environments was mainly assessed by cul- tivation of microorganisms on nutrient media prior to identification.

The MALDI-TOF identification process is based on the characterization of the proteome of microbial isolates from intact cells as well as cell extracts and its comparison against a known142Annals of Work Exposures and Health 2018 Vol.

The 16S rRNA gene is the mostly targeted gene for bacterial identification in bioaerosols.Contribution to the Existing Culture-Based MethodsThe method proposed by Schafer et al.

The method involves the cultivation of bioaerosol samples on agar media and the pick-up of grown colonies 16S rRNA gene amplification subsequent cloning sequencing and identification of bacterial isolates through the assignment against known gene databases.

The subse- quent molecular identification process allowed the identifi- cation at the specie level.

This will impair the correct identification of colonies with chemical bi- ochemical as well as molecular identification methods and requires a purification checking which is laborious as well material and time consuming.

The proposed method supplements the panel of existing biodiversity ones for cultivated bacteria especially useful for infectious microorganisms as well as culture-independent ones.
