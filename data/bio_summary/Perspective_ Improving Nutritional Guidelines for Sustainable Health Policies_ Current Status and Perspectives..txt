health condition or aspect of health such as nutrition developed by a multidisciplinary panel based on an independent systematic review of the best avail- able evidence.

The agenda for the future is expected to support available methodology in nutrition research to personalize guideline recommendations properly grading the quality of the available evidence promoting adherence to the well- established evidence hierarchy in nutrition and enhancing strategies for appropriate vetting and transparent reporting that will solidify the recommendations for health promotion.

The future agenda should advance through evaluation of newly available methodology in nutrition research to personalize guideline recommendations properly grade the evidence quality adhere to evidence hierarchy in nutrition and en- hance strategies for appropriate vetting and transparent reporting to solidify the recommendations for health pro- motion.
