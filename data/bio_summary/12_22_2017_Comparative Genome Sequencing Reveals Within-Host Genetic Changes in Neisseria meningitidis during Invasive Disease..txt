For each strain pair the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments are given.doi10.1371journal.pone.0169892.g005adhesion ratio over all four strains pairs was 0.78 - 0.35 SDM indicating that blood isolates adhere slightly but not significantly less to endothelial cells than the corresponding throat iso- lates p  0.10 one-sample Wilcoxon test.Furthermore pairwise comparisons of the invasion ratios as defined for each strain by the ratio of the invasion rate of the blood isolate relative to the invasion rate of the corresponding throat isolate for detailed information see Materials and Methods section in the Supporting Information showed that with the exception of DE8678 all blood isolates were slightly but not significantly more invasive than the corresponding throat isolates in human epithelial cells average invasion ratio  6.66 - 2.26 p  0.25 Wilcoxon test and overall less invasive in human endothelial cells average invasion ratio  0.54 - 0.25 p  0.25.Given the overall very low invasion rates of less than 0.05 of the adherent bacteria as well as the very small difference between the throat and blood isolates a higher number of such throat-blood strain pairs n  10 will be required to allow for statistically more robust analy- ses of such small phenotypic differences.DiscussionSeveral studies have already used comparative genome sequencing of longitudinal paired strain samples to provide evidence for adaptive within-host evolution mostly in pathogens that cause infections lasting days to months such as Staphylococus aureus or Escherichia coli   reviewed in .

When considering each strain as a bio- logical replicate of an either throat or blood derived isolate and thus ignoring genetic differ- ences among throat isolates and among blood isolates respectively there was no significant difference in serum resistance between throat and blood isolates Wilcoxon signed rank testp  0.05.Comparison of the ex vivo fitness of meningococcal strains.

In addition in line with the fact that we could not observe any mutations in metabolic genes in the blood isolates our data reject the hypothesis that WHE selects for strains with a higher fitness in human blood 95-CI  0.0 60.2 binomial test.Throat and blood isolates differ slightly in the interaction with human cellsSince Tfp glycosylation was also shown to be important for invasion of host cells   we finally assessed the interaction of the bacterial isolates with human epithelial and endothelial cell lines for differences in adhesion andor invasion properties in vitro.

As can be seen in  the adhesion ratio to human Detroit-562 nasopharyngeal epithelial cells calculated as ratio of adherent blood isolate CFU relative to the corresponding throat isolate CFU was slightly larger than one for the strain pair DE10445DE10444 and significantly smaller than one only for the adhesion of strain pair WUE2120WUE2121 p  0.05 two-sided one-sample t-test with Bonferroni multiple testing correction Of note the latter strain pair is predicted to differ in Tfp glycosylation based on the genomic data .

Accordingly the genetic variation observed in the paired strain samples might i have occurred during in vitro cultivation subsequent to strain sampling ii have already existed when the individual was exposed to or colonized by a second invasive strain or iii result from WHE either during colonization or upon host invasion.With respect to the effect of in vitro cultivation mutations possibly occurring during culti- vation as well as the picking of colonies from agar plates which is common practice in diagnos- tic laboratories can both affect the amount of genetic changes detected by genome sequencing.

We therefore tested whether throat and blood isolates also differed in their within-host fitness as proposed by the theory of direct selec- tion during WHE  .Differences in serum resistance between strain pairs are dependent on the strain but not their source of isolationSince Tfp antigenicity andor Tfp glycosylation were shown to be important in serum resis- tance  we assessed ex vivo resistance to 10 pooled human serum in standard serum resis- tance assays.

Based on our genome-wide analysis we further assume up to n  3 97.5-percentile contingency genes differ per strain pair and patient due to in vivo SSM or gene conversion from a total of over N  250 2.5-percentile contingency genes.

The probability p that at least one gene k involved in Tfp biosynthesis is drawn by chance is given by the hypergeometric distribution HkNKn as p  Hk025073  0.081.Considering the population of IMD patients as large and practically infinite the probability P that at least two m 2 2 of the M  4 blood-throat pairs differ in at least one contingency gene involved in Tfp function can therefore be calculated by a binomial distribution BmMp as P  Bm2240.081  0.0352.In vitro passage experiments with strain WUE2121To experimentally assess the potential impact of repeated in vitro cultivation on the variability of genes that were found to differ between throat and blood isolates  we performed in vitro cultivation experiments on Columbia blood agar plates bioMe'rieux using the semi- quantitative streak method.

For each gene and locus the inferred phenotypes of the blood isolates at the protein level are given in parentheses and below the resulting expression or functional changes on or off.Illegitimate recombinationHomologous recombination gene conversionSlipped-strand mispairingno datadoi10.1371journal.pone.0169892.t002prophage we resequenced all genes that were found to differ in any of the four strain pairs compared i.e.

In addition the relation between the number of assessed genomes to the number of genes identi- fied as core and pan was assessed by calculating the number of genes present in all assessed strains core and the total number of different genes present in any of the assessed genomes pan for each possible combination of one to 27 genomes.
