when considering each strain as a bio- logical replicate of an either throat or blood derived isolate and thus ignoring genetic differ- ences among throat isolates and among blood isolates respectively there was no significant difference in serum resistance between throat and blood isolates wilcoxon signed rank testp  0.05.comparison of the ex vivo fitness of meningococcal strains.

as can be seen in  the adhesion ratio to human detroit-562 nasopharyngeal epithelial cells calculated as ratio of adherent blood isolate cfu relative to the corresponding throat isolate cfu was slightly larger than one for the strain pair de10445de10444 and significantly smaller than one only for the adhesion of strain pair wue2120wue2121 p  0.05 two-sided one-sample t-test with bonferroni multiple testing correction of note the latter strain pair is predicted to differ in tfp glycosylation based on the genomic data .

variants were then extracted from the pileup file using the following command bcftools view -svcg pileup  rawvariants.variant filteringfor each strain the detected variants were classified into two categories variants detected in either the throat or the blood isolate unique variants and variants detected in the throat as well as the blood isolate common variants.

we assumed that each strain was first streaked out in the diagnostic labo- ratory on an agar plate from a positive blood culture bottle according to standard recommen- dations on the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis  passage 1 and subcultivated a second time on another agar plate for the preparation of a swab to be sent to the national ref- erence laboratory for meningococci for strain typing passage 2. after receiving the swab each strain is routinely subcultivated on an agar plate passage 3 from which another subcul- ture is prepared for long-time storage in a freezer passage 4. from this stock bacteria are taken and cultivated on an agar plate for isolation of genomic dna and sequencing passage5.

the illumina reads were mapped to the corresponding assembled throat isolate genomes and variant calling was performed on these alignments yield- ing in total 2751 variants before any filtering raw variants of which 547 were either detected in the throat or the blood isolate genomes unique variants and 2204 were detected in the throat as well as the blood isolate genomes common variants .

we therefore tested whether throat and blood isolates also differed in their within-host fitness as proposed by the theory of direct selec- tion during whe  .differences in serum resistance between strain pairs are dependent on the strain but not their source of isolationsince tfp antigenicity andor tfp glycosylation were shown to be important in serum resis- tance  we assessed ex vivo resistance to 10 pooled human serum in standard serum resis- tance assays.

accordingly the genetic variation observed in the paired strain samples might i have occurred during in vitro cultivation subsequent to strain sampling ii have already existed when the individual was exposed to or colonized by a second invasive strain or iii result from whe either during colonization or upon host invasion.with respect to the effect of in vitro cultivation mutations possibly occurring during culti- vation as well as the picking of colonies from agar plates which is common practice in diagnos- tic laboratories can both affect the amount of genetic changes detected by genome sequencing.

the probability p that at least one gene k involved in tfp biosynthesis is drawn by chance is given by the hypergeometric distribution hknkn as p  hk025073  0.081.considering the population of imd patients as large and practically infinite the probability p that at least two m 2 2 of the m  4 blood-throat pairs differ in at least one contingency gene involved in tfp function can therefore be calculated by a binomial distribution bmmp as p  bm2240.081  0.0352.in vitro passage experiments with strain wue2121to experimentally assess the potential impact of repeated in vitro cultivation on the variability of genes that were found to differ between throat and blood isolates  we performed in vitro cultivation experiments on columbia blood agar plates biome'rieux using the semi- quantitative streak method.

based on our genome-wide analysis we further assume up to n  3 97.5-percentile contingency genes differ per strain pair and patient due to in vivo ssm or gene conversion from a total of over n  250 2.5-percentile contingency genes.

the result of phase-variation in strain- pairs from imd patients can be modelled by a random experiment in which the result of each draw the finite number of contingency genes that differ between the throat and the cor- responding blood isolate can be classified into one of two mutually exclusive categories whether they code for tfp function or not and the sampling occurs without replacement.accordingly out of n  250 contingency genes of which k  7 are involved in tfp function n  3 are randomly drawn without replacement.

in addition the relation between the number of assessed genomes to the number of genes identi- fied as core and pan was assessed by calculating the number of genes present in all assessed strains core and the total number of different genes present in any of the assessed genomes pan for each possible combination of one to 27 genomes.

the power law function was defined as a  ib  c. for the description of the pan ssr loci the starting values were set to a  100 b  0.4 c  -100. for the description of the core ssr loci the starting values were set to a  100 b  -0.6 c  100. confidence intervals to a confidence level of 0.95 were computed from the fitted models using the function confint.cluster of orthologous groups cog enrichment analysiswe used gene set enrichment analysis to analyze the distribution of genes identified as ssr loci over the different cog functional classes  and to assess whether potentially phase-variable genes code for certain functions more frequently than expected by chance.as this approach requires whole-genome sequences we consequently retrieved only fully sequenced assembled and annotated meningococcal genomes from the ncbi public data- base totaling 27 at the time of analysis may 2016. genes of all assessed n. meningitidis genomes were further functionally annotated using the cognitor framework provided bymicroscope  and gene set enrichment analysis was per- formed using the fisher's exact test together with the benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple testing .whole-genome alignments of st-11 genomesthe progressivemauve algorithm as implemented in the mauve software package  was used for whole-genome alignments of strains from the st-11 clonal complex .
