By analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of soil bacterial communities along a natural gradient of soils under the influence of the same meta-community and environmental variation we have recently shown that soil type exerts greater effect on rhizosphere communities than plant as indicated by the fact that the rhizosphere microbiome followed the changes observed in the bulk soil.

It remains unclear however how soil properties would influence this selection and whether microbial functionality is mostly driven by plant-specific selection or by the soil parameters.In this study we aim at exploring the importance of the selective force exerted by the plant in regulating the functionality of plant-associated bacterial species in different soil types along a salt marsh primary succession chronosequence       .

In this study we use soil stage as a proxy of soil type as previous work has revealed that the sedimentation caused by the tidal regime has resulted in modifications on the soil physicochemical conditions along the primary succession leading to an accumulation of silt and clay particles.

Rhizosphere soil samples were collected by weighting ten grams of roots with tightly adhering soil particles about 3 g rhizosphere soil.

Here we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence that represents over 100 years of soil development to assess how the functional traits of plant associated bacteria respond to soil type plant species and plant compartment.
