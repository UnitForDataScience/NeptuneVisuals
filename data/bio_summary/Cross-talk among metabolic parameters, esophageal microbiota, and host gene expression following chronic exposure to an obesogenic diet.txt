Lactobacillus taxa were consistently found to be enriched in the lower esophagus as compared to the upper esophagus in each of the control fed and HFD fed rats Relative abundance CU 3.58 CL 25.08 HFU 2.15 HFL 12.86 2G.nMDS plots identified some separation across diet  Supplementary file 1 and significant differences PERMANOVA were found in the lower esophageal microbiota between control and HFD fed rats at the order family genus and OTU levels 2F.

email relationship between unhealthy diets higher BMIs and the esophageal microbiota is limited to the identification using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of a decrease in Lactobacillus abundance in the distal oesophagus of Sprague-Dawley rats fed a HFD.Given the lack of information surrounding the underlying mechanisms for the link between obesity and eso- phageal disease in this study we examined metabolic parameters esophageal microbiota and host esophageal expression of a range of markers involved in inflammation and fatty acid metabolism of two groups of rats fed control or a HFD for 16 weeks and determined the associations between these factors.ResultsRats fed a high fat diet gained more fat and developed insulin resistance.

An insulin tolerance test conducted at 15 weeks of diet showed an increased AUC P  0.061 in HFD fed rats as compared to control fed rats 1C which was suggestive of reduced insulin sensitivity in the HFD fed rats.One control fed rat that gained a comparable amount of weight to HFD fed rats was considered an outlier and excluded from the above analyses Supplementary file 1.

The consequences on the host of an esophageal microbiota rich in Rothia and Fusobacterium species should be examined in the future in the context of increased inflammation and histological changes observed in the EAC cascade.The predicted esophageal bacterial metagenome total genomic information of the rats showed that carot- enoid biosynthesis counts were significantly decreased in the lower esophagus of HFD fed rats when compared to control rats.

Further while not identified using LEfSe there appeared to be a decrease in abundance of Lactobacillus in the lower esophagus of HFD-fed rats CL 25.08 HFL 12.86.Of interest the upper and lower esophageal microbiota of the outlier control rat were comparable to other control rats Supplementary file 1.Composition of the esophageal microbiota correlates with metabolic parameters.

However the effect of HFD on the esophageal microbiota does not appear to be as pronounced as has been previously observed for the intestinal microbiota.One bacterial taxon that was found to be significantly enriched following HFD in both the upper and lower esophagus was Clostridium sensu stricto.

HFD fed rats gained more weight than controls and at the end of the experiment 16 weeks of diet HFD fed rats were significantly heavier than control fed rats Delta Body Weight Control 487.7 - 17.8 g HFD 593.6 - 14.8 g P  0.0014 A.

We observed a significant difference between the upper and lower esophageal microbiota in control fed rats emphasized by enrichment of Lactobacillus species in the lower esophagus.

HFD Black triangle Control Gray inverted triangle.E Comparison of the esophageal microbiota between upper and lower segments at all taxonomic levels using PERMANOVA in each of the control and HFD rat groups.

Thus it would be of interest to determine if SCFA levels are higher in the esophagus of HFD fed rats and how this may impact the esophageal microenvironment.Consistent correlations were observed across metabolic parameters the composition of the esophageal micro- biota and host gene expression.
