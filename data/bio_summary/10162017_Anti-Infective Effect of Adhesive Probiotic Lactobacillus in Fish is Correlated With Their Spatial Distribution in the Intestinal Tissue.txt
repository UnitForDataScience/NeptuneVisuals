The different protection ability between LGG and PB22 did not involve the intestinal microbiota however LGG induced injury to the mucosa of zebrafish.

C The overall colonization level of LGG or PB22 in fish gut at 107 cfuml immersion.D Spatial distribution of LGG or PB22 at 107 cfuml immersion.

The injury of LGG to the intestine of zebrafish was a surprising result as LGG has been reported to protect the intestinalepithelium from damage in mice.

Moreover LGG showed a mucosa type distribution with the majority of LGG cells bound in the mucosa zone Fig.

Next the isogenic pili-deficient LGG mutant strain PB22was used to investigate whether the well-studied mucus-binding pili of LGG influence its spatial distribution.
