generally bidirectional linkages between the gut microbiome and immune system have been well documented.56 gut microbiota have been associated with a number of disease states including asthma autoimmune disorders cardiovas- cular diseases and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.5-7this review assessed the association between tb infection and disease and the gut and lung microbiome.

tuberculosis stimulation of human peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells physiological concentrations of the scfa butyrate significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production.39 given the importance of the cell-mediated response including treg cells42 against tb infection scfa production is one hypothesized mechanism of the link between the microbiome and tb infection and disease.overall the gut microbiome of tb samples had lower bacterial abundance and composition relative to controls.sample sizetable 1studies assessing the association between tb and the lung and gut microbiomeoutcomemurinemodel5 female balbc micemarylandtb infection aerosolized mycobacterium tuberculosis cdc1551 strainbacterial diversitystool16s rrna sequencingv1-v2pre- vs. postinfectionalpha diversity shannon diversity index postinfection decreasein all micebeta diversity pcoa unifrac p  0.00188 otus more abundant preinfection q  0.01majority of30differential otusfirmicutes phylarelative species abundance of lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae and bacteriodales order greater preinfection and among controlscasestudy5 female balbc micepatient with multidrug- resistant tb5 mice11 age- matched-marseille francetb infection aerosolizedtuberculosish37rv strain-microbialdiversitystool16s and 18s rrnasequencing culturetb vs. controldifferential clustering pcoa unifrac distances p  0.00173 different otusq  0.01v6 depleted gut microbiota3139 bacterial speciesphylotypesotusmost phyla from pyrosequencing confirmed with culture firmicutes actinobacteriaproteobacteria except fusobacteria species only culture and cyanobacteria chloroplast only pyrosequencingcontinuedsample sizetable 1continuedoutcomecasecontrol31 patients with pulmonary tb24 controlsshanghaichinatb statusbacterial diversitysputum cases saliva  pharyngeal secretions controls16s rrnasequencingnew species detected by culture candidatus paenibacillus antibioticophila and 18s rrna sequencing3 fungal speciesv3tb vs. control32greater phyla and genera richness among patients with tb 24 phyla564 genera vs.controls 17 phyla235 generamost prevalent phyla firmicutes proteobacteria bacteriodetes crenarchaeota and actinobacterialower bacteriodetes and higher actinobacteria prevalencecertain genera stenotrophomonas cupriavidus pseudomonasthermus and phyla aquificae planctomycetes only intb samplesdifferential clustering pcoa unifrac distancescontinuedsample sizetable 1continuedoutcome32 patients with unilateral pulmonary tb24 healthy controlsjiangsu chinatb statusbacterial diversitybronchoalveolar lavage cases saliva pharyngeal secretions controls16s rrnasequencingv3tb vs. control36clustering pcoa unifrac distances distinctgenus most abundant genus differedtb uninfected vs. infected lungsclustering pcoa unifrac distances similargenus mycobacteria and porphyromonas abundances greater insidetb lesionsshannon diversity index higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from lungs with lesionscompared with controls22 patients with tb14 controls with tb-like coughinghong kong sarchinatb statusbacterial diversitysputum16s rrna sequencingv1-v2tb vs. control33phyla lower firmicutes and higher proteobacteria and bacteriodetes abundancegenra lower streptococcus and higher neisseria and prevotellaotus 8 more prevalent 2 less prevalentcontinuedsample sizetable 1continuedoutcomegroup 1 newly diagnosed pulmonary tbn  25group 2 recurrent tbn  30group 3 treatment failuren  206 patients with tbgroup 4 healthy controls n  206 controls without tbshanghai chinamedellin colombiatb statusbacterial diversitytb statusbacterial and fungi diversitysputum cases throat swabs controlssputum oropharyngeal nasal samples16s rrnasequencing16s rrnasequencing bacteria fungi fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribe spacer1 regionsno differences in clustering pcoa unifrac distancesoverall98 of identified sequences accounted for5 phyla proteobacteria firmicutes bacteriodetes fusobacteria actinobacteriamost prevalent bacterial genera neisseria prevotella streptococcusv1-v2 clustering pcoaunifrac distances differed between groups 1 and 3vs.

one of these overarching knowledge gaps involves inter individual variability which is a key focus area of the human microbiome project.48 what is the extent that a core set of human microbiome genes or species is shared between individuals48 in addition what are the temporal changes of lung and gut microbiota including throughout tb disease progression and treatment separately to what extent does cross talk occur between the lung and gut micro- biome particularly in response to tb infection and disease- related perturbances followingly do these interactions between the respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome modulate immune responses to tb infection and diseaseconclusionbased on preliminary evidence from studies in this review the lung and gut microbiome were associated with tb infec- tion and disease.

gut bacteria play important roles in nutrient metabolism intestinal homeostasis through preventing overgrowth of intestinal pathogens and immu- nity.51213 several studies have examined the associations between altered gut microbiota and clinical pathologies includ- ing inflammatory bowel disease diabetes and obesity.5614historically the lower respiratory tract has been considered sterile in healthy individuals but recent culture-independent studies have shown evidence to the contrary.1516 given the limited available studies focusing on the lung microbiome one key research gap is determining whether the observed microbiota are simply a continuation of the upper respiratory tract or separate.

conversely specific commensal gut microorganism species have been observed to modulate the immune system.23-26 gut bacteria species bacteroides fragilis species clostridium genus were associated with altered treg cell counts function and development.2324 previous studies have reported the influ- ence of bacteria on respiratory health including 1 airway inflammation and 2 lung damage in the context of influenza and probiotic supplementation.

specific commensal microorganisms may facilitate the cell-mediated immune response to tb infection and disease and modulate inflam- mation and lung damage through functional changes of the metagenome and metabolite production.1213tb and the microbiomein this review eight studies examined the association between pulmonary tb infection and disease and the micro- biome including an animal study30 a case report31 and 6 case-control studies table 1.2132-36 key study findings are highlighted in the following two sections regarding tb and the gut or lung microbiome respectively and study methodology is compared in the third section.tb and the gut microbiome.

specifically it is important to assess 1 the sputum and gut microbiome as risk factors for tb infection and disease susceptibility disease progression and treatment outcomes and 2 the effects of tb infection and disease on the sputum and gut microbiome which can sub- sequently impact health via alteration of immune responses.received july 17 2016. accepted for publication january 23 2017.published online february 27 2017.acknowledgments we thank michael s. glickman for his comments and suggestions and tnq tnq.co.in for their assistance with the graphic design of figure 1.financial support research reported in this publication was supported by the human ecology alumni association of cornell uni- versity for madeleine r. wood and the national institutes of health national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases t32-dk007158 award for elaine a. yu.disclaimer the content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases niddk or the national institutes of health.disclosure madeleine r. wood and elaine a. yu have no conflicts of interest.

this review examined the associations between tb and the gut and lung microbiome.

current evidence suggests that the gut and lung microbiome are associated with tb infection and disease.

in summary the dynamic interplay between host immune response and m. tuberculosis survival mechanisms such as t cell homeostasis is modulated through numerous factors potentially including the microbiome.the gut and lung microbiome.

murine studies involv- ing gut microbiota have provided evidence of the modulation of microbiota by the immune system.

between the lung and gut microbiome and dysbiotic microbiota may adversely influence some clinical pathologies.microbial diversity is hypothesized to affect the growth of particular opportunistic pathogens due to resource competi- tion.

in germ-free mice increased airway inflammation was rescued by the administration of certain bacterial species faecalibacterium lachnospira rothia and veillonella.26 similarly greater abundance of bacteria species veillonella prevotella in the supraglottic- characteristic taxa were associated with higher indicators of airway inflammation.27moreover two studies showed links between gut bacteria and lung damage.

disrupted gut microbiota decreased bifidobacterium and lactobacillus was associated with altered immune response to influenza a infection and increased lung damage in a murine model.28 separately probiotic supplementation of bifidobacterium was associated with improved toll-like receptor 7 response and reduced lung damage.28 one hypothesis is that probiotics are protec- tive against pneumococcal disease through modulating the upper respiratory tract microbiome.29in summary given these dynamic bidirectional interactions between the microbiome and host immunity commensal bacteria could have a role in the immunological response to pulmonary tb infection and disease.
