Changes in glucose homeostasis after Roux-en- Y gastric bypass surgery for obesity at day three two months and one year after surgery role of gut peptides.

The existing pharmaceutical and other nonsurgical treatments for morbid obesity produce suboptimal physi- ologic outcomes compared with those of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB surgery.

For instance Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB surgery can induce a staggering 40 total body weight loss that is sustained for a lifetime.

Although the procedure was initially designated as a treatment for peptic ulcers clinicians soon realized thatTable 1Physiological changes following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB surgery in human and rodentsContinued Table 1Continued  Hormonal changesAbbreviations BCFA branched-chain fatty acid CCK cholecystokinin GLP glucagon-like peptide PYY peptide YY SCFA short-chain fatty acid.patients experience significant weight loss after the operation 17.

46 multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of gastric bypass surgery especially RYGB in improving insulin sensitivity.

However this study looked at only short-termFigure 2Alterations of hormones mediated by the anatomical reconfiguration after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB surgery.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery increases respiratory quotient and energy expenditure during food intake.
