In this regard risk factors including adipose tissue dysfunction mitochondrial dysfunction myofiber types and gut microbiota have been reported to be asso- ciated with insulin resistance and obesity and will be discussed first.Adipose tissue composition and function at a glanceOverweight andor obesity continue to rise at an alarming rate worldwide and adipose tissue plays a vital role in the regulation of energy homeostasis.

Adipose tissue is mainly composed of three types of fat namely white adipose tissue WAT brown adipose tissue BAT and the 'beigebrite' brown in white fat .

Upon systemic metabolic demand the unparalleled capacity of adipose tissue for lipid storage and release links the cell biology of the adipose tissue physiology to whole-body metabolism .

Taken together the functions of adipose tissue include adipogenesis lipid metabolism adipokine synthesis andor secretion and thermogenesis.Adipose tissue dysfunction obesity and T2DMThe first organ influenced by excessive fat intake is the WAT responding by higher fat deposition and consecutive hypertrophy and hyperplasia adipocytes .

In general adipose tissue dysfunction is characterized by the inability of adipose tissue to store the surplus free FAs FFAs  decreased production of adiponectin and increased pro- duction of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a leptin and IL-6 .

Intriguingly many factors including adipose tissue dys- function mitochondrial dysfunction alterations in the muscle fiber phenotype and in the gut microbiota compo- sition have been identified to be involved in the develop- ment of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Therefore obesity has been considered to be a chronic disease that requires medical prevention and treatment.Intriguingly many factors have been identified to be involved in the development of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders such as adipose tissue dysfunction alterations in myofiber types mitochondrial dysfunction changes in the gut bacterial composition as well as others that are not listed in the present review have been associ- ated with obesity development and contribute to this low- grade systemic inflammation subsequently leading to insulin resistance and probably T2DM -.

In this context interest in better understanding the composition and function of adipose tissue is rapidly rising in current medical research .

Notably the primary cell type of adipose tissue is the adipocyte .
