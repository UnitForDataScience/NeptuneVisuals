Classification of Cross-Feeding InteractionsaaBased on the directionality and cost of metabolite production cross-feeding interactions can be classified into four basiccategories i one-way by-product cross-feeding ii two-way by-product cross-feeding iii by-product reciprocity andiv cooperative cross-feeding.

Together the abovementioned studies provide compelling evidence that obligate cross-feeding interactions  are actually common in natural bacterial communities.Evolution of Obligate Cross-Feeding InteractionsHow can we envisage the emergence of obligate cross-feeding interactions that could explain the abovementioned unculturability of environmental bacteria In the following we present a working hypothesis that provides an adaptive explanation for why bacteria become metaboli- cally dependent on one another as well as detail the evolutionary consequences resulting from this loss of metabolic autonomy.

As a consequence two partners that engage in such an obligate reciprocal cross-feeding interac- tion couple their evolutionary fate an increased cooperative investment on one side for example by a mutation that increases metabolite production is directly rewarded by an increased metabolite production by the respective other partner in return cooperative cross-feeding 27TDDIF.Reciprocation can be achieved fairly easily for example by two auxotrophic genotypes encountering each other two-way by-product cross-feeding .

For example cells living in a reciprocal cross-feeding interaction immediately benefit from increasing the investment that is directed towards their interaction partner C. In the long run this positive feedback should result in increased production levels of the exchanged metabolites within a cluster of cross-feeding cells D. Experimental studies in which pairs of cross-feeding genotypes were experimentally coevolved indeed support this prediction .

D Positive feedback among interacting cells selects for an increased metabolite production of both interaction partners thus causing the evolution of a cooperative cross-feeding interaction.Concluding Remarks Taken together given their stability and the ease with which metabolic cross-feeding can evolve in microbial populations a coevolutionary race in which all involved partners omit more and more biochemical functions that can be compensated for by their corresponding counterparts is expected to result in the emergence of obligate metabolic dependencies.

Clusters of cross-feeding bacteria emerge through contact-dependent interactions grey area around the cells and cells within clusters are transmitted between cluster generations either vertically budding fission or horizontally aggregation and disaggregation of cells.

In the case of cross-feeding bacterial consortia intercellular nanotubes could represent such an adaptation because these structures are known to also function between different bacterial species .Moreover auxotrophic bacteria can likely satisfy their nutritional requirements by interacting with a number of different bacterial genotypes and do not necessarily require a specific interaction partner.

Their increased Darwinian fitness will likely allow them to export their enhancedproductivity also to other local patches leading to a dissemination of cooperative cross-feeding within and between microbial communities.Coevolutionary ConsequencesThe first mutation deactivating a gene that is vitally involved in the biosynthesis of an essential metabolite such as amino acids or nucleotides renders the survival of the resulting mutant obligately dependent on an environmental supply of the lacking metabolite B. Auxo- trophic bacteria that derive key metabolites from other organisms should thus experience a strong selection pressure to remain associated with cells that can satisfy their requirements.

Given the tremendous fitness advantage bacteria gain when losing one biosynthetic function  the continued coexistence with other cross-feeding genotypes likely rewards mutants with even more reduced genomes .
