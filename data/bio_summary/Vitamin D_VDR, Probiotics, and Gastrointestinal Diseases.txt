After supplementation with recommended doses of vitamin D and reserving saturation of 125OH D3 the serumconcentration of vitamin D and health related quality of life can be improved 16 17.However more recently a study showed that daily supplementation with 1000 IU of vitamin D3 1200 mg of calcium or both did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas after its removal over a period of 3 to 5 years 18.A variety of factors may reduce vitamin D absorption including limited exposure to sunlight dark skin obesity and problems with absorption or the ability to convert vitamin D to its active form.
