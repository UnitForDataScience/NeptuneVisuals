The sequencing of 16S rRNA has been successfully applied for bacterial genus classification  while molecular markers such as repetitive- element PCR rep-PCR has been aiding the classification of bacterial isolates by genomic fingerprint patterns  .Owing to bring up to date the researches comprising bacterial contamination of anterior chamber after phacoemulsification of dogs this study aimed to identify bacterial contaminants of aqueous humor of dogs during the surgery with intraocular lens implantation by mole- cular approaches and genetically correlate them with those present in the conjunctival surface.Methods techniquesPatientsA total of 20 non-diabetic dogs of different breeds affected by bi- lateral immature or mature cataracts were sampled.

Bayesian analysis of 16S rRNA region of the representative bacterial isolates obtained from con- junctival surface and aqueous humor samples of dogs submitted to phacoemulsification.Table 1Number of positive bacterial colonies from conjunctival surface C and aqueous humor samples collected before and after phacoemulsification HB and HA of three dogs that had their anterior chamber contaminated during the surgery.Fig.

Even after contamination of the anterior chamber the dogs 1 and 4 did not de- velop endophthalmitis.DiscussionSome of the bacterial strains and genus identified in aqueous humor samples were not present in those from conjunctival surface which leads us to point out not only the microbiota from conjunctival surface as source of contamination but also additional sources.Bacterial growth has been reported in conjunctival surface in 65 of cases in humans  and 81.8 in dogs  .

The dogs did not show systemic or ophthalmic diseases and sequelae of ocular in- flammation except for the cataracts.Preoperative therapyOne hour before surgery the dogs received one drop of topical combination of dexamethasone and tobramycin Tobradex Alcon Labs Sao Paulo Brazil.

belongs to the bacterial flora of conjunctival surface of dogs and is considered the most abundant genus in clinically healthy dogs .

The significant genetic diversity of bacterial isolates found in the aqueous humor samples after surgery denoted the possibility of anterior chamber contamination during phacoemulsification by bacteria not only from conjunctival surface but also from different sources related to surgical environment.IntroductionPhacoemulsification is the current technique of choice for cataract surgery in dogs.

A previous study has demonstrated that microorganisms present in the anterior chamber of dogs' eyes after phacoemulsification were similar to those detected in conjunctival surface by bacteriological culture and Corresponding author.R03e7ce8i-v1e1d3525 cAu2g0u1s7t 2E0ls1e7vieRreBce.Viv.eAdllinrigrehvtsisreedseforvrmed.17 November 2017 Accepted 18 November 2017Fig.

In other studies con- tamination of anterior chamber in humans were reported in 1.8  to 5  of the cases.The most common microorganisms identified in dogs' conjunctiva are gram-positive bacteria although the gram-negative ones have also been isolated .

In the literature contamination of anterior chamber after phacoemulsification in dogs by bacterial strains similar to those present in conjunctival surface was reported for the species Staphylo- coccus epidermidis  Pantoea agglomerans and Bacillus sp.

Even though three dogs showed the presence of viable potential pathogenic bacteria in their anterior chamber at the end of surgery none of the eyes developed untreatable infectious endophthalmitis.
