we therefore use the term resident microbiota in this review to describe the aggregate pathogenic commensal symbiotic endogenous microbiota in the intestine.pathobiontspotentially pathogenic microorganisms residing in the microbiota.dysbiosisa perturbation that departs from an otherwise balanced ecology to prolong exacerbate or induce a detrimental health effect.prebioticsnutritional substrates that promote the growth of microbes that confer a health benefit on the host.probioticsa live microorganism that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.synbioticsformulations consisting of a combination of pre- and probiotics.fecal microbiota transplantation fmt the introduction of a liquid filtrate of stools from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of an ill patient.selective decontamination of the digestive tract sdduse of daily antibiotics with the aim of preventing hospital-acquired infections while preserving the anaerobic microbiota.published up through 2017 were reviewed within rayyan.

finally the microbiota and intestinal epithelium continually interact leading to innate and adap- tive immune signaling that likely maintain intestinal immune homeostasis throughout life.table 2. techniques used to study the structure and function of the intestinal microbiomenamepurposemethodbiomarker sequencingstudies of the sequence variation of 1 ubiquitous gene eg 16s ribosomal ribo-nucleic acid rna for bacteria to describe microbial composition within an environmental studynext-generation sequencingmetagenomicsstudies of the function of all genetic material within an environmental studynext-generation sequencing metatranscriptomicsstudies of gene expression at the rna levelnext-generation sequencingmetaproteomicsstudies of gene expression at the protein levelliquid or gas chromatography mass spectometrymetabolomicsstudies of metabolite formation by the microbiotaliquid or gas chromatography mass spectometryfigure 1. a schematic overview of the infectious diseases in which there is a proven therapeutic role for microbiome manipulation through either probiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation left panel and an overview of the subjects for which there is a strong correlation between microbiome composition and risk of infectious disease right panel.

the long-held belief that antibiotics have no effect on viral infections is challenged by these animal models demonstrating how antibiotic-induced alteration of the microbiota impacts both viral replication and host viral immunity.enteric bacterial infectionsa key concept underpinning the importance of the intestinal microbiota to infectious diseases is termed colonization resist- ance.

this symbiotic conceptualization of the microbiota protecting the host against enteric infections and the host protecting the colonizing microbiota is termed coloniza- tion resistance .

antibiotics deplete sensi- tive microbiota resulting in decreased microbiota signaling and diminished local and systemic immune responses to c difficile.

infectious disease physicians and micro- biologists long trained in recognizing and treating individual human pathogens are increasingly recognizing a need to incor- porate the findings arising from the nascent microbiome field into their daily clinical practice.much of the current understanding of the intestinal microbi- ome is made possible by the application of culture-independent high-throughput deoxyribonucleic acids equencing techniques to describe the community structures and functions of the microorganisms microbiota residing in the human intestinal tract.

imbalance in the microbiota composition or function or dysbiosis also asso- ciate with numerous diseases ranging from inflammatory bowel disease and atopy to diabetes obesity and arthritis  .

however the more correct term describing the resident microbiota in the intestines may be amphibiont organisms that may have a pathogenic detrimental commensal neutral or symbiotic relationship beneficial with the host.

millions of years of evolution have shaped the interactions between bacterial communities andthe human body and there are elegant mutualistic relation- ships between the human host and microbiota.

viral enteric infections illustrate the trilateral relationship binding infectious disease pathogens intestinal microbiota and host immunity.

numerous pediatric enteric viruses including polio norovirus and rotavirus have likely evolved to exploit the bacterial microbiota for immune evasion entry and replication in the gut.

in antibiotic-depleted mice rotavirus similarly has diminished replication and infectivity .the bacterial microbiota can also calibrate innate immune responses to viruses.

in addition when the microbiota is disrupted with antibiotics during a murine norovirus infection the innate immune system is capable of clearing the norovirus infection via interferon-l signaling .

enteric bacteria causing infections can be exogenous pathogens or pathobionts--potentially path- ogenic microorganisms already part of the resident microbiota .
