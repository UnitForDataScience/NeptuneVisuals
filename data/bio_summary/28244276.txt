Exploration of new microbial strains and products for agricultural use is greatly helped by the increasing num- ber of complete microbial genomes on public and private databases.Current microbial products typically contain one or several microbial species and represent microbes that can be cultured.

1.Challenges and outlooksAll indicators suggest the use of microbiome tools and microbial products in agriculture have great potential to create new industries and boost economic growth and job creation.

These beneficial microbial productsgenes can be used in future to manipulate the microbiome in situ or used to geneti- cally modify crops for more efficient production.Role in regional prosperity job creation and boosting activities of allied industriesThe wider use of microbiome tools in agriculture can significantly increase regional growth if the demand and supply routes are regionally locked.

consumer's demand of chemical-free food and environ- ment preservation pressures are other key drivers that provide the impetus towards green and renewable tech- nologies for sustainable farming.Initial outcomes from microbiome approaches and emerging industriesAlthough still in its infancy the use of and market for microbiome-derived tools the term used here is broad in nature and include both the whole microbial community as well as single species products in agriculture is growing rapidly.

Similarly Bioag Alliance a joint venture between Monsanto and Novozyme has announced a number of new microbial products which can substantially increase corn productivity by enhancing nutrient uptake and nematicidal activities.

Our ability to manipulate entire microbiomes in situ could open up an entirely new industry which could include 'green' chemistry microbial cocktails and or based on synthetic biology.

Additionally microbial products will require different formulations and delivery technologies requiring new or modified technologies.

All approaches described above will benefit from the ability to tap into the ever-increasing metagenomic data produced from microbiome research and allow the identification of addi- tional genes and microbial products without the need for culturing to provide agricultural yield benefits.

Similarly a new approach is being considered for the plant breed- ing industry where the retention and promotion of the plant beneficial microbiome are being considered.
