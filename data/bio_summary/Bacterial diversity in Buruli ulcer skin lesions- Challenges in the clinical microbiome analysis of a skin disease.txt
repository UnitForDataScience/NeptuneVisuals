2017 Bacterial diversity in Buruli ulcer skin lesions Challenges in the clinical microbiome analysis of a skin disease.

However ade- quately studying the human microbiome in a clinical setting can prove difficult when investi- gating a neglected tropical skin disease due to its rarity and the setting.MethodologyPrincipal findingsUsing 16S rRNA sequencing we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples.

The totality of microorganisms and their collective genetic material present on the skin is called the skin microbiome.

With molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing this bias is reduced yielding a more precise overview of the bacteria present within the ulcers and their relative abundances.The totality of microbes present on the human skin is referred to as the skin microbiome .

Additionally since the microbiome dif- fers between body sites sufficient samples should be taken from the same site on different patients and controls for proper comparisons.In this pilot study we compared the microbial population associated with BU andnon-BU skin samples from patients with ulcers of different etiology collected in Benin and healthy skin samples from similar body sites collected from the same BU endemicarea and from public datasets to look for shifts in the microbial diversity associated withM.

In addition to ensuring a wide yet comparable spread of ages samples from contralateral unaffected skin are needed to control for genetic differences for specific body sites with diverse ecology and bacterial distribution and to compare with as healthy skin controls.

Studies comparing healthy skin and psoriatic lesions with skin biopsies as a sampling method had 10-15 patients per sample group .

This is not a problem restricted to BU as similar numbers would be required for other neglected tropical skin diseases such as yaws up to 20000 cases per year in some countries  and even more prominent skin diseases such as cutaneous leishmania- sis 70000-1.2 million cases per year  and leprosy 250000 cases per year  for which a previous microbiome study was undertaken but with no matching non-leprosy lesions or local healthy controls .
