fecal samples were then thawed extracted as previously described910 and fecal canine calprotectin s100a12 and ca1pi concentrations were measured using established immunoassays.8-10 bacte- rial dna was extracted from each fecal sample and was analyzed for proteobacteria ruminococcaceae faecal- ibacterium spp.

concentrations of fecal canine calprotectin s100a12 and ca1pi as well as the abundance of fecal bacterial dna were compared using a friedman test with dunn's post hoc tests.

further longitudinal studies including larger numbers of dogs with idiopathic ahds are war- ranted to evaluate the role of intestinal dysbiosis in canine ahds.the results of this investigation suggest that canine ahds is associated with a significant but transient gas- trointestinal loss of protein intestinal inflammation and an intestinal bacterial dysbiosis that appears to outlast both the loss of proteins and inflammation.acknowledgmentwe thank dr. niels gru tzner for critically reviewing this manuscript.footnotesa idexx vet med labor gmbh ludwigsburg germany.

a blood culture was also performed for each dog and feces were collected for a fecal examination which included a direct examination nano3 flotation aerobic culture for bacteriaa and specific diagnostic testing for giardia sp.b canine parvovirusc c. perfringens enterotoxind and clostridium difficile toxin ab.e diagnostic imaging and additional diagnostic tests eg acth stimulation test were performed at the discretion of the attending clin- ician.

all dogs were diagnosed with idiopathic ahds based on the exclusion of an underlying condition.at the time of presentation fecal canine calprotectin s100a12 and ca1pi were above the suggested reference intervals in 6 86 6 86 and 5 71 of the 7 dogs respectively.

in addition588intestinal inflammation as measured by concentrations of fecal canine calprotectin and s100a12 decreased over the same time period.

these changes while not specific to ahds are consistent with the mucosal necrosis and influx of inflammatory cells previously observed in en- doscopic small and large intestinal mucosal biopsy sam- ples from dogs with ahds.7compared to concentrations of ca1pi both fecal ca- nine calprotectin and s100a12 concentrations decreased after 3 days of therapy suggesting that intestinal inflam- mation is a more likely explanation of the increased fe- cal canine calprotectin and s100a12 concentrations than loss of inflammatory cells although further studies are needed to definitively differentiate between these pos- sibilities.

difficile toxin ab in fecal samples of dogs in this study both 29 agrees with prior reports4 and supports the conclusion that these toxins do not play a significant role in canine ahds.

development and ana- lytic validation of an immunoassay for the quantification of canine s100a12 in serum and fecal samples and its biological variability in serum from healthy dogs.

no differences in the abundance of bacterial groups over time was seen except for a mild but significant decrease in ruminococcaceae at day 3.significance - these results suggest that canine ahds is associated with a significant but transient gastroin- testinal loss of protein and intestinal inflammation.

clinical disease severity was evaluated every 24 hours using the canine hge activity index hgeai11 which considers the following clinical parameters gen- eral attitude appetite vomiting stool consistency stool frequency and dehydration.

all dogs tested negative for canine parvovirus and no salmonella sp.
