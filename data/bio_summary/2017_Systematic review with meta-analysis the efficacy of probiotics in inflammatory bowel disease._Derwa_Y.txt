results in clinical trials have been mixed with some studies showing an improvement in maintenance of remission or induction of remission with probiotics16-19 while other trials have failed to show any benefit.20-25 this could be due to the species or strain of probiotic used or methodological differences between studies.previous meta-analyses have examined the benefit of probiotics in specific subgroups of patients with ibd26-36 but none have syn- thesised all current available evidence for their role in ibd and somehave important limitations which have been reported previously.37 most notably several prior meta-analyses have combined data from trials of probiotics and synbiotics28293336 or pooled data from stud- ies in paediatric and adult populations.28-303335 furthermore only two meta-analyses have assessed the effect of probiotics on relapse of disease activity in post-operative cd3638 but neither provided data on the efficacy of preventing endoscopic recurrence at differing severities of rutgeerts' endoscopic score nor did they extract data using intention-to-treat analysis.we therefore conducted an up to date systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the overall efficacy of probiotics in adult patients with ibd and where possible the effect of individual probi- otic preparations in inducing remission in active uc and cd main- taining remission in quiescent uc and cd and preventing relapse in post-operative cd.

however some combinations of probiotics are of proven benefit in other gi disorders where their use is associated with an improvement in abdominal pain scores and a reduction in the persistence of bowel symptoms.58 the paucity of data on probiotics for the induction of remission in active cd and to a lesser extent for the maintenance of remission in quiescent cd means that drawing conclusions on their efficacy is unreliable.

current management strategies focus on reducing the inflammatory burden in patients with active disease and attempting to maintain remission in those with inactive disease.

studies had to report either an assessment of failure of remission in active ibd or relapse of disease activity in quiescent ibd.

outcome assessmentthe primary dichotomous outcomes assessed were the efficacy of probiotics compared with 5-asas or placebo in terms of failure to achieve remission in active ibd and relapse of disease activity in quiescent ibd.

data were extracted as intention- to-treat analyses with all drop-outs assumed to be treatment failures ie failed to achieve remission in active ibd trials and disease activity relapsed in quiescent ibd trials wherever trial reporting allowed this.

the impact of probiotics compared with 5-asa or placebo was expressed as a relative risk rr of failure to achieve remission with 95 confidence intervals cis in trials of therapy for active uc or cd or rr of relapse of disease activity in trials of therapy for quies- cent uc cd or post-operative cd.
