Results in clinical trials have been mixed with some studies showing an improvement in maintenance of remission or induction of remission with probiotics16-19 while other trials have failed to show any benefit.20-25 This could be due to the species or strain of probiotic used or methodological differences between studies.Previous meta-analyses have examined the benefit of probiotics in specific subgroups of patients with IBD26-36 but none have syn- thesised all current available evidence for their role in IBD and somehave important limitations which have been reported previously.37 Most notably several prior meta-analyses have combined data from trials of probiotics and synbiotics28293336 or pooled data from stud- ies in paediatric and adult populations.28-303335 Furthermore only two meta-analyses have assessed the effect of probiotics on relapse of disease activity in post-operative CD3638 but neither provided data on the efficacy of preventing endoscopic recurrence at differing severities of Rutgeerts' endoscopic score nor did they extract data using intention-to-treat analysis.We therefore conducted an up to date systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the overall efficacy of probiotics in adult patients with IBD and where possible the effect of individual probi- otic preparations in inducing remission in active UC and CD main- taining remission in quiescent UC and CD and preventing relapse in post-operative CD.

There were eight trials studying the efficacy of probiotics in inducing remission in active UC16182544-48 six studying their efficacy in preventing relapse of quiescent UC17192349-51 two studying the efficacy of probiotics in inducing remission in active CD5253 two studying their efficacy in preventing relapse of quies- cent CD2455 and four studying their efficacy in preventing relapse of CD in remission following a surgical resection.20-2254 None of the RCTs were cross-over trials.

Data extractionAll data were extracted independently by two reviewers on to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet XP professional edition Microsoft Corp Redmond WA USA as dichotomous outcomes remission or failure of remission in active IBD and relapse or no relapse of disease activ- ity in quiescent IBD.

Efficacy of probiotics in preventing relapse in CD in remission following a surgical resectionThere were four placebo-controlled trials20-2254 containing 333 patients reporting the efficacy of probiotics vs placebo in terms of preventing either clinical or endoscopic relapse of CD in remission following a surgical resection.

In terms of clinical relapse three trials reported these data.20-22 In total 28 26.7 of 105 patients allocated to probiotics experienced a clinical relapse of disease activity compared with 28 25.9 of 108 receiv- ing placebo RR of clinical relapse of disease activity1.06 95 CI0.59-1.92 Figure 3.

Efficacy of probiotics in inducing remission in active UCOne of the eight eligible trials compared probiotics with 5-ASAs for induction of remission of active UC44 and the other seven trials were placebo-controlled.16182545-48 Two trials were at low risk of bias.25 Detailed study characteristics are provided in Table 2.
