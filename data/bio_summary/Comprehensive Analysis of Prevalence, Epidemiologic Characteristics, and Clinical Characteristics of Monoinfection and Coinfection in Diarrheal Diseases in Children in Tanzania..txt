the significant associations with diarrhea mean these pathogens are capable of inducing diarrhea regardless of whether they occur as monoinfection or in coinfection.few studies have looked at biological interactions between coinfecting pathogens in diarrheal disease   .

some pathogens were not tested for in this study such as enterohemorrhagic e. coli aeromonas and helminthes but previous studies in the same setting have shown absence or low prevalence of these pathogens.

we modi- fied primers published by iida et al.

for detection of cadf genes for campylobacter jejuni primers and probes published by elfving et al.

a high prevalence of coinfections both in cases and controls can represent both a consequence of and a predisposing factor for environmental enteropathy in develop- ing countries .we compared pathogenicity which can be expressed as odds ratio as described by black et al.

bhavnani et al.

bilenko et al.

an important note is that these studies which reported increased severity of diarrhea in coinfections did not analyze for the presence of biological interactions whereas bhavnani et al.
