In the regression analy- sis the odds of having 2 or more pathogens were significantly higher among cases than among controls and were as follows for 2 patho- gens odds ratio  5.21 95 confidence interval CI 3.72 7.29 for 3 pathogens odds ratio  5.7 95 CI 3.65 8.91 for 4 pathogensodds ratio  19.89 95 CI 4.52 87.47 and for 5 pathogens odds ratio  7.37 95 CI 1.98 27.38.status type of diarrhea presence of dehydration HIV status presence of blood in stool and death.RESULTSThe study included 1287 children 723 cases and 564 con- trols.

Values of AF for different pathogens are shown in Table .Biologic interaction between coinfecting pathogens associated with diarrhea in additive- and multiplicative- scale modelsThe values for RERI AP and multiplicative interaction for different coinfecting pathogens are presented in Table .

Number of pathogens detected ranged from 0 to 6 patho- gens per child in cases and 0 to 5 pathogens per child in controls.

From the multivariate analysis 8 pathogens rotavirus norovirus GII Cryptosporidium Giardia typical EPEC Shigella speciesEIEC and ST-ETEC were significantly associated with diarrhea in any infection monoinfection and coinfections combined.After stratification for infection type monoinfection vs. coinfection only 4 pathogens rotavirus norovirus GII Cryptosporidium and Shigella speciesEIEC showed sig- nificant association with diarrhea both as monoinfection and in coinfections.

The significant associations with diarrhea mean these pathogens are capable of inducing diarrhea regardless of whether they occur as monoinfection or in coinfection.Few studies have looked at biological interactions between coinfecting pathogens in diarrheal disease   .

Some pathogens were not tested for in this study such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli Aeromonas and helminthes but previous studies in the same setting have shown absence or low prevalence of these pathogens.

We modi- fied primers published by Iida et al.

A high prevalence of coinfections both in cases and controls can represent both a consequence of and a predisposing factor for environmental enteropathy in develop- ing countries .We compared pathogenicity which can be expressed as odds ratio as described by Black et al.
