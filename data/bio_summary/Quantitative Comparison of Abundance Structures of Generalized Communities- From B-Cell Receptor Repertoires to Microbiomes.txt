The small deviations of NRAD distances in for R  250 are all towards smaller NRAD distances points shifted to the left of the diagonal because lower- ing R from 2067 to 250 means that for R  250 we straighten some of the fine-grained structure of NRADs with R  2067 that allows for larger NRAD distances.

Even for R  100 we still have r2  0.913.In we show for comparison how reduction of R affects NRAD distances for a sim- pler normalization scheme in which ranks above a given R are cut off cutoff normalizationinformation in the tails with ranks higher than R is completely neglected.

The results forR  4105 1000 and 250 are summarized in .The table shows a weak reduction in accuracy and k statistic with decreasing R and increas- ing errors both explainable by a loss of information stored in the NRADs with lower R. How- ever the reduction of R from 4105 to 1000 affects the accuracy of the classifier barely and even the classifier computed from NRADs with R  250 has still a good accuracy.

Approximately halving R fromR  2067 the maximum possible R in the GlobalPatterns set to R  1000 does not affect dis- tances between NRADs the points are very close to the diagonal coefficient of determination r2  1.000.

For instance the hierarchical clustering  of the GlobalPatterns dataset is identical between R  250 R  1000 and R  2067 up to an agglomeration height of 0.98 vertical axis in .

Shannon evenness changes weakly with R. Moreover this equation means that entropy or information content will systematically decrease with decreasing R. This decrease will depend weakly on R since log R changes only slowly with R.As the NRAD entropies change systematically with R this must also affect our model of entropy of gut microbiome NRADs as function of age.

MaxRank normalization maps all rank abundance vectors to the same rank range from 1 to a common maximum rank R. The normalization procedure is explained in the following.First we chose the maximum rank or MaxRank R symbol R is used for the MaxRank throughout this work.

The minimum R is 2 because R  1 would eliminate all abundance structure.

We have implemented the meth- ods used in this work in free open source software packages RADanalysis and RankAbundance- Distributions available in R  and Julia .Analyses of NRADsThe last box of the flowchart indicates that sets of RADs normalized to a common R can be analyzed in numerous ways.

This could make analyses based on NRADs sensitive to R. To test this we have tested how the choice of R affects NRAD based classification NRAD distances and NRAD entropies as used in the previous sections.First we address the question whether NRAD based classification is sensitive to R using the classification of gut microbiomes described earlier.
