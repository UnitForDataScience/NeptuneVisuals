Of note altered expression levels of ALB catalase CAT serotransferrin TF and CALB1 were predicted to be in line with increased reactive oxygen species production in Timp3-- mice.Blood acylcarnitine and amino acid profilingIn order to assess the impact of loss of TIMP3 alone or in combination with STZ treatment on peripheral AA and AC profiles we performed targeted DIMS analysis of blood col- lected by WT and Timp3-- mice under basal conditions and after STZ treatment.Upon basal conditions we found that Timp3-- miceshow lower levels of blood acetylcarnitine C2 valerylcar- nitine C5 palmitoylcarnitine C16 and stearoylcarnitine C18 compared with WT mice Fig.

p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsKidney proteome profilingIn order to characterize the kidney protein expression pro- file associated with TIMP3 deletion we performed non- targeted label-free shotgun proteomic analysis of kidney lysates from Timp3-- and WT mice in baseline condition Timp3-- vs WT.

c.The potential involvement of loss of TIMP3 in the onset of DN was further investigated by differential proteomic analysis of kidney extracts from WT and Timp3-- mice after STZ treatment Timp3-- STZ and WT STZ respec- tively.

Therefore in order to further support the hypothesis that the loss of TIMP3 is associated with a higher risk to develop DN we performed targeted metabolomic analysis of whole blood samples from WT and Timp3-- mice before and after STZ treatment.We found that after the STZ treatment Timp3-- miceshow lower levels of C0 compared with WT mice.

Fold changes of AC levels following STZ treatment were cal- culated for both mouse strains as xi - xmean x 100xmean where xi is the measured concentration measured in blood of WT or Timp3-- mice of the ith AC after STZ treatment and xmean is the mean concentration calculated for the same AC from analysis of blood of WT or Timp3-- mice under basal conditions.Statistical analysisTwo-way ANOVA followed by Fischer least significant dif- ference LSD post hoc test was performed using the gen- eral linear model GLM approach which takes account of unequal sample size of the study groups.

In par- ticular medium-chain ACs such as C14 C141 C161 and C181 show opposite fold change directions in the mouse strains increasing in Timp3-- mice and decreasing in WT mice.Finally we did not find significant alteration of blood AAs with exception of glutamic acid Glu that was higher in Timp3-- STZ compared with WT STZ mice Online Resource 9.DiscussionTIMP3 is the most highly expressed TIMP in the kid- ney.

Therefore we decided to perform targeted analysis of both ACs and AAs in whole blood collected from the WT and Timp3-- mice under baseline conditions and after the STZ treatment.Materials and methodsMouse modelsWT and Timp3-- mice on a C57BL6 background have been already described .

CALB1 is up-regulated in Timp3-- mice upon baseline condition and down-regulated in Timp3-- after STZ treatment compared with WT mice.

Furthermore together with the alteration of ATP1A1 and PRDX3 that are predicted to be involved in the kidney cell death the over-expression of CALB1 in Timp3-- mice upon baseline condition may suggest a genetic background more prone to develop DN.Remarkably under basal conditions IPA analysis predicts the inhibition of PTEN in kidney of Timp3-- mice.

In order to gain further insights on the role of TIMP3 in the onset of DN we performed a differential proteomic analysis of kidneys collected in our previous study  from wild-type WT and Timp3-- mice treated or not with STZ.
