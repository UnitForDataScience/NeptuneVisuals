The intestinal micro- biome has also been shown to propagate hepatocellular carcinoma1 possibly through the translocation of bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides to the liver indi- rectly via systemic inflammation or through innate immune pathways via TLR4.1 Chronic infection of S. en- terica typhi in the gastrointestinal tract has been associ- ated with pancreatic and lung cancer.2 More broadly the gut microbiota appears to have systemic effects on the immune system.22 Several studies have reported systemic Th17 inflammation or anti-inflammatory Treg activation due to the presence of commensal microbes of the gut.2324 Such systemic effects could alter the risk of can- cer in any organ25 including the cervix ovaries and uterus.sity in the vaginal microbiome is correlated withincreased incidence of inflammatory conditions in this case candidal vulvovaginitis or bacterial vaginosis.33 In bacterial vaginosis there is a reduction in Lactobacillus and an increase in the abundance of other bacteria such as Prevotella.34 Once the bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics the vaginal microbiome becomes less diverse with increasing frequency of lactobacilli.35 The composition of the vaginal microbiome has implications for other infectious diseases as well.

In one study cer- vicitis was associated with Mageeibacillus indolicus and individuals without cervicitis had a greater abundance ofjensenii.36 Microbiomes with abundant lactobacilli appear to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.37 It has also been suggested that a vaginal microbiome plays a role in preterm birth38 and that a vaginal microbiome rich in lactobacilli reduces its incidence.3940 Overall Lac- tobacillus species appear to be protective and disturbance in the vaginal microbiome appears to be a factor in the pathogenesis of several diseases impacting immune regu- lation and inflammation.

Taken simultaneously with the primary therapy they were able to replace microflora depleted by antibiotics60 or radiation therapy3 and have been used as preventative measures in some cases.62 Vagi- nal probiotics may be useful for this purpose and even oral probiotics can help preserve normal vaginal flora during antibiotic therapy.63 Direct vaginal probiotics including Lactobacillus species have also been successfully utilised in several interventions64 including reduction of bacterial vaginosis.65 It has also been suggested that use of vaginal probiotics for preventing bacterial vaginosis may be able to decrease the risk of preterm birth.3940Probiotics could also have more direct effects on carcino- genesis and treatment.

BJOG 2018125309-315.IntroductionWhile a well balanced vaginal microbiome is known to pre- vent vulvo-vaginal infections recent evidence suggests that the state of the vaginal microbiome could influence the development of cancer.

Here we review the role of the human microbiome in cancers focusing specifically on the vaginal microbiome.Recent studies have indicated that changes in the vaginal microbiome could affect the risk of gynaecological cancers.

For example Streptococcus bovis is involved in the pathogenesis of colonic neoplasia10 via chronic inflammation by the11The vaginal microbiomeThe vaginal microbiome comprises a diverse array of bacte- rial species usually between 20 and 140 in any particular individual with marked variation between individuals and over time.2627 Vaginal microbiomes can be classifiedinnate immune system.Similarly inflammation fromchronic Salmonella enterica typhi infection has been associ-12according to the most dominant species of bacteria presentwhich is most commonly a species of Lactobacillus.28 Lacto-ated with gallbladder cancer.

Maintaining a normal set of microflora has been found to be essential for these path- ways.1920 Increased rates of multiple cancer types in mice14Like the gut microbiome alteration of the vaginal floracould play a part in the pathogenesis of several diseases by modulating immunity or increasing the growth of pathogenic strains.31 Perhaps the most important role of a healthy microbiome is in preventing vaginal infections and inflammatory conditions.

This type of disturbance may also promote carcinogenesis.Influence of vaginal microbiome on carcinogenesisResearch on the relation between the vaginal microbiome and gynaecological cancers is still in its infancy.

It is interesting to note that although L. gasseri was positively correlated with a higher level of HPV infec- tion43 it was also associated with a higher remission rate.45 It has been suggested that vaginal infection by Chlamydia trachomatis may also predispose individuals to HPV infec- tion by altering the microbiome.46However it appears that the vaginal microbiome can be directly correlated to gynaecological cancers as well.
