As Parabacteroides also a member of the Bacteroidales order was negatively correlated with AD-like pathology our results suggest that a shift in Bacteroidales composition from possibly protective Parabacteroides to S24-7 may affect cerebral Abeta amyloid progression.Remarkably in the brain pathogenicity of microbiota harvested from aged wild-type control mice was less pro- nounced compared to the microbiota harvested from aged APPPS1 mice that further hints to putative pathogenic gastro-intestinal microbiota strains in the APPPS1 mouse model.should readRemarkably pathogenicity of microbiota harvested from aged wild-type control mice was less pronounced compared to the microbiota harvested from aged APPPS1 mice that further hints to putative pathogenic gastro-intestinal microbiota strains in the APPPS1 mouse model.In addition Figure 3 has duplicated panels for CONVR-APPPS1 at 3.5 month-old and GF-APPPS1 at 8 month-old.

showed that gastro-intestinal microbiota of the brains of transgenic 5XFAD mice resulted in seeding and accelerated cerebral beta-amyloid deposition29.

One can hypothesize that gastro-intestinal microbiota depleted in Akkermansia in AD mice may lead to a disturbed gut barrier with increased influx of inflammatory components including endotoxins.
