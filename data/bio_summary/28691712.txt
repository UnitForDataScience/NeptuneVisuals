showed that gastro-intestinal microbiota of the brains of transgenic 5xfad mice resulted in seeding and accelerated cerebral beta-amyloid deposition29.

one can hypothesize that gastro-intestinal microbiota depleted in akkermansia in ad mice may lead to a disturbed gut barrier with increased influx of inflammatory components including endotoxins.
