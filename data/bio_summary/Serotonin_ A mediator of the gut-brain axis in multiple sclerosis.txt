intestinal bacterial communities alter the production of nts in the central nervous system cns influencing the levels of host metabolitesnecessary for their production.5 moreover the gut microbiome secretes many nts such as 5-ht dopa- mine and gaba thus regulating also their peripheral levels.67 finally the nts exert an effect on the immune system through respective immune cell receptors.89 the link between nts and neuroinflam- matory diseases their function in the nervous and immune system and the microbial regulation of their levels makes them potent candidates for mediators of the gut-brain interactions in ms of which 5-ht may be a dominant player.5-ht and the gut microbiomeabout 90 of the human 5-ht is synthesized by the gut enterochromaffin cells through a process modu- lated by the intestinal microflora.10 in the gut 5-ht controls peristalsis secretion vasodilation nociper- ception and nausea via 5-ht receptors 5-htr expressed on afferent nerves in the lamina propria of the intestinal epithelium.11 comparison of the fecal metabolome and 5-ht serum levels between germ- free gf mice and mice with humanized microbiome reveals that the gut microbiome accounts for 64 of the gut 5-ht concentrations and 49 of its serum lev- els.10 other experiments exploiting the same animal model demonstrate that microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids promote transcription of tryp- tophan hydroxylase 1 which is crucial for 5-ht bio- synthesis.5 combined these data show a major effect of gut bacteria on 5-ht synthesis.

the prevalence of depression is higher in individuals suffering from the demyeli- nating disease compared to healthy individuals.20 although depression could manifest as a result of being diagnosed with ms a current study suggests that depression in ms has a different pathophysiology and a different cause.20 a 4-year questionnaire-based follow-up on a cohort of over thousand ms patients indicates that depression in ms has a chronic charac- ter lasts longer and is not related to the course of ms.20 the authors of this study argue that the cause of depression during ms is a result of alterations in the cns and not a reaction to being diagnosed with an incurable disease.

future perspectivesserotonin a mediator of the gut-brain axis in multiple sclerosistsveta s malinova christine d dijkstra and helga e de vriesabstractbackground the significance of the gut microbiome for the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis ms has been established although the underlying signaling mechanisms of this interaction have not been sufficiently explored.objectives we address this point and use serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-ht--a microbial-modu- lated neurotransmitter nt as a showcase to demonstrate that nts regulated by the gut microbiome are potent candidates for mediators of the gut-brain axis in demyelinating disorders.methods results and conclusion our comprehensive overview of literature provides evidence that 5-ht levels in the gut are controlled by the microbiome both via secretion and through regulation of metabolites.

therefore it can be assumed that observed effects are the result of the combined modulation of the three nts and are not solely dependent on 5-ht.16 similarly treatment with arylpiperazine ligands which bind to 5-htr1a and dopamine receptor 2 demonstrates that combined serotonergic and dopa- minergic stimulation has a neuroprotective effect and reduces cns immune infiltration in eae mice.17 clinical investigations have also explored the effects of fluoxetine - a selective 5-ht re-uptake inhibitor which increases the concentration of 5-ht in the cns of ms patients.1819 fluoxetine - a candidate for drug repurposing18 is now clinically tested in patients with secondary-progressive ms as a neuroprotective com- pound.19 these clinical studies are the next step in the verification of the role of 5-ht in ms and theconfirmation of this hypothesis would be a starting point for future research to elucidate the effects of serotonergic signaling on the disease pathogenesis.in addition evidence for an altered ss in ms comes from studies on depression.

we also show that ss alterations have been related to ms directly-- altered expression of 5-ht transporters in central nervous system cns and indirectly--beneficial effects of 5-ht modulating drugs on the course of the disease and higher prevalence of depression in patients with ms. finally we discuss briefly the role of other microbiome-modulated nts such as g-aminobutyric acid and dopamine in ms to highlight a new direction for future research aiming to relate microbiome- regulated nts to demyelinating disorders.keywords multiple sclerosis gut microbiome gut-brain axis serotonin 5-ht altered ss ss neuroinflammation neurotransmittersdate received 2 june 2017 revised 2 october 2017 accepted 5 october 2017multiple sclerosis journal1-7doi 10.1177 1352458517739975c the authors 2017.reprints and permissions correspondence tots malinovadepartment of biochemistry academic medical center university of amsterdam meibergdreef 9 amsterdam 1105 az the netherlands.

it is thus reasonable to assume that the gut microbiome might play a role in ss alterations.altered ss in msevidence for an altered ss in ms comes from posi- tron emission tomography studies on a cohort of 23 ms patients and 22 healthy controls15 which revealed lower expression of 5-ht transporters serotonin transporter sert in the limbic and paralimbic regions in patients.

this study and the investigations on the beneficial effects of antidepressants on ms highlight a possible shared ss alteration in the patho- genesis of ms and depression.altogether these studies demonstrate a role of decreased ss functionality in ms which may be due to altered cellular immunity.5-ht and cellular immunity5-ht has an effect on immune regulation via 5-htrs expressed on cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems21 and changes in the communication between the ss and leukocytes are related to diseases with an inflammatory pathological component rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis asthma.

depletion of platelets during a peak of eae exacerbates inflammation and increases immune cell infiltration of the cns illustrating their importance in ms.26other potential gut-brain axis mediatorsbesides 5-ht other nts are also regulated by the gut microbiome6 function in the immune system9 and have altered levels in ms patients.2728 for instance gaba the main inhibitory mediator in cns down- regulates pro-inflammatory mediators which target t-cell dampening and thus t-cell-mediated immu- nity.29 in addition gaba production is regulated by the gut microbiome with lactobacillus brevis being the most efficient gaba producer from the enteral flora.30 moreover treatment of mice with lactobacillus rhamnosus shows altered gaba recep- tor expression in cns accompanied by related changes in the mice behavior31 indicating that bacte- ria regulate gaba signaling both in the cns and in the periphery.

using this approach it would therefore be interesting to investi- gate whether the variabilities in the microbiome ofdifferent patient cohorts such as between the harvard2 and mayo clinic3 reports from 2016 which are likely due to sequencing methods and patients' population differences are however not related to common global effects on 5-ht signaling.we have combined data demonstrating that the enteral flora influences the peripheral and central ss5-7101213 with clinical studies which provide evidence for lowered ss functionality in ms patients.15-20 in our opinion these data strongly suggest a role of the gut microbiome in the alterations of the ss in ms. to further strengthen our hypothesis we looked into studies on the effects of 5-ht on macrophages dcs and t cells21-25 - key play- ers in ms. although there is a need for greater under- standing of the effects of 5-ht on cellular immunity and neuroinflammation specifically the discussed studies provide a plausible theoretical framework linking decreased levels of 5-ht to inflammation in ms.we propose that a decrease in ss function is a factor contributing to ms pathology figure 1. since the microbiome is a major regulator of the ss we suggest that the root cause of this alteration may lie in an unbalanced microflora during early life when the ss in the periphery and in the cns is shaped or later through modulation of peripheral 5-ht levels.

for instance ele- vated levels of bifidobacterium in the gut disable the increase in 5-ht receptor type 2a 5-htr2a in the frontal cortex of mice in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide lps.12 this effect is combined with steady levels of peripheral 5-ht indicating a mechanism of central ss modulation which bypasses the 5-ht synthesis in the gut.

in vitro experiments utilizing cells from healthy donors and ms patients demon- strate that through 5-htr2b and 5-htr7 on mono- cytes 5-ht skews monocyte polarization to m2 macrophages via suppression of lps-induced pro- inflammatory cytokines and reciprocal regulation of m2 and m1 polarization-related genes--a potentially beneficial effect for lesion recovery in ms.2324dcs in ms patients have a pro-inflammatory pheno- type resulting in augmented t-cell activation.25 5-ht regulates maturation of dcs in the bone marrow affecting their migration capacity and shaping their cytokine repertoire and subsequent secretion and t-cell activation.21 finally dcs can take up and store 5-ht from the local environment which is shuttled to t cells to regulate their function.21ht directly regulates the differentiation prolifera- tion and effector functions of naive and activated t cells.21 naive t cells express 5-htr7 which signals to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk and nuclear factor kb nf-kb path- ways resulting in expression of 5-htr1b and 5-htr2b.

the right side represents neuroinflammatory pathways triggered by lowered 5-ht production in the gut as a result of altered gut microbiota depicted in red with striated texture.

dopamine controls locomotion cognition endocrine regulation and has been related to neurodegenerative diseases.8 in vitro human gut bacteria produce dopa- mine in very high concentrations compared to its physiological levels.6 moreover experiments with gf rats demonstrate lower dopaminergic turnover rate in the cns accompanied by enhanced anxiety- like behavior and neuroendocrine response highlight- ing the role of the microbiome in dopaminergic system regulation.33 finally dopamine also plays a role in immune modulation and its decreased levels are linked to ms relapse.28 a study on a cohort of 43 patients with rrms reveals lowered serum levels of dopamine during relapse related to higher t helper 17 th-17 and interleukin 17 il-17 serum levels.

dopamine suppresses il-17 production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from ms patients suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect on ms.28the discussed nts do not exhaust the arsenal of microbiome-modulated compounds with effects on neuroinflammation but point to a new direction of future investigation to relate other microbiome-regu- lated nts to demyelinating disorders.conclusion and perspectivesgut microbiota alterations are linked to ms and some pathological mechanisms have been proposed for a few individual species.

the reduced 5-ht levels affect neuroinflammation in the cns directly or through skewing macrophages and t cells to an autoinflammatory phenotype.summarizing the available data on the role of the gut microbiome in ss regulation and on the role of ss in ms pathology we demonstrate that 5-ht is a critical mediator of the gut-brain axis in ms. this is a novel insight which opens up a broad horizon for future investigation to relate the microbiome modulation of a wide range of nts to demyelinating disorders.declaration of conflicting intereststhe authors declared no potential conflicts of inter- est with respect to the research authorship andor publication of this article.fundingthe authors received no financial support for the research authorship andor publication of this article.referencesmielcarz dw and kasper lh.
