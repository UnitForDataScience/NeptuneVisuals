The prevalence of depression is higher in individuals suffering from the demyeli- nating disease compared to healthy individuals.20 Although depression could manifest as a result of being diagnosed with MS a current study suggests that depression in MS has a different pathophysiology and a different cause.20 A 4-year questionnaire-based follow-up on a cohort of over thousand MS patients indicates that depression in MS has a chronic charac- ter lasts longer and is not related to the course of MS.20 The authors of this study argue that the cause of depression during MS is a result of alterations in the CNS and not a reaction to being diagnosed with an incurable disease.

Therefore it can be assumed that observed effects are the result of the combined modulation of the three NTs and are not solely dependent on 5-HT.16 Similarly treatment with arylpiperazine ligands which bind to 5-HTR1A and dopamine receptor 2 demonstrates that combined serotonergic and dopa- minergic stimulation has a neuroprotective effect and reduces CNS immune infiltration in EAE mice.17 Clinical investigations have also explored the effects of fluoxetine - a selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor which increases the concentration of 5-HT in the CNS of MS patients.1819 Fluoxetine - a candidate for drug repurposing18 is now clinically tested in patients with secondary-progressive MS as a neuroprotective com- pound.19 These clinical studies are the next step in the verification of the role of 5-HT in MS and theconfirmation of this hypothesis would be a starting point for future research to elucidate the effects of serotonergic signaling on the disease pathogenesis.In addition evidence for an altered SS in MS comes from studies on depression.

This study and the investigations on the beneficial effects of antidepressants on MS highlight a possible shared SS alteration in the patho- genesis of MS and depression.Altogether these studies demonstrate a role of decreased SS functionality in MS which may be due to altered cellular immunity.5-HT and cellular immunity5-HT has an effect on immune regulation via 5-HTRs expressed on cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems21 and changes in the communication between the SS and leukocytes are related to diseases with an inflammatory pathological component rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis asthma.

We also show that SS alterations have been related to MS directly-- altered expression of 5-HT transporters in central nervous system CNS and indirectly--beneficial effects of 5-HT modulating drugs on the course of the disease and higher prevalence of depression in patients with MS.

It is thus reasonable to assume that the gut microbiome might play a role in SS alterations.Altered SS in MSEvidence for an altered SS in MS comes from posi- tron emission tomography studies on a cohort of 23 MS patients and 22 healthy controls15 which revealed lower expression of 5-HT transporters serotonin transporter SERT in the limbic and paralimbic regions in patients.

In vitro experiments utilizing cells from healthy donors and MS patients demon- strate that through 5-HTR2B and 5-HTR7 on mono- cytes 5-HT skews monocyte polarization to M2 macrophages via suppression of LPS-induced pro- inflammatory cytokines and reciprocal regulation of M2 and M1 polarization-related genes--a potentially beneficial effect for lesion recovery in MS.2324DCs in MS patients have a pro-inflammatory pheno- type resulting in augmented T-cell activation.25 5-HT regulates maturation of DCs in the bone marrow affecting their migration capacity and shaping their cytokine repertoire and subsequent secretion and T-cell activation.21 Finally DCs can take up and store 5-HT from the local environment which is shuttled to T cells to regulate their function.21HT directly regulates the differentiation prolifera- tion and effector functions of naive and activated T cells.21 Naive T cells express 5-HTR7 which signals to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK and nuclear factor kB NF-kB path- ways resulting in expression of 5-HTR1B and 5-HTR2B.

Dopamine suppresses IL-17 production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs from MS patients suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect on MS.28The discussed NTs do not exhaust the arsenal of microbiome-modulated compounds with effects on neuroinflammation but point to a new direction of future investigation to relate other microbiome-regu- lated NTs to demyelinating disorders.Conclusion and perspectivesGut microbiota alterations are linked to MS and some pathological mechanisms have been proposed for a few individual species.

Using this approach it would therefore be interesting to investi- gate whether the variabilities in the microbiome ofdifferent patient cohorts such as between the Harvard2 and Mayo clinic3 reports from 2016 which are likely due to sequencing methods and patients' population differences are however not related to common global effects on 5-HT signaling.We have combined data demonstrating that the enteral flora influences the peripheral and central SS5-7101213 with clinical studies which provide evidence for lowered SS functionality in MS patients.15-20 In our opinion these data strongly suggest a role of the gut microbiome in the alterations of the SS in MS. To further strengthen our hypothesis we looked into studies on the effects of 5-HT on macrophages DCs and T cells21-25 - key play- ers in MS.

The reduced 5-HT levels affect neuroinflammation in the CNS directly or through skewing macrophages and T cells to an autoinflammatory phenotype.Summarizing the available data on the role of the gut microbiome in SS regulation and on the role of SS in MS pathology we demonstrate that 5-HT is a critical mediator of the gut-brain axis in MS.

Future PerspectivesSerotonin A mediator of the gut-brain axis in multiple sclerosisTsveta S Malinova Christine D Dijkstra and Helga E de VriesAbstractBackground The significance of the gut microbiome for the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis MS has been established although the underlying signaling mechanisms of this interaction have not been sufficiently explored.Objectives We address this point and use serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT--a microbial-modu- lated neurotransmitter NT as a showcase to demonstrate that NTs regulated by the gut microbiome are potent candidates for mediators of the gut-brain axis in demyelinating disorders.Methods Results and Conclusion Our comprehensive overview of literature provides evidence that 5-HT levels in the gut are controlled by the microbiome both via secretion and through regulation of metabolites.
