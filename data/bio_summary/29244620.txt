Con- temporary theories about skin-to-skin contact propose that attachment and bonding occurs as the result of mother and infant contact and that the mechanisms by which the phenomena occur are brain-based and influenced by various signaling modulators including OT Atzil Hen- dler  Feldman 2011 Schore 2014.Another theory in behavioral development focuses on the notion that attachment and bonding are the result of cognitive learning processes that occur independently in mother and in the infant Bolten 2013.

The theory builds upon the research and ideas of Pavlov and his followers and proposes that subcortical Pavlovian co-conditioning of the autonomic nervous systems of mother and infant is the key to maintaining emotional connection between the two and to shaping emotional behavior of the infant into adulthood.

Finally while at- tachment theory draws from central nervous system physiology calm- ing cycle theory expands human neurobiology to include two ANSs mother's and infant's especially via vagal pathways Porges 2011 to explain how learning in the viscera and ANS influences the brain and emotional behavior.FAMILY NURTURE INTERVENTIONFamily Nurture Intervention FNI was designed to test calming cycle theory.

We propose that oxytocin levels in the mother and infant are co-regulated by emotional connection or disconnection and that the autonomic co-conditioning learning mechanism can be exploited to change a negative physiological and behav- ioral response between mother and infant into a positive one.

Sensory contact between the mother and infant trigger visceral signal- ing via the vagus nerve to the brain stem and hypothalamus of both mother and infant.

Sensory contact between the mother and infant triggers vagal signaling to the brain stem of both mother and infant.

However most current authors have proposed that infant attachment to the mother is learned through operant conditioning mechanisms via the infant's brain and central nervous system.

Such very early autonomic learning between mother and infant is the primary factor that helps the infant form emotional relationships with others.

What are the individual or combined roles of exogenous OT from milk and endogenous produc- tion of OT by the gut and brain If breast milk is not available to an infant which is often the case in preterm infants how does that lack of milk OT affect gut development in this population particularly at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis In turn since the gut provides massive input to the brain how would the absence of OT in the gut affect brain development and behavior And how are gut OT levels affected by the interventions aimed at emotional connection Is it possible to overcome the negative effects of maternal separation with the positive effects of interventions such as FNI If so what are the mechanisms by which it does soPROPOSED OXYTOCIN CELLULAR MECHANISMBased on our research thus far we propose a possible mechanism by which emotional connection between mother and infant might up- regulate OT in innate immune and other cells in the gut and dampen inflammation and stress.Figure 5 illustrates how the hypothesized positive social hormonal reflex works at the cellular level.

Calming Cycle Theory and the Co-Regulation of OxytocinMartha G. Welch and Robert J. LudwigAbstract The biological functions of oxytocin in attachment and bonding be- tween mother and infant in parturition and breastfeeding and between adults have been studied extensively.
