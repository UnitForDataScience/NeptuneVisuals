for details refer to the manufacturer's documentation.dilute the sequencing primers for read 1 index and read 2 to a final concentration of 0.5 mm by mixing 3 ml of each 100 mm sequencing primer stock solution with 597 ml of the ht1 buffer.collect the standard illumina sequencing primers for read 1 index and read 2 from the miseq cartridge these are contained in wells 12 13 and 14 respectively into three separate 1.5-ml capped tubes using a 1-ml syringe or a pasteur pipet.see figure 6 for location of wells 12 13 and 14 in the miseq cartridge.add 200 ml of standard illumina sequencing primers for read 1 index and read 2 from step 14i to the 600 ml of sequencing primers for read 1 index and read 2 from step 14h respectively.load 600 ml of the 12 pm sequencing library created in step 14f to well 17 of the miseq cartridge and 600 ml of the mixed sequencing primers created in step 14j to wells 18 19 and 20. the mixed sequencing primers for read 1 should be added to well 18 index to well 19 and read 2 to well 20 of the cartridge.miseq sequencing runto perform a sequencing run the miseq requires a csv file labeled sample sheet in which settings are specified.to set up the sample sheet open a text editor this can be done directly on the miseq computer with notepad and create a file that looks like the example shown in figure 7.the example miseq sample sheet shown in figure 7 sets a 2 250 b paired-end se- quencing section reads with a 12 b index sequencing that will be performed in-between data.index.

alternatively follow the support protocol 3 to purify 16s rrna amplicon libraries using gel electrophoresis.purify the 16s rrna amplicon libraries in pcr products from step 4 of the basic protocol using dna-binding magnetic beads as follows adapted from the manufac- turer's instructionsmix the dna-binding magnetic bead suspension thoroughly by vortexing.add 33 ml of dna-binding magnetic bead solution to every well of pcr product from step 4 of the basic protocol mix and incubate 5 min at room temperature.place the pcr plate or pcr tubes on a magnet for 2 min to pellet the beads then remove and discard the supernatant.wash the purified dna twice each time by adding 90 ml of 80 ethanol to the beads vortexing briefly and placing the pcr plate or pcr tubes for on a magnetic rack for 2 min before removing and discarding the supernatant.allow the beads to air dry by placing the pcr plate or pcr tubes on the magnetic rack with the caps open for 20 min at room temperature.remove the pcr plate or pcr tubes from the magnetic rack and add 50 ml of 10 mm tris cl ph 7.5 to the beads to detach the dna.

once the samples have been homogenized proceed to step 6 of the manufacturer's instructions.after the final step of the manufacturer's instructions step 22 transfer the isolated dna to a sealed pcr plate or sealed pcr tubes for easier storage and for lateruse in the 16s rrna pcr.microbiotaanalysis by sequencing 16 s rrnamicrobiota analysis by sequencing 16 srrnatable 5 16s rrna pcr mix using q5 high-fidelity polymerase kit neb e0555reagentvolumeanuclease-free h2o15 mltemplate dna5 ml10 mm reverse primer2.5 ml10 mm forward primer2.5 ml2x q5 mix25 mlafinal volume for each reaction  50 ml.amplify 16s rrna by pcr using barcoded primersfor each sample of extracted dna generated in step 2 plus one positive control and one negative control see below prepare a pcr mix in a new pcr plate or pcr tubes according to table 5 total volume of 50 ml per reaction also see kramer  coen 2000. for samples that will be later pooled together for multiplexed sequencing use a different barcoded primer for each of them.for the positive control a template dna that previously led to a successful 16s rrna pcr reaction should be used.

in addition sequencing samples together that need to be compared limits possible bias that would be introduced by low quality or sequencing depth differences between separate sequencing runs.basic protocolmicrobiota analysis by sequencing 16 srrnabacterial 16s rrna sequencing for bacterial communities present in intestinal contents of mice or from fecal samples collected from mice or humansthis protocol covers the entire process of bacterial 16s rrna sequencing starting with the collection of fecal samples and moving on to dna extraction amplification of 16s rrna by pcr amplicons amplicon quantitation and pooling multiplexed amplicon pool purification and finally the setup and initiation of the illumina miseq sequencing run.breaks in the protocol can be taken after the completion of steps 1 2 4 8 10 11 and 12 at which point samples should be stored at 20degc.

using a dedicated barcoded primer for negative controls would facilitate its integration into a multiplexed sequencing run for contaminant identification in the possible case of contamination.alternatively other high-fidelity pcr systems can be used in place of the neb q5 high- fidelity polymerase kit.seal the pcr plate or pcr tubes vortex briefly and perform pcr in a thermal cycler according to the program outlined in table 2. as an option perform a check that the pcr worked at this stage see support protocol 1.if a pcr product for any of the samples is not detected these samples should be run again using a smaller volume of template dna see the troubleshooting section.prepare a multiplexed 16s rrna amplicon libraries pool for sequencing.

2011. a selection of common previously described primer pairs is depicted in figure 1 and further described in table 1. aside from the above considerations there is no strong rationale for the choice of one primer pair over another.number of pcr cyclesthe number of pcr cycles to perform when amplifying portions of the 16s rrna gene can be adapted depending on sample specificities as follows--if the pcr template dna has been extracted from a sample containing a relatively high concentration of bacteria such as intestinal content or feces performing as few pcr cycles as possible is preferred since performing a high number of pcr cycles has been shown to introduce a bias and lead to an over-representation of the most abundant taxa in the resulting sequencing data gonzalez portillo belda-ferre  mira 2012. in this case limiting the number of pcr cycles to 20 to 25 as indicated in table 2 is recommended.

however if the pcr template dna has been extracted from a sample containing relatively few bacteria such as skin swabs it is recommended to perform a higher number of pcr cycles in order to obtain sufficient amplicons number for sequencing as instructed in step 19b of the alternate protocol.amplicon purificationas discussed earlier amplicon purification prior to sequencing is necessary to remove small dna fragments that may interfere with the sequencing of the larger amplicons.
