Alternatively follow the Support Protocol 3 to purify 16S rRNA amplicon libraries using gel electrophoresis.Purify the 16S rRNA amplicon libraries in PCR products from step 4 of the Basic Protocol using DNA-binding magnetic beads as follows adapted from the manufac- turer's instructionsMix the DNA-binding magnetic bead suspension thoroughly by vortexing.Add 33 ml of DNA-binding magnetic bead solution to every well of PCR product from step 4 of the Basic Protocol mix and incubate 5 min at room temperature.Place the PCR plate or PCR tubes on a magnet for 2 min to pellet the beads then remove and discard the supernatant.Wash the purified DNA twice each time by adding 90 ml of 80 ethanol to the beads vortexing briefly and placing the PCR plate or PCR tubes for on a magnetic rack for 2 min before removing and discarding the supernatant.Allow the beads to air dry by placing the PCR plate or PCR tubes on the magnetic rack with the caps open for 20 min at room temperature.Remove the PCR plate or PCR tubes from the magnetic rack and add 50 ml of 10 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5 to the beads to detach the DNA.

Once the samples have been homogenized proceed to step 6 of the manufacturer's instructions.After the final step of the manufacturer's instructions step 22 transfer the isolated DNA to a sealed PCR plate or sealed PCR tubes for easier storage and for lateruse in the 16S rRNA PCR.MicrobiotaAnalysis by Sequencing 16 S rRNAMicrobiota Analysis by Sequencing 16 SrRNATable 5 16S rRNA PCR mix using Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase Kit NEB E0555ReagentVolumeaNuclease-free H2O15 mlTemplate DNA5 ml10 mM reverse primer2.5 ml10 mM forward primer2.5 ml2x Q5 Mix25 mlaFinal volume for each reaction  50 ml.Amplify 16S rRNA by PCR using barcoded primersFor each sample of extracted DNA generated in step 2 plus one positive control and one negative control see below prepare a PCR mix in a new PCR plate or PCR tubes according to Table 5 total volume of 50 ml per reaction also see Kramer  Coen 2000.

Aside from the above considerations there is no strong rationale for the choice of one primer pair over another.Number of PCR CyclesThe number of PCR cycles to perform when amplifying portions of the 16S rRNA gene can be adapted depending on sample specificities as follows--if the PCR template DNA has been extracted from a sample containing a relatively high concentration of bacteria such as intestinal content or feces performing as few PCR cycles as possible is preferred since performing a high number of PCR cycles has been shown to introduce a bias and lead to an over-representation of the most abundant taxa in the resulting sequencing data Gonzalez Portillo Belda-Ferre  Mira 2012.

Using a dedicated barcoded primer for negative controls would facilitate its integration into a multiplexed sequencing run for contaminant identification in the possible case of contamination.Alternatively other high-fidelity PCR systems can be used in place of the NEB Q5 High- Fidelity Polymerase Kit.Seal the PCR plate or PCR tubes vortex briefly and perform PCR in a thermal cycler according to the program outlined in Table 2.

Discard the flowthrough.Repeat step 11 until the entire volume of DNA solution from step 10 is transferred.Microbiota Analysis by Sequencing 16 S rRNARemove the column and place it into a new clean 2-ml collection tube add 500 ml of AW1 buffer provided in the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit to the top of the column and centrifuge the tube for 1 min at 12000 x g 24oC.Remove the column and place it into a new clean 2-ml collection tube add 500 ml of AW2 buffer provided in the QIAmp DNA mini kit and centrifuge the tube 1 min at 12000 x g 24oC.Remove the column place it into a new clean 2-ml collection tube and centrifuge the tube for an additional 1 min at 14000 x g 24oC.Remove the column place it into a new clean 1.5-ml tube and add 40 ml of ultrapure water.Incubate the tube for 5 min at room temperature then centrifuge 1 min at 6000 g 24oC.This step will elute the DNA so that it is now contained in the solution transferred from the column to the tube.Remove the column and transfer the solution remaining in the tube flow-through into a sealed PCR plate or sealed PCR tubes for easier storage and for later use in the 16S rRNA PCR.Amplification of 16S rRNA by PCR using barcoded primersAmplify 16S rRNA gene according to the Basic Protocol steps 3 to 4 with the following minor modificationsAdjust the volumes outlined in Table 5 such that 20 ml rather than 5 ml of template DNA is added to each PCR reaction.
