The intestinal microbiota of AT- pretreated mice significantly changed in both the jejunum and colon after FMT p  0.05 however those of BC-pretreated or CON mice were not altered by FMT .Influence of Gut Preparation on FMT EfficiencyTo determine if the FMT efficiency which we defined as the dissimilarity between the altered gut microbiota after FMT and the donor microbiota varied under different pretreatments we calculated the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between the jejunum and colon microbiota of mice and those of the donor.

Theoretically increasing niche vacancy prior to FMT is an important mechanism by which to improve FMT efficiency and additional studies are needed to investigate the viability of other procedures of efficiently generating available niches.Although FMT induced microbiota changes in both the jejunum and colon the FMT efficiency in the jejunum was less efficient than that in the colon.

With high throughput sequencing based on the 16S rDNA V3-V4 region a total of 2862280 49350 - 18901 sequencessample mean length 419 - 11 bp1 2 and 1653597 5702118065 sequencessample mean length418 11 bp high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained in the intestinal mucosa after gut pretreatments and after FMT respectively.Alteration of Intestinal Microbiota after FMT with Different Gut Preparation ProceduresThe donor and mouse intestinal microbiota were distinct from one another  and the various taxonomy levels had different compositions  therefore we expected the mouse intestinal microbiota to change after xenomicrobiota were introduced into the gut by FMT.

In jejunum mucosa after FMT AT- or BC-pretreated mice each had four taxa that were more abundant CON mice with FMT had 16 taxa that were more abundant and AT-pretreated mice had seven taxa that were less abundant compared with controls that did not undergo FMT p  0.05 .

These results verify the antibiotic selection on the intestinal microbiota that was observed via metabolism profile.Dynamic Changes in Intestinal Microbiota Following Combination Therapy with FMT and AntibioticsTo illustrate the dynamic changes in intestinal microbiota following combination therapy with FMT and antibiotics the microbiota of control AT-treated and AT-pretreated FMT mice were compared at the genus level.

Our data demonstrate here that after FMT administration the enriched antibiotic- resistant bacteria taxa decreased in abundance to the original profile which revealed another potential application for FMT to drive out the universal gut antibiotic-resistant bacteria.CONCLUSIONOur data demonstrate that FMT efficiency is adjustable by changing how the gut is prepared and that antibiotic pretreatment enhances gut microbiota reprogramming by promoting xenomicrobiota colonization.

However there remains a knowledge gap on how to increase FMT efficiency and the alteration efficiency of gut microbiota reprogramming by FMT in the gut mucosa has also not been fully elucidated.Recent data suggest that perturbations in the intestinal microbiota alter host susceptibility to xenobacteria     and one potential mechanism for this is niche competition in the mucosa between the xenomicrobiota and indigenous microbiota based on ecological niche theory         .

Thus this study had three main objectives 1 to test whether or not FMT efficiency changed following any of the three most-clinically used gut preparation procedures antibiotics bowel cleansing BC solution or no pretreatment 2 to characterize the influence of gut preparation on the gut microbiota in the mucosa and lumen to gain insight into potential mechanisms and 3 to monitor the antibiotic-resistant bacteria during period of combination therapy with FMT and antibiotics.MATERIALS AND METHODSMiceEight-week-old specific-pathogen free SPF male ICR mice were acquired from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co. LTD Beijing China.

After sample collection a FMT with xenomicrobiota from a healthy human was performed and additional samples were collected to assess the FMT efficiency .

None of the pretreatments affected the FMT efficiency in the jejunum  but the FMT efficiency was enhanced after AT pretreatment in the colon p  0.05 .
