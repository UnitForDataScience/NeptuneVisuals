Further analysis of operational taxonomic units revealed a high abundance of genes associated with twocomponent systems and secretion systems in the SAL group whereas the PRO group had more genes associated with ribosomes.Conclusion The results of this study indicate that B. subtilis CSL2 administration can modulate the microbiota in HLB laying hens potentially acting as a probiotic to protect against Salmonella Gallinarum infection.Keywords Bacillus subtilis Intestinal Microbiota Laying Hens Probiotics Salmonella GallinarumINTRODUCTIONSalmonella enterica S. enterica is a pathogen that causes salmonellosis an acute inflammation of the intestines in poultry including broilers and laying hens 1.

Tukey's honestly significant differ ence was employed to compare functional differences between groups with a significance threshold of p0.05.RESULTSDiversity values in probiotic-fed and infected laying hens The effects of S. Gallinarum infection and B. subtilis CSL2 admini stration on the alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota of laying hens were determined Table 1.

Therefore a detailed analysis of these key functions might shed light on the probiotic mode of action and mecha nisms of S. Gallinarum infection in laying hens.CONCLUSIONThe microbial and functional profiling of HLB laying hens de monstrated the potential protective effects of using an infeed probiotic supplement B. subtilis CSL2 against S. Gallinarum infection.

Poultryderived products can be infected with many serovars of S. enterica including S. Typhimurium S. Typhi S. Pullorum and Salmonella Gallinarum S. Gallinarum 1.

However no study has yet sought to characterize the microbiota of HyLine Brown HLB laying hens under the influence of S. Gallinarum infection or probiotic treatment.In the present study the fecal microbiota of HLB laying hens was investigated using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing.

Many studies have investigated the mode of infection of S. Gallinarum and its relatives but to our knowledge no studies have explored the impact of S. Gallinarum infection and probiotic administra tion on the gut microbiota and functional profiles of laying hens.

After infection the microbiota of the SAL group became significantly different from those of the CON and PRO groups suggesting that S. Gallinarum might trigger general changes in the fecal microbiota of laying hens Figure 3B.

The microbiota of HLB laying hens orally challenged with S. Gallinarum and not givensubtilis CSL2 displayed lower bacterial diversity than that of uninfected laying hens but the greatest diversity was exhibited in the PRO group.

Previous studies in pigs and broiler chickens have shown that pathogen infection lowers the alpha diversity of the microbiota while probiotic or prebiotic administration may increase bacterial diversity 810.Changes in the fecal microbiota of laying hens after infectionThe most abundant bacterial phylum in the fecal microbiota of laying hens was Firmicutes accounting for 53.0 to 72.0 of the bacterial population followed by Bacteroidetes or Proteo bacteria Figure 2A.

The PCA showed that the microbiota of the CON SAL and PRO groups were similar before S. Gallinarum infection Figure 3A however due to the dynamic nature of the chicken gut microbiota certain animaltoanimal variation was still ob served as 1013.
