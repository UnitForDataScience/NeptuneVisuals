The con- served domain architecture of RR includes the N-terminal receiver domain REC containing a con- served D residue that receives the phosphoryl group required for activation of the regulatory domain output domain.

Species that predominantly initiate colo- nization of the supra-gingival dental surfaces under healthy-associated conditions include the Mitis Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis and the Sanguinus groups Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus gordonii .
