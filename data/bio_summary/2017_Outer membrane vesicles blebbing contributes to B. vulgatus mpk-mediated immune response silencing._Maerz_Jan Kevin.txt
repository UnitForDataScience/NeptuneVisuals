Based on this cross talk specific modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition is considered to be used as therapy for the treatment of microbiota-associated AID.Hereby intestinal commensals are decisive for the induction pathobionts or prevention symbionts of a pathological immune response in a certain pre- disposed host.In this context members of the genus Bacteroides were already demonstrated to exhibit sym- biotic properties concerning the modulation of the intestinal immune system.CONTACT Prof. Dr. Julia-Stefanie FrickInstitute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene University of TEURubingen Elfriede-Aulhorn-Str.6 D-72076 TEURubingen Germany.c 2018 Taylor  FrancisAccordingly Bacteroides vulgatus mpk was already depicted to mediate inflammation-silencing effects finally preventing from colitis induction in various moue models for IBD.These immune regulatory properties of B. vulgatus mpk are traced back to the induction of a tolerant dendritic cell DC phenotype in the colonic lamina propria cLP termed semi- mature.

The release of PSA in OMVs induces immune-modu- latory effects activates regulatory T cells and prevents from experimental colitis.However a general role for OMVs in mediating immune responses account- ing for all OMV-producing commensal was not yet demonstrated.Findings using live B. vulgatus mpk cells indicate that this symbiotic bacterium prevents from disease induction in different mouse models for experimental colitis.In this context B. vulgatus mpk promotes the maintenance of the immune equilibrium via induction of tolerant semi-mature dendritic cells in the intestine and the resulting regulation of host Cathepsin S activity and secretion in these antigen- presenting cells.In this study we demonstrated that OMVs derived from B. vulgatus mpk contribute to these observed effects since they interact with bone marrow derived dendritic cells leading to a semi- mature phenotype characterized by a low expression of T cell activation and maturation markers as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.Innate immune cells recognize conserved microbial ligands through pattern recognition receptors PRRs leading to immunologic responses.

There- fore B. vulgatus mpk-caused OMV blebbing seems to contribute to host-microbe communication at intesti- nal sites which are hardly accessible for the living bacterium.ResultsBacteroides vulgatus mpk outer membrane vesicles induce tolerance in CD11cC cellsIt is well known that components of the intestinal microbiota have widespread effects on the mucosal immune system in the intestine.Hereby commen- sal bacteria exhibit important functions for the prim- ing of immune cells underlying the mucosal epithelial barrier.

The mechanism of OMV production is a key characteristic of Gram nega- tive bacteria and commensal-derived OMVs seem to be important for the modulation of the host immune system.In previous work we could demonstrate that B. vul- gatus mpk modulate the immune response in vivo and in vitro in an inflammation-silencing manner.

the rapid internalization of vesicles can be achieved in an actin-dependent manner directing the expression of surface markers and inflammatory cyto- kine secretion in BMDCs.OMVBV-mediated immunomodulatory properties are sensed via host TLR2 and TLR4 receptor complexesWe demonstrated that B. vulgatus mpk and its outer membrane vesicles interact with innate immune cells and modulate the host immune system in an anti- inflammatory sense.

Though OMVs can cross physical barriers which are impermeable for the whole bacterium such as the intestinal mucus layer gain access to the intestinal epithelium and therefore to the underlying immune cells present in the intesti- nal lamina propria.This makes OMV bleb- bing to an important immune modulating mechanism.

However OMVs derived from commensal symbiotic bacteria were demonstrated to be involved in main- taining or restoring immune homeostasis in the intestine.For example Bacteroides fragilis repre- senting an intestinal commensal produces OMVs and interacts with the host immune system by delivering a capsular polysaccharide PSA to dendritic cells.

To gain information on the immune system modulat- ing features of OMVs CD11cC BMDCs were gener- ated as described and stimulated with B. vulgatus mpk-derived OMVs OMVBV for 24 h .

This observation prompted us to elucidate whether the contact of host immune cells with a bacterial TLR4 agonist such as LPS alone is sufficient for the activation and differentiation of tolerant BMDCs or whether an additional TLR2 acti- vation is accessory required for adequate induction of BMDC semi-maturation.
