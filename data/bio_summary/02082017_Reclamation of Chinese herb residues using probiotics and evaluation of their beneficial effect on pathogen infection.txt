dgge is a powerful tool based on the direct analysis of the extract of dna from the microbial environment and does not require cell cultivation this method has been used success- fully to evaluate the bacterial composition of probiotic products and to identify or profile bacteria in dairy products as dgge could only identify bacteria representing more than 1-3 of total bacteria this method only identified three dominant bacteria namely l. gasseri l. johnsonii and l. plantarum of which l. gasseri and l. johnsonii could tolerate the extremely low ph in the stomach and were dominant in all groups with or without the administra- tion of h. pylori ss1 or herb residue fermentation supernatant both in bacterial dgge and lactobacilli dgge l. gasseri has long been used as a probiotic and in the treatment of h. pylori ss1 infection moreover although outside interference exhibited lit- tle influence on the dominant lactobacilli species it seemed that the addition of h. pylori ss1 had disturbed the microbial diversity in h. pylori ss1 infection model and the administration of herb residue fermentation supernatant helped to restore the former microbial balance in the mouse stomachs in conclusion we have shown in the h. pylori ss1 mouse modelthat herb residue fermentation supernatant can inhibit urease activity reduce the level of the gastric inflammatory cytokines il-6 il-8 and tnf-a alleviate histological lesions and help to recover the disturbed microbiota to a normal level.

the experiment was conducted in duplicate preparation of herb residue extract and fermentation supernatantthe herb residue of jianweixiaoshi tablets was obtained from river pharmaceutical co. ltd. and was mashed using a pulper within 2 h. the probiotics l. plantarum hm218749 l. reuteri eu547310 l. rhamnosus rs05630 l. johnsoni rs03965 andl.

therefore the medicinal components remaining in the herb residue should be useful for stomach diseases.in our previous studies l. plantarum hm218749 was isolated from the human intestine and was shown to tolerate low ph and high concentrations of salt bile as well as to possess high adher- ence capability and anti-adherence properties against food-borne pathogens both in vivo and in vitro in this study its high sur- vival rate in extreme acid ph  1.5-3.5 and bile salt conditions 0.3 ensure its survival in the stomach to exert its probiotic effect and strong anti-h. pylori ss1effect moreover the high num- ber of l. plantarum hm218749 in herb residue 8.5 lg cfug without any additives offers us more options for the development of drugs or healthcare products.to verify the anti-h. pylori effect of the herb residue fermenta- tion supernatant we employed the ss1 h. pylori mouse model and verified its reliability using urease activity testing and histological imaging s-1.

all the data showed that we had successfully established the h. pylori ss1 infection model.treatment of h. pylori ss1-infected mice with herb residue fermentation supernatantbefore the formal experiment 0.1 ml 0.3 ml 0.5 ml and 0.7 ml of herb residue fermentation supernatants were used to evaluate the suitable dose for ss1-infected mice and the dose of 0.5 ml was chosen for its sound treating effect.

pylori infection and our results showed that the herb residue fermentation supernatant successfully inhibited urease activity in the treatment group moreover h. pylori achieved the sub- stantial infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the infected group while the herb residue fermentation supernatant clearly slowed the inflammatory response of the gastric mucosa and reduced the colonization of h. pylori ss1 which was con- firmed by the il-6 il-8 and tnf-a protein levels evaluated by elisa.

the results demonstrated that the herb residue fer- mentation supernatant successfully inhibited urease activity slowed cell infiltration in the gastric area and significantly reduced the production of interleukin-6 il-6 il-8 and tnf-a in the treatment group p  0.01. in addition the dgge results indicated that the herb residue fermentation supernatant was beneficial for the recovery of the disturbed microbiota in the infected model to the normal condition in which l. gasseri gu417842.1 and l. johnsonii hq828141.1 were dominant in all groups.

the pcr products for sequencing were purified using the qia quick pcr purification kit and were sub-cloned using the pmd18-t vector sys- tem i takara according to the manufacturer's instructions and the transformants were randomly picked and sequenced in invitrogen shanghai china.resultsacid salt and antibacterial test of the probioticsthe populations of l. plantarum hm218749 l. reuterieu547310 l. rhamnosus rs05630 l. johnsoni rs03965 andl.

plantarum hm218749 could be used as a potential strain for the development of herb residues and d.evaluation of the h. pylori ss1 infection modelthe urease experiments showed that the mice administered h. pylori ss1 were urease positive s-1 and the histopathological evaluation revealed a significant increase in mucosal inflamma- tion in the gastric body he.the giemsa stain also indicated a high colonization number of h. pylori ss1 s-1b and s-1c.

therefore the combination of jianweixiaoshi herb residue and l. plantarum hm218749 pro- vides a novel method for the use of herb residue to better address the environmental pollution problem and waste of medicinal ingre- dients contained in herb residues.fundingno funding sources.competing interestsnone declared.ethical approvalnot required.acknowledgmentsthis work was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china no.

to test acid tolerance each isolate was diluted 1100 vv in phosphate-buffered saline pbs at ph 1.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 and 7.0 for 4 h. to test salt tolerance freshly prepared cultures were inoculated into corresponding media containing 0.1-0.5 ww bile salts and were incubated at 37 c for another 4 h. all bacterial colonies were enumerated using the plate count method.for antimicrobial activity overnight 12-16 h cultures of pathogenic micro-organisms including shigella dysenteriae 301 sh.

h. pylori infec- tions by the ss1 strain were conducted as previously described briefly freshly prepared aliquots 500 ul 109 cfu of the h. pylori ss1 strain in brain heart infusion broth oxoid were administered to mice via orogastric inoculation five times days 1 3 5 7 and 9. all noninfected control animals were inoculated with the same vol- ume of plain brain heart infusion broth.

eight weeks after the last gavage of h. pylori urease activity and histological imaging were examined to confirm successful modeling.next the mice were divided into 3 groups control group n  12 normal mice only given pbs model group n  12 the infectious model only given pbs treatment group n  12 the infectious model given herb residue fermentation supernatant.

ten weeks after the last gavage of h. pylori ss1 0.5 ml of pbs control group and model group or herb residue fermentation supernatant treatment group was administered to mice for 3 weeks and then the stomachs of 6 mice in each group were sterilely obtained and divided into 4 parts for the urease activity test histological imag- ing elisa testing il-6 il-8 and tnf-a and dgge analysis.
