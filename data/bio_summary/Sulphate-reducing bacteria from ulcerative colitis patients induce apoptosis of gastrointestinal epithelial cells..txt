It has been proposed that SRB likely contribute to colonic pathology for example ulcerative colitis UC.The interaction of SRB with the human colon and intestinal epithelial cell lines has been investigated using Desulfovibrio indonesiensis as a model mono-culture and in a co-culture with E. coli isolate and with SRB consortia from human biopsy samples.We find that D. indonesiensis whether as a mono- or co-culture was internalized and induced apoptosis in colon epithelial cells.

While the numbers of SRB are similar for UC patients and healthy controls differences were noted in the proliferative rates of bacterial colonies enriched from these samples .Other studies confirmed that samples from UC patients andhealthy controls harbor the same level of SRB but there are sig- nificant differences in the structure of the SRB community between the two groups .

Using antibodies against EPS of SRB we also identified SRB on samples from ulcerative colitis patients where they were found in association with the surface of intestinal epithelia c. These results suggested that the epithelial barrier was broken in the patients and the colonic epithelium was infil- trated with SRB bacteria.Fig.

The left panel aceg and i shows in green SRB staining with anti-EPS antibodies the right panel bdfh and j shows the double staining of SRB green and the nucleus blue of eukaryotic cells and bacteria.

The asterisk represents a significant difference relative to the 1x dose inoculum value.Antibodies against EPS of D. indonesiensis discriminate between SRB isolated from ulcerative colitis patients and control samplesThe polyclonal antibody against EPS of D. indonesiensis was used to recognize SRB in bacteria consortium isolated in biopsies from the intestinal mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients and control groups by the dot blotting assay.

The apoptosis induced by SRB was significantly higher when the cells were co-infected with E. coli commensal bacteria and these find- ings were confirmed when the SRB and E. coli were obtained from UC patients.

The SRB interacted with the cell membrane of epithelial cells usually creating aggre- gates presumably biofilms  both when D. indonesiensis infected alone e or in combination with E. coli 2RBP g. The E. coli 2RBP strain was not labeled with the antibody againstFig.

Furthermore the antibody raised against exopolysaccharides EPS ofindonesiensis cross reacted with the SRB population from UC patients but not with the SRB combi- nation from non-UC controls.

Although the involvement of SRB in the initiation andor mainte- nance of UC in both humans and animals has been proposed  the exact mechanism by which SRB could contribute to UC etiology remains unknown.
