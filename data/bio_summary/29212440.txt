Hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene have been extensively studied and adopted by researchers to describe prokaryotic microbial communities and a mix of ribosomal markers havebeen used to describe fungal communities  over the past 25 years The ITS region comprising the ITS1 5.8S and ITS2 segments was recently selected as the formal DNA barcode for fungi - although there is a lack of consensus regarding which ITS ITS1 or ITS2 to utilize as a barcode - It remains unclear which of the ITS primer sets has the best resolution for fungal diversity and papers targeting either ITS segment have been published at near equal frequencies -Pipelines for processing fungal ITS amplicon datasets such as CLOTU  CloVR-ITS  PIPITS  andothers are available in the literature but most of the tool-development effort has been towards generating Correspondence Equal contributors2Department of Plant Soil  Microbial Sciences Michigan State University East Lansing Michigan 48824 USAFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlenearly automated pipelines for filtering trimming and clustering of amplicon reads into operational taxonomic units OTUs.

For ITS2 datasets there was a 1-61 percent improvement at Family level Table For ITS1 datasets there was a 1 to 59 improvementat Family level Table At Species level there was a 35 mean improvement across all datasets Table The higher end of these ranges is due to poor classifica- tion of OTUs especially ITS2 OTUs using UTAX.

The score is used to estimate confidence values for each of the taxo- nomic levels which are then trained on the reference database to give an estimate of error rates The SINTAX algorithm predicts taxonomy by using k-mer similarity to identify the top hit in a reference database and provides bootstrap confidence for all ranks in the prediction Local alignment most commonly im- plemented in BLAST is still occasionally used for taxonomy assignment of high-throughput sequence datasets.

The mycological community should continue to generate high quality ITS reference sequences for their research organisms and from Herbarium specimens which will further enhance the performance of tax- onomy assignment algorithms.Additional filesAbbreviationsESV exact sequence variant ITS internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA OTU operational taxonomic unit PCR polymerase chain reaction RDP Ribosomal Database Project RDPC Ribosomal Database Project classifier rRNA ribosomal RNAAcknowledgmentsWe thank Matthew Agler for providing processed OTUs for our analysis and Benli Chai for assistance with RDPC training.FundingKG was supported by MSU Plant Science Fellowship and the Michigan Wheat Program.

The classifier programs tested here differ slightly in power so performing taxonomic classifications with multiple programs and combining the results will re- sult in a stronger assignment with higher resolution.When designing experiments it behooves researchers to carefully consider their target organisms when choos- ing the ITS barcode region and selecting primers.

In this study eight fungal amplicon datasets were assigned taxonomy using the same reference database and three taxonomy assignment programs were com- pared RDPC UTAX  3 and SINTAX The taxonomic classification step is arguably one of the most delicate steps of the pipeline for amplicon-based microbial ecology studies because taxon names are largely the basis by which scientists attach biological interpretation to the data.

When investigating broad patterns of fungi use of ITS alone should be sufficient but if there is interest in a specific group of fungi additional markers for those lineages such as 18S rRNA gene for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may be needed Further there are limitations in making functional inferences from fungal ITS amplicon data.

Also the total number of assigned OTUs varied across datasets ITS region and OTU-generation approach.

Regardless of primer choice we showed that use of multiple taxonomy assignment algorithms resulted in con- sistent classifications when an appropriate OTU-clustering threshold level is used.Our tool CONSTAX implements the following best practice tips for taxonomy assignment of ITS datasets i Use more than one classifier program as not one is clearly superior to others ii Obtain a consensus taxonomy after running multiple classifiers iii Use the most recent re- lease of software.

Analysis of plant datasets ITS1-plant and ITS2-plant began with the processed 97 similarity OTUs provided by the authors For the ITS12-BC and ITS12-UN datasets reads were quality-filtered as above but differed in OTU- generation method.
