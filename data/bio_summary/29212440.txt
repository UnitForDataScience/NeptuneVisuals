the unite reference database is a curated database of all international nucleotide sequence database col- laboration insdc fungal sequences and is the most commonly used reference database for fungal amplicon analyses -.

the score is used to estimate confidence values for each of the taxo- nomic levels which are then trained on the reference database to give an estimate of error rates the sintax algorithm predicts taxonomy by using k-mer similarity to identify the top hit in a reference database and provides bootstrap confidence for all ranks in the prediction local alignment most commonly im- plemented in blast is still occasionally used for taxonomy assignment of high-throughput sequence datasets.

for its2 datasets there was a 1-61 percent improvement at family level table for its1 datasets there was a 1 to 59 improvementat family level table at species level there was a 35 mean improvement across all datasets table the higher end of these ranges is due to poor classifica- tion of otus especially its2 otus using utax.

recently the ribosomal database project released the warcup fungal database a curated version of unite and insdc.

analysis of plant datasets its1-plant and its2-plant began with the processed 97 similarity otus provided by the authors for the its12-bc and its12-un datasets reads were quality-filtered as above but differed in otu- generation method.

the code for the otu-picking pipeline de- scribed above is available in additional file database formatting and classifier trainingthe unite fungal database release 31-01-2016 containing 23264 sequences was used in the currentstudy.

in this study eight fungal amplicon datasets were assigned taxonomy using the same reference database and three taxonomy assignment programs were com- pared rdpc utax  3 and sintax the taxonomic classification step is arguably one of the most delicate steps of the pipeline for amplicon-based microbial ecology studies because taxon names are largely the basis by which scientists attach biological interpretation to the data.

the mycological community should continue to generate high quality its reference sequences for their research organisms and from herbarium specimens which will further enhance the performance of tax- onomy assignment algorithms.additional filesabbreviationsesv exact sequence variant its internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal dna otu operational taxonomic unit pcr polymerase chain reaction rdp ribosomal database project rdpc ribosomal database project classifier rrna ribosomal rnaacknowledgmentswe thank matthew agler for providing processed otus for our analysis and benli chai for assistance with rdpc training.fundingkg was supported by msu plant science fellowship and the michigan wheat program.

the most popular are mothur qiime  and usearch  thereare a variety of algorithms to use for the taxonomy as- signment step which include blast  ribosomal database project rdp naive bayesian classifier utax 19 and sintax 20. the rdp classifier rdpc uses bayesian statistics to find 8-mers that have higher probability of belonging to a given genus.

however use of blast to identify otus in amplicon-based microbiome datasets has low accuracy as demonstrated previously - and discussed by wang et al.

apart from pre- viously published database comparisons which showed the accuracy of unite  and warcup fungal data- bases  all comparative studies of taxonomy classifiers of which we are aware have analyzed only prokaryoticorganisms   .

fur- ther we created a python tool that functions independently of otu-picking method to merge tax- onomy assignments from multiple classifier programs into an improved consensus taxonomy and generates several output files that can be used for subsequent community analysis.methodsdata accessibilitysample origins barcode regions and accession numbers for all datasets used in the current study can be found in table implementation of the tool presented in this paper requires users to download and install the following software rdpc  usearch version 8 for utax and usearch version 9 or later for sintax   r v2.15.1 or later  python version 2.7 detailed in- stallation and analysis instructions including all customtable 2 sample origins barcode regions and accession numbers for datasetsadata processed with uparse algorithm otus generated with clusteringbdata processed with unoise algorithm esvs generated with splittingscripts used in the analysis and a test dataset are available in additional file or for download from github  .
