.Since most alpine lakes are usually oligotrophic numer- ous studies of alpine lake ecosystems have concentrated on assessing the importance of nutrient availability on bacterial community composition and diversity Perez and Sommaruga  Logue et al.

A recent study concludes that in- creasing total nitrogen TN gradients induce a significant non- linear response of bacterial community assemblages from Pro- teobacteria to Cyanobacteria in plateau freshwater lakes Cao et al.

Consistently there is ample evidence thatinput from glacier retreat can be an important carbon source for bacteria in glacial-fed lake ecosystems competition for available substrates is expected to be a key factor in controlling bacterial diversity in Kalakuli Lake.Shifts in bacterial community compositionThe identification and characterization of bacterial populations in alpine lakes offer us information about the ecological niches of bacteria thriving in inland aquatic ecosystems Shafi et al.

Studies of the re- sponses of bacterial communities to nutrient conditions are crit- ical to understanding how climate change potentially affects mi- crobial communities in alpine lakes Pearce  Tranvik et al.

Liu et al.

The empirical evidence suggests that freshwater species richness in oligotrophic lakes depends on nutrient availability rather than on species-area relationships Logue et al.

Observations from field surveys also indicate that bacteria from different taxonomic groups may have diverse re- sponses to specific dissolved organic substrates Kirchman et al.

Elifantz et al.

Moreover a large body of literature based on nutrient enrichment experiments demonstrates that the Actinobacteria Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacte- ria are dominant bacterial groups in oligotrophic lakes Pearce et al.
