intraoperative bile samples were obtained for microbiological analysis after transection of the common bile duct.

more recent studies7- 12 including amulticentre rct however have demonstrated an increase in postoperative infectious complications.pbd by a stent is a significant risk factor for bacterial contamination of the biliary system with a bacterial florathat is resistant to antibiotics leading to an increased risk of postoperative infection13- 15. antibiotic prophylaxis basedon preoperative bile cultures and short-term antibiotic treatment in patients at risk of biliary contamination may reduce postoperative wound infections16- 18.the aims of this study were to characterize the bacterial flora in the bile of patients with periampullary cancer who did or did not undergo pbd and to assess whether there were differences in antibiotic resistance patterns and in the development of postoperative complications in these two groups of patients.methodsthis was a single-centre retrospective study.

the proportion of patients with positive bile cultures was significantly higher in the pbdtable 4 postoperative complications in patients with positive and negative bile culturesvalues in parentheses are percentages.

as in the present study bacteria isolated from the bile after pbd were often resistant to imipenem cefpirome andgentamicin13.in the present study an increased incidence of post- operative complications including wound infection was seen in patients with positive bile cultures.

whether surgery should be performed immediately in patients with obstructive jaundice or afterdecompression of the bile duct has been debated exten- sively and is the subject of ongoing studies.

a pos- terior gastroenterostomy and a cholecystogastrostomy to the anterior wall of the stomach was performed first followed by a pancreaticoduodenectomy 3-4 weeks later.c 2017 bjs society ltdbjs 2017 104 e182-e188the rationale was to decompress the obstructed biliary tract and allow restoration of liver function coagulopathy and haemorrhagic diathesis3.nowadays preoperative biliary drainage pbd is often performed by endoscopic placement of an endobiliary stent into the common bile duct cbd or via percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the biliary tract14.

details of all patients with carcinoma of the head of the pancreas carcinoma of the distal bile duct and ampullary cancer who were treated at the department of surgery of klinikum rechts der isar technical university of munich between july 2007 and july 2015 were retrieved from an institu- tional database.

only patients with existing samples from intraoperative bile cultures were included in the study.clinically relevant cholestasis was defined as a dilated biliary tree observed via imaging and a bilirubin concen- tration raised to 2 mgdl or above.

postoperative antibiotic treatment for patients experiencing major infectious abdominal complications was performed empirically with piperacillin-tazobactam adopted according to theantibiotic sensitivity of bile cultures and continued for 7 days.

final results of the bile cultures were available on day 3 after surgery.
