There was no signifi- cant difference in the postoperative wound infection rate in patients with and without a bile fistula 1 of 3 33 per cent versus 44 of 280 157 per cent P  0406 pancreatic fis- tula 8 of 29 28 per cent versus 37 of 254 146 per cent P  0102 or need for interventional drainage 8 of 31 26 per cent versus 37 of 252 147 per cent P  0120.Bacteria in bile and wound infectionsTable 5 shows the association between the type of bacterium cultured from the bile and the presence of a wound infec- tion after surgery.

Intraoperative bile samples were obtained for microbiological analysis after transection of the common bile duct.

The rate of wound infection was higher in patients with a positive bile culture 210 per cent versus 6 per cent in patients with sterile bile P  0002.

Antibiotic prophylaxis basedon preoperative bile cultures and short-term antibiotic treatment in patients at risk of biliary contamination may reduce postoperative wound infections16- 18.The aims of this study were to characterize the bacterial flora in the bile of patients with periampullary cancer who did or did not undergo PBD and to assess whether there were differences in antibiotic resistance patterns and in the development of postoperative complications in these two groups of patients.MethodsThis was a single-centre retrospective study.

The proportion of patients with positive bile cultures was significantly higher in the PBDTable 4 Postoperative complications in patients with positive and negative bile culturesValues in parentheses are percentages.

Similarly increased resistance was observed to other antibiotics including piperacillin-tazobactam ciprofloxacin and imipenem.Cholangitis was associated with a significant increase in antibiotic resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam 54 per cent versus 219 per cent in patients with no cholangitis P  0002 ciprofloxacin 52 versus 210 per cent respec- tively P  0002 and imipenem 44 versus 197 per cent P  0019 whereas resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was not affected by cholangitis 60 versus 573 per cent P  0831 Table S1 supporting information.Preoperative prophylaxis with broad-spectrum antibiotics led to increased resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam 59 per cent versus 189 per cent in patients who did not receive preoperative antibi- otics P  0001 ciprofloxacin 65 versus 162 per cent respectively P  0001 and imipenem 51 versus 167 percent P  0001 but again not to ampicillin-sulbactam71 versus 553 per cent P  0125 Table S2 supporting information.Increased duration of biliary drainage more than 4 weeks did not influence the incidence of antibiotic resis- tance to ampicillin-sulbactam piperacillin-tazobactam ciprofloxacin or imipenem Table S3 supporting informa- tion.Postoperative complicationsA positive bile culture was not associated with severe post- operative complications grade III or above 302 per cent versus 238 per cent in patients with sterile bile P  0274 Table 4.

As in the present study bacteria isolated from the bile after PBD were often resistant to imipenem cefpirome andgentamicin13.In the present study an increased incidence of post- operative complications including wound infection was seen in patients with positive bile cultures.

 Original articleEffect of preoperative biliary drainage on bacterial flora in bile of patients with periampullary cancerF.

Postoperative complica- tions were registered.Results Of 290 patients treated intraoperative bile samples were present for 172 patients 593 per cent who had PBD and 118 407 per cent who did not.

Contamination of bile was increased significantly in patients who underwent stenting 971 per cent versus 186 per cent in those without stenting P  0001.
