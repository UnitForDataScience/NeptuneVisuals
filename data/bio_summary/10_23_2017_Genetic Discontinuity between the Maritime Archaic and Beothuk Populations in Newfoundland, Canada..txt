4000 YBP.To assess the demographic history of both the MA and Beo- thuk we produced Bayesian skyline plots from the mitochondrial genomes of samples with associated radiocarbon dates 30 MA samples and 19 Beothuk samples Table S1 through the BEAST program suite see for full analysis details.

Some samples appeared to quantify poorly after the two rounds of enrichment and were subsequently re-amplified for an additional 10 cycles and then re-quantified as described above.QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISRadiocarbon calibration and MRE CorrectionRadiocarbon ages require calibration against a calibration curve such as IntCal13 for terrestrial samples or Marine13 for marine samples .

Most of the samples for our analyses are represented by teeth 83 4352 while the remaining samples are made up of bone material from cranial and appendicular elements 17 952.

Replicate samples n  12 yielded a mean difference of 0.1 for both carbon and nitrogen far below the threshold for meaningful dietary interpretation.AMS Dating at UCIBone samples of approximately 200mg were removed from 31 human skeletons from Port au Choix-3 and from 20 skeletons affil- iated with the precontact and historic Beothuk and Dorset Palaeoeskimo archaeological cultures.

The radiocarbon samples were calibrated Figures S2 and S3 using OxCal v. 4.3  with the DR calculated using the 14CHRONO Marine Radiocarbon Reservoir online data- base .Sequencing and bioinformatic processingAll samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform at the Farncombe Institute at McMaster University.

All samples were observed to possess some degree of terminal deamination though the proportion of damaged molecules varied throughout the samples.

Contamination estimates for samples were generally low with more than 25 of all samples reporting only 1 contamination but ranged as high as 37 with a mean of 3 Table S1.Consensus sequence generation and curationWe also used schmutzi  to generate the consensus sequences by mitigating the impact of deamination-induced nucleotide mis- incorporation.

This final dataset of 74 unique samples was aligned with MAFFT v. 7.2  the multiple alignment was visually inspected to correct any areas of ambiguous alignment and uploaded to Haplogrep Build 17  to assign the mitochondrial haplogroup Table S1Population AssignmentThe assignments of the 53 MA samples are supported by strong contextual data and radiocarbon ages that do not overlap with any other occupations of the island .

This sample set in- cludes the MA subadult found in the L'Anse Amour burial mound the oldest known burial mound in North America and one of the first manifestations of the MA tradition  with the remaining MA samples coming from multiple burial loci of Port au Choix-3  .

The majority of the Beothuk samples are from the Notre Dame Bay area the geographic area where the Beo- thuk retreated in response to European expansions.
