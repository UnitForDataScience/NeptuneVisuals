Thus considering the beneficial metabolic features of SCFAs these bacteria also involved in chitin degradation may contribute to hen health during insect diet such as lowering blood triglycerides andcholesterol levels.The reduced feed intake during insect meal administration reported by Marono et al.

Insect diet indeed may decrease the use of antibiotics in the poultry indus- try controlling the antimicrobial resistance and its adverse effects on human health.The gut microbiota plays an important role in its vertebrate host facilitating the digestion of food or feed com- ponents fermenting the diet ingredients to short chain fatty acids SCFAs as major products.

Lower serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels and a reduction of feed intake and body weight were observed in the ID group with respect to SD group as also reported by Marono et al.

Cecal microbiota analyses were performed in order to describe and compare the gut bacterial composition of two groups of laying hens fed with soybean and insect meal-based diet SD and ID respectively n 6 pool of 2 samplesgroup sequencing of V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene from cecal samples generated 178376 high quality reads assigned to a total of 1461 operational taxonomic units OTUs.

A sequencing depth of 5234 sequencessample with good's coverage  96.9 and clus- tered in 1123 OTUs was considered to elaborate the results and analyze the effect of insect meal-based diet on gut microbial communities with respect to SD.Insect meal administration significantly increased the diversity within microbial populations as indicated by a higher number of observed species and Shannon entropy increase in ID samples with respect to SD samples Fig.

Firmicutes 49.28 - 3.16 in SD and 57.69 - 2.37 in ID mean - SEM Bacteroidetes 31.52 - 3.28 and 25.40 - 1.30 in SD and ID respec- tively and Proteobacteria 7.92 - 1.31 in SD and 8.38 - 0.47 in ID were the most abundant bacterial phyla detected in both groups Fig.
