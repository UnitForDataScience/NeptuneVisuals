Twenty-five isolates that represent the egg surface microbial community diversity were selected out of the 92 isolates based on the previous pyrosequencing data and the phylogenetic tree topology of the isolates and were tested for antagonistic inter- actions and biofilm forming capabilities.Antagonistic Interactions Between IsolatesThe soft agar overlay technique proved to be a sensitive meth- od for detecting antagonistic interactions Fig.

Isolates that could not be grown in the broth were grown in R2A plate media at room temperature 20-22 degC for 48 h.Soft Agar Overlay Technique for Screening AntagonistsAntagonistic interactions among 25 isolates were screened by stamping 23 of the isolates on a soft agar lawn previously inoculated with one of the 25.

We demonstrated that some isolates from the egg surfaces exhibited antagonistic interac- tions and biofilm forming capabilities that could help them to compete for resources and space on the egg when interacting with other members of the egg-associated microbial community.We found that temperature influenced the detection of an- timicrobial activity among isolates suggesting that the nature of microbial interactions on the egg surface microbial com- munity could vary across the prolonged spawning season for lake sturgeon since ambient water temperature changes dur- ing the egg incubation period and fluctuates daily .

The most ag- gressive of the isolates disrupted biofilm formation of twowell-characterized isolates but enhanced biofilm formation of a fish pathogen.

Out of the 92 isolates 77 were isolated from the stream eggs with 45 isolates coming fromFig.

Sequences deposited in GenBank are labeled SEI Sturgeon Egg Isolate followed by a microtiter plate coordinatethe early run strain ID starts with A B C and 32 isolates from the late run strain ID starts with D and E. The remain- ing 15 isolates were from the hatchery reared eggs strain ID starts with F. Taxa include representatives from phylum Bacteroidetes all Flavobacterium spp.

Overall 48 to 72 depen- dent on temperature of the isolates we tested were susceptible to at least one of the isolates.The degree of antagonism among our isolates is shown in Fig.

Seven out of nine b- proteobacteria were susceptible to one of the g-proteobacteria isolates at 21 degC and 5 out of 6 Flavobacterium isolates were susceptible to both Bacillus sp.

Although about 80 of b-proteobacteria isolates were susceptible to at least one of the other isolates strains Vogesella sp.

The 25 isolates used in thisstudy encompassed 16 genera including 5 isolates from genus Flavobacterium the most dominant of all genera identified on the egg surfaces using pyrosequencing during the incubation periods in the natural stream.
