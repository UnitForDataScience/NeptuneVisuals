Taking this into account by running a GLMM the data indicated that surface was the only variable to independently have a significant effect on AMR.Patterns and dynamics of microbial diversityDue to the growing availability of molecular data for microbial species it is now possible to test many long standing ecological theories in the realm of microbial ecology Ambulances as well as other healthcare settings tend to be cleaned regularly creating a dis- turbed microbial ecosystem which is constantly being recolonized from patient healthcare workers visitors and the environment Disturbed environments have lower diversity which has been shown to be more conducive to invasive species at the macroscopic leveland for pathogens at the microscopic level a prop- erty referred to as colonization resistance for microbes- We found a positive correlation between alpha diversity and nosocomial pathogens so in broad terms our data do not support this theory however this is not taking into account how combinations of microorgan- isms may facilitate colonization.

To then assess prediction perform- ance as a function of dataset we performed a parameter sweep using a RF classifier for microbial composition data MetaPhlAn2 and MetaPhlAn2CLARK overlap data and functional data HUMAnN.The generalization error of the resulting best-fit RF mtry  8 ntree  128 was evaluated using the overlap test set.

BF conducted data analysis including PCoA beta diversity analysis and species correlation analysis.

With currently available sequencing technology and analysis tools we are now able to explore these patterns at the microorganismal level in new ways uncovering undiscovered levels of diversity and identifying novel microbial ecology dynamics Metagenomics has been used to study the microbial ecology of a growing number of diverse environments including urban environments such as subways  healthcare settings such as hospitals - built environments such as homes  and natural environments such as oceans  Findings include evidence of overabundance of particular microbial populations associated with specific envi- ronments and taxa being driven by a myriad of factors such as surface-type humidity temperature and cleaning regimens.

Our findings support the hypothesis that mi- crobial species diversity may follow the LDG in agreement with at least one prior study We found that surface did not have an effect on alpha diversity but it did have an effect on beta di- versity as well as many other microbial variables AMR RF classification and functional results indi- cating that surface may play a role in shaping microbial communities and differentiation between microbial communities but potentially not diversity within sample.

By generating syn- thetic data to test our workflow we found that working with the overlap data was a trade-off that increased our precision but decreased our sensitivity.An additional challenge in characterizing pathogens using metagenomic data is that genus and species level identification may group pathogenic and non-pathogenic species andor strains but resolutions to the strain level are still computationally challenging.

These overlapping species have been character- ized further when data was retrievable Additional file Table S6 using sources including MicrobeWiki h i and the Human Microbiome Project hSurface and region classificationTo explore how variables including surfaces cities and region may contribute to the variation in microbial com- munities observed we used a machine learning approach to analyze these data.

Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was calculated to estimate beta diversity using the overlap data and the Vegan R package.Since weather including temperature and humidity have shown to play a prominent role in microbial diversity  weather data was downloaded and used in modeling alpha and beta diversity.
