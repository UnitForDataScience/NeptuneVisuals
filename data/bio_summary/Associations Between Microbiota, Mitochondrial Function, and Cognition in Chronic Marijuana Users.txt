Recently cannabinoid CB1 receptor was found in neuronal mitochondria mt membrane where it mediated the inhibitory effect of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol THC on mt respiration and energy production Benard et al.

mt share some common structure and function with bacteria and microbiota can interact with host cells through regulating mt biogenesis Saint-Georges-Chaumet and Edeas .

Therefore chronic MJ use may be associated with altered abundances of Prevotella and Bacteroides which in turn may affect systemic mt function and cognition.We carried out a pilot study in a small cohort of subjects as a first step to examine the possible relationships among mi- crobiota composition mt respiration and cognitive function in the context of chronic MJ use.

ATP production was used as the primary measurement of mt function and basal andmaximal respiration rates were considered as the secondary measurements of mt function.

d. Meanwhile mt maximal respiration rate correlated with the abundance of Log-Prevotella r  0.54 p  0.035 data not shown but not with that of Bacteroides.Greater Log lifetime MJ use was associated with lower mt ATP production r  -0.72 p  0.0057 Fig.

3 kg their mt ATP production was higher than the mean value of nonusers while heavier MJ users had lower mt ATP production than the mean value of nonusers Fig.

However regardless of MJ use status mt function positively correlated with the abundance of Prevotella but inversely correlated with that of Bacteroides.These findingsprovide a preliminary framework for further explorations of the possible relationships between MJ use gut microbiota mt func- tion and cognitive function.MJ Use Dietary Patterns and PrevotellaPrevotella and Bacteroides are two dominant and antagonistic genera of phylum Bacteroidetes with the former associated with plant-based diet high in fruits and fiber and the latter associated with animal-based diet high in protein and fat Ley .

Plant-based foods typically contain higher levels of antioxidants than an- imal food products which may explain why higher levels of Prevotella associated with higher dietary intake of plant- derived antioxidants may provide protection against oxida- tive stress and lead to greater mt function.Conversely the inverse correlations between Bacteroides abundance and mt activities may be related to relatively lower levels of antioxidants in animal food prod- ucts.

Therefore the lower mt function in those with greater Bacteroides abun- dance might also be mediated by propionate production.THC or Cannabis Effects on PBMC Mt Oxygen Consumption and Cognitive FunctionAlthough our MJ users as a group had higher mt ATP produc- tion than nonusers those who had greater lifetime MJ use had lower ATP production.

Notably many of these in vitro studies used supraphysiological doses of cannabinoids which is consistent with our observation that heavier MJ use was associated with lower systemic mt function.In our relatively small sample although MJ users and nonusers had similar cognitive performance at the group level significant correlations between measures of mt function and cognitive performance were found only in the MJ user group.
