The number of processed full-length 16S rRNA sequences per coral sample ranged from 20453 to 60143 with an average of 31761 readssample Table .Due to the high cost of Sanger sequencing the number of full-length 16S rRNA sequences investigated in coral microbiome studies typically ranged from 50 to 200 reads per sample-  which was insufficient to capture the complete diversity of the population.

The number and percentage of bacterial species within each genus identified in our coral microbiome that were classifiable using the V3-V4 V5-V6 or full-length 16S rRNA sequences are shown in Supplementary Table .

Microbial communities associated with Porites corals also comprised members of other commonly occurring marine and coral bacterial phyla including Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Lentisphaerae and Cyanobacteria.Proteobacteria account for the majority of bacterial diversity in most of the marine environment including tropical coral species  temperate and cold-water scleractinians and octocorals .

Despite the importance of bacterial associates to coral hosts there have been very few studies that focused on the identification and charac- terisation of species-specific association between corals and bacteria.Historically environmental 16S rRNA gene profiling was performed using clone-based Sanger sequencing which provided accurate full-length or near full-length sequences.

This is in agreement with our finding that bacteria that form stable and species-specific associations may be present at low relative abundance in the coral microbiome.Superior performance of full-length 16S rRNA sequences in taxonomical classification at spe- cies resolution.Resolving the taxonomy of 16S rRNA sequences based solely on limited segments of the 16S rRNA gene derived from next generation sequencing can be challenging.

The full-length 16S rRNA sequences along with their respective V3-V4 and V5-V6 regions werealigned to the non-redundant RDP reference bacterial type strain sequences using BLAST with an E-value cutoff of 10-10.

Besides being found embedded deep within tissues of Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora verrucosa cor- als Endozoicomonas appears to inhabit the coral surface mucus layer and the coral skeletonof both Acropora and Porites corals and its function has been speculated to be involved in biofilm production that allowed other bacteria to colonize coral surfaces.
