BBR treatment revealed a positive effect on butyrate production similar to that observed in the HFD- hamsters C  D. In an inverse correlation with the level of blood butyrate blood TC TG and FBG went down in the ob ob mice treated with butyrate C D  E. This reduction positively correlated with the dosage of butyrate and the treatment time C D  E demonstrating the regulatory effect of butyrate on the metabolism of lipids and glucose.

An aliquot of 1 mL of the supernatant was injected into the GC-2014 for butyrate analysis.Obob Mice ModelEighteen obob mice were randomly divided into 3 groups 6 mice were given a low dose of butyrate treatment 200 mgkgd group 1 6 were given a high dose of butyrate 400 mgkgd group 2 and 6 were given the BBR treatment 100 mgkgd group 3.

Although the plasma butyrate level in the BBR-treated obob mice was lower than that in the mice directly treated with butyrate B P  0.05 day 7 and 10 the lipids and glucose- lowering efficacy of BBR was in general higher than that of direct butyrate treatment C P  0.01 on day 10 EP  0.01 on day 7 and 10.

This is because it has been reported that PTBBUK gene knockout mutants showed no decrease in butyrate produc- tion in C. tyrobutyricum  as butyrate is an end product of the energy metabolism network in bacteria A. There- fore the molecular mechanisms involved in BBR-mediated increase of butyrate in bacteria need further investigation.Although the presented work investigates the role of the gut microbiota in the mode of action of BBR the finding is of particular significance to herbal medicines because herbal chemicals are often poorly absorbed in the intestines .

Intraperitoneal BBR administration did not increase butyrate but reduced blood lipid and glucose levels suggesting that BBR has two modes of action the direct effect of the circulated BBR and the indirect effectAbbreviations SCFAs short-chain fatty acids LDLR low-density lipoprotein receptor InsR insulin receptor AMPK AMP-activated protein kinase PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 PTP1B protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B BBR berberine TC total cholesterol LDL-C low-density lipoprotein cholesterol TG triglycerides LC-MSMS liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry GC gas chromatography HFD high-fat diet ip intraperitoneal PGF pseudo-germ-free GAPDH glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase NADH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide BUK butyrate kinase BUT butyryl-CoAacetate-CoA transferase PTB phosphotransbutyrylase FFAR2 free fatty acid receptor 2 FFAR3 free fatty acid receptor 3 GPCR G protein-coupled receptor.

Bacterial butyrate is mainly synthesized through the acetyl CoA-butyryl CoA- butyrate pathway in which the key enzymes are regulated based on the level of ATP and NADH .

In this study we show that BBR enriched butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota and through the acetyl CoA-butyryl CoA- butyrate pathway BBR promotes the gut microbiota to synthe- size butyrate which then enters the blood and causes a reduction in blood lipid and glucose levels.

A Treating Sprague-Dawley SD rat intestinal bacteria with BBR 10 and 20 mgmL in vitro increased butyrate concentrations in the culture P  0.05 andP  0.01 heat inactivation of intestinal bacteria abolished the effect of BBR on butyrate production insert.

Feeding healthy hamsters a HFD for 6 weeks significantly decreased the butyrate level in their feces and plasma by 24 and 44 respectively C and at the same time TC TG and LDL-C increased in the hamsters P  0.001 for all three C. Treating the HFD-hamsters with BBR orally 100 mgkgd for 10 days increased butyrate in their feces and plasma by 1.8- and 2.5-fold D respectively verifying the butyrate-increasing effect of BBR in vivo.

Accordingly TC TG and LDL-C significantly decreased in HFD-hamsters as com- pared to that before treatment D P  0.001 for all three.Increasing Butyrate Production in the Gut Microbiota is a Newly Discovered Mechanism of BBR in Reducing Blood Lipid and Glucose LevelsTo elucidate the role of butyrate obese obob mice were treated directly with an oral administration of butyrate sodium using BBR as a reference.
