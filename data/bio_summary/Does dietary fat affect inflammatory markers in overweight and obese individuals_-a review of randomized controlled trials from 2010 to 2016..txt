the present review do not focus on weight reduction and inflammatory response but rather fat quality and inflammatory response which might ex- plain the discrepancy between the present review com- pared with previous studies the limitation in time giving a limited amount of studies in the present reviewmay also influence the results.conclusionobesity is associated with pathological changes in adi- pose tissue morphology including infiltration of immune cells and obese individuals have higher circulating levels of inflammatory markers than lean individuals as- sociations between intake or status of various fatty acids and inflammatory markers have been examined in hu- man studies and there is a general agreement that increasing dietary sfa intake especially in overweight and obese individuals is associated with raised inflam- matory markers  in the present review comprising studies between january 2010 and september 2016 we only found minor effects of dietary fat on inflammatory markers in overweight and obese subjects.

studying the effect of intake of soy nuts or textured soy protein they found no sig- nificant differences in crp between the groups in another study the effects of high oleic peanuts on cardio-metabolic measures and crp in healthy over- weight adults were examined however no clear effects were found finally tey and coworkers compared the effects on inflammatory markers with consumption of either 0 30 or 60 g of hazelnuts per day for 12 weeks they found no effect on any of the inflammatory markers examined crp il-6 icam and vcam.despite the high-fat content of nuts including pufa intake of nuts do not seem to modulate markers of in- flammation in overweight or obese individuals which is in accordance with previous review even though two of the five included studies found lower inflammatory markers in the nut groups il-6 vcam the effects dis- appeared when adjusting for weight loss or compared to the control group.vegetable oilsvegetable oils are rich in pufa the main constituent being n6 fatty acids.

however despite the general acceptance that n6 pufa are pro-inflammatory several studies show that humans with the highest intake or plasma level of n6 pufa have the lowest inflammatory status and hence do not support a pro- inflammatory effect 15.in the hours following the consumption of a meal a transient increase in circulating inflammatory markers occurs which potentially contributes to endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease the post-prandial inflammatory reaction appears to be triggered mainly by triglycerides and sfa in addition to total energy and glucose content of the meal  interestingly this post-prandial inflammatory response is exaggerated in obese subjects persistent increased post-prandial exposure produces a state of chronic low-grade inflam- mation characterized by increased systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines tnfa il-1b and il-6 and chemokines  which is a critical player in the devel- opment of many lifestyle diseases.research on diet-related health effects has traditionally examined single nutrients.

in the present review the focus was fat intake and therefore no studies specifically investigating matrix ef- fects or dairy peptides were included which may explain the lack of beneficial effects.nutsnuts are high-energy nutrient-dense foods that are rich in pufa and other bioactive components including fiber antioxidants vitamins and minerals evidence suggests that nut consumption may have beneficial ef- fects on oxidative stress inflammation and vascular re- activity importantly epidemiological studies show a negative correlation between nut intake and risk of cvd and recently the predimed study found 30 re- duction in cvd after intake of a mediterranean diet enriched with mixed nuts walnuts almonds and hazel- nuts in a high-risk cvd group five studies that investigated the inflammatory effects of nuts in overweight and obese subjects were included in this review table when investigating the effect of the american heart association aha dietary guide- lines with or without enrichment of 30 g raw mixed nuts 15 g walnuts 7.5 g almonds and 7.5 g hazelnuts on in- flammatory markers for 12 weeks lopez-uriarte et al.

investigated the effects of extra virgin olive oil compared with corn oil soybean oil and butter on quantity and functionality of a number of lymphocyte subsets  in general there were no anti- inflammatory effects of olive oil intake however the au- thors suggested that the increased t cell proliferation in the olive oil group might reflect immune-modulatory ef- fects of olive oil consumption .masson and mensink esser and coworkers and van dijk et al.

after the hmufa post-prandial fat challenge the mrna level of tnfa and metalloproteinase-9 mmp-9 were downregulated in pbmc compared with the hsfa fat challenge moreover the post-prandial effect on the pbmc proteome nuclear and cytoplasmic was also examined in the lipgene study by rangel-zuniga et al.and camargo et al.

specific dietary factors such as dietary fat may modulate inflammation and thereby risk of disease in humans  dietary fat is composed of different fatty acids like saturated fatty acids sfa and trans fatty acids monounsaturated fatty acids mufa polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa of both omega n 6- and n3-family and conjugated linoleic acid cla.

while some studies show no association be- tween dietary fat intake and body weight other studies do find an association however during the past years several studies have confirmed that total energy intake rather than macronutrients distribution per se is the more important determinant of weight reduction and maintenance  therefore it is of high inter- est to elucidate if different fatty acids as part of a diet- induced weight reduction will affect the low-grade inflammatory status observed in overweight and obesity.tovar and coworkers  investigated the cardio- metabolic protective effect of an 8-week multifunctional diet mfd including food items such as low-glycemic- impact meals antioxidant-rich foods oily fish viscous dietary fibers soybean and whole barley kernel products almonds and plant stanols in overweight and obese sub- jects compared with a control diet where none of the abovementioned functional food items were included.

calder and coworkers performed a comprehen- sive review of dietary factors and inflammation in 2011 including both dietary patterns and dietary components whole grains fruits vegetables nuts soya coffee tea cocoa fiber milk peptides vitamin e vitamin c fatty acids carbohydrates iron vitamin d phytochemicals gut microbiota prebiotics and probiotics they con- clude that a healthy dietary pattern like the mediterra- nean diet is associated with decreased low-grade inflammation in both healthy and obese individuals.

in contrast to at-risk obese aro the mho phenotype is defined by a favorable cardio-metabolic profile despite the same amount of body fat including a more favorable inflammatory profile less visceral fat less infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue and smaller adipocyte cell size -.
