A study that employed next generation sequencing of salivary microbiota in healthy indi- viduals consuming a transconjugant Streptococcus salivarius M18 also reported no significant changes in the overall ecol- ogy with the probiotic streptococcus forming a large propor- tion of the total indigenous S. salivarius population in some individuals .However significant health-associated changes in the supragingival plaque microbiota were reported in a study that employed L. reuteri as a prophylactic probiotic suggesting niche-specific ecological changes in addition to effects spe- cific to the probiotic strain used .

However it is known that the tongue is a more distinct niche than the periodontal niches in terms of species that normally colonise suggesting the requirement of niche-specific adapta- tions and probiotic strains targeted to colonise the periodontal niches may not readily colonise the tongue to exert health- promoting effects  .One of the earliest probiotic strains proposed to target oral malodour and fulfilling the above criteria was the bacteriocin- producing strain S. salivarius K12 which reduced breath vol- atile sulfur compound VSCs concentrations in individuals who consumed the probiotic lozenges after pre-treatment with a chlorhexidine rinse -.

High throughput sequencing study of community-wide changes in supragingival plaque microbiota with probiotic use and follow up.Dongarra ML et al.

Whilst the differences in dental plaque scores between these studies may relate to the probiotic strain used and differences in treatment modality these data suggest that probiotic strains could alter the community structure of the supragingival and subgingival plaque in chronic periodontitis either directly by inhibiting disease-associated taxa such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia or indirectly by inhibiting the keystone pathogen P. gingivalis.Probiotic treatment of gingivitis as an adjunct to professional mechanical plaque removal has also shown significant reduc- tions in the major periodontopathogens namely P. gingivalisA.

In a study that investigated twice per day probiotic L. reuteri consumption for 3 weeks as an adjunct to clinical treatment of chronic periodon- titis a significant reduction in the proportion of obligate anaer- obes in the subgingival plaque was observed up to 21 weeks after the end of the probiotic course compared to placebo witha return to baseline levels at the 1 year follow-up .

Further the lack of more comprehensive ecological surveys using established high throughput 16S rDNA sequencing plat- forms in the literature limits the current understanding into the nature of community-wide changes exerted by the probiotic strains in the periodontal niches during treatment.Probiotics in the Maintenance of Periodontal HealthEcological surveys reported in studies that investigated probiotics for preventative oral care have provided some in- sights into the changes occurring in the oral microbiome of healthy individuals consuming probiotic products.

Recent in vitro studies continue to elucidate the mechanisms of probiotic im- mune modulation showing that probiotic lactobacilli could abolish CXCL8 attenuation by P. gingivalis and promote Th1 and Th17 responses  .

It is also hypothesised that those oral commensals associated with health are likely to be more effective as probiotic species than the traditional gut-associated probiotic species in terms of ability to colonise health- promoting functions biocompatibility and necessary dosage.
