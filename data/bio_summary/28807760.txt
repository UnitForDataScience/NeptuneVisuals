Therefore our data indicates that the feces collection methodology proposed is a suitable tool for obtaining culturable bac- teria from mosquitoes.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at .Conflicts of interestNoneAcknowledgmentsThe authors express their gratitude to Conselho Nacional deDesenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico CNPq Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior CAPES Rede de Biodiversidade e Biotecnologia da Amazonia Legal BIONORTECNPq MCT FIOCRUZ RONDONIA Fundacao Universidade Federal de Rondonia UNIR Instituto Federal de Educacao Ciencia e Tecnologia de Rondonia and to Rede de Plataformas Tecnologicas Fiocruz.

However it is reasonable to hypothesize that mosquito feces contain microorganisms that are andor were present in the intestine of these insects.The present device for collecting cultivable intestinal microorgan- isms from mosquito feces does not require insect dissection to collect material reducing work and external contamination issues.The feces collection device is based in a modified PVC mosquito cage with 3 compartments namely 1- upper compartment for feeding 2- middle compartment body for maintenance of mosquitoes 3- lowercompartment for collection of feces .The middle compartment is a 10 x 10 cm diameter and height PVC tube screened on both sides with a mosquito-proof nylon net 1.5 mm mesh and a side opening covered by a perforated elastic material for mosquito manipulation.

The sterility of internal surface of feces col- lection device was checked after the cleaning and UV treatment using Corresponding author at Laboratorio de Bioecologia de Insetos Depto de Biologia Universidade Federal de Rondonia BR 364 Km 95 sentido Acre Porto Velho RO CEP 76800- 000 Brazil.E-mail address A.

Mosquitoes are introduced into the device through the middle compartment side opening feed in the sucrose solution placed the in the upper com- partment and then release their feces into the lower compartment in- accessible to the mosquitoes that keeps the Petri dishes containing LB agar culture medium .Mosquitoes were captured in Porto Velho Rondonia State Brazil using a hand-held aspirator identified using identification keys .The Feces collection device was cleaned using water and neutral liquid soap rinsed with distilled water and then with 70 ethanol for 10 s and rotated after 30 min while drying under UV light inside a microbiological safety cabinet for 1 h. The devices were packed in plastic film prior to use.

We highlight the pioneering study on the experimental transmission of the yellow fever virus from fecal material present in the legs of infected mosquitoes   and recently the study conducted by using the feces of the mosquito Anopheles stephensi for xenomonitoring of the nematode Brugia malayia and protozoan Plasmodium vivax.

The amplicons were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit QIAGEN according to the manufacturer's specifications.Sequencing was performed using the Sanger method in an ABI 3730 DNA Sequencer from Life Technologies.

The upper side contains cotton soaked with 10 sucrose for mosquito feeding covered by a PVC lid upper compartment preventing any external microorganism con- tamination.

Lower compartment for collection of mosquito feces.

Three mosquito-free devices were used as negative controls.Petri dishes containing the mosquito feces in LB agar culture were removed from the lower compartment after 24 h and incubated at 37 degC for 24 h .
