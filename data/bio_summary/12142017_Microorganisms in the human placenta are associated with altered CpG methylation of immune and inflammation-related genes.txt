presence of microorganisms in the placenta and methylation of cpg probes and associated genes.1 hyperm  hypermethylated2 hypom  hypomethylatedidentification of differentially methylated probes in elgan placentas exposed to bacteriaplacental cpg methylation differences were analyzed within the elgan cohort between 84 individuals with or without placental microbes for 377716 cpg probes representing 20418 genes.

these varying inflammatory responses induced by placental bacteria might be driven by cpg methylation in the placenta which could impact both placen- tal function and fetal well-being.to our knowledge this is among the first studies to assess placental cpg methylation in relation to placenta bacteria.

the probes that displayed differential methylation were unique depending on which bacteria was present .the microbial species that was associated with the greatest number of altered cpg sites was streptococcus group b with 1257 differentially methylated cpg probes n  802 genes.

here we investigated whether placental microbes were associated with altered placental dna cpg methylation patterns in the elgan cohort.

the fact that there is little overlap between the cpg probes that are differentially methylated for each bacterium shows a diverse placental epigenetic response depending on which bacterial species is present.in the present analysis the nf-kb pathway was enriched among the microorganism-associ- ated differentially methylated genes.

to evalu- ate whether the presence of microorganisms is associated with the human placental epigen- ome we integrated data for 16 different microbial species in the placenta with genome-wide cpg methylation levels.

the specific genes with altered methylation could represent etiologic factors that contribute to pla- cental function and fetal health.the data from the study show that 14 of the bacteria species were associated with unique cpg probes with not much overlap between the bacterial types.

six of our 50 immune-related genes are transcribed by rela and the cpg probes that are associated with these genes were all hypomethylated in the presence of strep- tococcus group b bacteria.

other placental bacteria group b streptococcus and escherichia coli are associated with chorioamnionitis and fetal infection .

epigenetic changes such as dna methylation have been associated with bacteria in other tissues including helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa - uropathogenic escherichia coli in uroepithelial cells  and campylobacter rectus in murine placental tissue .

in human placental cell culture the pres- ence of bacteria has been associated with both pro- and anti- inflammatory responses medi- ated by cytokines .

with an intriguing potential for sustained inflammation our team showed in the extremely low gestation age newborns elgan cohort that vaginotropic placental bacteria were associated with distinct inflammatory protein profiles in newborn blood with lactobacillus sp.

the methylation pattern for streptococcus group b leans heavily toward hypomethy- lation with 98 1232 of the sites being hypomethylated.following streptococcus group b the two microbial species that were associated with the most differentially methylated probes were streptococcus group d and alpha-hemolytic strep- tococcus with 206 and 167 cpg probes respectively.

future research should have a larger sample size and incorporate mrna and protein expression data along with the cpg methylation data.this study is among the first to investigate the potential effect of placental bacteria on the methylome of the placenta.

for example it has been proposed that oral bacteria can translocate to the placenta by hematogenous transmission .importantly certain bacteria in the placenta have been associated with deleterious preg- nancy outcomes such as preterm birth .
