These find- ings emphasize the importance of DNA de-methylation in SLE gender bias.An extensive sex-specific genetic association study on au- tosomal genes 5932 female and 1495 male samples revealed that men most likely require a higher cumulative genetic load than women to develop an SLE .Rheumatoid ArthritisContrary to SLE RA has been described only rarely in men with the Klinefelter syndrome suggesting that the surplus X chromosome does not provide an additional RA risk .

Due to higher prevalence of osteoporosis in women in the general population and the high amount of female SLE patients oste- oporosis in SLE has been mostly investigated in femaleTable 4 SLE co-morbidities in female compared to male patients sorted from the highest to the lowest femalemale ratiopatients  .

DOI 10.1007s12016-017-8631-6Sex Symptom Severity and Quality of Life in RheumatologyMarco Krasselt1 Christoph Baerwald1 Springer ScienceBusiness Media LLC 2017Abstract Inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as rheuma- toid arthritis RA and systemic lupus erythematosus SLE show a striking female predominance ranging from 31 in RA up to 91 in SLE.

In this respect IL-10 as a pleiotropic cytokine has opposite effects in SLE compared to RA.Progesterone might provide positive effects in SLE patients by counteracting estradiol effects e.g.

Concordantly the prevalence of Klinefelter syndrome is 10 times higher in male SLE patients compared to the general population .Different X-linked genes Table  such as TLR7 have been associated with the sex bias in SLE .

Nevertheless more research on that topic is imminent to find further proof for the impact of the gut microbiota on the gender bias in RA and elucidate the distinct mechanisms behind it in detail.Symptom Severity and Quality of LifeWhen comparing the impact of either RA or SLE on patients RA seems to have the more negative effect on quality of life than SLE .

These results have been confirmed at least partly by another recent investigation while the physical domains have been lower in RA patients compared to SLE patients the mental domains have been worse in SLE patients .Nevertheless symptom severity differs between genders as epidemiology of the same rheumatic disease does.

As for laboratory findings thrombocytopenia and anti- dsDNA antibodies are more frequent in male patients while leukopenia lupus anticoagulant low-level C3 and ANAs are more common in women .Interestingly depression and signs of anxiety which are both more frequent in female SLE patients   seemTable 3 SLE features with a significant sex variety given are female male ratiosa Including hematuria proteinuria nephrotic syndrome renal insufficien- cy renal failure and requirement of a renal biopsyb Only seizures requiring a therapy for at least 6 monthsto have the same negative impact on quality of life as measured using the SF-36 in men and women .

While current data shows a higher risk for female compared to male SLE patients male SLE patients are at a particular increased risk when being compared to healthy men .

While signs of de- pression are more frequent in female SLE patients compared to healthy women there is no such difference for male SLE patients when being compared to healthy men .
