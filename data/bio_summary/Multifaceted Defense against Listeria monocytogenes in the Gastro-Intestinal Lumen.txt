L. monocytogenes replicates in the gallbladder and re-accesses the intestinal lumen via the common bile duct upon gallbladder contraction .Although most studies have focused on L. monocytogenes colonization and invasion of the small intestine several studies including our own have demonstrated that marked expansion and prolonged persistence of L. monocytogenes occurs in the large intestine of rodents as well as other model animals -.

Furthermore treatment with cephalosporins a class of eta-lactam antibiotics to which L. monocytogenes is resistant was shown to worsen the effect of immune-suppressant drugs administered prior to oral L. monocytogenes inoculation by increasing both intestinal expansion and systemic spread of intragastrically inoculated bacteria .Consistent with this previous work we recently showed that perturbation of the microbiota through antibiotic treatment dramatically increases luminal expansion of L. monocytogenes in mice rendering doses as low as 100 CFUs capable of colonizing the entire intestinal tract and leading to systemic spread .

As a result of gastric acid-mediated killing of L. monocytogenes only a fraction of the infectious inoculum enters the small intestine of laboratory animals in the minutes to hours following the infection  providing at least a partial explanation for the need to use high doses of L. monocytogenes to induce disease in healthy individuals.

Intestinal P glycoprotein also provides a defense against L. monocytogenes infection through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated and mice lacking this protein show higher bacterial dissemination following oral challenge .Host Immune DefensesMultiple immune mechanisms also contribute to reducing L. monocytogenes density in the gastro-intestinal lumen.

The early studies with GF animals correctly hypothesized that the microbiota plays a major direct role in providing colonization resistance against L. monocytogenes.Initial attempts to protect GF mice by transferring commensal Clostridium and a Bacteroides species prior to L. monocytogenes infection were only partially successful and demonstrated that thepathogen still expanded to high densities in the lumen but that the number of bacteria near the intestinal mucus layer was reduced in the presence of these commensals .

We recently identified bacterial taxa that provide colonization resistance against L. monocytogenes and assembled a consortium of four Clostridiales species that efficiently protect ex-GF mice upon reconstitution from orally administered L. monocytogenes.

This suggests that diet could also affect the capacity of specific commensals to promote colonization resistance against L. monocytogenes.Mechanisms of bacterial suppression of L. monocytogenes that do not rely on the release of soluble mediators might include nutrient competition and contact-dependent mechanisms.

Thus it appears that L. monocytogenes is endowed with a range of defenses to combat commensals and promote its own survival in the intestine.ConclusionsLuminal expansion of L. monocytogenes in the gut increases the risk of systemic dissemination and the development of severe disease and classic and more recent experimental studies using animal models are revealing that host defense is multifaceted involving the epithelial barrier innate and adaptive immune defenses and perhaps least appreciated but extremely important the commensal microbial populations that inhabit the mammalian GI tract.

Despite the high prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the environment and frequent contamination of uncooked meat and poultry products infections with this pathogen are relatively uncommon suggesting that protective defenses in the general population are effective.
