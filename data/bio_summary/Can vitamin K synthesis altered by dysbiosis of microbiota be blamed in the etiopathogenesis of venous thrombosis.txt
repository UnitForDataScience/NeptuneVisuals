36 3 73-74 2017Can vitamin K synthesis altered by dysbiosis of microbiota be blamed in the etiopathogenesis of venous thrombosisSuna AYDIN11Department of Cardiovascular Surgery Education and Research Hospital Health Science University Elazig Campus 23100 Elazig TurkeyReceived March 7 2017 Accepted April 6 2017 Published online in J-STAGE April 21 2017Venous thrombosis deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is seen in one out of 1000 individuals in the general adult population However as age advances this rate goes up to one in 100 individuals and the mortality rate stands at 30 If the etiopathogenesis of thrombosis can be clarified the rate of morbidity and mortality can be reduced.

Given that the role of the microbiota in the development of venous thrombosis has not been studied yet it can be anticipated that by analyzing the amount of vitamin K originating from the microbiota mortality associated with venous thrombosis can be reduced.REfEREncEsCushman M. 2007.

Currently the etiopathogenesis of thrombosis is explained by Virchow's triad which includes i changes in blood flow deceleration of blood flow leads to the impairment of laminar blood flow being overweight being bedbound having congestive heart failure and age-related alterations ii changes in vessel walls conditions arising from traumas and inflammatory and degenerative diseases and iii coagulation abnormalities congenital hypercoagulation protein C S and antithrombin III deficiency and acquired hyper- coagulation oral contraceptive pregnancy nephrotic syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus inflammatory intestinal disease malignancies and their treatment 2 3.

Although changes in blood flow and vessel walls play major roles in the etiopathogenesis of thrombosis coagulation abnormalities appear to figure more prominently in the underlying mechanism of the disease Of the natural anticoagulants synthesized in the liver proteins C and S have to go through a carboxylation process involving vitamin K Therefore vitamin K a fat-soluble essential vitamin plays a key role in maintaining normal coagulation.

If the number of vitamin K-synthesizing bacteria in the microbiota increases for any reason or decreases to reduce vitamin K synthesis as a compensatory mechanism vitamin K levels will be elevated even if dietary vitamin K intake is restricted and venous thrombosis will occur.

One reason why we cannot elevate the international normalized ratio despite Coumadin administration in certain cases may be that the excessive vitamin K synthesized by the microbiota can be absorbed more than usual along the intestinal lymph vessels together with lipids and thus affect the coagulation cascade Consequently an overall evaluation of the information above indicates that when the doses of anticoagulation medications are to be decided the possible role of the members of the microbiota in the development of venous thrombosis and whether there is an increase in the amount of vitamin K-synthesizing bacteria should be analyzed In this74S.

Aydinway even after the prevention of venous thrombosis healthy microbiota transplantation can be performed if necessary to impede vitamin K of microbial origin.
