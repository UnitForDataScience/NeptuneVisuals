Growing evi- dence supports the possibility that both scenarios exist and that different FGID phenotypes could exist with some patients presenting first with mood disorders without gut symptoms and then later developing gut symptoms brain driving gut whereas others first pres- ent with FGIDs and then emerge with psychological dis- turbance gut driving brain.

The bidirectional trafficking of these signals opens the pos- sibility of some gut diseases being driven by aberrant brain function and conversely disordered gut homeo- stasis being responsible for driving brain pathology and particularly mood disorders in other patients.

The study concluded that the gut was probably the driver of psychological morbidity in patients in whom gastrointestinal symptoms predated mood dis- order and the brain was probably the driver of FGIDs in patients in whom anxiety or depression symptoms manifested before gastrointestinal symptoms.

The immune system integrates and modulates bidirectional signals between the brain and the nervous system and the gut and consequently mechanistically links alterations in function in both brain and gut.

Although recogni- tion of the directionality of this association might imply the existence of distinct mechanisms of disease it is also possible that these different modes of presentation that is brain driving gut or gut driving brain might instead represent polar ends of the same disease process.

Importantly at least in the case of post-infectious FD gut symptoms were markedly more likely to develop in patients with pre-existing anxiety or depression60 consistent with the possibility that mood disorders predispose to the development of chronic gut symptoms.

Production of mast cell products including tryptase histamine and prostaglandins is increased in gut tissue from patients with IBS111117 and jejunal fluid harvested from patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS have increased levels of tryptase112.

With the emer- gence of precision medicine strategies in which patients with FGID or IBD might be stratified beyond standard gut symptom complexes might offer the opportunity to tailor therapies to individual patients.

Clinical trials stratified by these parameters are eagerly awaited by the scientific and clinical communities.ConclusionsIn conclusion lines of communication between the brain and gut play a key part in the biology clinical manifes- tations and clinical outcomes of gut diseases but most notably in FGIDs.
