MRS deMan Rogosa Sharpe.Moreover L. reuteri 6475 administration significantly increased histamine quantities in mouse feces in contrast to the lack of increased amounts of histamine after adminis- tration of L. reuteri defective in HDC function hdcA mutant E. These studies indicate that i L. reuteri administration increased its relative abundance in the guts of Hdc-- mice and the presence of L. reuteri in the intestine was not affected by the presence or absence of an intact HCD gene in L. reuteri ii L. reuteri can express the HCD and histidinehistamine antiporter genes in the mammalian intestines of Hdc-- mice iii hdc-positive L. reuteri is able to generate histamine in the gut providing a mechanistic underpinning for histamine-mediated immunomodulation by the mammalian gut microbes.HDC Gene Is Necessary for L. reuteri 6475 to Attenuate Colonic Carcinogenesis in VivoTo probe the ability of histamine-generating L. reuteri 6475 to suppress CRC associated with chronic intestinal inflam- mation the combination of AOM and DSS was used to induce colitis-associated colon cancer in 12-week-old male Hdc-- BALBc mice A.

When Hdc-- mice receive hdcth Lactobacillus reuteri histamine is produced in the intestinal lumen via histidine decarboxylase Hdc protein machinery in L. reuteri L-histidine is converted to histamine by HdcA and histamine is exported to the gut lumen by histidine-histamine antiporter HdcP.L.

From the studies by Yang et althat showed an increased susceptibility of Hdc-- mice to inflammation-associated colonic cancer induced by AOMDSS challenge we addressed the ability of histamine-producing gut microbes such as L. reuteri to complement the histamine deficiency in Hdc-- mice by interkingdom complementation.

The lack of functional mammalian histidine decarbox-ylase HDC the enzyme converting L-histidine to histamine yielded increased susceptibility to inflammation- associated CRC in adult mice.Here we set out to address the ability of hdcth L. reuteri to reduce the frequency and severity of inflammation-associated colon cancer in Hdc-- mice and to investigate whether microbe-generated metabolites may suppress inflammation-associated cancer phenotypes exacerbated by mammalian enzyme deficiencies.Materials and MethodsAssociation between HDC and H2R Gene Expression and Overall Survival Rates in Colon Cancer PatientsTo investigate whether HDC and histamine H2 receptor H2R symbol HRH2 expression is associated with changes in survival rates of colon cancer patients the PROGgeneV2 database was queried by selecting gene name HDC or HRH2 cancer type colorectal and survival measure death.

Elevated patterns of H2R gene HRH2 expression was correlated with enhanced survival among patients with CRC GSE17537 P Z 0.02 B indicating a potential antitumorigenic effect by H2R up-regulation.These findings based on human cancer gene expression profiling set the stage to explore whether microbial Hdc expression and histamine generation could complement histamine deficiency in Hdc-- mice and provide mecha- nistic insights in murine models of CRC.L.

For example H2R-mediated signaling may offer protection against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and histamine type 1 receptoremediated signaling may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome.The opposing proinflammatory hista- mine type 1 receptor and anti-inflammatory H2R effects of histamine receptors may depend on differences in relative tissue distributions of histamine receptors.

The accumulated data were analyzed with FlowJo software version 10 FlowJo Ashland OR gated using forward scatter and side scatter followed by allophycocyanin-cyanine 7 Gr-1th on the y axis and fluorescein isothiocyanate CD11bth on the x axis.PET Imaging of Living MicePositron emission tomography PETcomputed tomography CT scanning was performed 15 weeks after AOM injec- tion just before euthanizing the mice as described previ- ously.Briefly mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and received 200 mCi of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose FDG by i.p.

reuteri 6475 Administration Increases hdc Gene Expression and Histamine Production in the Intestines of Hdc-- MiceTo explore whether oral administration of L. reuteri increased the relative abundance of this bacterial species in the intestines of Hdc-deficient mice fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed in the colons of Hdc-- mice 2 days after L. reuteri administration.
