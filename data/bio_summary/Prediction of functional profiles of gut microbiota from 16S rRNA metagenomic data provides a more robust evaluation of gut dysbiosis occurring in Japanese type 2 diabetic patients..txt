In addition results revealed that the composition ratio of the genus Blautia decreased in diabetic patients compared with that in con- trol subjects and furthermore negatively correlated with HbA1c.It is now the world consensus that gut microbiota play an impor-tant role in obesity6 and obesity-associated disease such as type 2diabetes.7 However it has been difficult to clarify in detail how the gut microbiota in particular their functional profiles relate to pathophysiological conditions due to the gut microbial diversity depends on individual andor ethnic background differences.4 Recently a few whole-genome-based shotgun metagenomics studies have suggested that functional profiles of the gut micro- biota may be associated with inflammatory diseases and auto- immune diseases.8 However using a readily available and affordable computational tool such as PICRUSt no evidence of type 2 diabetes-associated gut microbial functional profiles has been found to date.

Accumulating evidence has implicated dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the development of type 2 diabetes.1 However the functional profiles of the gut microbiota including activatedinactivated biological pathways in diabeticpatients are yet to be fully elucidated.Currently there are two major approaches to evaluate the func- tions of gut microbiota by metagenomics 1 whole-genome shotgun metagenomics and 2 computational prediction using data of 16S rRNA metagenomics2 the former being more accurate but expensive than the latter as it requires many more sequence reads.34 The latter is a recently developed approach that cangenomic sequencing across many samples and laboratory work.3 To gain insight into the pathophysiological roles of gut microbial functions in type 2 diabetes we examined the relation- ship between gut bacterial compositions predictive functional profiles of gut microbial communities and anthropometric metabolic parameters in Japanese subjects with or without type 2diabetes.Materials and MethodsSubjects.

Further studies are needed to clarify the involvement of these pathways in type 2 diabetes.Of note we preliminary detected in nine subjects three control and six diabetic that gut bacterial composition and functional profiles were consistent within individuals R  0.90 - 0.06 and R  0.99 - 0.01 respectively throughout one month suggesting the stabilityreproducibility of this approach.

The relative abundance of functional pathways in gut microbiota between control subjects and type 2 diabetic patients.

The abundance of the genus Blautia showed significant negative correlations with HbA1c but not with FPG levels R  -0.63.DiscussionUsing computational prediction from 16S rRNA metagenomic data this study represents the first demonstration that gut microbiota-associated functional profiles in type 2 diabetic patients are remarkably different from those of control subjects.

Further longitudinal studies in larger cohorts with vs without dietary intervention would provide insights into a causal association between gut microbiota-functional profiles and type 2 diabetes.In conclusion this study provides notable evidence that not only composition but also the functional profiles of microbiota differed between Japanese control subjects and diabetic patients whichwas further associated with glucose metabolism.

Our findings suggest a novel pathophysiological relationship between gut microbial communities and diabetes further highlighting the significance and utility of combining prediction of functional profiles with ordinal bacterial taxonomic analysis UMIN Clinical Trails Registry number UMIN000026592.Key Words diabetes dysbiosis genus Blautia glucose metabolism prediction of functional profileshe prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased worldwide including in Japan.

These findings highlight the significance of identifying and characterizing the gut microbial functional pathways possibly implicated in type 2 diabetic patients including the Insulin signaling pathway and GlycolysisGluconeogenesis pathways found in this study.

Fecal samples were obtained from 12 control and 10 type 2 diabetic subjects.
