In this work we aimed to characterize the gut bacterial community of pine processionary larvae associ- ated with three different host pine species Pinus halepensis Miller P. nigra subsp.

laricio and Pinus pinasterof the target species and the characterization of its associated microorganisms needs to be accomplished  including both life stage and host-associated microbiota.In this study we found that the population of gut symbionts of T. pityocampa larvae associated with P. halapensis was different from the symbionts associated with larvae that fed on P. nigra subsp.

1 Double principal coordinate analysis DPCoA performed on the whole microbial community associated to larvae of Thaumetopoea pityocampa feeding on different host plant species Pinus halepensis Pinus nigra subsp.

Host plant species were selected on the basis of the different susceptibility to the processionary moth  the Aleppo pine P. halepensis the Maritime pine P. pinaster and the Laricio pine P. nigra subsp.

Dead insects were then sterilized su-perficially with a solution of sodium hypochlorite 21.6 gL for 5 min washed once in ethanol 70 vv for 2 min and finally three times in sterile distilled water for 10 s. Dead larvae were then placed in phosphate buffer solution to excise the complete gut with sterile forceps.

On the other hand as the gut of lepidopteran larvae has a relatively simple morphol- ogy  lacking specific structures for harboring microbial symbionts it is not surprising that the gut microbiota can be affected by diet  as we experienced in our study.
