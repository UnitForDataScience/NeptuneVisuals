Radioactivity was visualized by the BAS FLA-3000 system GE Healthcare Tokyo Japan.Phylogenetic characterizationPhylogenetic group of E. coli strains was determined by using a multiplex PCR as reported previously .Detection of virulence genes for diarrheagenic E. coliA total of 103 E. coli strains were analyzed for the presence of virulence genes associated with diarrheagenic E. coli DEC including eae E. coli-attaching and effacing bfpA bundle-forming pilus EAF enteropathogenic E. coli adherence factor elt heat-labile enterotoxin est heat-stable enterotoxin eagg plasmid of enteroaggregative E. coli astA enteroaggregative E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin 1 stx1 Shiga toxin 1 stx2 Shiga toxin 2 invE and daaD by colony hybridization assay using respectiveprobe labeled with a-32P-dCTP Perkin Elmer as described previously .RESULTSAntimicrobial susceptibilityA total of 103 E. coli strains including 73 from urban districts and 30 from suburban district were successfully isolated from 103 healthy adults in Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam and further analyzed for their antimicrobial susceptibility to 13 different drugs including AMP CTX CAZ IPM NAL CIP GEN KAN STR FOS TET SXT and CHL.

There was no significant difference in rate of MDR of E. coli strains isolated from healthy adults in urban 5473 74.0 and suburban districts 2030 66.7.ESBL characterization and its genotypeSince 51 5 and 11 E. coli strains were resistant to AMP alone AMP and CTX AMP CTX and CAZ respectively these strains might produce ESBL.

Moreover among the 5 strains harboring both blaCTX-M and blaTEM genes 3 strains carried these genes on the same plasmid data not shown.Phylogenetic characterizationWe further examined the 103 E. coli strains for phylogenetic group.

Furthermore 13 of the MDR E. coli strains belonged to phylogenetic group B2 suggesting that these strains might have a potential virulence capacity and could pose a risk to public health.Furthermore virulence gene profile analysis indicated that indeed 18 E. coli strains carried one or two virulence genes associated with DEC Table 2.

One E. coli strain was collected from each sample and used for further analysis.Determination of antimicrobial susceptibilityAntimicrobial susceptibility of the E. coli strains against ampicillin AMP cefotaxime CTX ceftazidime CAZ imipenem IPM nalidixic acid NAL ciprofloxacin CIP gentamicin GEN kanamycin KAN streptomycin STR fosfomycin FOS tetracycline TET trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole SXT and chloramphenicol CHL was examined by disk diffusionmethod  on Mueller-Hinton agar Becton Dickinson and Co. Sparks NV U.S.A. using commercially available disks Becton Dickinson and Co.. Charaterization of E. coli strains as susceptible intermediate resistant or resistant was based on the size of the inhibition zones according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute CLSI guidelines .

As shown in Table 1 most of the E. coli strains were resistant to STR 80.6 TET 67.0 AMP 65.0 SXT 48.5 and NAL 43.7 although all E. coli strains were susceptible to IPM.

Moreover five CTX-M-positive E. coli strains additionally possessed blaTEM genes but none of the strains were positive for the blaSHV genes.

Of 103 E. coli strains none of the strains were positive for bfpA est stx1 stx2 invE and daaD genes.

However astA was most prevalent and detected in 15 strains followed by EAF n5 elt n3 eagg n2 and eae n1 indicating that some of the E. coli strains isolated fromhealthy adults are potentially virulent to human.

However1 of the E. coli strains isolated in FilaBavi were resistant to CIP  although 15.5 strains were resistant to CIP in this study.
