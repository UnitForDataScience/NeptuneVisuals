Herstad1 Karina Gajardo2 Anne Marie Bakke2 Lars Moe1 Jane Ludvigsen3 Knut Rudi3 Ida Rud4 Monika Sekelja35 and Ellen Skancke1BackgroundThe canine faecal microbiota consists of a complex eco- system of bacteria virus fungi and protozoa of which bacteria dominate and are the most characterized organ- isms -.

In contrast fermentation of proteins and amino acids by proteolytic bacteria in the colon results in increased faecal pH and in the formation of faecal metabolites such as ammonia sul- phides phenols indols and branched chain fatty acids BCFA including isovaleric acid.

Thus the effect of a change in one macronutrient on the faecal microbiota is therefore a result of the combinatory effect of all the macronutrients Knowledge of the canine faecal microbiome has lagged behind that of humans but has recently improved with the implementation of state-of-the-art high throughput sequencing methods HTS.

However that particular study focused on the effects of adding prebiotics and not the meat per se.Dogs appear to have coevolved with humans and have developed characteristics enabling them to efficiently digest a more carbohydrate-rich diet compared to their wild pre- decessor Yet fresh meat-based diets are common due to some dog-owners' and veterinarians' belief that these diets are beneficial for dog health In humans high consumption of red meat and reduced content of non- digestible carbohydrates in the diet have been associated with an elevated risk of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer as reviewed by  It has been hy- pothesized that these associations are mediated through changes in colonic bacterial populations Given that humans and dogs live in close contact and may have many microbes in common  knowledge of the faecal microbiota in dogs including potential zoonotic and patho- genic bacteria may be of importance for both species To minimize variability among study subjects diet- induced effects on the faecal microbiota have mostcommonly been investigated in laboratory dogs most often beagle dogs in controlled environments  Although these studies are highly valuable the results are not necessarily applicable to a heterogeneous population consisting of client-owned dogs from various home locations.To this end more studies are needed regarding the consequences of feeding meat-based diets including red meat on the ecology of intestinal microbiota in non- laboratory dogs using more sensitive state-of-the-art methods.

Diarrhoea was indi- cated with a faecal score from 4.5 to 5 according to the Waltham faeces scoring system  The investigator also recorded faecal consistency score in all the collected samples.

Results from the following parameters Shannon diversity index observed species faecal water faecal consistency score and short chain fatty acids were presented as medians and minimum and maximum ranges for each of the diet periods.

However all faecal samples analysed see below were of normal consistency faecal score ranging from 2.5 to 3.5.
