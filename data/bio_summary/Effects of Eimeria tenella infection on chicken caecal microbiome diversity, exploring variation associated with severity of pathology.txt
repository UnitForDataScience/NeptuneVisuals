At genus level Clostridium increased following infection in the all LS group LS 0 and LS 4 conversely the genus Ruminococcus decreased only in LS 4 samples simi- lar changes were induced by mixed Eimeria infection in a previous study .While it is unsurprising that changes in abundance of bacteria occur following E. tenella infection of particular interest was the examination of differential taxa according to caecal lesion score.

This work highlights that E. tenella infection has a significant impact on the abundance of some caecal bacteria with notable differences detected between lesion score categories emphasising the impor- tance of accounting for differences in caecal lesions when investigating the relationship between E. tenella and the poultry intestinal microbiome.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.IntroductionOver the last 20 years global poultry production has tripled with approximately 90 million tonnes of chicken meat and 1.1 trillion eggs now produced every year   .

It is now hypothesised that a combination of factors are involved and results from this study suggest either a func- tional role for the enteric microbiome or microbial variation as a consequence of infection.The importance of the enteric microbiome to fermentation and effective use of dietary resources underlines the significance of these changes .ConclusionThe current study has demonstrated that E. tenella infection of Cobb500 broilers elicited sig- nificant changes in the abundance of a number of microbial taxa in the caecal microbiome that were correlated with the most severe caecal pathology.

Additionally differences in species strain and level of Eimeria parasite infection may explain between study variations in alpha diversity .Eimeria infection per se also did not produce a significant impact on caecal microbiome beta-diversity P  0.062 compared to uninfected controls.

These results highlight the importance of considering Eimeria parasite induced pathology when analysing caecal microbial diversity.Numbers of differentially abundant taxa identified following infection were similar to pre- vious reports investigating the influence of Eimeria on the caecal microbiome  .Assessment of differential abundance was correlated to OTUspecies level where possible as it is known that analysis at higher taxonomic levels can lead to inaccuracies however where nec- essary abundance at higher taxonomic levels is discussed .

2017 Effects of Eimeria tenella infection on chicken caecal microbiome diversity exploring variation associated with severity of pathology.

This study evaluated the composition and structure of the caecal microbiome in the presence or absence of a defined Eimeria tenella challenge infection in Cobb500 broiler chickens using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.

Following E. tenella infection the diversity of taxa within the caecal microbiome remained largely stable.
