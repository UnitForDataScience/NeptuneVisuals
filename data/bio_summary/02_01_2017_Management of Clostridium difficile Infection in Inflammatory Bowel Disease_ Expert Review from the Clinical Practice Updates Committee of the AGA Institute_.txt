published with permission from elsevier.b c difficileincidence and severity of cdi has increased in the general population even greater increases have been described in patients with ibd.-in 2004 7 of cdi cases diagnosed at one institution occurred in patients with underlying ibd in 2005 this proportion had increased to 16 a.during the same time period the overall rates of cdi in hospitalized ibd patients increased from 1.8 to 4.6. almost all patients with cdi had a prior history of ibd with colitis 91.similar trends have been seen in other studies b.the increasing incidence of cdi mainly afflicts patient with ulcerative colitis increasing from 2.4 of admissions in 1998 to 3.9 in 2004 rates were lower in patients with crohn's disease 0.8 increasing to 1.2.in another study the overall rates of cdi were higher in patients with ulcerative colitis than crohn's disease and nearly 8 times greater overall in ibd than in non-ibd patients .these differences may reflect the lower incidence of colitis in crohn's disease and hence less widespread colonic dysbiosis.it is important to note that cdi arising in patients with ibd may have several atypical features .

however the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with c difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations.best practice advice 6 clinicians should offer a referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent c difficile infection.lostridium difficile is an anaerobic spore-forming gram-positivebacillus.

however it appears that the response rates and recurrence rates to these regimens are probably less favorable compared with non-cdi patients.another treatment option forrecurrent cdi includes gut microbial restoration such as fmt which has been shown to be effective in non-ibd patients with more than 80 efficacy and also in immunosuppressed patients including those with ibd on systemic immunosuppression.one study suggested that ibd patients with cdi can undergo fmt with no safety concerns response rates were lower than in non-ibd patients and were not dependent on immunosuppressive therapy.

learning objective-upon completion of this activity successful learners will be able to identify and manage clostridium difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.the purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of clostridium difficile infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.

shortly thereafter an increased risk for colonization with toxin-producing c difficile was noted in individuals with ibd leading to an active debate as to whether c difficile toxins may be afigure 1. a increasing proportion of ibd patients with c diffi- cile c diff infection compared with the total number of c diffi- cile-infected patients at a single referral hospital from 2000 tocause for ibd or ibd flares.in more recent years as the2005.

pathogenicstrains produce 2 large protein exotoxins toxin a and toxin b.in 1978 c difficile and its toxins were first identified as causing antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis.the incidence and severity of colonic disease caused by c difficile have increased greatly in recent years.a study of c difficile infection cdi in the united states in 2011 found that there were 453000 incident cases and 83000 first recurrences.of greatest concern is the estimated number of cdi-associated deaths at 29000 per annum a death rate that exceeds the total number of deaths attributed to both multidrug-resistant gram- negative bacteria and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus combined.the ascent of c difficile to become the most lethal acute enteric pathogen in the united states led the centers for disease control to designate it as an urgent antibiotic resistance threat in 2015 1 of only 3 pathogens to earn this attribute  .

patients with both cdi and ibd remain in the hospital for 3 days longer 95 confidence interval 2.3-3.7 d than those ibd patients who are not infected.concomitant cdi and ibd patients are less likely to respond to medical therapy for their cdi.

upon discussion of risks and benefits given the high safety and efficacy for fmt in cdi the high complication rates for cdi in ibd patients and the lack of data for routine antibiotic regimens for recurrent cdi in ibd patients fmt may be considered earlier in the course of cdi in ibd such as after the first recurrence by referring these patients to a center per- forming fmt for cdi .

how- ever upon escalation of immunosuppression these patients should be monitored closely for worsening symptoms and impending complications .summary and conclusionsc difficile is a common complication in patients with ibd .

interestingly asymptomatic carriage of toxin-producing strains of c difficile appears to be as common as cdi and has been linked to protective adaptive immunity against c difficile toxins.although a majority of cases of cdi are health care-associated approximately one-third are community acquired and a substantial number of these cases appear not to be antibiotic-associated.in ibd colonic dysbiosis and loss of resistance to bac- terial colonization frequently arises from the underlying colitis allowing cdi to develop in the absence of any recent antimicrobial therapy.-this predisposing dysbiosis is characterized by a reduced diversity of the colonic microbiota together with alterations in the population distributions which leads to a loss of colonization resis- tance against c difficile.-a majority of cdi cases overall are hospital-acquired or hospital-associated.however cdi in ibd often is community-acquired resulting from contact with c difficile spores that are ubiquitous in thegeneral environment.ingested spores germinate under the influence of body temperature availability of key nu- trients and the presence of primary bile salts.
