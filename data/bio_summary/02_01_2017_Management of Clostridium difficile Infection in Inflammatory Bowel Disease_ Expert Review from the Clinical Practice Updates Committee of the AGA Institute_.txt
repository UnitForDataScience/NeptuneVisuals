Almost all patients with CDI had a prior history of IBD with colitis 91.Similar trends have been seen in other studies B.The increasing incidence of CDI mainly afflicts patient with ulcerative colitis increasing from 2.4 of admissions in 1998 to 3.9 in 2004 rates were lower in patients with Crohn's disease 0.8 increasing to 1.2.In another study the overall rates of CDI were higher in patients with ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease and nearly 8 times greater overall in IBD than in non-IBD patients .These differences may reflect the lower incidence of colitis in Crohn's disease and hence less widespread colonic dysbiosis.It is important to note that CDI arising in patients with IBD may have several atypical features .

However it appears that the response rates and recurrence rates to these regimens are probably less favorable compared with non-CDI patients.Another treatment option forrecurrent CDI includes gut microbial restoration such as FMT which has been shown to be effective in non-IBD patients with more than 80 efficacy and also in immunosuppressed patients including those with IBD on systemic immunosuppression.One study suggested that IBD patients with CDI can undergo FMT with no safety concerns response rates were lower than in non-IBD patients and were not dependent on immunosuppressive therapy.

Best Practice AdviceDescriptionThe purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of Clostridium difficile Infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.MethodsThe evidence reviewed in this manuscript is a summation of relevant scientific publications expert opinion statements and current practice guidelines.Best Practice Advice 1Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease forC difficile infection.Best Practice Advice 2Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection.Best Practice Advice 3Clinicians should consider treating C difficile Infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole.Best Practice Advice 4Clinicians should strongly consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea severe abdominal pain a markedly elevated peripheral blood leukocyte count or other evidence of sepsis.Best Practice Advice 5Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated.

This review is a summary of expert opinion in the field without a formal systematic review of evidence.Best Practice Advice 1 Clinicians should test patients who present with a flare of underlying inflammatory bowel disease for Clostridium difficile infection.Best Practice Advice 2 Clinicians should screen for recurrent C difficile infection if diarrhea or other symptoms of colitis persist or return after antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection.Best Practice Advice 3 Clinicians should consider treating C difficile infection in inflammatory bowel disease patients with vancomycin instead of metronidazole.Best Practice Advice 4 Clinicians strongly should consider hospitalization for close monitoring and aggressive management for inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection who have profuse diarrhea severe abdominal pain a markedly increased peripheral blood leukocyte count or other evidence of sepsis.Best Practice Advice 5 Clinicians may postpone escalation of steroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C difficile infection until therapy for C difficile infection has been initiated.

Published with permission from Elsevier.B C difficileincidence and severity of CDI has increased in the general population even greater increases have been described in patients with IBD.-In 2004 7 of CDI cases diagnosed at one institution occurred in patients with underlying IBD in 2005 this proportion had increased to 16 A.During the same time period the overall rates of CDI in hospitalized IBD patients increased from 1.8 to 4.6.

Adverse Outcomes of C difficile Infection Complicating Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseSubsequent IBD flaresMore likely to fail medical therapyMore frequent need to escalate IBD therapy Higher surgery ratesHigher mortality rate than for IBD alone More frequent CDI recurrences Increased emergency room visits Longer hospital stayIncreased health care costsData from Rodemann et alIssa et alAnanthakrishnan et alDubberke et alJodorkovsky et alKhanna and Pardiand Jen et al.are required more frequently in patients with CDI complicating IBD.Of greatest concern is that mor- tality rates are 4 times higher than in patients with IBD alone.Not surprisingly given the series of negative outcomes outlined earlier health care costs are higher in patients with CDI and IBD compared with IBD alone.Several risk factors have been identified for recurrence of CDI after an initial response to therapy.

Upon discussion of risks and benefits given the high safety and efficacy for FMT in CDI the high complication rates for CDI in IBD patients and the lack of data for routine antibiotic regimens for recurrent CDI in IBD patients FMT may be considered earlier in the course of CDI in IBD such as after the first recurrence by referring these patients to a center per- forming FMT for CDI .

Learning Objective-Upon completion of this activity successful learners will be able to identify and manage Clostridium difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.The purpose of this expert review is to synthesize the existing evidence on the management of Clostridium difficile infection in patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease.

However the decision to withhold or continue immunosuppression in inflammatory bowel disease patients with C difficile infection should be individualized because there is insufficient existing robust literature on which to develop firm recommendations.Best Practice Advice 6 Clinicians should offer a referral for fecal microbiota transplantation to inflammatory bowel disease patients with recurrent C difficile infection.lostridium difficile is an anaerobic spore-forming gram-positivebacillus.

A Increasing proportion of IBD patients with C diffi- cile C diff infection compared with the total number of C diffi- cile-infected patients at a single referral hospital from 2000 tocause for IBD or IBD flares.In more recent years as the2005.
