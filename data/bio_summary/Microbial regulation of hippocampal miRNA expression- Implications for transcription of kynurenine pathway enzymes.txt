In male mice Kat1 was significantly decreased in germ free mice B p  0.05 compared with conventional mice this decrease was not reversed by colonisation.

In contrast the gene which encodes Tdao2 was significantly increased in germ free male mice and in recolonized mice compared with conventional male mice C p  0.05 D p  0.05.These results demonstrate to our knowledge that the gut micro- biota can regulate the expression of miRNAs in the hippocampus spe- cifically miR-294-5p.

Based on the results of the two-way ANOVA and using specific primers for 3 miRNAs mmu-miR-342-3p mmu-miR-294-5p and mmu-miR-16- 5p  we found a significant increase in expression of miR-294- 5p only in the hippocampus of male mice compared to conventionally raised male mice C p  0.05.

Little is known about the function of miR-294 but it is part of a cluster of miRNAs that are expressed in embryonic stem cells and plays an important role in embryogenesis.We found a significant increase in the expression of miR-294-5p only in the hippocampus of male mice compared to conventionally raised mice but this did not result in alterations in Brd2.

N  8-11 mice per group   p  0.05 Two-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD  t-test versus Control mice p  0.05.

Tdao2 was increased in GF and exGF male mice compared to conventional mice.

Tdao2 which was increased in germ free mice irrespective of sex has previously been shown to be increased in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer's diseasewhile Kat1 which is altered in a number of neurological disorderswas decreased in germ free mice.

We measured miRNAs in the hippocampus of Germ free GF conventional C and Germ free colonised exGF Swiss Webster mice.

Behaviours associated with the hippocampus such as anxiety depression and cognitive func- tion are also abnormal in germ free mice.

Statistical analysis was carried out as previously described .Sex and germ free status interact to alter the expression of miRNA'sMicroarray analysis was performed on hippocampi removed from both male and female conventional CON germ free GF and mice that had previously been germ free but were colonised exGF post- weaning day 21 A. Microarray analysis revealed that micro- bial colonisation status and sex affected the expression of hippocampal miRNAs B.
