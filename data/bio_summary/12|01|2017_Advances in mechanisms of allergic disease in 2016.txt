Mechanisms of allergyimmunologyMarc E. Rothenberg MD PhDa Hirohisa Saito MD PhDb and R. Stokes Peebles Jr MDcCincinnati Ohio Tokyo Japan and Nashville TennThis review highlights advances in mechanisms of allergic disease particularly type 2 innate lymphoid cells TH2 lymphocytes eicosanoid regulation of inflammation extracellular vesicles in allergic responses IL-33 microbiome properties especially as they relate to mucosal barrier function and a series of findings concerning the allergic inflammatory cells eosinophils basophils and mast cells.

In contrast PLZF22 mice had no defect in the ability to generate allergic inflammation to ovalbumin sensitization and challenge which is mediated by CD41 T cells and the adaptive immune response.In another study Lombardi et alfound that the frequency of ILC2s and ILC3s in PBMCs was the same between allergic subjects allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and nonallergic subjects.

Recent publications about the molecular and functional charac- teristics of platelet-derived EVs suggest that they have a key role in various processes especially during inflammation instead of being inert byproducts of cellular activation.Regarding allergic inflammation platelets express functional IL-33 protein and papain-induced eosinophilic airway inflammation was attenuated by platelet depletion alone or followed by transplantation of platelets genetically lacking IL-33.

Biomechanical stress can also translocate IL-33 to membrane-bound secretory vesicles and triggers the passive and time-dependent release of IL-33 from living cells.IL-33 A VERSATILE CYTOKINEIL-33 is now recognized to play a crucial role in inflammatory allergic diseases by triggering ILC2s to produce type 2 cytokinesand by suppressing innate antiviral immunity.

In particular patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma had more ILC2s and ILC3s in the blood than did patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis without asthma.

For example in a population- and na- tional registry-based cohort study including all children born in Denmark the effect of elective cesarean section was higher than the effect of emergency cesarean section on the risk of asthma and the effect of cesarean section was associated with early colo- nization patterns of the neonatal gut but not of the airways in com- parison with the effect of natural delivery.Regarding the effect of food supplementation on asthma development fish-derived n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy reduced the risk of persistent wheeze asthma and infections of the lower respiratory tract in offspring but not the risk of allergic sensitization.Future studies regarding mechanisms involved in the effect of the microbiome on asthma onset will require a clearer definition of the asthma endotype.Unlike other allergic diseases the prevalence of food allergies is rapidly increasing in the 21st century.

Regarding the effect of the microbiome on development of allergic diseases it was shown that the intestinal microbiota of infants allergic to cow's milk is more diverse than that of healthy age-matched control subjectsand that marked reductions in skin microbial diversity occur during the exacerbation stage of atopic dermatitis.Extensive studies are needed about the mechanisms involved in these responses as well as therapeutic approaches based on restoring barrier function.EOSINOPHILIAEosinophils were an intense focus over the past year  undoubtedly related to entrance of the first class of anti-eosinophil therapeutics eg the anti-IL-5 based antibodies reslizumab and mepolizumab into routine clinical use for eosin- ophilic asthma.

Basophils were implicated in allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in patients with mild allergic asthma on the basis of basophil expression of activation markers in the circulation.In an interesting study both baso- phils and mast cells were shown to contribute to allergic responses through a circadian clock demonstrating a marked daynightFIG 3.

They re- ported that the regulatory function downstream of the LPS recep- tor Toll-like receptor 4 in mast cells signals through activation of canonical nuclear factor kB phosphatidylinositol-45- bisphosphate 3-kinaseAKT and p38 signaling pathways.In another report IL-6 levels were shown to increase human mast cell proliferation and generate an activated phenotype enabled by suppressing proteolytic cleavage of soluble IL-6 receptor from IL-6 receptor and downregulation of a suppressor of cyto- kine signaling 3 autoinhibitory pathway.A recent review article focused on the recently identified Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 MRGPRX2 formerly known as MRGX2 which was shown to be expressed by mast cells and involved in non-IgE-mediated allergic responses to peptidergic drugs.In this review the possible roles of MRGPRX2 in a variety of responses including pain itch urticaria asthma and drug reactions was reviewed and potential ways of inhibiting MRGPRX2 were highlighted.Most studies on mast cell activation have focused on acute activation such as after 1 dose of anti-IgE but allergic responses likely involve repetitive allergen exposure.
