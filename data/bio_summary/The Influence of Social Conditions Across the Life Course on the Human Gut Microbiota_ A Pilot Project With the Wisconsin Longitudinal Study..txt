What we already know regarding the influence of early life conditions socio- economic status and social support on health and mortal- ity--areas of profound importance for those who study the influence of social conditions on health--provides a start- ing place for exploring how social conditions influence the gut microbiome.A key opportunity for the integration of these data into population-based designs is to characterize differences in the gut microbiome across different populations.

The inclusion of data on the gut microbiome into the WLS--and other population based longitudinal stud- ies--can help advance our understanding of how social conditions such as early life conditions educational attain- ment and social relationships influence health and mortal- ity across the life course.

Discussion The addition of data on the gut microbiome to the WLS--and to other population based longitudinal studies of aging--is feasible under the right conditions and can generate innovative research on the relationship between social conditions and the gut microbiome.Keywords Biodemography--Health disparities--Survey methodsThere has been a rapid acceleration of high-quality lon- gitudinal population-based studies integrating biologi- cal data into their data collection  .

In prior WLS refusal conversion efforts conversion rates were between 20 and 35.DiscussionWe believe the integration of data on the gut microbiome into population-based studies can help social and popu- lation health scientists better understand the biological mediators linking social conditions to health and mortality.

It also demonstrate the promise--and necessity--of collaborations between social scien- tists and microbiologists to generate novel insights into the role of the gut microbiome as a mediating biological pathway between social conditions and health and mortal- ity outcomes.AcknowledgmentsP.

Importantly because this is the first effort to include these data in a longitudinal popula- tion-based study focused on social conditions health and aging we provide detailed guidance on the survey methods employed to collect fecal specimens.The Gut MicrobiomeWhat is the gut microbiome The human microbiome is now considered our second genome with potentially par- allel importance to the genome for shaping human health .

Although most existing work has focused on how the gut microbiome affects immune functioning its role in processing nutrients from our diets and how its composition affects metabolic disorders there is broader and growing interest in how it influences other inflammatory processes and even neurological functioning     .What makes the gut microbiome distinct from the human genome--and potentially of significant interest to social scientists and population health researchers--is its plasticity  .

In general biomarker data has rapidly expanded our understanding of how social factors get under the skin to influence health and mortal- ity .We detail the inclusion of a new biological marker-- the gut microbiome--recently added to the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study WLS.

Research on the microbiome which is considered to be of parallel importance to human health as the human genome has been hin- dered by human studies with nonrandomly selected samples and with limited data on social conditions over the life course.

A study comparing healthy children and adults in rural Malawi the Amazonas of Venezuela and urban U.S. resi- dents found substantial differences in the diversity of the gut microbiome between the U.S. sample and the Malawian and Venezuelan samples the U.S. sample had far less vari- ation in the gut microbial communities than did the other two samples .For social scientists and population health researchers its early life origins and ongoing plasticity across the life course hint at the intriguing possibility that the gut micro- biome may be a mediating biological pathway between social conditions and health and mortality.
