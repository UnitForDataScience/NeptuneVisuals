The 2 species are recognized to have health-promoting properties and are added to commercial foods such as infant formula and used in pharmaceutical probiotics to enhance the protective gut micro- biota thus improving intestinal microbial balance.Bifidobac- terium infantis releases bioactive factors and prevents TNF-a- and IFN-g-induced drops in transepithelial resistance to protect intestinal epithelial cell barrier function.1112Bifidobacterium bifidum increases local IgA levels in the intestine and prevents diarrhea and shedding of rotavirus.1314Lactobacillus helveticus inhibits Campylobacter jejuni invasion of intestinal epithelial cells.

Thus the age of 4 to 6 months will be applied for the inclusion of subjects.Inclusion criteriaEach infant will have to meet all of the following criteria to be enrolled in this studyGood healthSingle birthGestational age  37 weeks WHOBirth weight  2500 gAppropriate weight at inclusion visit between P20 and P80 in accordance with the weight percentile charts of Chinese children aged 0 to 18 yearsAged  4 months 120 days and 6 months 180 daysBeing exclusively formula-fed no breast milk meal at the inclusion visitNo gastrointestinal diseases within 1 month CCDCNo use of antibiotics within 1 month CCDCParents' agreement to use one of the recommended infant formulas no probiotics if with prebiotics galacto-oligosac- charides GOS  2 g100 g and no fructo-oligosaccharides FOS insideConsent form signed by at least one of the parents or a legal guardianParents able to understand the protocol requirements and to fill in the infant's diariesExclusion criteriaInfants meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the studyCongenital illness or malformation.Critical prenatal andor postnatal disease.Mothers with metabolic andor chronic disease.An allergic constitution and sensitive to probiotics CCDC.Serious diseases such as those of the cardiovascular cerebrovascular endocrine liver kidney and hematopoietic systems or mental diseases CCDC.Other drugs during the administration of the study products thus making it impossible to judge their efficacy andor influencing the judgment of results CCDC.Current or previous illnesses or conditions or interventions that could interfere with the study affecting tolerance andor growth such as gastrointestinal malformations chronic diarrhea malabsorptive syndrome malnutrition congenital immunodeficiency or major surgery as per the investigator's clinical judgment.Oral antibiotic treatment at V1 visit and within 4 weeks before V1.Any medication or nutritional supplements such as probiotics and prebiotics except for infant formula in the 4 weeks preceding the study start.Having ever consumed the test product.Medical conditions for which a special diet other than standard nonhydrolyzed cow's milk-based infant formula is required such as cow's milk allergy soy protein allergy fish protein allergy egg protein allergy lactose intolerance and galacto- semia.Current participation or having participated in another clinical trial during the previous 4 weeks.Infants' legal representatives without the psychological or linguistic capability to sign the informed consent form.Reasons to presume that the parents are unable to meet the study plan requirements e.g.

This difference is considered to be due to breast milk's composition with molecules with antimicrobial activity and prebiotic oligosaccharides with various health benefits.2627 In fact healthy intestinal microflora are essential to infants' health and the composition of intestinal microflora could be adapted by consuming probiotics in infancy.

Although randomized controlled trials using probiotics in infants have shown promising results in the prevention and treatment of common diseases such as diarrhea and allergy little is known about whether probiotics could offer benefits to healthy infants.

Numerous randomized controlled trials using probiotics in infants have shown promising results in the prevention and treatment of common diseases such as diarrhea and allergy.5-8 Among the possible mechanisms of probiotic intervention is promotion of a nonimmunologic gut defense barrier which includes the normalization of increased intestinal permeability and altered gut microecology.

Another possible mechanism of probiotic intervention is improvement of the intestine's immunologic barrier particularly through local immunoglobulin A IgA responses and alleviation of intestinal inflammatory responses which produce a gut-stabilizing effect.However little is known about whether probiotics could offer benefits to healthy infants.

Its surface-layer protein can exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the activation of NF-kB on intestinal epithelialcells.However the interpretation of clinical trials is difficult to compare due to the differences in endpoints and variations in the probiotics used as well as their doses and strains.

We have designed a randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that an oral preparation of probiotics is superior to placebo in improving digestive and immune function in healthy infants.The trial will be a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 2-parallel-group study in Shanghai China.
