For example low CD4 counts in humans havebeen associated with adenoviral infections.42 Fecal micro- biome analyzed from SIV-infected and -uninfected macaques showed distinct profile in infected animals with advanced disease which was not observed in African green monkeys a species in which SIV is not pathogenic.43 Interestingly a recent study with wild chimpanzees showed no virome dys- biosis irrespective of SIV-positive status except when close to death.44 This might indicate that virome dysbiosis in im- munodeficiency is highly species specific or that the really sick SIV-infected chimpanzees die off in the wild and are therefore missed in sampling.Another level of understanding regarding impact of gut virome on human health comes from children with severe combined immunodeficiency SCID syndrome X1 many of whom undergo successful gene therapy treatment.45-49 Stool analysis of these children has revealed an improvement in microbiota abundance upon successful therapy which was absent in cases where therapy was not successful.49 The gut virome of SCID children was enriched for nonpathogenic Anellovirus and Astrovirus while immunocompromised.

After an- tiretroviral therapy these differences tended to decrease.34 These findings suggest that the oral mucosal immune system plays a role in selecting symbionts or excluding potential pathogens.Microbiome and VaccinesInfancy may be the ideal time for immunization against HIV because infants develop broadly neutralizing antibodiesbetter than adults vaccine administration rates are best for infants and the microbiome is most malleable.35 Dr. Permar of Duke University discussed data supporting an HIV vaccine strategy focused on infancy.A comparison of vaccine responses in two studies using the same vaccine rgp120MF59 one in infants and one in adults found that ENV-specific IgG response was higher and more durable in infants.3637 This may be related to the rapid changes in the microbiome during the first year of life and acquisition of commensals in particular Dialaster and Megasphaera which divert the anti-HIV ENV humoral re- sponse.38 Manipulating the infant microbiome to prevent this antigen diversion may be a useful strategy to improve anti- body responses to HIV ENV proteins.Dr.

In healthy humans the gut virome is abundant with 1011 particles per gram of stool.4041 The gut virome is composed of endogenous retroviruses persistent latent viruses Herpes family viruses Polyoma viruses and Adeno-associated viruses and bacteriophages which infect endogenous bacteria and archaea species.In an immunodeficient state components of the virome such as the latentpersistent viruses can become pathogenic in the absence of immune control and result in opportunistic infections.

Dr. Hartigan- O'Connor's group characterized the microbiome and virome in blood and stool of CMV-infected and CMV-uninfected 8- 10 months old rhesus macaques.

Previous reports have shown no as- sociation of bacteriome stability with SIV infection in go- rillas.50 However enteric virome has been shown to expand dramatically in SIV-infected macaques.43 The authors in this study investigated enteric virome in SIV-infected and-uninfected gorillas using stool samples.

He suggested that we need to get past correlations in microbiome research by using models and informatics which incorporate metagenomics to predict functional changes in the microbiome.Keywords HIV microbial translocation inflammation HIV transmissionPathogenesiss opportunistic infections become less common li- ver disease has become a more prominent cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV.1 Nonalcoholic steatohepa- titis NASH and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD which are associated with the metabolic syndrome are in- creasingly common in Westerner's where up to 25 have some evidence of excessive fat in the liver.2 The liver re- ceives 75 of its blood supply from the portal vein and so is particularly susceptible to insult from microbial translo- cation from the gut which is known to be increased in HIV infection.34 NASH NAFLD and cirrhosis have been di- rectly associated with alterations in the gut microbiome.5 Dr.Gary Wu of the University of Pennsylvania discussed the potential mechanisms by which diet and microbiota effect risk for fatty liver disease.

KEGG level II analysis demonstrated that metabolism of carbohydrates particularly pentose phosphate were under- represented in the EC microbiome compared with either treatment naives or HC.

Longitudinal data following initiation of antiretrovirals will be helpful in corroborating this work.Pulmonary disease remains common in individuals with HIV with particular increased risk for pneumonia tuber- culosis pulmonary hypertension lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.14 Dr. Ron Collman of the University of Pennsylvania discussed his study on the lung microbiome in HIV.15 They performed two bronchoscopy procedures to first identify background contaminants and then to identify lung microbiota with repeated bronch- oalveolar lavage BAL.

The microbiome of the lungs was very similar to what was found at the level of the vocal cordssuggesting that microaspirations are the source of the lung microbiota.

It is unclear whether these an- elloviruses cause pathology in HIV but there is a negative correlation between anellovirus levels and graft dysfunction after lung transplant.16 Overall they were surprised by the similarity of lung microbiome between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals given the increased risk of pul- monary infection that accompanies HIV even with preserved CD4 and suggested that impaired local immune responses may play a role.Transmission and PreventionCommensal bacteria affect multiple immune parameters to modulate HIV transmission from mother to child.
