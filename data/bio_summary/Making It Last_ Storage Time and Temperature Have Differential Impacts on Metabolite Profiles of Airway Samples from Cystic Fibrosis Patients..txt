The metab- olites in aliquots stored at -20degC had lower CVs than those stored at 4degC as demonstrated by the distribution of points in the violin plot in  where the CVs of the aliquots stored at -20degC largely fall under 0.3 while the CVs of the aliquots stored at 4degC are more widelyFIG 6 Intensities of several metabolites of potential clinical significance after storage of samples from patients 1 and 2 at 4degC or -20degC including lactic acid a 5-aminovaleric acid b and the polyamine putrescine c.distributed.

c Intensities over time of five metabolites that distinguish storage at the temperatures shown.differences between samples stored at 4degC and those stored at -20degC.

For both patients the samples stored at -20degC clustered together with the respective time zero samples that were stored immediately at -80degC while samples stored at 4degC drifted in the ordination space over time.

After 1 day the metabolomic profiles of samples stored at 4degC were observed to be more distant than those of samples stored at 20degC and the average distance from the time zero profile increased each week in samples stored at 4degC.

At each time point two aliquots stored at -20degC were thawed on ice for 30 min before being stored at -80degC.The bacterial communities in both of the sputum samples stored continuously at -80degC were characterized as described previously .

Overall storage at -20degC and freeze-thaw cycles had little impact on metabolite profiles however storage at 4degC shifted metabolite abundances significantly.

All replicates from both samples are shown including those subjected to one or two freeze-thaw cycles.FIG 5 The VIPs from a supervised random-forest analysis to determine which metabolites best distinguish a patient 1 and 2 samples and b storage at -20degC versus storage at 4degC.

In previous work we observed that CF sputum sample metabolite profiles determined by LC-MS were unstable after sample storage at 4degC .In this study we captured smaller aqueous and more volatile metabolites in CF sputum by acetonitrile-isopropyl alcohol-water extraction followed by untargetedFIG 7 Violin plot of the CVs of each metabolite with storage at 4degC or -20degC.

An analysis of metabolite stability under various storage conditions in sputum samples from a greater number of individuals is required to better demonstrate the generalizability of our findings.In summary storage of CF sputum samples at 4degC leads to changes in metaboliteprofiles within a day with greater variation in metabolite abundances and an increase in the abundance of many of the metabolites including several amino acids detected by untargeted GC-MS profiling.

We previously examined the impact of storage conditions on CF sputum metabolomic profiles based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LC-MS and found that profiles were stable in samples stored for at least 4 weeks at -20degC .
