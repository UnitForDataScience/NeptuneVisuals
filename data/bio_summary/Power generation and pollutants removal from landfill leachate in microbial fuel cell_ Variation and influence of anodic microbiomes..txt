The similar removal trend of NH - N and TN indicates that TN was mainly abated by the contribution ofNH -N. The NH -N in the anaerobic condition might be removed44declining of CE from cycle 3-6 indicates the loss of substrate in a non- electricity production process and COD removal mostly occurred in a non-electrogenic way.In the second phase of experiment as can be seen in B A stable voltage 342 - 14 mV and power density 65 - 5 mWm-2 781 - 63 mWm-3 was observed from day 1-7 but declined in later days day 8-12 reaching the lowest value of 30 mWm-2 on day 12.

The total nitrogen TN removal efficiency was 57.2 - 3.4-63.2 - 2.3 equating to the maximum removal rate of 0.055 kg N m-3 d-1 D. The lesser TN removal efficiency might be due to theHowever low efficiency of denitrification has been reported expect stage 1 despite 5 denitrifying bacteria among anodic bacteria dis- cussed in the following section.

The power output of 96.8 mWm-2 with COD removal of90.0 - 1.2 was achieved at 60 young leachate in batch mode which decreased to 75 mWm-2 having55.5 COD abatement in continuous mode employing 100 young leachate.

The high ammonium dosage increased the overall system performance but beyond a certain limit the inhibitory effect intensified.Nitrogen removal 66.0 - 3.3 NH -N and 86.0 - 0.1 NO --N occurred obeying different removal42pathways.

The electrogenic bacteria attach on the anode sur- face degrade organic pollutants and generate electrons which flow through the external circuit to the cathode react with certain electron acceptors e.g.

The generated voltage was recorded every 30 s using a digital multimeter VICTOR 70 C con- nected to the personal computer.

The anolyte and catholyte was agi- tated simultaneously with a magnetic stirrer to avoid concentration gradients.Inoculum and landfill leachateAnaerobic digester effluent sludge was collected from the secondary digester of Laogang wastewater treatment plant Shanghai China.

The MFC system was inoculated with anammox sludge anammox accounted for 5-10 of the total bacteria which was obtained from an on going lab- scale bioreactor running for over 1 year.The NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 contained in the nutrient solution buffered the pH at neutral value.

The catholyte consisted of in g L-1 NaH2PO42H2O 3.32 Na2HPO412 H2O10.32 NH4Cl 0.32 KCl 0.14whereas 50 mM potassium ferricynide K3Fe CN 6 was employed as electron acceptor.Raw leachate samples young and old were collected from Laogang sanitary disposal treatment plant located on the outskirts of shanghai China.

The leachate was used as received for the experiments without pH adjustments addition of nutrientstrace metals or dilution however NH42SO4 and NaNO2 were added with the old leachate in order tokeep NH -N and NO --N ratio at 11.32.
