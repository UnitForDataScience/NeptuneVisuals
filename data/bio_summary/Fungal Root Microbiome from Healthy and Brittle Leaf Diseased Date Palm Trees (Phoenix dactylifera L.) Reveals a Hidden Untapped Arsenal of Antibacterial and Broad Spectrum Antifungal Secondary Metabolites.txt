Mean lipase activity of all isolates of healthy roots was not significantly different from mean lipase activity of BLD isolates .In vitro Antimicrobial Antagonistic Assay of Date Palm EndophytesThe isolated date palm healthy and BLD root endophytic fungi were examined against several pathogenic bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi to assess their antimicrobial activities.

Mean antibacterial activity against S. aureus and antifungal activity against R. solani and P. catenulatum show non-significant difference between healthy and BLD endophytic fungi whereas healthy date palm roots endophytes show significantly higher antimicrobial activities against Ml than BLD derived root endophytes   .Antimicrobial Assay of Date Palm Endophyte ExtractsThe EtOAc extracts of 17 endophytic fungi were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity using agar-well diffusion method -.

Among the examined fungal extracts only five originated from the isolates of healthy dateFIGURE 4  A Heat map of antibacterial Gram-negative bacteria including Se Ec and Kp activity against fungal endophytes isolates from healthy and BLD date palm roots.
