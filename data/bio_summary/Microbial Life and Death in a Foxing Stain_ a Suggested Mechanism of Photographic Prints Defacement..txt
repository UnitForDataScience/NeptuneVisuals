The techniques were applied to two prints collecting data from attacked and not attacked areas in order to point out the possible differences caused by the action of microorganisms.Materials and MethodsPhotographs Sampling Microbial Cultivation and IdentificationTwo different gelatine-silver photographs inv.

In the last years it has been demonstrated that two kinds of foxing exist namely biological and chemical can exist and are clearly detectable and can be differentiated by the topographic modification in- duced in the attacked support  .The objectives of this investigations were the following a to study the nature and origin of stains similar to foxing on the surface of gelatin prints b to screen the microbiome developing on photographs when stored in metallic drawers of common use which apparently favor microbial growth and c to evaluate the role of a different chemical composition and manufacture of the photographs in the defacement phenomena.In this work the foxing-like stains appearance on two gelatine- silver prints supported by cardboard were assessed by means of classical microbiological culturing culture-independent approach scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy SEM-EDS and m-Raman spectroscopy supported by X-ray fluo- rescence analysis XRF.

Means in a row without a common superscript letter differ P  0.05 as analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the Tukey's testBefore discussing the Raman results it must be underlined that the co-occurrence of different species--both fungi and bacteria--on the photographic prints does not allow a detailed analysis of the spectra since it is impossible to differentiate the contribution of each species.Both examined prints were realized on baryta papers with silver halide salts suspended in gelatine as can be seen in Figs.

The presence of potentially halotolerant species could be due to the content of various salt complexes within the gelatine prints including those that microorganisms can deposit during colonization.SEM-EDS m-RAMAN and XRF succeeded in distinguishing the manufacture of the two prints and the structur- al changes occurring in the attacked areas in contrast to those not attacked.

Differences in elemental composition between the prints and the relevant layers obtained using EDS were based on repeated measurements obtained from a number of small samples gained from the materials and mounted in the SEM chamber while XRF data were obtained from several areas se- lected on the entire prints.

A few differences between the results obtained with the two different techniques could account for the different kinds of measured objects samples taken from prints and the prints themselves.

They found that in some cases the initial cause of foxing was actually a group of spores of conidia that had been deposited on the surface of paper prior to printing and had germinated in situ during the slow drying of the paper.The presence of dead fungal and bacterial debris settled in a series of contamination events to which the photographic prints had been exposed in the past was actually the common denominator of the damage affecting the two objects.ConclusionsThe study distinguished the manufacture of the two prints using SEM-EDS and XRF and described the structural and chemical changes occurring in attacked areas in contrast to those not attacked using m-RAMAN.
