All the enzymatic activity b-glucosidase cellulase acid phosphatase and protease showed significant differences p  0.01 depending on the treatment this resulted in significant interactions between the treatment and sampling time p  0.0001 .Cellulase activity was significantly affected by the presence of earthworms p  0.001 this effect being dependent on the sub- strate p  0.05.

No studies comparing vermicomposting and composting process of pig manure through microbial dynam- ics have been found.This research addresses the study of the microbial dynamicsduring the vermicomposting of pig manure and during the matura- tion process of pre-composted pig manure with and without epi- geic E. andrei earthworms.

At the end of the process the cellulase was higher in maturation treatments consequently the passing of manure through the ther- mophilic stage meant a short-term degradation of the most avail- able materials resulting in the concentration of cellulolytic materials and cellulase synthesis.The action of E. andrei earthworms on b-glucosidase activity hadantagonistic effects depending on substrate that it fed from the earthworms caused a reduction in activity in the fresh manure whereas the opposite was true for pre-composted substrate.

Consequently ver- micompost from pre-composted substrate showed higher degradation of organic material as a result of microbial activity during the previous thermophilic phase of pig manure and the pos- terior interaction of earthworms and microbiota with the pre- composted material.With the exception of the vermicompost obtained from fresh manure which showed optimal parameters close to neutrality the pH of the remaining products achieved slightly acidic values.

In the CV treatment the PLFAs characteristic of Gram  bacteria correlated with cellulase r  0.50 p  0.05 and protease r  0.54 p  0.05.A reduction in the PLFAs characteristic of Grambacteria wasobserved as a consequence of the activity of E. andrei earthworms with respect to the treatments without earthworms p  0.001.

Consequently the smaller microbial biomass maintained higher activity than the treatments without earthworms suggesting that the passage through the earthworm intestine could result in microbial population that while smaller is metabolically more active .The enzyme protease is considered indicative of the state ofdegradation of organic material due to its extreme dependence on the microbial availability of substrate .

In this last group there was the highest difference between the CV treatment and the Vcontrol and C treatments there existing higher similarity between products that had not been treated with earthworms.DiscussionGrowth and reproduction of E. andreiThe results show the ability of the E. andrei earthworms to grow and reproduce both in fresh and in pre-composted pig manure sub- strates which means that vermicomposting is appropriate for treating pig manure and maturing after previously pre- composting it.Table 3Parameters of stability and maturity of compost and vermicompost after 112 days of process of vermicomposting V and control Vcontrol treatments of pig manure maturation with earthworms CV and static maturation C treatments of pre-composted pig manure.43Parameters with different letters indicate significant differences between products Tukey test p  0.05.

So it has been observed that in the C treatment Gram  bacteria corre- lated with every enzyme positively with b-glucosidase r  0.76 p  0.0001 and protease r  0.68 p  0.001 and negatively with cellulase r  -0.56 p  0.01 and acid phosphatase r  -0.73 p  0.001.
