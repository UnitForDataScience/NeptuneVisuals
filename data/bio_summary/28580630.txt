Thus the anterior migration of promastigotes that is essen- tial to their differentiation and positioning for successful transmission by bite results in exposure to an especially high sugar concentration in the thoracic midgut and may explain why the early growth of promastigotes in the abdominal midgut was normal in the antibiotic-treated flies and why even during late-stage infections the survivaldefect was confined to the promastigotes that had migrated to the most anterior aspects of the thoracic midgut.

In addition promastigotes undergo a sequence of development in the vectorThese authors contributed equally to this work.midgut culminating in their differentiation to infective metacyclic promastigotes that are uniquely pre-adapted for their transition to life in the vertebrate host.

Infection with LmRy produced an initial growth of promastigotes in the midgut over the first 3 days that survived excre- tion of the digested blood meal Days 4-6 followed by another stageof growth and differentiation into non-dividing infective stagemetacyclic promastigotes Days 9-14 Figure 1a.

Flies were artificially fed through a membrane on mouse blood seeded with 4 x 106ml LmRy promastigotes and dissected at the indicated times postinfection and scored for the number and developmental stage of promastigotes under a haemocytometer.

Flies were treated or not with PS in the blood meal and in the sugar meals composed of 30 or 15 sucrose and evaluated for the total number of promastigotes a or metacyclic promastigotes b at Days 7 and 13 postinfection p.i..

Time lapse imaging of promastigotes in the antibiotic-treated flies failed to capture any motil- ity in the plug region and the cells appeared enlarged and deformed consistent with dead or dying promastigotes Movies S5-S6.

It is interesting that plant diet has been shown to be a potential cause of L. major mortality in the sand fly midgut Schlein  Jacobson 1994 with certain plant species found to produce a high proportion of deformed promastigotes in flies with mature infections consistent with an osmolytic effect of the sugar meals on promastigotes stationed in the anterior midgut.Our findings confirm a recent study involving another Leishmania species L. infantum and another vector L. longipalpis in which dysbiosis of the midgut also resulted in promastigote killing and failure to generate metacyclics Kelly et al.

Leishmania has a dimorphic life cycle consisting of extracellular promastigotes that multiply and develop within the digestive tract of their female sand fly vectors and intracellular amastigotes that multiply within the phagolysosomes of their host cell macrophages.

With respect to the insect promastigotes stages a family of surface and secreted phosphoglycan-containing molecules have been shown to be essential for the parasite to survive certain natural barriers to mid- gut colonisation including the digestive enzymes that are induced upon blood feeding and the excretion of the blood meal remnants that neces- sitates promastigote attachment to the gut wall to avoid being expelled Sacks  Kamhawi 2001.

We attribute this phe- nomenon to the capacity of the gut bacterial symbionts to create the appropriate osmotic conditions required for the survival of infectivestage metacyclic promastigotes in the anterior midgut.
