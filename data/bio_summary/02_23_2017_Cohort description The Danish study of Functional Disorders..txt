accordingly due to the current lack of medical explanations for fss patients are often misdiagnosed and offered insufficient health care solutions.535 moreover they experience being met with mistrust and doubt by health care professionals the social welfare system and friends and relatives.1630 the negative consequences for the patients and society in terms of unmet health care needs social isolation and loss of ability to work emphasize the demand for well-designed studies investigating the epidemiology.26in 2009 motivated by the growing concern about the fss within the medical community a think tank of scientists medical experts and medical social workers were invited by the danish foundation trygfonden to discuss possible interdisciplinary and cross-national research studies.

additional data included a telephone-based diagnostic interview assessment for fss questionnaires on physical and mental health personality traits lifestyle use of health care services and social factors and a physical examination with measures of cardiorespiratory and morphological fitness metabolic fitness neck mobility heart rate variability and pain sensitivity.

finally the impact of fss both on an individual level and for the society as a whole is difficult to disentangle due to few well-conducted follow-up studies.the burden on the use of the health care system itself can be calculated indirectly but there is a need for longitu- dinally cohort studies linked to registries to obtain reliable data on remission exacerbation use of health care services and development of other diseases.

a better delimitation of fss will similarly lead to more precise estimates of the true prevalence and incidence of fss.to disentangle the pathophysiology of fss thereby sup- porting the delimitation of the syndromes.to identify risk factors for fss ranging from the genome and the microbiomes over fitness and lifestyles to psy- chological factors.to assess the consequences of fss both on an individual level and for the society as a whole including the course of the syndromes remission stability and exacerba- tion development of other diseases and socioeconomic consequences.study populationthe danfund cohort is anchored at the research centre for prevention and health rcph glostrup denmark and is a random sample of the general adult population.
