The specific aims with the cohort were to test delimitations of FSS estimate prevalence and incidence rates identify risk factors delimitate the pathogenic pathways and explore the consequences of FSS.

The study population comprises a random sample of 9656 men and women aged 18-76 years from the general population examined from 2011 to 2015.

The survey comprises screening questionnaires for five types of FSS ie fibromyalgia whiplash- associated disorder multiple chemical sensitivity irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome and for the unifying diagnostic category of bodily distress syndrome.

Several projects using the DanFunD data are ongoing and findings will be published in the coming years.Keywords functional somatic syndromes medically unexplained symptoms epidemiologylongitudinal cohort study pathophysiology risk factorsResearch 10Department of Public Health Faculty of Health and MedicalSciences University of Copenhagen11Faculty of Medicine Aalborg University Aalborg DenmarkCorrespondence Thomas Meinertz Dantoft Research Centre for Prevention and Health The Capital Region of Denmark Nordre Ringvej 57 Building 8485 2600 Glostrup DenmarkTel 45 3863 4248Fax 45 3863 3977Email IntroductionThe Danish study of Functional Disorders DanFunD was initiated to outline the epidemiology of what is often referred to as medically unexplained symptomssyn- dromes or bodily distress defined as conditions that cannot be explained in terms of a conventional medical or surgical disease.1-6 They exist in many forms are clinically important and are prevalent in all medical settings.

Consequently the estimated prevalence and the incidence rates of FSS have so far been inconsistent2627 and our understanding of both the pathogenesis and common risk factors is similarly at a premature stage.2829 The significance of various physiologi- cal biochemical and psychological factors has received some scientific attention30-34 but a systematic approach has been missing.

Accordingly due to the current lack of medical explanations for FSS patients are often misdiagnosed and offered insufficient health care solutions.535 Moreover they experience being met with mistrust and doubt by health care professionals the social welfare system and friends and relatives.1630 The negative consequences for the patients and society in terms of unmet health care needs social isolation and loss of ability to work emphasize the demand for well-designed studies investigating the epidemiology.26In 2009 motivated by the growing concern about the FSS within the medical community a think tank of scientists medical experts and medical social workers were invited by the Danish foundation TrygFonden to discuss possible interdisciplinary and cross-national research studies.

The outcome was the formation of the DanFunD Steering Com- mittee with the overall objectives to design and launch a large-scale epidemiological population-based longitudinal study with special focus on FSS encompassing research- ers from basic science clinical science biostatistics and epidemiology.ObjectivesThe overall goal of the DanFunD is to unravel the epidemiol- ogy of FSS and achieve a similar knowledge to what has been generated for other chronic diseases using epidemiological methods.More specifically the objectives of the DanFunD can be divided into the following categoriesTo delimitate FSS by means of relevant symptoms in the general population.
