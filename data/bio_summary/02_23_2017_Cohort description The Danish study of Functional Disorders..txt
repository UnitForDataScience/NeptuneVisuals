The specific aims with the cohort were to test delimitations of FSS estimate prevalence and incidence rates identify risk factors delimitate the pathogenic pathways and explore the consequences of FSS.

The study population comprises a random sample of 9656 men and women aged 18-76 years from the general population examined from 2011 to 2015.

The survey comprises screening questionnaires for five types of FSS ie fibromyalgia whiplash- associated disorder multiple chemical sensitivity irritable bowel syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome and for the unifying diagnostic category of bodily distress syndrome.

Several projects using the DanFunD data are ongoing and findings will be published in the coming years.Keywords functional somatic syndromes medically unexplained symptoms epidemiologylongitudinal cohort study pathophysiology risk factorsResearch 10Department of Public Health Faculty of Health and MedicalSciences University of Copenhagen11Faculty of Medicine Aalborg University Aalborg DenmarkCorrespondence Thomas Meinertz Dantoft Research Centre for Prevention and Health The Capital Region of Denmark Nordre Ringvej 57 Building 8485 2600 Glostrup DenmarkTel 45 3863 4248Fax 45 3863 3977Email IntroductionThe Danish study of Functional Disorders DanFunD was initiated to outline the epidemiology of what is often referred to as medically unexplained symptomssyn- dromes or bodily distress defined as conditions that cannot be explained in terms of a conventional medical or surgical disease.1-6 They exist in many forms are clinically important and are prevalent in all medical settings.

Consequently the estimated prevalence and the incidence rates of FSS have so far been inconsistent2627 and our understanding of both the pathogenesis and common risk factors is similarly at a premature stage.2829 The significance of various physiologi- cal biochemical and psychological factors has received some scientific attention30-34 but a systematic approach has been missing.
