we would argue that an early identification of additional modifiable risk factors in this at-risk group of pregnant women would be likely to provide motivational strategy for health counselling of pregnant women and thus be helpful in lowering the risk of adverse clinical mani- festations in both mother and child.the objective of this study was to investigate whether intestinal microbiota composition and serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles differ and are interrelated in overweight and obese women during early pregnancy.subjects and methodssubjectsthe study investigated 99 overweight and obese pregnant women at early pregnancy who participated in the on-going mother-infant dietary intervention trial clinicaltrials.gov nct01922791.

our objective was to investigate whether intestinal microbiota serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles differ in relation to the degree of overweight status in pregnant women.methods this study investigated 52 overweight and 47 obese pregnant women in early pregnancy.

a total of 52 mothers were overweight bmi 25e30 with the remaining 47 classified as obese bmi 30. the inclusion criteria into the trial were overweight prepregnancy bmi 25 and early pregnancy 17 weeks of gestation.

p-value  0.05 is considered significant.four bacteria belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes including a bacterial family prevotellaceae mean 3.69 - sd 9.03 vs mean2.50 - sd 6.82 p 0.019 genus prevotella mean 3.69 - sd 9.03 vs mean 2.50 - sd 6.82 p 0.019 and species copri mean 3.14 - sd8.47 vs mean 2.18 - sd 6.84 p 0.033 were higher in obese compared to overweight pregnant women whilst species uniformis mean 3.62 - sd 3.09 vs mean 6.00 - sd 5.06 p 0.012 was lower in the obese pregnant women.

overweight was defined a bmi equal to or greater than 25 kgm2 whereas the woman was obese if their bmi was equal to or greater than 30 kgm2 .

further the variables from microbiota prevotellaceae and amino acids leucine isoleu- cine valine and phenylalanine mmoll that remained significant after correction for multiple analyses in comparison between overweight and obese women were included in the model.

differences were considered significant with p-value below 0.05. the statistical analysis of metabolites lipids and amino acids separately and in- testinal microbiota ateach taxonomic level between overweight and obese pregnant women and the correlation analysis between pre- pregnancy bmi with microbiota lipids or amino acids low-grage inflammation with lipids and amino acids diet with metabolites were adjusted for multiple comparisons using adaptive benjamini- hochberg procedure for the false discovery rate controlling.

the groups of overweight and obese women were clearly distinguish- able according to their prepregnancy bmi weight and body fat percent at early pregnancy.

mean daily intakes of energy energy yielding nu- trients and fiber or met index describing physical activity did not differ between overweight and obese pregnant women.

neither serum zonulin levels a marker of intestinal permeability nor lps activity a marker of endotoxemia differed between the two groups.metabolic profilein the evaluation of lipid profile 157 of 213 lipid metabolites differed statistically significantly between overweight and obese pregnant women  exact values are presented in supplementary table 1a.

the majority of these 5984 were higher in obese compared to overweight pregnant women.
