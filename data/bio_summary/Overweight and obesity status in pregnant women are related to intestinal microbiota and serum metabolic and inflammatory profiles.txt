We would argue that an early identification of additional modifiable risk factors in this at-risk group of pregnant women would be likely to provide motivational strategy for health counselling of pregnant women and thus be helpful in lowering the risk of adverse clinical mani- festations in both mother and child.The objective of this study was to investigate whether intestinal microbiota composition and serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles differ and are interrelated in overweight and obese women during early pregnancy.Subjects and methodsSubjectsThe study investigated 99 overweight and obese pregnant women at early pregnancy who participated in the on-going mother-infant dietary intervention trial ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01922791.

Our objective was to investigate whether intestinal microbiota serum metabolic and inflammatory profiles differ in relation to the degree of overweight status in pregnant women.Methods This study investigated 52 overweight and 47 obese pregnant women in early pregnancy.

The analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for false discovery rate controlling.Results The relative abundance of bacterial family Prevotellaceae adjusted P 14 0.19 and markers of low- grade inflammation hsCRP P 14 0.0015 and GlycA P  0.001 and three branched chain amino acids isoleucine adjusted P 14 0.024 leucine adjusted P 14 0.026 valine adjusted P 14 0.10 and one aromatic amino acid phenylalanine adjusted P 14 0.050 and concentrations of several VLDL particles and lipid measures in several VLDL particles were higher in obese pregnant women compared to their overweight pregnant counterparts adjusted P  0.12.

In contrast lipid measures in a few HDL particles and many fatty acids were lower in obese compared to overweight pregnant women adjusted P  0.12.Conclusions The detected alterations in intestinal microbiota and metabolic and inflammatory profiles related to obesity status may offer new alternative tools to supplement standard clinical measures to predict the risk for metabolic alterations during the early phase of pregnancy.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

A total of 52 mothers were overweight BMI 25e30 with the remaining 47 classified as obese BMI 30.

Further the variables from microbiota Prevotellaceae and amino acids leucine isoleu- cine valine and phenylalanine mmoll that remained significant after correction for multiple analyses in comparison between overweight and obese women were included in the model.

The statistical analysis of metabolites lipids and amino acids separately and in- testinal microbiota ateach taxonomic level between overweight and obese pregnant women and the correlation analysis between pre- pregnancy BMI with microbiota lipids or amino acids low-grage inflammation with lipids and amino acids diet with metabolites were adjusted for multiple comparisons using adaptive Benjamini- Hochberg procedure for the false discovery rate controlling.

The groups of overweight and obese women were clearly distinguish- able according to their prepregnancy BMI weight and body fat percent at early pregnancy.
