The workflow's classification step is based on Illumina's proprietary algorithm ClassifyReads and a modified version of the Greengenes Database v.135.For phylogenetic characterization of the strain collection species C. saccharophila MZCH 10155 C. vulgaris pv minima HH MZCH 10162 C. zofingiensis MZCH 10156S.

For each of the three analyzed microbiomes we generated a minimum of 567 mio reads which were assembled to 174 Mb of DNA for C. saccharophila 162 Mb of contiguous DNA for S. quadricauda and 268 Mb for M. crux-melitensis .To further analyze the dataset we employed the AMPHORA2 software which uses 31 conserved bacterial proteins as phylo- genetic markers  .

bins from Sediminibacterium an uncultured Bacteroidetes and Sphingobacterium appeared to be the main suppliers of vitamin B12 based on the RNA-Seq data .Altogether these data imply that in the Chlorella and Scenedesmus microbiome the bacteria affiliated with Porphyrobacter and Blastomonas are transcriptionally most active while in the Micrasterias microbiome the bacteroidetal organisms show highest numbers of transcripts.Secretome-Based Microbiome AnalysisSecretome analyses for the S. quadricauda microbiome were performed to partially verify the metagenome and metatranscriptome-based results Supplementary Figure S2 and .In total we identified 156 bacterial proteins in the supernatants.

The second evolutionary younger system is designated as effector- triggered immunity ETI with the signals being perceived by variable cognate plant immune responsive receptor proteins       .Within this framework we addressed the following questions in the current study Can we identify specific bacterial communities associated with microalga affiliated with the Trebouxiophyceae Chlorophyceae and Zygnematophyceae using material from strain collections that has been cultivated over long-time periods Who are the transcriptionally most active bacteria in these communities on a genome transcriptome and proteome level and are the main bacterial transcripts and secretome-proteins the same as those known as elicitors to plant innate immune system To answer these questions we have systematically characterized the microbiomes of selectedFurther detailed and deep metagenome and metatrans- criptome analyses identified shared and host-specific transcripts in microalgal microbiomes.

While it has previously been reported that alga-associated bacteria are most likely responsible for the supply of the essential B-vitamins we provide strong evidence that the supply is provided by a rather small group of bacteria in the different microbiomes and that significant differences exist between the Chlorella Scenedesmus and Micrasterias associated bacterial community .
