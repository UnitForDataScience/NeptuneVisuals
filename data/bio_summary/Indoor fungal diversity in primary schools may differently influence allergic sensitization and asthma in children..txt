Indoor fungal diversity in primary schools may differently influence allergic sensitization and asthma in children.

Despite having a clear impact on sensitization fungal diversity was not a risk factor for allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis suggesting that exposure to microbiologic agents may differently influence the atopic syndrome.A different risk pattern for fungal diversity between the different definitions of asthma was also discernable with the fungal diversity showing a tendency to be associated with a higher risk for lung function diagnosed asthma but not for the other definitions.

Similar results were observed for exhaled NO values data not shown.DiscussionOur findings suggest that higher levels of endotoxin or Penicillium exposure in classrooms is associated with increased risk of allergic sensitization in school-aged children while a higher fungal diversity showed a clear tendency for a decreased sensitization.

Diversity scores were established as the number of different fungal species found in each classroom.Results Classrooms with increased diversity scores showed a significantly lower prevalence of children with atopic sensitization but not asthma.

Similarly significantly higher concentrations of Penicillium spp were found in classrooms with a higher number of children with atopic sensitization.Conclusions Although no causal relationships could be established exposure to higher fungal diversity was protective against allergic sensitization but this was not seen for asthma.

22 which showed that exhaled NO at school age was lower in children exposed to LPS during the first 2-3 months of life.Although no significant associations between exposure to total bacteria concentrations and allergic sensitization asthma or exhaled nitric oxide levels were found total fungi concen- tration is generally not a good predictor as it is not very specific and does not consider several confounding factors such as the species and diversity involved 1 23.

More region-wide studies are needed to further clarify the biodiversity hypothesis.In conclusion the microbiologic diversity in classrooms is associated with a lower risk of sensitization development in children thus supporting the results from other studies concerning home exposure.

A total of 58 children refused to perform the clinical tests having only the questionnaire data available thus spirometry skin-prick testing and exhaled nitric oxide datawere retrieved from 858 children mean age of 9 - 1 years.Clinical assessmentIn all participating children height weight lung function spirometry with bronchodilation and exhaled level of nitric oxide NO were measured and skin-prick tests SPTs performed by a trained professional.

Due to the low number of observations with low and high diversity the variable was categorized into quartiles being the classrooms with lower diversity score in the first quartile whereas the fourth quartile included those with higher diversity scores.

Sensitization odds ratio was lower than the unity for all tertiles and a significant tendency for a lower risk of allergic sensitization was observed in classrooms with higher fungal diversity.
