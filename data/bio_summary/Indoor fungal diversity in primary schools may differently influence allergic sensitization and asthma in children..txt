in contrast classrooms with a higher fungal diversity and with lower concentrations of penicillium spp were shown to be negatively associated with the prevalence of allergic sensitization supporting the results from previous studies 25 26. despite having a clear impact on sensitization fungal diversity was not a risk factor for allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis suggesting that exposure to microbiologic agents may differently influence the atopic syndrome.a different risk pattern for fungal diversity between the different definitions of asthma was also discernable with the fungal diversity showing a tendency to be associated with a higher risk for lung function diagnosed asthma but not for the other definitions.

in contrast higher exposure to gram-negative endotoxins and penicillium spp in primary school0s classrooms was associated with increasing odds of allergic sensitization in children.exposure to indoor air microbiologic agents during childhood has been shown to influence the development of allergic diseases 1. while there is evidence that excessive exposure to indoor air bacteria or fungi concentrations may induce the development of allergy and asthma 2-4 a large number of recent studies also suggest that exposure to certain microor- ganisms in the early years of life may have a protective effect in children reducing the risk of allergy and asthma onset by promoting the maturation of th1 lymphocytes thus decreasingthe incidence of th2-oriented immunity hygiene hypothesis 5-9. there is published evidence supporting the general concept that a low diversity of the human microbiome during infancy is associated with the long-term development of lifestyle-dependent immune disease manifestations such as atopic disease 10.apart from home young children spend a large section of their daytime at school mostly within their classrooms which might be reflected as a long-term exposure to indoor airmicrobes 5 11. if the human microbiome does change according to environmental exposure the classroom environ- ment might contribute to microbiome changes and conse- quently either induce the development andor exacerbation of allergy and asthma or on the other hand have a protective effect against their onset.therefore the aim of this cross-sectional study was to observe how the prevalence of allergic sensitization and asthma in schoolchildren is influenced by the exposure to indoor air bacteria and fungi in classrooms.

diversity scores were established as the number of different fungal species found in each classroom.results classrooms with increased diversity scores showed a significantly lower prevalence of children with atopic sensitization but not asthma.

similar results were observed for exhaled no values data not shown.discussionour findings suggest that higher levels of endotoxin or penicillium exposure in classrooms is associated with increased risk of allergic sensitization in school-aged children while a higher fungal diversity showed a clear tendency for a decreased sensitization.

the results showed that classrooms with higher concentrations of lps had a significantly higher prevalence of allergic children 2.20 0.89-4.25 vs. 2.60 1.18-5.68 data presented as median 25-75 respectively non-sensitized vs sensitized p  0.02. diversity scores ranged from 1 to 11. logistic regression models showed that there is a negative association between the number of fungi species in classrooms and the risk of allergic sensitization fig.

sensitization odds ratio was lower than the unity for all tertiles and a significant tendency for a lower risk of allergic sensitization was observed in classrooms with higher fungal diversity.

similarly significantly higher concentrations of penicillium spp were found in classrooms with a higher number of children with atopic sensitization.conclusions although no causal relationships could be established exposure to higher fungal diversity was protective against allergic sensitization but this was not seen for asthma.

due to the low number of observations with low and high diversity the variable was categorized into quartiles being the classrooms with lower diversity score in the first quartile whereas the fourth quartile included those with higher diversity scores.

22 which showed that exhaled no at school age was lower in children exposed to lps during the first 2-3 months of life.although no significant associations between exposure to total bacteria concentrations and allergic sensitization asthma or exhaled nitric oxide levels were found total fungi concen- tration is generally not a good predictor as it is not very specific and does not consider several confounding factors such as the species and diversity involved 1 23. in this study no fungi species in classrooms were associated with a lower prevalence of the four definitions of asthma.

more region-wide studies are needed to further clarify the biodiversity hypothesis.in conclusion the microbiologic diversity in classrooms is associated with a lower risk of sensitization development in children thus supporting the results from other studies concerning home exposure.

endotoxin concentrations in classrooms were associated with a higher prevalence of sensitization to inhalant allergens in children somehow corroborating the results obtained in the pasture study 20. these results need to be interpreted with caution however as children in the present study were considerably older and may have their immune systems further developed thus the impact of exposure to lps in this agegroup may be substantially different than when exposition occurs in pre- and post-natal periods of life.

these results were significant for the third 0.63 95 ci 0.40-0.98 and fourth 0.60 95 ci 0.40-0.92 quartile scores which ranged from 7 to 8 table s1.additional pro-sensitization evidence was observed with specific fungal species as classrooms with second tertilefigure 2 a logistic regression between lps bacterial and fungal exposure in classrooms and the prevalence of asthma and atopy.

more specifically this work aimed to i quantify the concentration of microbiologic parameters in the indoor air of primary school classrooms andii investigate how microbial concentrations and diversity may influence the risk of asthma and allergy in primary school children.methodsstudy design and participantsa total of 20 public primary schools located in the city of porto portugal were invited to participate in this cross- sectional survey corresponding to a total of 71 assessed classrooms.

the results are expressed as odds ratios with 95 ci in logarithmic scale.concentrations of penicillium spp were associated with a higher risk of sensitization or  1.46 95 ci 1.02-2.09 and classrooms with third tertile concentrations showed an even higher risk or  1.68 95 ci 1.18-2.40. this tendency for a higher sensitization risk associated with penicillium spp can be observed in fig.
