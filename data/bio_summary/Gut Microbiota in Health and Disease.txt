The high rate of gut bacteria in the circula- tion suggests translocation of bacteria from the gut to the bloodstream.Dysbiosis in Infants Born by Cesarean-SectionInfants born vaginally acquire bacterial communities that resemble the vaginal microbiota of their mothers while those delivered by cesarean C-section acquire communities similar to the microbiota found on the sur- face of the skin of their mothers and those of the hospital staff.

Sys- temic low-grade inflammation is closely linked to meta- bolic disorders 16 to which dysbiosis of gut microbiota with lipopolysaccharide-containing microbiota contrib- utes 17 such low-grade inflammation also plays a sub- stantial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseas- es including ischemic stroke 18.

Research activity on gut microbiota by Japanese scientists is expect- ed to continue to facilitate further development of this field.ReferencesAtarashi K Tanoue T Oshima K Suda W Nagano Y Nishikawa H Fukuda S Saito T Narushima S Hase K Kim S Fritz JV Wilmes P Ueha S Matsushima K Ohno H Olle B Sakaguchi S Taniguchi T Morita H Hattori M Honda K Treg induction by a rationally selected mixture of Clostridia strains from the human microbiota.

Japantopic a special issue of Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism provides a brief review of several papers recently reported by Japanese researchers and this may provide new insights into gut microbiota and probiotics.

Their findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.These authors also reported related work on Treg cellsand Th17 cells 3.A Cutting-Edge Analytical Method for Detection of Bacteria in the Bloodstream Leading to Evolution of an Altered Disease ConceptA highly sensitive microbial analytical system the Yakult Intestinal Flora-Scan has been developed to quan- tify the intestinal microbiota 4.

Dr. Junko Sato Department of Metabolism  Endocrinology Jun- tendo University Tokyo and her group 7 recently pro- vided the first report demonstrating a high prevalence of bacteremia in patients with type 2 diabetes.Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is an important modifier of obesity and diabetes.

Using a sensi- tive RT-qPCR method we determined the composition of fecal gut microbiota in 50 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and 50 control subjects and its association with various clinical parameters including inflammato- ry markers.
