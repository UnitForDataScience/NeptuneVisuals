The high rate of gut bacteria in the circula- tion suggests translocation of bacteria from the gut to the bloodstream.Dysbiosis in Infants Born by Cesarean-SectionInfants born vaginally acquire bacterial communities that resemble the vaginal microbiota of their mothers while those delivered by cesarean C-section acquire communities similar to the microbiota found on the sur- face of the skin of their mothers and those of the hospital staff.

Sys- temic low-grade inflammation is closely linked to meta- bolic disorders 16 to which dysbiosis of gut microbiota with lipopolysaccharide-containing microbiota contrib- utes 17 such low-grade inflammation also plays a sub- stantial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseas- es including ischemic stroke 18.

Research activity on gut microbiota by Japanese scientists is expect- ed to continue to facilitate further development of this field.ReferencesAtarashi K Tanoue T Oshima K Suda W Nagano Y Nishikawa H Fukuda S Saito T Narushima S Hase K Kim S Fritz JV Wilmes P Ueha S Matsushima K Ohno H Olle B Sakaguchi S Taniguchi T Morita H Hattori M Honda K Treg induction by a rationally selected mixture of Clostridia strains from the human microbiota.

Dr. Junko Sato Department of Metabolism  Endocrinology Jun- tendo University Tokyo and her group 7 recently pro- vided the first report demonstrating a high prevalence of bacteremia in patients with type 2 diabetes.Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is an important modifier of obesity and diabetes.

Using a sensi- tive RT-qPCR method we determined the composition of fecal gut microbiota in 50 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and 50 control subjects and its association with various clinical parameters including inflammato- ry markers.

Their findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which host-microbe interactions establish immunological homeostasis in the gut.These authors also reported related work on Treg cellsand Th17 cells 3.A Cutting-Edge Analytical Method for Detection of Bacteria in the Bloodstream Leading to Evolution of an Altered Disease ConceptA highly sensitive microbial analytical system the Yakult Intestinal Flora-Scan has been developed to quan- tify the intestinal microbiota 4.
