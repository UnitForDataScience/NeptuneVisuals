Defensin affinity towards HCV surface glycoprotein epitopes may create a protective barri- cade that blocks viral fusion  thereby displaying additional properties to neutralising antibodies albeit at the expense of autoimmunity.Implications of bacteria-driven defensin expressionBy focusing on symbiotic events between microbiota and viruses characterised by their ability to establish persistent infec- tions highly complex synergies which modulate the thresholds of ATL activation and initiate a pro-inflammatory milieu able to induce distal signalling events in the CNS started to unveil .In this context co-stimulated defensin expression by specific T-cell subsets epithelial cells and perivascular macrophages provides a mechanistic mode that may induce differentiation and trafficking of immature cytokine-expressing dendritic cells CD4 and CD8 T-cells and inhibit apoptotic deletion that further fuelsmucosal and systemic inflammation and contributes to the break- down of self-tolerance.

Furthermore BBB dysfunction enhances efferent immunity demonstrated by the transfer of distantly-produced CNS antigen-specific T-cell subsets into the CNS thereby promoting neuroinflammation.

In addition HCV RNA has been associated with CNS tissue and reports of viral sequence diversity between brain and liver tissue suggest independent viral evolution in the CNS and the liver.

Moreover the existence of a dedicated dural lymphatic vasculature allows bilateral movement of immune cells and immunoregulatory mole- cules between the brain parenchyma and the periphery  thereby challenging basic dogmas of neuroscience.

These cells may access the brain thereby causing a decrease in defensin expression and subsequent down-regulation of CD91LRP1-mediated clearance of amyloid-b that ultimately accumulates as protein deposits.

Impaired BBB structure may also lead to increased exposure of brain cells to hepatitis C virus HCV proteins thereby promoting neuronal damage via sustained activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT3extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK pathway through Toll-like receptor TLR-2interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase IRAK complex signalling.

HSPGs facilitate simultaneous binding of human b-defensins and human immunodeficiency viral HIV gp120 to epithelial cells that favors the formation of immunogenic oligomers inside endosomes thereby reducing virion infectivity .

Its absence or dysfunction results in the loss of T-cell negative selection and the development of polyclonal ATLs that enter into the circulation and possibly the brain thereby initiating a dose-dependent CNS inflammatory response.

Specifically HCV core protein neuro- toxicity may be mediated by the sustained activation of ERKSignal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 dependent on specific Toll-like receptor 2 signalling pathways thereby providing novel targets for the development of neuroprotective treatments against HCV involvement of the CNS .

Moreover HCV NS3 protein was capable of activating microglia and the inflammatory response could be controlled by blocking the transcription nuclear factor-jB or by treating the microglia with TLR ligands which acts viasecreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 thereby having therapeutic potential in controlling HCV- mediated neuroinflammation .Viewing all aforementioned data we propose that inappropri- ate expression of defensins may be involved in HCV-induced autoimmunity in the CNS .
