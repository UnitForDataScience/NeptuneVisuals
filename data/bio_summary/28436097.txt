The vaginal microbiome and gynaecological cancer exercise caution when considering causationNC Ramchandera EJ Crosbiebca University of Manchester Medical School Manchester UK b Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology St Mary's Hospital Manchester Academic Health Science Centre Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Manchester UK c Gynaecological Oncology Research Group Division of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Sciences Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health St Mary's Hospital University of Manchester Manchester UKLinked article This is a mini commentary on M Champer et al.

The vaginal microbiome may play an important role in determining the fate of viral challenge indeed recent data suggest that certain vaginal microbiome signatures are asso- ciated with the presence or absence of genital HPV and the severity of associ- ated CIN Mitra et al.

However such associa- tions can neither inform temporal rela- tionships nor ascertain cause and effect.While it is plausible that the vaginal microbiome influences or is influenced by cervical carcinogenesis its role in the aetiology of other gynaecological cancers is entirely unclear.

Could chronic exposure to the vaginal microbiome affect the exquisitely sensi- tive balance of local inhibitory and pro-inflammatory mediators with neo- plastic consequences for susceptible cells principally those of the tubal fim- briae This is pure speculation com- pletely unsubstantiated by any evidence but fits with the emerging consensus that neoplastic change in the tubal epithelium is responsible for a proportion of 'ovarian' cancers.Champer et al.

also propose a role for the vaginal microbiome in endome- trial carcinogenesis.

In fact endometrial cancer is more common among nulliparous women there is no evidence whatsoever to support a link between sexually trans- mitted infection and endometrial car- cinogenesis.Thus we are intrigued by the notion that the vaginal microbiome may hold clues to the secrets of cervical carcino- genesis and that piecing these together could have major implications for the prevention and treatment of this com- mon cancer.
