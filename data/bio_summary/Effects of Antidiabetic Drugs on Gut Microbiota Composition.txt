Thus beneficial effects might be mediated by specific taxa.Keywords gut microbiota type 2 diabetes antidiabetic drugs metformin incretinsIntroductionThe gut microbiota refers to the trillions of microbes living in our guts and can be considered a separate endocrine organ .

Furthermore some beneficial actions but also side-effects of metformin are thought to be mediated by gut microbiota .In rodents metformin has been shown to modify gut microbiota composition and diversity but in a diet-dependent manner .

In order to increase the beneficial effects of incretins two categories of incretin-based drugs have been developed i GLP-1 receptor agonists GLP-1 RA and ii DPP-4 inhibitors DPP-4i.Even though this section focuses on the effects of incretin-based drugs on gut microbiota it is worth mentioning that gut microbiota fermentation products also influence incretin secretion.

Note that in this study the DPP-4i saxagliptin was able to decrease the relative abundance of only one phylotype associated with weight gain the genus Candidatus Arthromitus .Currently only few studies show the actions of GLP-1 RA on gut microbiota and we could not find any data on other GLP-1 RA such as exenatide dulaglutide albiglutide or lixisenatide.DPP-4 InhibitorsAmongst DPP-4i sitagliptin was shown to restore the gut microbiota structure at the phylum level in diabetic-induced rats without significant modifications in body weight.

It is becoming clear that gut microbiota is playing a prevalent role in pathologies such as metabolic syndrome type 2 diabetes T2D inflammatory and bowel diseases.

In this review we aim to cover the current knowledge about the effects of antidiabetic drugs on gut microbiota diversity and composition as well as the potential beneficial effects mediated by specific taxa.

The composition and richness of the gut microbiota depends on the symbiotic relationship with the host.

Moreover one main function of gut microbiota is to breakdown non-digestible carbohydrates into short-chain fatty acids SCFA mostly acetate propionate and butyrate.

Consequently gut microbiota contributes to a broader metabolic potential for the host .
