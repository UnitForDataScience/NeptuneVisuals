S2.Effect of butyrate and IFN-g on the expression of FoxP3 isoforms in CD41CD251 Tanalysis on HC and CD subjects did not show statistically sig-nificant changes in FOXP3 isoforms expression between theand CD41CD25-T cellsregtwo culture conditions upon stimulation with lactate both FOXP3 isoforms appeared to be expressed more significantly in CD patients compared to HC subjects P  0005 Fig.It has been shown that upon activation FoxP3 expression is up-regulated in CD41CD25- T cells 37.

The effect of lactate on the relative expression of both FOXP3 isoforms was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR in CD41CD251 Treg healthy controls HC n 5 6 coeliac disease CD n 5 6 and CD41CD25- T cells HC n 5 8 and CD n 5 11.

in PBMC of HC and CD patients without stimulus black bars or stimulated with PTG white bars c. Relative expression of interleukin IL6 was measured as a positive control of the efficacy of the PBMC stimulation with PTG in PBMC from HC n 5 6 and CD n 5 6 D. Statistical comparisons were made using Wilcoxon's test abd the Mann-Whitney U-test bd and the Kruskal-Wallis test c. P  005.evaluate more clearly the precise cells subset targeted by IFN-g and butyrate we isolated CD41CD25- T cells and CD41CD251 Treg from HC and CD patients Supporting information Fig.

Relative expression of FOXP3 isoforms normalized to housekeeping gene 18S expression was measured before and after stimulation in HC n 5 7 and CD n 5 7 patients a. Paired analysis was used to determine the differences between the two isoforms' expression within the same group of patients in both culture conditions b.

The effect of lactate 1 lgml on FOXP3 isoforms expression was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR on PBMC from non-coeliac subjects HC n 5 16 and coeliac patients CD n 5 23 after a 48-h stimulation and normalized on 18S a. Paired analysis was used to determine differences between the two isoforms' expression within each group of patients in both cultures conditions b.

In the present study we have shown that upon stimulation with lactate PBMC from CD patients expressed higher levels of both FOXP3 isoforms compared to non-coeliac HC sub- jects therefore confirming once again how cells from CD patients respond differently to the same microenviron- ment.

These conditions trigger an efficient regulatory immune response in HC subjects by modulating directly the balance between FoxP3 isoforms while intrinsic defects on Treg cells do not allow this balance to occur in CD patients.In summary our study demonstrates for the first time adirect and mechanistic link between microbiota-derived metabolites mucosal inflammatory processes and epige- netic changes regulating FOXP3 isoform expression and how these mechanisms lead towards a Th17-driven immune response in CD subjects.

The ratio between FoxP3 isoforms D2FL was calculated normalizing the relative protein expression of each isoform to b-actin in PBMC isolated from HC n 5 3 and CD subjects n 5 3 before MED and after stimulation STIM f. Western blot analysis of FoxP3 protein detection in PBMC cultured with medium alone MED or with butyrate and IFN-g STIM is representative of three independent experiments on PBMC from HC and CD patients g. Statistical comparisons were made using Wilcoxon's test or paired t-test.

The effect of butyrate and IFN-g on the ratio between FOXP3 isoform expression was evaluated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR on CD41CD251 Treg healthy controls HC n 5 6 coeliac disease CD n 5 6 and CD41CD25- T cells HC n 5 8 and CD n 5 11.

Correlation between gene expressions wasmeasured by two-tailed Spearman's or Pearson's correlation analysis depending on the sample distribution.Study approvalAll protocols were approved by the Partners Human Research Committee Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all enrolled subjects.ResultsAltered expression of FoxP3 isoforms in the intestine of active coeliac patientsWe measured the expression of total FOXP3 in the small intestine of CDA patients and HC subjects and also the expression of each FOXP3 isoform in HC CDA and CDGFpatients by performing a real-time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR.
