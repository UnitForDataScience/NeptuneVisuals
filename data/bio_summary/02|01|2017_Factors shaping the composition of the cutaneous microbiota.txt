Many of these microbial species are not sim- ply passive bystanders but together with various human cells form a complex ecosystem.1-3The first identified human-associated bacterium Escherichia coli was isolated from stool samples of healthy and diseased children by paediatrician Theodor Escherich in the 1880s.4 His contemporary Louis Pasteur had already hypothesized that normal human flora were essential for life reviewed by344British Journal of Dermatology 2017 176 pp344-351c 2016 British Association of DermatologistsMackowiak.5 The idea that microbes can act as important integral components of the human body received particular attention a decade ago subsequently studies on microbial communities inhabiting various organs have become increas- ingly popular.

The net effect would be gradually decreasing variability in our resident microbes or in other words disappearing microbiota.4559 The combined effects of decreasing diversity for environmental microbes hygiene hypothesis and drastic changes in human ecology might also lead to declining diversity in our resident flora disappearing microbiota hypothesis.
