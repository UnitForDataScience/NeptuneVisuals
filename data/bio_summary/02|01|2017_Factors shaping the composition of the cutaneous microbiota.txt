many of these microbial species are not sim- ply passive bystanders but together with various human cells form a complex ecosystem.1-3the first identified human-associated bacterium escherichia coli was isolated from stool samples of healthy and diseased children by paediatrician theodor escherich in the 1880s.4 his contemporary louis pasteur had already hypothesized that normal human flora were essential for life reviewed by344british journal of dermatology 2017 176 pp344-351c 2016 british association of dermatologistsmackowiak.5 the idea that microbes can act as important integral components of the human body received particular attention a decade ago subsequently studies on microbial communities inhabiting various organs have become increas- ingly popular.

in fact they may regulate the development of cellular and histo- logical features of colonized human organs and help to main- tain their proper functions.12-14factors shaping the composition of the skin microbiotathe cutaneous microbiota populates the epidermis and the pilosebaceous unit of human skin.1516 to date approximately 1000 bacterial species belonging to 19 phyla as well as fungal dermatophytes and viral species have been identified as members of this community.15 actinobacteria propionibacterium and corynebacterium species proteobacteria firmicutes staphylo- coccus species and bacteroidetes are the most common represen- tatives of the four dominant bacterium phyla.

in addition to the effects of contact with environmental microbes microbial components of the human ecosystem have also been suggested to play important roles in the maintenance of our healthy and bal- anced states.5253 important questions remain as to whether and how all these changes can affect our body and homeosta- sis.agricultural development urbanization the industrial revo- lution and westernization represent prominent shifts in human cultural development that have resulted in changes in individual lifestyles and most probably in our microbiota.

even though socioe- conomic differences were likely to be small subtle alterations in the microbiome composition were apparent suggesting that geographical and climatic factors may also have some effect.58nonetheless these studies clearly indicate the importance ofwell-designed and large-scale investigation of different popula- tions to further increase our understanding of pan-micro- biome composition.what can we learn about the role of the cutaneous microbiota in acne pathogenesisa balanced interaction between microbial and human cells is important for the maintenance and promotion of healthy functions.121350 microbes can synthesize and release nutri- ents from our food for use by human cells protect us from the colonization of pathogenic or harmful invaders benefi- cially modulate our immune system and even facilitate dif- ferentiation and renewal of certain tissues e.g.
