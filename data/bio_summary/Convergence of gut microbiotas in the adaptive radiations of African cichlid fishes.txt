the two radiations diverged around 55.14 mya from the last common ancestor m. lake tanganyika harbors the most phenotypically and genetically diverse african species assemblage comprising around 250 species currently subdivided into 12-16 tribes mlake barombi mbo is a volcanic crater lake  2 km in diameter hosting a small sympatric radiation of 11 cichlid species .both lakes offer multiple species representatives of main diet categories thus providing a natural setup to explore convergence divergence and repeatability of patterns in microbiota ecoevolutionary diversification.materials and methodssampling and dietwe sampled 19 cichlid species from lake tanganyika zambia encompassing major tribes and diets and 10 of the 11 cichlid species from lake barombi mbo cameroon 115 specimens supplementary table 1. given some inconsistencies in calling dietary categories across literature here we used a standard approach based on food preferences as inferred by published gut content data from for all tanganyika species and from and unpublished data for barombi mbo.

after removal of de novo otus from the original table and rarefaction to 8000 reads the table was input into the picrust pipeline in galaxy functions were predicted according to the kegg orthology.correlation analyses between taxonomic and func- tional diversity were performed with the vegan r package .a-diversity was calculated as shannon entropy converted to effective number of species and faith's phylogenetic diversity phylogenetic diversity whole tree.deconstructing the microbiota phylogenetic and ecological signalsto separate the confounding phylogenetic effect from the main dietary one in affecting the microbiota clustering we used the tanganyika data set for which host phylogeny and stable isotopes 15n and 13c are publicly available 2.starting from the rarefied otu table we retained an otu if present in at least 50 of the conspecifics of at least 1019 species summing 20 total reads and using the median across conspecifics as a proxy per species.

the majority of cichlid species are found in the three great lakes from east africa victoria malawi and tanga- nyika but they also occur in numerous smaller lakes and rivers providing several examples of adaptive radiations at different evolutionary timescales   cichlids have occupied most available trophic niches some species as highly specialized feeders and others as opportunist feeders s 12. their out- standing trophic morphology including jaws teeth body and gut largely correlates with the feeding ecology regardless of species phylogenetic relatedness hence supporting a process of 'ecological speciation' 012. similar ecomorphs have repeatedly evolved through convergent evolution due to the discrete number of trophic niches available andor to a putative ontogenetic-driven canalization of shape variance.given the high genetic similarity among cichlid species  examples of micro- biota phylogenetic inertia are to be expected.

these syntopic species however like other herbivore species in tanganyika show strong niche specialization with significant differences in their algal farms partly due to habitat-depth segregation food contamination alone might therefore not fully explain the observed convergence nor the simila- rities in taxa enrichment detected across lakes especially when considering that such transient component is not under host selection and its distribution across species should follow a more stochastic process mostly reflecting the type of ingesta at the time of capture.

interestingly it also indicates strong cases of microbiota convergence for phylo- genetically distant species confirming previous observations 5. conversely pc2 12 of variance is affected only by a phyloge- netic signal largely shaped by the coordinates of twoconserved discriminatory taxa in the cichlid trophic adaptationwhich taxa and functions do drive the difference in bacterial communities observed across diets here we limited our analyses to species at the extremes of diet range within each lake carnivores and herbi- vores usually more restricted in their diet range while keeping in mind that the definition of herbivory in barombi mbo is less stringent see supplementary information.patterns of taxonomic enrichment between carni- vores and herbivores were strikingly concordant across lakes at all levels supplementary figures 5 and 6. at the taxa level above otu supplementary figure 5 three main observations can be madediscriminatory taxa in barombi mbo represented a subset of those recovered from tanganyikashared taxa between lakes showed a fully concordant pattern of enrichment and 3 most taxa were enriched in herbivores.

the gut microbiota in carnivores was dominated by few and abundant taxa while in herbivores and partly omnivores it distinguished for an increased bacterial richness while converging in key compositional and func- tional features across species beyond host phyloge- netic boundaries.parallel diversification of bacterial community structure following dietary shiftslake tanganyika and barombi mbo are inherently different in geography ecology and timing of species divergence with dietary preferences particularly herbivory which are less marked within the bar- ombi young radiation where they have not yet transformed into exclusive specialization.

shigelloides were the only significantly enriched taxa in carnivores reported by both lakes the species has been previously described in humans with a low-fiber diet  suggesting that it could represent a signature species of carnivores in vertebrates.alternative explanations exist for the observed trends in microbiota structure particularly when considering the unknown contribution of the alloch- tonous component to the actual resident gut micro- biota.

if indeed the gut microbiota acts predomi- nantly as a trophic trait then we might state a few predictions 1 the gut microbiota should largely mirror the adaptation of the other ecomorphological traits of cichlids and examples of divergence and convergence of this trait should occur across species as a function of diet rather than phylogeny2 herbivores should present a larger taxonomic and functional bacterial diversity than strict carni- vores consistently with their additional needs for fiber degradation potential nutrient supplementa- tion and chemical detoxification 3 functional profiles of herbivores should reflect enrichment in the above bacterial functions 4 if these patterns are deterministic and therefore predictable then they should replicate across independent radiations.here we set to test the above predictions using wild specimens from two cichlid radiations the oldest radiation from lake tanganyika zambia 9-12 myr and the recent monophyletic radiation from lake barombi mbo cameroon 0.5-1 myr .

on the other hand carnivores were enriched in more conservative housekeeping functions such as 'replication and repair' 'translation' and 'nucleotide metabolism'.discussionwe built our study on previous findings for a sample of cichlids within a single tribe suggesting a role of diet in shaping the gut microbiota using a much larger sample of 29 species and two lakes here we showed a clear pattern of gut microbiota ecoevolutionary dynamics following diet- ary habits and largely independent from the host phylogeny and geography.

c pc2 shows a strong phylogenetic signal largely driven by the two neolamprologus species neosav and neopul and partly by the two species erecya eretmodini and cypcol cyprichromini unique representatives of two distant tribes.

here we characterized by 16s rrna amplicon sequencing the gut microbiota of 29 cichlid species from two distinct lakesradiations tanganyika and barombi mbo and across a broad dietary and phylogenetic range.

the increased gut microbial diversity observed in terrestrial herbivores compared with carnivores clearly underlines these metabolic differences .at an evolutionary timescale quantifying how much of the extant gut microbiota variation seen across species is attributable to ecological and environmental factors rather than to the host genotype remains a challenge.

such convergence was largely independent of the phylogenetic context as no clear evidence for microbiota phylogenetic inertia was found except for the two neolamprologus species.

in principle such microbiota fea- tures could individually and altogether be used to predict or revise diets for species with unknown uncertain trophic niches.
