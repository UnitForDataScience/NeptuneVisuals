Adjusted multiple logistic regression revealed that sensitization to indoor dust EV high serum anti-dust EV IgG was an independent risk factor for asthma odds ratio OR 3.3 COPD OR 8.0 and lung cancer OR 38.7 19.These results signify that bacteria-derived EVs in the indoor dust are a major risk factor in the development of asthma COPD and lung cancer although further studies should be con- ducted.CONCLUSIONIn the aged society of the 21st century where the life expectan- cy of human being is increased due to sanitization antibioticsand vaccines non-communicable chronic inflammatory diseas- es associated with immune dysfunction have become major dis- eases which determines the life span and quality of life 20.

Whereas over 50 of childhood asthma were sensitized to in- door dust EV suggesting that EVs present in the indoor dust could be an important causative factor in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma 16.

As for the clinical significance of sensiti- zation to EVs in the indoor dust EV sensitization was closely associated with asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder COPD and lung cancer.

Taken together microbial EVs in the indoor dust are an im- portant diagnostic and therapeutic target for the control of chronic lung diseases such as asthma COPD and lung cancer.Keywords Ultrafine particle Particulate matter Extracellular vesicle Indoor dust Inflam- matory pulmonary diseaseINTRODUCTIONPublic concern for fine dust and ultrafine dust has recently been rising due to the influence of the yellow dust from China.

Based on the knowledge that EVs derived from pathogenic bacteria are pres- ent in large volumes in the indoor environment and given that these are important causative factors in asthma COPD and lung cancer it is very important to avoid exposure to these bac- teria and extracellular vesicles as a primary preventive measure against chronic inflammatory lung diseases.

When we consider the fact that the inci- dence of lung cancer is increased in the presence of COPD re- gardless of smoking and the results of animal experiments there is a limit to explain neutrophilic inflammation which is a key pathology of severe asthma and COPD only by cigarette smoke.

The prevalence of childhood asthma in Korea is 5-9 and is gradually increasing the prevalence of asthma in adults has also been rising persistently from 1.1 in 1998 to 3.1 in 2011 4.

Bacteria-derived EVs in the indoor dust caused severe airway inflammation which resulted not only in severe asthma but also in emphysema which is a major cause of irre- versible airway obstruction 16.

Smoking and air pollutants are known to be important in the development of chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma COPD and lung cancer 78.

Moreover anti-dust EV immunoglobu- lin G IgG antibody titers in serum were significantly higher in patients with non-eosinophilic asthma COPD and lung cancer than in healthy control subjects irrespective of age sex or smok- ing history 19.
