Water and coral samples were collected during 2014 and 2015 from three coastal inlets Port of Miami Baker's Haulover and Port Everglades two treated wastewater effluents Miami Central and Miami North two surface boil expressions of oceanic outfalls from treated wastewater Miami Central and Miami North 16 coral reef water sites four reefs with three sites each for surface water and four reefs with one site each for bottom 12 coral polyp tissue extracts four reefs with three sites each and 12 coral mucus extracts  described in detail in supplemental methods.

However the functional states of the coral microbiome show some plasticity adapting to geographical differences and nutrient availability .Anthropogenic impacts primarily in the form of terrestrial runoff also contribute to nutrient loading sediment deposition and the transport of pesticides pharmaceuticals and other harmful chemicals to nearby coral reefs stressing coral communities  .

In this study we used a next-generation sequencing approach to characterize the microbial communities from LBSP coastal inlets oceanic outfalls from wastewater treatment plants and wastewater treatment effluent coral reef waters and coral tissues mucus and polyps among coral reefs off the southeastern coast of Florida offshore of the Miami-Dade and Broward counties.

The goals of this program are to investigate nutrient concentration and transport from LBSPs perform coral benthic surveys of coral cover and health and monitor microbiological water quality of the southeast Florida sentinel coral reef sites used in this study.

Water samples from coastal inlet dis- charges oceanic outfalls of municipal wastewater treatment plants treated wastewa- ter effluent before discharge open ocean samples and coral tissue samples mucus and polyps were characterized to determine the relationships between microbial communities in these matrices and those in reef water and coral tissues.

The results of this study provide new insights into how microbial communi- ties from LBSP can impact coral reefs in southeast Florida and suggest that waste- water outfalls may have a greater influence on the microbial diversity and structure of these reef communities than do contaminants carried in runoff although the in- fluences of runoff and coastal inlet discharge on coral reefs are still substantial.IMPORTANCE Coral reefs are known to be endangered due to sewage discharge and to runoff of nutrients pesticides and other substances associated with an- thropogenic activity.

Geographic differences in the degree of impact suggest that coral mi- crobiomes may be influenced by the microbiological quality of treated waste- water.KEYWORDS coral land-based sources of pollution microbial ecology microbial source tracking next-generation sequencingoral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that play crucial roles in maintaining marine biodiversity and productivity and coastal protection and they serve as a source of food and recreation .

Due to global climate change and other anthropogenic impacts on the coral microbiome   coral reefs have been recog- nized as endangered ecosystems for the last several decades .

We hypothesized that the impacts of various LBSP on microbial prokaryotic and fungal communities in nearby coral reefs and tissue samples would vary as a result of demographic and hydrological differences associated with sampling sites and that the relative degree of source impacts could be determined based on exchange between microbial communities from LBSP and reef waters or coral tissues.

Not surprisingly com- munities from coral mucus showed greater susceptibility to source influence than did the polyp communities most likely due to a more intimate association of the coral mucus with the surrounding waters .
