Several bacterial species approximately equal to the ratio of Gram-negative and Gram-positive species dominated by obligate anaerobes have been involved in the etiology of endodontic infec- tions The prevalence of microbial coexistence was markedly associated with clinical properties and is different in various popu- lations suggesting that specific combinations of species lead to the promotion of endodontic symptomatology If microbiota retain in the pulp cavity after root canal therapy there is an increased risk of a detrimental outcome of the endodon- 1572-1000c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

faecalis can enter the root canal during or between the process of treatment and survive in a very harsh root canal environment that is usually lethal for many other microbiota owing to its properties which include growth in high concentrations of salt a wide tem- perature and a broad pH range In the results of this study the diversity of bacterial communities was decreased after PAD and E. faecalis C. albicans and V. parvula were found in three root canals of a persistent endodontic infection separately.

According to the results of this study micro- bial load combined with microbial composition analysis before and after PAD treatment reflects the at least possible role of recurrence and treatment failure of endodontic infection after PAD treatment which may indicate microbial susceptibility to PAD.

According to this in vivo study the diversity and count of microbiota in root canal-treated teeth were decreased after TBO-PAD so that E. faecalis V. parvula and C. albicans were the microorganisms that recovered after PAD.Conclusion TBO-PAD is an effective approach that exhibited anti-microbial potential activity against microbiota involved in secondarypersistent endodontic infection.c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

albicans 1 33.3.DiscussionThere are more than 600 various microbial taxa in endodontic samples It is generally believed that persistence of microor- ganisms in the root canal of root-filled teeth is the major cause of post-treatment disease after initial endodontic treatment Although there are numerous studies that described the strategies to deal with the appearance of secondary endodontic infections up to now the development of inefficient conventional ther- apeutic methods and emergence of resistance to antibiotics by the organisms involved in root canal infections has led to the develop- ment of a new antimicrobial approach with fewer complications.PAD has gained regulatory approval for the treatment of various diseases and eradication of microorganisms such as oral pathogenic bacteria TBO is one of the cationic blue-coloring hydrophilic photosensitizers that can be used for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria due to its physical and chemical prop- erties and in combination with wavelength-specific laser photonic energy it has an additional antimicrobial effect To the best of our knowledge this is the first in vivo study that has evalu-Fig.

In this study sig-nificant decrease of the microbial load and content of endodontic microbiota after PAD treatment demonstrated that it is the basis for the success of endodontic treatment to indicate the prognosis of PAD treatment.

The maximum time between sampling and laboratory processing was less than 4 h. At the end of sampling the root canal therapy was done by a dentist based on conventional treatment methods Culture procedureThe tubes of transport media containing the root canal sam- ples were strongly vortexed for 30-45 s and serial 10-fold dilutions were made up to105 based on previously described conditions In brief 90 microliter uL brain heart infusion BHI broth Merck Darmstadt Germany was added to each well of round-bottom 96- well microtiter plates TPP Trasadingen Switzerland using the multi-channel pipet and 10 uL of each tube containing sample was transferred to the wells in column one and diluted 10-fold step wise from column one to column five.

No microorganisms in 11 cases and one single microorganism in three cases were found after PAD As the results show the most common bacterial genera recovered from secondary infection of the root canals before TBO-mediated PAD was E. faecalis 35.4 and after TBO- mediated PAD were V. parvula 1 33.3 E. faecalis 1 33.3 andC.

However according to the best of our knowledge no data has yet been reported regarding microbial load combined with microbial composition analysis before and after PAD treatment This is the first systematic culture and molecular methods approach that attempts to assess and evaluate the composition and load of the endodontic microbial community in previously root- filled canals before and after PAD treatment.

Since there is no research to show the pattern of microbial profile before and after PAD we cannot compare the results of this study after PAD with other studies.The difficulty of killing the Gram-negative bacteria using PAD is to be able to achieve the penetration of TBO inside the bacte- rial cell wall with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria playing a major role that is involved in resistance to antimicro- bial agents.
