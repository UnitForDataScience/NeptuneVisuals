taking into account that proteases and anti-proteases are drivers of ptmp and can potentially breach tight junction integrity  the microbial tg becomes a potential enhancer of intestinal permeability thus setting the stage for the next section.increased intestinal permeability the leaky gutthe intestinal barrier illustrates a vast surface of 400 m2 where billions of microbes confront the vastest immune apparatus in the human body.

motility disorders  such as chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction  post-operative ileus in mice  chronic constipation  or fulminant jejunoileitis and infectious gastroenteritis  gastroschisis  and inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn's or ulcerative colitis  intestinal inflammation  and irritable bowel syndrome  are associated with intestinal glial cell depletion malfunction or failure.

table summarizes the factors that protect intestinal permeability and might present potential new therapeutic strategies.table 2. environmental factors that breach tight junction integrity and increase intestinal permeability.

adapted from references --.the enteric systems that receive and transmit messages to the brainthe intestinal glial neuronal bouncer microglial networkafter describing various topics such as the nutritional factors that affect the intestinal microbiome the metabolomic consequences the place of neo-peptide formation by ptmp and leaky gut syndrome it is time to tie together the enteric eco-events and to look for the enteric receptive systems for those luminal and mucosal messages that connect the gut to the brain.

the next section will concentrate on the role of the enteric microglial network in the microbiota-tj-gut-brain axis.the enteric glial rolesthe intestinal local rolesit appears that most intestinal functions are regulated by the ens and due to its key role abnormalities in its formation or functions cause several morbid or life-threatening human diseases.

many of them present gastrointestinal comorbidity .the enteric glial network is an integral part of the intestinal nervous system and the following section will retrench its local enteric roles.multiple functions were allocated to the intestinal glial networkmaintenance of barrier functions -.protect enteric functions by glial cell mediators or by the modulation of neurotransmission and secretion in the gi tract .provide trophic and cytoprotective functions towards enteric neurons .by possessing receptors for various enteric neurotransmitters they are activated by synaptic transmission e.g.

they 'listen' to neuronal conversations.protect local tissue integrity .control gi motility .regulate mucosal secretion .regulate mucosal immunity .active as progenitor cells .protect support and maintain the mucosal neural network .constrain microbiota composition towards increased anti-inflammatory and decreased pro-inflammatory bacterial lineages .modulate epithelial cell proliferation differentiation and healing .defend intestinal mucosa against pathogen invasion .due to its pivotal functions in the intestinal tract when the enteric glial cell dysfunctions occur various gastrointestinal diseases appear.

many more brain affecting disorders where the intestinal microbiome and enteric nervous networks are actively involved are described and are summarized in table .table 4. a summary of brain-affecting disorders where gastrointestinal manifestation exists and the intestinal microbiome and enteric nervous networks are actively involved.diseasesreferenceparkinson's disease- autism spectrum disorder-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis- alzheimer diseases-prion diseases-creutzfeldt-jakob disease transmissible spongiform encephalopathiesadditional conditionsdepression-anxietybehavior-cognition-moodstress-fatigue-agingpotential enteric neuron and glial cell sensing capacitiesthe enteric glial network not only provides structural and nutritional support for the enteric neurons but influences activates or modulates close non-neuronal cells such as enterocytes immunocompetent and enteroendocrine cells.

results tremendous progress has been made in exploring the interactions between nutrients the microbiome and the intestinal epithelium-enteric nervous endocrine and immune systems and the brain.

these are mediated by neuroanatomy represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis represented by the gut hormones immune routes represented by multiple cytokines microbially-derived neurotransmitters and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain barriers.

the role of the central nervous system cns in terms of brain-gut interaction has been considered a significant factor for multiple intestinal functions including motility digestion absorption local hormonal secretion and visceral sensitivity .

more specifically based on the current evolving knowledge the mechanistic pathways whereby the microbiota is influenced and influences the gut-brain axis will be described.potential intestinal eco-events that affect the microbiomenutrients food additives bugs and usmany environmental factors impact the gut microbiome.

nutrition from as early as in utero through the neonatal period and up to adulthood has a profound effect on the shape and trajectory of our intestinal microbiome.

new genetic technologies and bioinformatics reveal the immense influence the enteric microbiome has on our early development intestinal homeostasis behaviors and susceptibility to and recovery from human diseases.

when nutrients enter the human intestinal bioreactor much of human physiology is changed including major effects on the gut microbiota composition diversity and metabolomic product secretion.significant changes in the gut microbiome have been primarily associated with the intake of fiber from fruits vegetables and other plants.
