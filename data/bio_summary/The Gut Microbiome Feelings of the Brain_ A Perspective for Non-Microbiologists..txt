Many of them present gastrointestinal comorbidity .The enteric glial network is an integral part of the intestinal nervous system and the following section will retrench its local enteric roles.Multiple functions were allocated to the intestinal glial networkMaintenance of barrier functions -.Protect enteric functions by glial cell mediators or by the modulation of neurotransmission and secretion in the GI tract .Provide trophic and cytoprotective functions towards enteric neurons .By possessing receptors for various enteric neurotransmitters they are activated by synaptic transmission e.g.

The question arises as to how the enteric nervous system and glial cells sense the foreign antigens the luminal microbes nutritional components or any enteric eco-events and transmit the signals locally and cephalically.Several mechanisms have been proposed for the microbiota communication with the enteric neurons or glial cells  1 The toll-like receptors that the enteral glial and neuron express which represent agonists to prokaryotic components such as LPS viruses and nucleic acids 2 The intrinsicprimary afferent neurons with their numerous axonal processes extending into the intestinal mucosa.

A summary of brain-affecting disorders where gastrointestinal manifestation exists and the intestinal microbiome and enteric nervous networks are actively involved.DiseasesReferenceParkinson's disease- Autism spectrum disorder-Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis- Alzheimer diseases-Prion diseases-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Transmissible spongiform encephalopathiesAdditional conditionsDepression-AnxietyBehavior-Cognition-MoodStress-Fatigue-AgingPotential Enteric Neuron and Glial Cell Sensing CapacitiesThe enteric glial network not only provides structural and nutritional support for the enteric neurons but influences activates or modulates close non-neuronal cells such as enterocytes immunocompetent and enteroendocrine cells.

This is the correct place to state that the gut-brain circuitryis much more complicated since the enteric events exert their effects not only through the nervous network but also channeled through the enteric endocrine immune and metabolic systems .The neurons of the enteric neuronal system contain two types of interconnected ganglia myenteric Auerbach's and sub-mucosal Meissner's plexuses.

Just for anatomicalhistological orientations there are several-fold more glial cells than neurons in the enteric neuronal systems and they dwell in the enteric plexuses intra-ganglionic glial along the nerves in the enteric circular muscle layer intra-muscular glial and in the lamina propria beneath the epithelium in contact with the basement membrane sub-epithelial myofibroblasts and lymphatic vessels mucosal glial .

They respond to changes in luminal chemistry mechanical distortion of the mucosa and their processes thus capable of sensing microbial and other luminal components  3 Bacterial toxins such as cholera E. coli heat labile and Clostridium difficile toxins can directly or indirectly impact enteric neurons to stimulate secreto-motor reflexes that induce human morbidity 4 Microbial polysaccharide and prokaryotic microvesicles can influence enteric neuronal functions 5 Engagement of adjacent mucosal enterochromaffin and enteroendocrine to secret active endocrine or neuro-mediators such as serotonin peptide YY cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide one thus distributing the messages locally or systemically 6 Microbially-derived neurochemicals gamma-aminobutyric acid norepinephrine serotonin dopamine and acetylcholine can potentially reach the enteric neuronglial network activating the corresponding receptors  7 The body bacterial bioactive factories metabolites which act as effector molecules--trimethylamine bile acids phenol and phenol derivatives indole vitamins B12 and K and SCFA--sensed by the sub-epithelial dendritic cells and the neuronal processes  8 Finally the molecular mimicry pathway should be mentioned explaining commonalities of structures between bugs and us.

Adapted from references --.The Enteric Systems That Receive and Transmit Messages to the BrainThe Intestinal Glial Neuronal Bouncer Microglial NetworkAfter describing various topics such as the nutritional factors that affect the intestinal microbiome the metabolomic consequences the place of neo-peptide formation by PTMP and leaky gut syndrome it is time to tie together the enteric eco-events and to look for the enteric receptive systems for those luminal and mucosal messages that connect the gut to the brain.

They 'listen' to neuronal conversations.Protect local tissue integrity .Control GI motility .Regulate mucosal secretion .Regulate mucosal immunity .Active as progenitor cells .Protect support and maintain the mucosal neural network .Constrain microbiota composition towards increased anti-inflammatory and decreased pro-inflammatory bacterial lineages .Modulate epithelial cell proliferation differentiation and healing .Defend intestinal mucosa against pathogen invasion .Due to its pivotal functions in the intestinal tract when the enteric glial cell dysfunctions occur various gastrointestinal diseases appear.

Motility disorders  such as chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction  post-operative ileus in mice  chronic constipation  or fulminant jejunoileitis and infectious gastroenteritis  gastroschisis  and inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis  intestinal inflammation  and irritable bowel syndrome  are associated with intestinal glial cell depletion malfunction or failure.
