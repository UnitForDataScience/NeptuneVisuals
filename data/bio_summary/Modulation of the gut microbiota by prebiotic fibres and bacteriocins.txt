in addition the gut microbiota contributes to homeos- tasis and keeping pathogens away the latter often through a synergy between the microbial activities of the gut microbiota and the immune system of the host .modulation of the gut microbiota has become a promising and important approach to improve host health as it protects the host from infections and diseases and produces important vitamins and scfas.

however in spite of the relatively well-organized structure of the main bacterial groups it is difficult to define the composition of the normal or healthy microbiota owing to the complexity of the microbiota and its variation between and within indi- viduals .interindividual variation is a commonly observedphenomenon in gut microbiota studies .

another possible reason for this alteration in gut microbiota is the frailty or health status of the host during ageing however it is still not clear whether the changes in microbiota are correlative with or causative for the poor health status during ageing .response to environmental factorsenvironmental factors such as host genetics ageing health lifestyle early colonization use of antibiotics and diet can affect the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota .

the cause-and-effect relationships between the microbiota and disease and disorders are not well known such that it is still uncertain whether the changes in gut microbiota are a cause or an effect of the disease or disorder.

the bacterial housekeeping functions involved in metabolic pathways and the putative gut- specific functions involved in adhesion to hostproteins which contributes to robustness in the gut ecosystem .important dietary components for the gut microbiotadietary fibresdiet is a factor for exploitative competition among the gut microbiota providing nutrition for selective groups of bacteria since it may act as a direct sub- strate for the microbiota via its indigestible ingredi- ents and some by-products of digestion.

moreover it modifies the gut microbiota to a certain extent an alginate- containing diet increased the relative abundance of some scfa-producing populations such as roseburia ruminococcus and lachnospira in growing pigs although the overall diversity and the composition of the gut microbiota remained unchanged .

on the other hand the administration of purified or synthesized bacter- iocins via delivery systems such as encapsulated pills or particles has also been developed for food and medical applications .personalized use of probiotics and prebioticsmetabolic and functional phenotypes of the gut microbiota are dependent on the microbiota compo- sition .

individual differences in the microbiota composition can therefore have effects on how drugsand food components  are metabolized and consequently on how the health of the individual is affected.diseases and disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome are asso- ciated with patients who have both a normal and dysbiotic gut microbiota .

this has been illustrated for pro- biotic application by our recent study showing that the effect of probiotics on prevention of atopic der- matitis is associated with the intrinsic microbiota in early infancy .for future development of the aforementioned interventions the personal gut microbiota must be taken into account.

diet prebiotics probiotics antimicrobial agents and faecal transplantation are current strate- gies with great potential to modify and manipulate the gut microbiota.

it has been shown that dietary interventions and long-term dietary habits can shape the gut microbiota in mice and humans .

when the normal gut microbiota is disrupted dys- biosis during disease conditions or during therapeu- tic treatments it can worsen the host condition for example by allowing a bloom of unwanted bacteria or pathogens in the gut .

in this review we will discuss the properties of the gut microbiota and its manipulation to improve host health with special focus on the use of somecontact ozgun c. o. umudepartment of food safety and infection biology faculty of veterinary medicine and biosciences norwegian university of life sciences nmbu po box 8146 dep.
