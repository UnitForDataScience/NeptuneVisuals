these discrep- ancies may have a major impact on patient safety and on the liability of doctors when they prescribe a probiotic formulation made with different processes at different production sites from the formulation which generated the original evidence without properly informing the patients.in cart patients a number of clinical studies conducted with the reference formulation - have reported beneficial effects at the intestinal and neurological levels confirming and extend- ing what previously observed in siv-infected monkeys -.

the fact that the new formulation is now dairy-free means that the growth media for the bacterial strains have been changed and the fact that the manufacturing has been moved from the us danisco dupont to italy cslnutrilinea may well have given rise to genome rearrangements different gene expression patterns or divergent metabolic output .the data here reported confirm previously published reports of a reduction in immunoactivation after 6 months of treatment with the reference formulation with a statistically significant reduction in the percentage of cd4cd38hla-dr t-cells at 6 months median 0.22 iqr 0.10-0.39 compared to baseline median 0.63 iqr 0.35-2.09. these findings reinforce the concept on the beneficial impact of probiotic intervention with the us-made reference formulation on systemic immune acti- vation in chronically hiv-1 infected patients.

in this paper we describe a new approach characterized by a the identification of the metabolites present in the feces of cart patients who had received 6 months' treat- ment with the reference us-made formulation and then b the in vitro comparison for production and metabolism of the same molecules by the us-made the formulation administered to cart patients and the new italian-made vsl3 and c theirbiological effects on a normal rat intestinal epithelial cell line.

dha reduced the viability of streptococcus thermophilus reduced iec-6 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and also led to a lower rate of repair to scratched iec-6 cell monolayer.conclusion our data in conjunction with previously published findings confirm that the new italian-made formulation of vsl3r is different from the previous us-made vsl3 and therefore its efficacy and safety in hiv-infected subjects is still unproven.keywords human immunodeficiency virus probiotics metabolomics gut microbiota vsl3introductionvariability in the manufacturing of probiotics is an unexplored area that is of major concern for efficacy and safety especially if the product is destined for use by individuals affected by seri- ous conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv inflammatory bowel disease ibd or cancer.

stocks of1 g of each vsl3 formulation us-made reference version or italian-made vsl3 were suspended in 10 ml of pbs euroclone wetherby west yorkshire uk and added to iec-6 cell line cultures at 1000 bacterial cellsiec-6 cell at 37degc.

the purpose of the study was to carry out a series of experiments comparing the properties of the us-made probiotic formulation originally commercialized under the brand name vsl3r with those of the italian-made formulation now commercialized under the same name.

the us-made formulation has previously shown beneficial effects at the intestinal and neurological levels in hiv- infected subjects as well as in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and hepatic encephalopathy.methods eleven subjects receiving combined antiretroviral therapy for hiv-1 were treated for 6 months with the us-made vsl3 formulation.

in vitro significant differences in the production and metabolism of dha were found between bacteria from the us-made and italian-made formulations the us-made formulation was able to metabolize dha whereas the bacteria in the italian-made formulation were producing dha.

bulgaricus dsm24734 lactobacillus aci- dophilus dsm 24735 bifidobacterium longum dsm24736 bifidobacterium infantis dsm24737 can currently be considered the reference formulation because it is the formulation with which the most convincing efficacy and safety data were obtained -.

however this formulation is no longer commercially available under the brand name vsl3r in europe canada or some other countries and the brand name is now applied to a formulation manufactured at cslnutrilinea in italy.

this formulation manufactured at daniscodupont usa was previously commercialized under the brand vsl3r but now is available under the brand vivomixxr in europe visbiomer in usa desimone formulation in korea.

while the us-made reference formulation reduced the amount of dha in the medium the italian-made formulation increased the amount of dha detectable in the medium .to investigate the effects of dha levels on the probiotic bacteria growth and metabolism we repeated the experiments by adding exogenous dha at two different concentrations one comparable to the amount of dha previously detected in the italian-made supernatant 0.3 mmoll and the other cor- responding to a doubled amount.

have recently shown that supplementing cart with the probiotic formulation described in the current paper the reference formulation reduces systemic immune activation and improves gut immune restoration and brain function .however not all probiotic formulations are effective and recommended for hiv patients.

this formulation is now no longer available in europe canada and some other countries under the vsl3r brand which instead is now applied to a different probiotic mix that is compared with the reference formulation in the work described here.

we did not utilize the italy-made formulation in our clinical trials.culture conditions bacterial cell counts and metabolome analysisthe sachets containing the two formulations were handled according to the manufacturers' instructions and were opened immediately before the assay.
