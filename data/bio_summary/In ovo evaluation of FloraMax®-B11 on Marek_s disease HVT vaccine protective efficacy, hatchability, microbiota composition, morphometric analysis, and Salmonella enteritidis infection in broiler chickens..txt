MDV as well as SE incidence data were expressed as positivetotal chickens  and the percent recovery of SE was com- pared using the chi-squared test of independence test- ing all possible combinations to determine the signifi- cance P  0.001 for these studies Zar .RESULTSThis study addressed 3 major concerns A whether in ovo administration of FloraMaxQR -B11 mixed with MD vaccine would negatively impact vaccine efficacy in White Leghorn 15I5x71 chickens Experiment 1 B the effect of in ovo administration on hatchability and microbiota composition Experiment 2 and C the im- pact on Salmonella infections and morphometric anal- ysis in broiler chickens Experiment 3.

Interestingly chickens that received the probiotic showed a significant reduction in the in- cidence and total SE cfu numbers recovered from CCT when compared with saline control chickens Table .The results of the effect of in ovo application of FloraMaxQR -B11 on morphometric analysis of the gas- trointestinal tract of hatching broiler chickens of Ex- periment 3 are summarized in Table .

In tri- als 1 and 2 d 18 White Leghorn 15I5x71 embryos were randomly distributed in 4 groups 1 HVT vaccinated in ovo and no Marek's disease virus MDV challenge 2 HVT  FM vaccinated in ovo and no MDV chal- lenge 3 HVT vaccinated in ovo and challenge with virulent MDV vMDV strain 583A and 4 HVT  FM vaccinated in ovo and challenge with vMDV.

Chicks were randomly dis- tributed into 4 groups each with 17 birds in 2 in- dependent trials 1 HVT vaccinated in ovo and no MDV challenge 2 HVT  FloraMaxQR -B11 vaccinated in ovo and no MDV challenge 3 HVT vaccinated in ovo and challenged with MDV and 4 HVT  FloraMaxQR - B11 vaccinated in ovo and challenged with MDV.

Therefore earlier administration of probiotics to embryos can have a profound impact on growth and overall health of the birds.In summary the results of the present study sug- gest in ovo administration of FloraMaxQR -B11 does not negatively affect HVT vaccine efficacy or hatchability of the chickens but improves BW and intestinal in- tegrity during the first 7 d of life while decreasing SE intestinal load in broiler chickens.

The aims of Experiment 2 were to evaluate the effect of in ovo application of this probiotic on hatchability and microbial composition in the gastrointestinal tract of hatching broiler chickens in 3 independent trials.

The results of the effect of in ovo ap- plication of FloraMax-B11QR on microbial composition in the gastrointestinal tract of hatching broiler chickens in Experiment 2 are summarized in Table .
