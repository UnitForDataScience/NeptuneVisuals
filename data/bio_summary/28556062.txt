Most subjects harboured the pathogens at both visits in both treatment groups without differences between study visits.In regard to the bacterial concentrations of the tested bacteria Table 6 a significant reduction of A. actinomycetemcomitans occurredStatistically significant difference between visits p  .016.in both the test and control groups -0.97 1.3 and -1.06 1.3 p  .044 and p  .017 respectively while a significant reduction of T.forsythia only happened in the test group -1.06 1.6 p  .008.

At week 6 however there were no sites with GI  3 in the test group while five were still present in the control group 0.2 and the difference between groups was statistically significant p  .042.

Use of mouthwashes was expressly prohibited.Then subjects were randomly assigned by blocks using a computer- generated list to one of the following two regimensTest group chewing twice per day during 6 weeks morning and night after oral hygiene procedures tablets containing the pro- biotic strains L. plantarum CECT 7481 AB15 L. brevis CECT 7480 AB38 and P. acidilactici CECT 8633 AB30 at a dosage of1.00 x 103 colony-forming units CFUs for each probiotic strain.Placebo group same regimen but using tablets containing the same excipients as the active product but without live bacteria.All tablets as well as the cases containing them were identical and were coded according to the computer-generated randomization list which was only revealed at the end of the study.

A total of 26 subjects per group were needed that after calculating for a potential dropout of 10 resulted in 56 subjects 28 per treatment arm.The subject was used as the experimental unit and the primary outcome variable mean GI as well as the secondary variables was generated at each visit first for patient then for treatment group.

At baseline 401 sites 6.3 demonstrated GI  3 being the number of these sites significantly higher in the test group than in the con- trol group n  263 8.2 versus n  138 4.4 p  .001.

Furthermore there were no subjects in the test group at 6 weeks with a mean GI  1 while in the control group three subjects still presented that level of gingival inflammation 13 p  .080.TABLE 2 Gingival index GI plaque index PlI and angulated bleeding score AngBS expressed as mean standard deviation SD and 95 confidence intervals 95 CI per visit with inter-group and intra-group comparisons by unpaired t test.

In both treatment groups AngBS decreased signifi- cantly p  .001 0.20 0.2 in the test group and 0.28 0.2 in the con- trol group.

Compliance and adverse eventsFrom the whole sample 94.2 of patients took at least 75 of treat- ment 89.7 in the test group and 100.0 in the control group.

Furthermore all subjects in the probiotic group demonstrated gingi- val health as identified with a mean GI  1 at the re-evaluation visitwhile three patients in the control group still shown gingival inflam- mation mean GI  1.The use of mean GI as the main outcome measurement for as- sessing the efficacy of the adjunctive use of new agents for gingivitis management such as probiotics may not be appropriate.

The lack of statistically significant differences in the primary outcome variable mean GI could also be explained by the selection of mild-moderate gingivitis cases instead ofStatistically significant correlation.TABLE 7 Correlation of individual species to number of individual gingival index GI scores  3 and mean GImore severe conditions the possible effect of PMPR the Hawthorne effect or the limited follow-up which may have prevented to evaluate the effect of the probiotic on bacterial recolonization patterns.
