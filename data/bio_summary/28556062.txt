furthermore all subjects in the probiotic group demonstrated gingi- val health as identified with a mean gi  1 at the re-evaluation visitwhile three patients in the control group still shown gingival inflam- mation mean gi  1.the use of mean gi as the main outcome measurement for as- sessing the efficacy of the adjunctive use of new agents for gingivitis management such as probiotics may not be appropriate.

a recent systematic review of rcts reported that probiotics did not affect gastrointestinal motility asrani yoon megill windsor  petrov 2016. however sorbitol which was a component of both test and placebo tablets has been associated with transitory diarrhoea in certain individuals oku  nakamura 2002. this could explain the fact that all patients but one in the control group were able to con- tinue the treatment provided.within the referred limitations of the present investigation it can be concluded that the use of probiotic tablets containing l. plantarumbrevis and p. acidilactic did not lead to significant changes in mean gi however they were able to reduce the number of sites with severeinflammation in gingivitis patients after pmpr when compared with the use of similar tablets without the probiotic strains.
