It is a prospective matched cohort study conducted in Sweden with a recruitment period of 1987-2001 .Durability of weight lossIn the SOS study body weight remained reduced by 16 10 years after surgery while it increased by 1.6 in the matched control group In a prospective Utah-based study in over 1000 obese patients undergoing RYGB weight loss reached 28 up to 6 years after surgery and RYGB achieved superior weight loss maintenance com- pared to control interventions 94 of RYGB-treated patients maintained at least 20 of their initial weight loss at 2 years and 76 maintained at least 20 at 6 years These findings are consistent with a set point change for weight in the subcortical areas of the brain which suggests that postoperatively the subcor- tical areas of the brain are under the impression that patients are 25-30 overweight and thus the body- weight is brought down to the new level where the set point is now established.T2DM prevention remission relapseA prespecified secondary endpoint of the SOS study was the incidence of new-onset T2DM during 15 years of follow-up in a large number of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery vs matched obese controls.

com- paring RYGBBPD to conventional medical treatment in poorly controlled obese patients with long-standing T2DM 50 of surgically-treated patients maintained partial T2DM remission at 5 years whereas 0 achieved complete T2DM remission at 5 years Recurrence of T2DM was observed in half of the patients who achieveda 2-year T2DM remission after RYGB and one third of patients who achieved a 2-year remission after BPD and was unrelated to the magnitude of weight loss.

Furthermore a growing number of recent RCTs in patients with T2DM including mainly individuals with BMI 35 kgm2 have consistently demonstrated superior efficacy of bariatric surgery in reducing weight and lowering glycemia compared to a variety of medical and lifestyle interven- tions -.The aim of this review is to discuss the major patho- physiological mechanisms mediating weight loss and T2DM remission after bariatric surgery summarize the clinical and biological predictors of T2DM remission after surgery and provide an update on the short mid- and long-term effects of bariatric surgery in obese patients with T2DM with a focus on weight loss durability T2DM remission improvement of cardiovascular risk fac- tors diabetes-related complications mortality and sur- vival.

In a three-arm single- center RCT including 69 patients with grade I and II obesity and concomitant T2DM RYGB and LAGB were compared to an intensive lifestyle weight loss interven- tion LWLI at 1 and 3 years of follow-up The gra- dient for weight loss and complete and partial T2DM remission rates at 1 and 3 years of follow-up was RYGBLAGB LWLI Long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in obese patients with T2DMTable summarizes the key findings of major studies investigating long-term beyond 5 years of follow-up out- comes of bariatric surgery in obese patients with T2DM regarding sustainability and maintenance of weight loss T2DM prevention remission and relapse cardiometabolic risk factors micro- and macrovascular complications and mortality.The SOS Swedish Obese Subjects study represents a landmark in the field investigating the short- mid- and long-term effects of surgery up to 20 years post- operatively.

Thus it becomes evident that an early operation combined with better controlled baseline glycemia are expected to be beneficial prompting a need for the early recognition of appropriate candidates for surgery   but this should not be done at the expense of patients with long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes where a surgical interven- tion will likely have dramatic and long-term beneficial effects on glycemia even if complete remission is not achieved.Short- and mid-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in obese patients with T2DMTable summarizes the key findings of major RCTs studying the short- and mid-term up to 1 and 3 years respectively outcomes of bariatric surgery in overweight and obese patients with T2DM regarding weight loss T2DM remission improvement of glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors.LAGB An Australian open-label study in 60 obese patients BMI 30-40 kgm2 with recently diagnosed T2DM compared LAGB to conventional diabetes therapyTable 1 Major RCTs on the short and mid-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in patients with T2DMReferenceStudy populationIntervention Duration of follow-up Major outcomesKey resultsDixon et al.

Authors concluded that bariatric surgery can definitely result in better short-term metabolic control in poorly controlled T2DM patients than high-standard medical therapy but baseline adiposity and weight loss could not predict improved metabolic outcomes.In a similarly designed single-center RCT STAM- PEDE comparing intensive medical treatment IMT with medical therapy plus RYGB or SG in 150 severely obese patients with poorly controlled T2DM baseline HbA1c 9 the percentage of patients with complete T2DM remission HbA1c 6 at 1-year follow-up was 42 in the RYGB and 37 in the SG group compared to only 12 in the IMT group Extended follow-up to3 years post-surgery mid-term outcomes showed T2DM remission rates of only 5 in the IMT group compared to 38 in the RYGB and 24 in the SG group and a significantly lower use of glucose-lowering medications in the surgical groups An important difference in this study was that patients were allowed to stay on oral hypoglycemic agents to allow them to achieve an HbA1c  6 suggesting that the benefit of surgery can be further enhanced with the use of appro- priate medication.RYGB was further compared to IMT in another RCT Diabetes Surgery Study in terms of cardiovascular risk factors including T2DM hypertension and hyperlipid- emia This study enrolled 120 obese participants with T2DM of at least 6 months' duration and poor gly- cemic control.

However the magnitude of intestinal glucose retention after mixed meal ingestion in humans is considered to be too small to induce a clinically relevant improvement of postpran- dial glycemic control.Finally it has been proposed that the increased BA and incretin levels achieved after RYGB may upregulate the metabolic activity of residual brown adipose tissue located in small amounts in the supraclavicular fat depots in adults and even induce browning of white adipose tis- sue leading to a better metabolic state and facilitating weight loss .Clinical and biological determinants of weight loss and T2DM remission after surgeryWith regard to weight loss the preoperative postpran- dial gut hormone responses incretin effect are not prognostic for surgically-induced weight loss Inter- estingly higher baseline levels of the soluble receptor for advanced glycation endproducts sRAGE have been asso- ciated with better weight loss after bariatric surgery RYGB SG LAGB .A large number of studies have tried to explore the best biological and clinical predictors of T2DM remis- sion after bariatric surgery.

In patients experiencing massive weight loss aftersurgery T2DM remission rates are considerably higher compared to subjects with less profound weight loss irre- spective of baseline BMI categorization  suggesting that weight loss per se appears to have a dominant effect.The International Diabetes Federation's definition of optimal metabolic control may be more helpful as the focus shifts from remission to long-term control of all metabolic parameters.

The major complications associated with the remaining types of surgery include physiological dumping syndrome chronic nutritional deficiencies loss of bone density and kidneygallbladder stone formation and mechanical ab- dominal pain anastomotic stenosis side effects .Pathophysiology of weight loss and T2DM remission after bariatric surgeryMetabolic surgery is able to induce and maintain sub- stantial weight loss through a variety of mechanisms including caloric restriction as a result of the anatomical remodelling of the gastrointestinal tract increased meal-induced thermogenesis modulation of hypothal- amic neuronal circuits involved in energy balance and appetite regulation altered taste food preferences and eating behaviour patterns as well as altered gut-brain signalling pathways  -With regard to amelioration of the metabolic milieu leading to T2DM remission the beneficial effects of metabolic surgery are mediated to a significant extent by two important factors the hypocaloric state due to pro- found caloric restriction and the significant weight loss achieved.
