it is a prospective matched cohort study conducted in sweden with a recruitment period of 1987-2001 .durability of weight lossin the sos study body weight remained reduced by 16 10 years after surgery while it increased by 1.6 in the matched control group in a prospective utah-based study in over 1000 obese patients undergoing rygb weight loss reached 28 up to 6 years after surgery and rygb achieved superior weight loss maintenance com- pared to control interventions 94 of rygb-treated patients maintained at least 20 of their initial weight loss at 2 years and 76 maintained at least 20 at 6 years these findings are consistent with a set point change for weight in the subcortical areas of the brain which suggests that postoperatively the subcor- tical areas of the brain are under the impression that patients are 25-30 overweight and thus the body- weight is brought down to the new level where the set point is now established.t2dm prevention remission relapsea prespecified secondary endpoint of the sos study was the incidence of new-onset t2dm during 15 years of follow-up in a large number of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery vs matched obese controls.

furthermore a growing number of recent rcts in patients with t2dm including mainly individuals with bmi 35 kgm2 have consistently demonstrated superior efficacy of bariatric surgery in reducing weight and lowering glycemia compared to a variety of medical and lifestyle interven- tions -.the aim of this review is to discuss the major patho- physiological mechanisms mediating weight loss and t2dm remission after bariatric surgery summarize the clinical and biological predictors of t2dm remission after surgery and provide an update on the short mid- and long-term effects of bariatric surgery in obese patients with t2dm with a focus on weight loss durability t2dm remission improvement of cardiovascular risk fac- tors diabetes-related complications mortality and sur- vival.

thus it becomes evident that an early operation combined with better controlled baseline glycemia are expected to be beneficial prompting a need for the early recognition of appropriate candidates for surgery   but this should not be done at the expense of patients with long-standing and poorly controlled diabetes where a surgical interven- tion will likely have dramatic and long-term beneficial effects on glycemia even if complete remission is not achieved.short- and mid-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in obese patients with t2dmtable summarizes the key findings of major rcts studying the short- and mid-term up to 1 and 3 years respectively outcomes of bariatric surgery in overweight and obese patients with t2dm regarding weight loss t2dm remission improvement of glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors.lagb an australian open-label study in 60 obese patients bmi 30-40 kgm2 with recently diagnosed t2dm compared lagb to conventional diabetes therapytable 1 major rcts on the short and mid-term outcomes of bariatric surgery in patients with t2dmreferencestudy populationintervention duration of follow-up major outcomeskey resultsdixon et al.

authors concluded that bariatric surgery can definitely result in better short-term metabolic control in poorly controlled t2dm patients than high-standard medical therapy but baseline adiposity and weight loss could not predict improved metabolic outcomes.in a similarly designed single-center rct stam- pede comparing intensive medical treatment imt with medical therapy plus rygb or sg in 150 severely obese patients with poorly controlled t2dm baseline hba1c 9 the percentage of patients with complete t2dm remission hba1c 6 at 1-year follow-up was 42 in the rygb and 37 in the sg group compared to only 12 in the imt group extended follow-up to3 years post-surgery mid-term outcomes showed t2dm remission rates of only 5 in the imt group compared to 38 in the rygb and 24 in the sg group and a significantly lower use of glucose-lowering medications in the surgical groups an important difference in this study was that patients were allowed to stay on oral hypoglycemic agents to allow them to achieve an hba1c  6 suggesting that the benefit of surgery can be further enhanced with the use of appro- priate medication.rygb was further compared to imt in another rct diabetes surgery study in terms of cardiovascular risk factors including t2dm hypertension and hyperlipid- emia this study enrolled 120 obese participants with t2dm of at least 6 months' duration and poor gly- cemic control.

however the magnitude of intestinal glucose retention after mixed meal ingestion in humans is considered to be too small to induce a clinically relevant improvement of postpran- dial glycemic control.finally it has been proposed that the increased ba and incretin levels achieved after rygb may upregulate the metabolic activity of residual brown adipose tissue located in small amounts in the supraclavicular fat depots in adults and even induce browning of white adipose tis- sue leading to a better metabolic state and facilitating weight loss .clinical and biological determinants of weight loss and t2dm remission after surgerywith regard to weight loss the preoperative postpran- dial gut hormone responses incretin effect are not prognostic for surgically-induced weight loss inter- estingly higher baseline levels of the soluble receptor for advanced glycation endproducts srage have been asso- ciated with better weight loss after bariatric surgery rygb sg lagb .a large number of studies have tried to explore the best biological and clinical predictors of t2dm remis- sion after bariatric surgery.

in patients experiencing massive weight loss aftersurgery t2dm remission rates are considerably higher compared to subjects with less profound weight loss irre- spective of baseline bmi categorization  suggesting that weight loss per se appears to have a dominant effect.the international diabetes federation's definition of optimal metabolic control may be more helpful as the focus shifts from remission to long-term control of all metabolic parameters.

the major complications associated with the remaining types of surgery include physiological dumping syndrome chronic nutritional deficiencies loss of bone density and kidneygallbladder stone formation and mechanical ab- dominal pain anastomotic stenosis side effects .pathophysiology of weight loss and t2dm remission after bariatric surgerymetabolic surgery is able to induce and maintain sub- stantial weight loss through a variety of mechanisms including caloric restriction as a result of the anatomical remodelling of the gastrointestinal tract increased meal-induced thermogenesis modulation of hypothal- amic neuronal circuits involved in energy balance and appetite regulation altered taste food preferences and eating behaviour patterns as well as altered gut-brain signalling pathways  -with regard to amelioration of the metabolic milieu leading to t2dm remission the beneficial effects of metabolic surgery are mediated to a significant extent by two important factors the hypocaloric state due to pro- found caloric restriction and the significant weight loss achieved.

based on data from long-term trials the median t2dm-free interval after surgery has been estimated to be 8.3 years rygb while t2dm relapse -restarting antidiabetic medication or fasting plasma glucose 126 mgdl andor hba1c6.5- may be observed in as many as 20-30 after initial remission over a period of 6 years  data from a retrospective cohort study in a large number of patients with t2dm undergoing rygb show that up to 70 may experience an initial complete remis- sion in the first 5 years but among these 35 may redevelop t2dm within 5 years after remission the favourable effect of surgically-induced weight loss on t2dm remission appears to be independent of initial bmi.

the gradient of efficacy for the four established proce- dures for weight loss and t2dm remission is bpd  rygb sg  lagb.according to recently released guidelines and recom- mendations metabolic surgery should be recommended in appropriate candidates with class iii obesity regard- less of glycemic control or glucose-lowering regimens and in patients with class ii obesity with inadequately controlled t2dm despite optimal therapy but additionally in patients with class i obesity and inadequately controlled hyperglycemia despite optimal medical treatment.in spite of the well-established role of metabolic surgery as an additional therapeutic tool against t2dm a number of issues still remain to be resolved the lack of long-term efficacy and safety data the incomplete characterization of t2dm remission determinants the paucity of studies investigating multimodal therapies combined surgical and pharmacological interventions and the lack of rcts with diabetes-related hard end- points such as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy cardiovascular disease and mortality.

rcts for these outcomes are warranted.there are no studies investigating the role of multimodal therapy with integration of pharmaceutical and surgical treatment strategies to optimize outcomes for t2dm patients in terms of inducing and maintaining t2dm remission as well as lowering the risk of complications and comorbidities.it is necessary to identify more reliable clinical and biological markers which can be applied in an accurate definition of t2dm remission and cure.cost-effectiveness data are pending.optimal intervention time for a durable t2dm remission still remains elusive.the relationship between the duration of t2dm remission and the incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications remains unclear.conclusionsthe gastrointestinal tract represents a meaningful target to treat t2dm.

studies involving patients with t2dm have demonstrated that caloric restriction to the extent ob- served during the first 10 to 20 days after rygb has the same immediate effect on insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels as surgery  however there is no enhanced incretin effect with caloric restriction alone and it is essentially impossible for people with obesity and diabetes to maintain this drastic restriction for a prolonged period of time.there are also other well-established weight loss- independent therapeutic effects specific to bariatric sur- gery which can be observed in the early postoperativeperiod preceding major weight loss and cannot be reproduced by comparable diet-induced weight loss.

the major pathophysiological mechanisms mediating these beneficial metabolic effects of upper gastrointestinal tract bypass surgery in particular comprise the following ef- fects on multi-organ insulin sensitivity hepatic and skeletal muscle b-cell function changes in bile acid ba composition and flow modifications of gut micro- biota intestinal glucose metabolism and increased metabolic activity of brown adipose tissue whether the effects of surgery and particularly rygb and lagb on insulin sensitivity are totally independent of weight loss remains controversial since a similar im- provement of insulin action has been demonstrated in non-surgically-treated patients losing the same amount of weight under a comparable dietary caloric restriction on the contrary bpd appears to exert uniqueeffects on insulin sensitivity studies have shown rapid clamp-assessed insulin sensitivity improvement after a minimal weight loss of 10 the short- and long- term effects of metabolic surgery on tissue-specific insu- lin sensitivity currently represent a highly interesting field of research.
