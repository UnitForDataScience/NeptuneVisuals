It is also estimated that the genes contained within the human microbiota known as the microbiome are 150-fold greater than those con- tained within the individual human genome Power et al.. Development of the human gut microbiome begins before birth and proceeds in a systematic manner affected by factors in- cluding maternal oral microbiome mode of birth maternal and infant diet and environmental exposures Brown et al.

The great- est change in the gut microbiota occurs in the ratio of certain key bacteria Firmicutes Bacteroidetes mimick- ing the higher levels of Firmicutes seen in obesity Santa- cruz et al.. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines includ- ing IFN-y IL-2 IL-6 and TNF-a also rise in serum adipose and placental tissue later in pregnancy and the mucosal surfaces throughout the gastrointestinal tract re- flect a low-grade inflammatory state Cani et al.

This migration occurs through a mechanism of intestinal permeability sometimes referred to as leaky gut Power et al.. With leaky gut junctions composed of various pro- teins that link adjacent intestinal epithelial cells are weak and fail to act as an integral barrier to migrating pathogens Power et al..

Development of the microbiome occurs simultaneously with and plays a key role in neurologic system maturation Borre et al.

Although the entire gut begins in the mouth and continues to the anus the gut microbiome describes the intestinal portion alone given that the intestine harbors the most diverse and abundant microbial community in the body Backhed et al.

It acts with the liver to detoxify and excrete xenobiotics ubiquitous harmful foreign chemicals present in the environment Mayer Savidge et al.

An individual's systemic and intestinal immune systems depend greatly on the gut microbiome's function of epithelial cell renewal and management of intestinal integrity Power et al.

Increased intestinal permeability is hypoth- esized to be the mechanism by which a dysbiotic gut is linked with low-grade inflammatory disorders like obesity and its associated conditions insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus Mokkala et al.

High permeabil- ity allows the leakage of bacteria andor bacterial compo- nents like the lipopolysaccharides LPS contained in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria thus inducing a delete- rious systemic inflammatory condition called metabolic endotoxemia Cani Osto Geurts  Everard 2012.Immunologic Changes of the Gut Microbiome in PregnancyDuring pregnancy inflammatory states vary from higherinflammation at implantation and in labor to lower levels of inflammation in midpregnancy Trevisanuto et al.

Anti-inflammatory properties exist at the placen- tal bed that protects the fetus from rejection yet the mu- cosal surfaces of the gut and other tissues experience a low-grade inflammation with rising levels of proinflam- matory cytokines and white cells as the pregnancy ad- vances Koren et al.
