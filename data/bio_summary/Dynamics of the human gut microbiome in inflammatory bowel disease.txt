To compare distribution of samples relative to this healthy plane a generalized linear mixed effects model was fit withHalfvarson et al.Page 8a conditional Gamma distribution using disease type as a fixed effect and including a random subject effectTo assess the variation between samples in an orderly manner as described by the time point we measured the UniFrac weighted and unweighted distance between samples that occur sequentially for any given subject samples representing the final collection point do not have a value in these columns as there is no subsequent sample to compare to.We examined the power of differential abundance tests for the 16S data.

Recently the short-term 6 weeks dynamics of the microbiome in pediatric patients with active IBD treated with anti-TNF indicated that initiation of medical treatment changes the microbial composition at the genus level20.Halfvarson et al.Page 5Because we had few anti-TNF exposed patients and our patients received a course of corticosteroids at flare as first line therapy we explored how corticosteroid administration influenced microbiome dynamics.

3.Halfvarson et al.Page 3From the animated ordination of the samples Supplementary Video 1 we observed that although microbiome samples from the healthy individuals varied over time they were restricted to a small volume of the ordination space.

The Random Forests model was constructed using the first time point from each patient in the downstream analysis cohort and prediction accuracy was measured using the subsequent three time points CCD  11 patients ICD without resection ICD-nr  4 patients ICD with resection ICD-r  15 patients UC  30 patients and HC  7 patients.

Devising improved methods to detect the healthy state with non-invasive sampling to predict when the healthy state will be departed and to sustain the microbiome in thisHalfvarson et al.Page 6healthy state by erecting barriers that prevent the slip back into dysbiosis will be an important focus of future work.METHODSCohort DemographicsPatients with CD or UC the two major forms of IBD attending the outpatient clinic were consecutively invited to take part.

Samples from patients with CCD and UC were closer to the HP and some samples did not differ significantly from healthy controls whereas ICD samples were the most distant from the HP Supplementary Video 1 Fig.

To address this limitation of unequal sampling of healthy individuals and IBD patients we compared the volatility of our healthy controls to healthy participants in two published studies the Student Microbiome Project SMP and the Moving Pictures MP datasets617.

These results help guide therapies that will re- direct the gut microbiome towards a healthy state and maintain remission in IBD.Both the state and the dynamics of the human gut microbiome in healthy individuals are highly personalized1-7.

Interestingly in a recent study of obesity covering 339224 individuals the 97 risk loci for obesity accounted for only 2.7 of BMI variation25 whereas the microbiome classified lean from obese individuals with 90 accuracy26 providing precedent for the predictive value of the gut microbiome over human genetics in chronic disease.In summary by analyzing fecal samples collected every 3 months from a large IBD cohort we determined the long-term volatility of the gut microbiome in IBD.

Although cross sectional studies have revealed dysbiosis of the gut microbiome in IBD8-12 little is known about the individual nature of microbiome dynamics in IBD beyond a study of 3 UC patients before and after ileostomy and two small studies of IBD patients in remission or during changes in disease activity13-15.
