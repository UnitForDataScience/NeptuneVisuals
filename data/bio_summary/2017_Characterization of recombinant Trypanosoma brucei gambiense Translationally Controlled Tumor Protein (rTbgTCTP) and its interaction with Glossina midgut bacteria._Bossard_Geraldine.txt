In this scenario lysin sites of the rTbgTCTP protein localized on the 3D structural helix with an outside orientation could play a role in binding to the bacteria membrane thereby impacting bacteria growth as antimicrobial properties.The effect of rTbgTCTPOur results indicate that the effect of rTbgTCTP can either inhibit or stimulate the growth of bacteria from the Glossina midgut and that this effect dependsmainly on the bacterium under consideration the cul- ture conditions and to a lesser extent the protein concentration.

Of even greater interest was the demonstration that this pro- tein can bind to bacteria isolated from the midgut of different tsetse fly species and interfere with bacteria growth despite multiple variations in bacteria strain and culture conditions.Binding of rTbgTCTP with bacteriaRecently Hansenova Manaskova et al.reported on the incorporation of a protease substrate into the bac- terial cell wall.

In this context several studies have already investigated the molecular dialog occurring between the tsetse fly its midgut bacteria and the ingested trypanosomes to iden- tify factors involved in these interactions that could become potential targets to hinder vector competence.Previous investigations have allowed identifying several proteins that are excretedsecreted by trypano- somes.A high number of midgut proteins were also identified as differentially expressed in Tbg-stimulated versus non-stimulated Glossina palpalis gambiensis flies.Similarly numerous tsetse midgut bacteria and trypanosome genes were found to be differentially expressed in Tbg-infected vs. non-infected tsetseCONTACT Geraldine BossardCentre de cooperation International en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement CIRAD Campus international de Baillarguet TA-A17G 34398 Montpellier France.c 2017 Taylor  Francisflies.Among these proteins we identified the trypa- nosomal Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein TCTP for which the corresponding gene was found to be overexpressed in Tbg-infected flies.TCTP is a ubiquitously distributed protein in eukar- yotes that appears to be highly conserved across ani- mals and plants.It has been reported to play multiple roles in cellular processes including cell prolifera- tionthe cell cyclestress responseand apopto- sis and is involved in embryo development.

This protein has been reported to play multiple roles and we investigated its possible effect on bacteria from Glossina gut microflora using a recombinant TCTP from Tbg along with bacteria isolated from diverse Glossina species.

Samples 21 ml were loaded onto a 10 SDS acrylamide gel and after electrophoresis 30 mA for 1 h the protein bands were transferred onto a0.45 mm nitrocelluloseTM membrane Bio-Rad andprocessed as described in section 1.3 to detect the presence of rTbgTCTP.Effect of rTbgTCTP on the growth of bacteria isolated from Glossina midgutsTo evaluate the effect of rTbgTCTP on bacteria growth a solution containing 150 ml of 'Mitsuhashi and Mara- morosch' insect culture medium 50 ml of each bacte- rium pre-culture and 10 ml of rTbgTCTP at different concentrations sterilized by filtration on a 0.22 mm membrane were mixed in one well of a 96-well NUNC Elisa plate.

Regarding the Tbg form of TCTP TbgTCTP the fact that the protein can be excretedsecreted by the trypano- some raises a question about its paracrine role since the parasite develops in the fly gut where several bacteria are harbored some of which have been shown to be involved in tsetse fly vector competence.Here we report on the production of the TbgTCTP recombinant protein rTbgTCTP and its biological effect on several bacterial strains that were previouslyisolated from the midgut of diverse Glossina species sampled in different HAT foci.These results will provide a basis for future research into controlling HAT from the perspective of the trypanosome parasite.ResultsProduction purification and molecular characterization of rTbgTCTPThe sequence of the synthesized Tbg 927.8.6750 gene exhibited a 100 match with the mRNA sequence from the NCBI database AAX80036.1 EMBL-EBI.

As shown in  an rTbgTCTP band lane 4 similar to the rTbgTCTP control lane 2 was only revealed when bacteria were incubated in the presence of rTbgTCTP even though the bacteria were washed 4 times with PBS before being boiled and treated with b-mercaptoethanol.

Thus such approach could open new strategies to improve vector control and the fight against HAT.Materials and methodsGlossina intestinal bacteria strainsThe bacteria that were tested in our study were previ- ously isolated from different Glossina species that were either amplified in the CIRAD's insectarium in Montpellier France or collected in HAT foci indifferent sub-Saharan African countries.

The CBS pre- diction servers were used to predict the post-transla- tional modifications of rTbgTCTP especially the N-linked glycosylation NetNGlyc 1.0 Serverand O-glycosylation NetOGlyc 4.0 Serversites but also immunological features such as Linear B-cell epitopes Bepipred 1.0 Serverand discontinuous B-cell epit- opes DiscoTope 2.0 Server.The PhyML website was used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on dif- ferences in the amino acid sequences between TCTP and several trypanosomatids including Tbg as well as several mammalian and Glossina species.Interaction between TCTP and bacteria fromGlossina midgutsIn collaboration with the IRD-MIO team Marseille France a total of 39 bacteria strains were obtainedfor use in this study.

To test the interaction between rTbgTCTP and the bacteria 5 mg of the pro- tein were added to 100 ml of freshly cultured bacteria displaying an optical density OD of 0.3 at 600 nm to obtain a 0.1 OD to start the growth kinetic for each bacterium tested samples were then incubated 2 h at 25oC.
