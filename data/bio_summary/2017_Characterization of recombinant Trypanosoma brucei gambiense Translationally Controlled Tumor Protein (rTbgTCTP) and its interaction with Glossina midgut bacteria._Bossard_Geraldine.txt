the purified fraction was then loaded onto 10 sds-page sodium dodecyl sul- fate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels after electrophoresis and staining the presence of an intense protein band was shown at 50 kda corre- sponding to the molecular weight of rtbgtctp  lane 2. the presence of rtbgtctp in the50 kda protein band was further confirmed by immunodetection using hrp horseradish peroxi- dase - conjugated anti-histidine antibody  lane 3. the rtbgtctp yield was approximately174 mg per liter of insect cell culture medium with a 95 purity rate bio 1d software.protein structure and sequence homologies with tctp from other organismsfor our 3d structure analysis of tctp only a limited number of tctp sequences were available in the embl-ebi database protein data bank in europe of 3d protein structures.

in this scenario lysin sites of the rtbgtctp protein localized on the 3d structural helix with an outside orientation could play a role in binding to the bacteria membrane thereby impacting bacteria growth as antimicrobial properties.the effect of rtbgtctpour results indicate that the effect of rtbgtctp can either inhibit or stimulate the growth of bacteria from the glossina midgut and that this effect dependsmainly on the bacterium under consideration the cul- ture conditions and to a lesser extent the protein concentration.

in this context several studies have already investigated the molecular dialog occurring between the tsetse fly its midgut bacteria and the ingested trypanosomes to iden- tify factors involved in these interactions that could become potential targets to hinder vector competence.previous investigations have allowed identifying several proteins that are excretedsecreted by trypano- somes.a high number of midgut proteins were also identified as differentially expressed in tbg-stimulated versus non-stimulated glossina palpalis gambiensis flies.similarly numerous tsetse midgut bacteria and trypanosome genes were found to be differentially expressed in tbg-infected vs. non-infected tsetsecontact geraldine bossardcentre de cooperation international en recherche agronomique pour le developpement cirad campus international de baillarguet ta-a17g 34398 montpellier france.c 2017 taylor  francisflies.among these proteins we identified the trypa- nosomal translationally controlled tumor protein tctp for which the corresponding gene was found to be overexpressed in tbg-infected flies.tctp is a ubiquitously distributed protein in eukar- yotes that appears to be highly conserved across ani- mals and plants.it has been reported to play multiple roles in cellular processes including cell prolifera- tionthe cell cyclestress responseand apopto- sis and is involved in embryo development.

regarding the tbg form of tctp tbgtctp the fact that the protein can be excretedsecreted by the trypano- some raises a question about its paracrine role since the parasite develops in the fly gut where several bacteria are harbored some of which have been shown to be involved in tsetse fly vector competence.here we report on the production of the tbgtctp recombinant protein rtbgtctp and its biological effect on several bacterial strains that were previouslyisolated from the midgut of diverse glossina species sampled in different hat foci.these results will provide a basis for future research into controlling hat from the perspective of the trypanosome parasite.resultsproduction purification and molecular characterization of rtbgtctpthe sequence of the synthesized tbg 927.8.6750 gene exhibited a 100 match with the mrna sequence from the ncbi database aax80036.1 embl-ebi.

this protein has been reported to play multiple roles and we investigated its possible effect on bacteria from glossina gut microflora using a recombinant tctp from tbg along with bacteria isolated from diverse glossina species.

the cbs pre- diction servers were used to predict the post-transla- tional modifications of rtbgtctp especially the n-linked glycosylation netnglyc 1.0 serverand o-glycosylation netoglyc 4.0 serversites but also immunological features such as linear b-cell epitopes bepipred 1.0 serverand discontinuous b-cell epit- opes discotope 2.0 server.the phyml website was used to construct a phylogenetic tree based on dif- ferences in the amino acid sequences between tctp and several trypanosomatids including tbg as well as several mammalian and glossina species.interaction between tctp and bacteria fromglossina midgutsin collaboration with the ird-mio team marseille france a total of 39 bacteria strains were obtainedfor use in this study.

this focus on gut microflora was based on the premises that i tctp in vivo excretion by trypanosomes should be accompanied by its release in the gut and that ii at least some portion of the midgut bacteria are involved in tsetse vector competence.first we fully succeeded in producing a recombi- nant tctp that corresponds to the tctp encoded byt.

the protein content of the concentrated eluate was quan- tified using the bradford method pierce coomassie protein assay kit thermo fisher waltham massa- chusetts usa and the purity of the eluted protein was verified after electrophoresis on 10 polyacryl- amide sds-page gels stained with page blue staining solution thermo scientific waltham massachusetts usa.western blot analysissds-page gels were blotted onto a 0.45-mm nitro- cellulosetm membrane bio-rad hercules california usa.

the portions of sequences forming tctp epitopes represent 46 of the total protein sequence when the protein is linearized i.e.

samples 21 ml were loaded onto a 10 sds acrylamide gel and after electrophoresis 30 ma for 1 h the protein bands were transferred onto a0.45 mm nitrocellulosetm membrane bio-rad andprocessed as described in section 1.3 to detect the presence of rtbgtctp.effect of rtbgtctp on the growth of bacteria isolated from glossina midgutsto evaluate the effect of rtbgtctp on bacteria growth a solution containing 150 ml of 'mitsuhashi and mara- morosch' insect culture medium 50 ml of each bacte- rium pre-culture and 10 ml of rtbgtctp at different concentrations sterilized by filtration on a 0.22 mm membrane were mixed in one well of a 96-well nunc elisa plate.

roles of the translationally controlled tumour protein tctp and the double-stranded rna- dependent protein kinase pkr in cellular stress responses.

of even greater interest was the demonstration that this pro- tein can bind to bacteria isolated from the midgut of different tsetse fly species and interfere with bacteria growth despite multiple variations in bacteria strain and culture conditions.binding of rtbgtctp with bacteriarecently hansenova manaskova et al.reported on the incorporation of a protease substrate into the bac- terial cell wall.

at this stage of research it is difficult to determine how certain bacteria strains are sensitive to the presence of tctp while others sometimes belonging to the same species are insensitive to this protein.

flies that are able to elimi- nate parasites ingested while taking a blood meal on an infected host.it could be argued that in the b. mori example the tctp acting on the cell culture is the endogenous protein resulting from the expression of the gene encoded by the insect's own genome whereas in the present study the tctp that is expected to act on the fly cells is an exogenous pro- tein produced and excreted by the trypanosome.

to present the effect of tctp histograms were constructed by comparing for a given experimental condition and for each time the od of the tested culture with tctp at a given concentration with the od of the corresponding control culture without tctp arbitrarily assigned to 100. this pro- cedure facilitates comparisons across all culture condi- tions and times of growth.disclosure of potential conflicts of interestno conflicts of interest were disclosed.fundingthis work was supported by cirad and ird umr intertryp.referenceshocking ks lamerton jf lewis ea.
