The acute phase is necessary for protection but dysregulated chronicity causes tissue damage inflammatory disease.Mediators of resolution of inflammation provide a valuable tool for dissecting the role of inflammation in disease because they predictably and naturally resolve an inflammatory lesion returning the tissues to homeostasis.In a rabbit model of Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis Dr. Van Dyke showed that topical application of a resolvin as a monotherapy reversed periodontitis with regeneration of all tissues lost to disease Hasturk et al.2007.

These findings included the observationsthat colonization and overgrowth of specific species do not predict future periodontitis active regulation not inhibition of inflammation at the cellular and tissue level restores tissue homeostasis in vivo pathogens cannot persist in the periodontal pocket without inflammation control of inflammation restores normal biofilm low-abundance biofilm species orchestrate inflammatory periodontal disease through the commensal microbiota and complement and shifts in early colonizers due to specific pathogens induce inflammatory disease.

Work from the Moutsopoulos laboratory and colleagues revealed that periodontal destruction in LAD1 patients wasnot a result of an invasive infection but represented a lesion of severe immunopathology dominated by the upregulation of IL23IL17 responses.Importantly upregulation of IL23IL17 and related responses has been linked to the amplification of chronic inflammatory responses in various settings and connected with the activation of inflammatory osteoclastogenesis inthe setting or arthritis.

New omics technologies have revealed that the functional signaturesof oral bacteria in dysbiosis during periodontitis progression demonstrate that bacteria virulence genes are modulated by the disease environment.Thus our current understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis as well as its impact ongeneral health can be summarized in 5 pointsDOI 1Department of Applied Oral Sciences The Forsyth Institute Cambridge MA USA 2Division of Periodontology UConn Health Farmington CT USA 3School of Dental Medicine UConn Health Farmington CT USA 4Oral Immunity and Infection Unit National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD USA 5Program for Human Microbiome Research Medical University of South Carolina Charleston SC USA.

The development of 16S ribosomalRNA rRNA gene sequencing opened a new era in periodontal microbiology with a global view of the bacterial species in a sample but it was not until the advent of high-throughput sequencing that the technique became the new gold standard.

The dynamics of these shifts were then discussed in the context of total biomass as there is at least a 3-log increase in load from health to periodontitis.

Questions that still need to be answered include the following What are the main triggers of microbiome shifts Which factors control community stability in health or in disease Are microbiome shifts reversible The audience also highlighted the need for studies to characterize biogeographical distribution of subgingival species.Periodontal Susceptibility in Patients with Single Gene Defects by Dr. Niki MoutsopoulosDr.

The most familiar types of analyses include discrete or hierarchical clustering principal component analysis multidimensional scaling also knownas principal coordinate analysis in the microbiome community correspondence analysis and support vector machines.

The current generation ofthe microbiome analysis relies on these distance-based techniques such as Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance PERMANOVA to build models of association of the microbiome with clinical and experimental variables.Unfortunately PERMANOVA is limitedto balanced designs and assumes an approximately equal multivariate spread of the data over factor levels multivariate homoscedasticity.Dr.
