these findings included the observationsthat colonization and overgrowth of specific species do not predict future periodontitis active regulation not inhibition of inflammation at the cellular and tissue level restores tissue homeostasis in vivo pathogens cannot persist in the periodontal pocket without inflammation control of inflammation restores normal biofilm low-abundance biofilm species orchestrate inflammatory periodontal disease through the commensal microbiota and complement and shifts in early colonizers due to specific pathogens induce inflammatory disease.

the acute phase is necessary for protection but dysregulated chronicity causes tissue damage inflammatory disease.mediators of resolution of inflammation provide a valuable tool for dissecting the role of inflammation in disease because they predictably and naturally resolve an inflammatory lesion returning the tissues to homeostasis.in a rabbit model of porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontitis dr. van dyke showed that topical application of a resolvin as a monotherapy reversed periodontitis with regeneration of all tissues lost to disease hasturk et al.2007.

dr. van dyke proposed that the administration of exogenous proresolving mediators holds great promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases like periodontitis promoting delayed resolution of inflammation as well as preventing the side effects of inhibitors of inflammation increased infections cancer heart disease.microbiome shifts in different periodontal conditions bydr.

since the first reports in the 1960s implicating bacteria as the etiologic agent infectious disease principles used to definethe pathogenesis of periodontitis have come into question based on a series of findings that support theinflammatory nature of disease.

van dyke emphasized that the endogenous regulation of inflammation is mediated by active pathways of resolution of inflammation discovered by charles serhan in the 1990s.clinically it is self-perpetuating and self-limiting mediated by endogenous small lipid molecules called lipoxins and resolvins that bind to specific cell receptors.

importantly local control of inflammation with resolvin completely eliminated the p. gingivalis infection suggesting that inflammation was the driver of dysbiosis.

in vitro studies further demonstrated that bacteria were cleared by the host more efficiently in the presence of resolvins.in summary dr. van dyke concluded that natural regulation of inflammation termed resolution of inflammation is an active receptor-mediated biological process controlled by proresolvinglipid mediators.

the discussion proposed future studies on microbiome shifts from health to disease and potential avenues on the therapeutic resolution of inflammation using resolvins or targeting il23il17.

data from an established animal model of lad disease the lfa-- revealed that il23il17 isthe driving force of inflammatory bone loss in lfa--.

importantly preclinical inhibition of il23 or il17 in the lfa-- model led to inhibition of inflammatory bone loss suggesting that the il23il17 axis may be a reasonable therapeutic target in lad1 disease.based on preclinical targeting of il23il17 in the models of lad1 to date a single patient with lad1 disease has been treated with the monoclonal antibody to il12il23p40 with promising clinical outcomes moutsopoulos et al.

work from the moutsopoulos laboratory and colleagues revealed that periodontal destruction in lad1 patients wasnot a result of an invasive infection but represented a lesion of severe immunopathology dominated by the upregulation of il23il17 responses.importantly upregulation of il23il17 and related responses has been linked to the amplification of chronic inflammatory responses in various settings and connected with the activation of inflammatory osteoclastogenesis inthe setting or arthritis.

new omics technologies have revealed that the functional signaturesof oral bacteria in dysbiosis during periodontitis progression demonstrate that bacteria virulence genes are modulated by the disease environment.thus our current understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontitis as well as its impact ongeneral health can be summarized in 5 pointsdoi 1department of applied oral sciences the forsyth institute cambridge ma usa 2division of periodontology uconn health farmington ct usa 3school of dental medicine uconn health farmington ct usa 4oral immunity and infection unit national institute of dental and craniofacial research national institutes of health bethesda md usa 5program for human microbiome research medical university of south carolina charleston sc usa.
