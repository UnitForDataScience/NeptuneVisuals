Considering the large heterogeneity of IBS we decided to restrict our study to patients with IBS with diarrhea or mixed-stool pattern as they appear to share similar sensory neuro-immune inter- action and are more likely to present with low-grade gut inflammation and similar microbiota compared with patients with IBS with constipation.Although several clinical studies investigated effects of probiotic bacteria on behavior and brain function mostly in healthy individuals our study is the first to show that probiotics can improve depression scores as well as alter brain activity patterns in patients with IBS with comorbid depression and anxiety.MethodsStudy OversightWe conducted a randomized double-blind placebo- controlled single-center pilot study from March 2011 to May 2014.

No significant dif-ferences in number of patients with decreased anxiety HAD-anxiety 2 points were found between the groups at 6- or 10-week follow-up.A sensitivity analysis performed to explore the rela- tionship between depression scores and gastrointestinal symptoms showed that the beneficial effect of BL on depression scores at 6 and 10 weeks was more likely to occur in those patients who reported adequate relief of IBS symptoms B.Secondary OutcomesHAD scores.

We used the HAD scale to identify patients with psychiatric comorbidity which is well validated and widely used in studies investigating IBS as a simple tool to screen for comorbid anxiety or depression.Its psychometric prop- erties may be inferior to clinician-administered rating scales for depression and anxiety but its main advantage is that it does not measure somatic symptomsa strong confounding factor in any study of patients with IBS.

Thus a larger appropriately powered trial with patients with IBS and comorbid depression is needed to verify our data on psy- chiatric and gut symptoms before BL can be recommended in clinical practice.In conclusion BL has long-standing beneficial effects on mild to moderate comorbid depression and it temporarily improves overall symptoms of IBS and QoL.

This was based on the previously established mean clinically important difference for the anxiety and depression score on the HAD scale of 1.3 and 1.4 respectively.Secondary end points included improvement in anxiety and depression scores HAD continuous data anxiety State-Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI IBS global adequate relief IBS symptoms somatization quality of life changes in brain activation patterns fMRI450Pinto-Sanchez et alGastroenterology Vol.

No differences were observed between the groups in baseline characteristics  except for higher HAD-D scores in the BL group .Primary Outcome Improvement in Depression andor Anxiety ScoresAt 6 weeks 14 64 of 22 patients in the BL group had decreased depression scores HAD-D 2 points compared with 7 32 of 22 patients given placebo relative risk RR 1.98 95 confidence interval CI 1.16-3.38 P .04 in the ITT population A.

We have previously extensively investigated the beneficial effect of BL on behavior in murine models and showed that this probiotic normalizes inflammation-induced anxiety-like behavior and hippo- campal BDNF levels.The beneficial effect on behavior was mediated through vagal signaling possibly through release of neuroactive metabolites acting on enteric neurons.Despite accumulating evidence of the influence of microbiota on behavior in animal models data from humans are rather limited.Two studies in healthy volunteers re- ported no major effects of probiotic on anxiety and depression scores.A very recent pilot study in patients with major depression showed that depression improved in both the placebo and probiotic groups although the improvement appeared to be greater in the latter.The only study that directly linked the gut microbiota to brain function assessed effects of mixture of probiotic bacteria in healthy women.

RESULTS At week 6 14 of 22 patients in the BL group had reduction in depression scores of 2 points or more on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale vs 7 of 22 patients in the placebo grouppatterns that indicate that this probiotic reduces limbic reac- tivity.

CONCLUSION In a placebo-controlled trial we found that the probiotic BL reduces depression but not anxiety scores and increases quality of life in patients with IBS.
