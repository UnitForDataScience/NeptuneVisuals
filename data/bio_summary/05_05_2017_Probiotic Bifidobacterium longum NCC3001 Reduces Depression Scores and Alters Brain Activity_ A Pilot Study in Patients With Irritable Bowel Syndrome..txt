considering the large heterogeneity of ibs we decided to restrict our study to patients with ibs with diarrhea or mixed-stool pattern as they appear to share similar sensory neuro-immune inter- action and are more likely to present with low-grade gut inflammation and similar microbiota compared with patients with ibs with constipation.although several clinical studies investigated effects of probiotic bacteria on behavior and brain function mostly in healthy individuals our study is the first to show that probiotics can improve depression scores as well as alter brain activity patterns in patients with ibs with comorbid depression and anxiety.methodsstudy oversightwe conducted a randomized double-blind placebo- controlled single-center pilot study from march 2011 to may 2014. the study was approved by the hamilton health sciencesparticipantswe recruited adult patients with a diagnosis of ibs with diarrhea or mixed-stool pattern rome iii criteriaand mild to moderate anxiety andor depression scores based on the hospital anxiety and depression had scalehad-anxiety or had-depression had-d score 8-14. patients with a history of organic diseases immune deficiency major abdom- inal surgery or a psychiatric condition other than anxiety or depression use of immunosuppressants glucocorticosteroids opioids antidepressants or anxiolytics in regular doses or alcohol or illicit drug consumption were excluded.

we used the had scale to identify patients with psychiatric comorbidity which is well validated and widely used in studies investigating ibs as a simple tool to screen for comorbid anxiety or depression.its psychometric prop- erties may be inferior to clinician-administered rating scales for depression and anxiety but its main advantage is that it does not measure somatic symptomsa strong confounding factor in any study of patients with ibs.

conclusion in a placebo-controlled trial we found that the probiotic bl reduces depression but not anxiety scores and increases quality of life in patients with ibs.

overall the change in engagement of the amygdala correlated with the change in depression scores r 0.52 p .004 e. within the bl group reduced engagement of theamygdala correlated with decreased depression scores r 0.58 p .03 but this was not observed in the placebo group r 0.20 p .46. in the bl group reduced engage- ment of the amygdala was more likely to occur in patients with adequate relief of ibs symptoms than in those without it rr 3.07 95 ci 0.89-10.59 p .03 but this was notobserved in the control group rr 1.5 95 ci 1.00-2.23p .51 e.there was no difference when comparing response to fearful versus neutral faces.inflammatory markers neurotransmitters and bdnf levels.

after treatment there were no significant differences on had-d scores when assessed as a continuous outcome between the 2 groups  but when adjusting for baseline differences a greater improvement was found in the bl group ancova p .049. anxiety scores assessed as a continuous outcome were similar between the 2 groups .ibs symptoms.

its pathophysiology is incompletely understood but is considered to be a disorder of gut-brain interactionand is frequently accompanied by psychiatric disorders.accumulating evidence suggests that commensal bacte- ria play a role in ibs as multiple studies have demonstrated an abnormal composition or metabolic activity of gut microbiota in patients with ibs.

ibs symptoms and signs were assessed by the birmingham ibs score and bristol stool scale.

to evaluate an overall improvement of ibs symptoms patients were asked a validated question over the past week have you had adequate relief of your ibs symp- toms with a dichotomous option for responses.
