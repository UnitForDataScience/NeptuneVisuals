.Bacterial T3SS genes in the rumen are associated with unidentified Proteobacteria and the genus SuccinivibrioTo identity the origin of the T3SS genes found in the rumen metagenome and metatranscriptome sequences we screened for contigs containing these genes and a total of 101 genes were found on the 73 contigs retrieved.

Peaks were detected with a flame ionization detector identified by comparison with standards and integrated with Hewlett-Packard ChemStation software version 4.02.Animal ethics approvalThe collections of rumen contents from sheep were car- ried out under the approval of the AgResearch Ltd Grass- lands Animal Ethics Committee Approval 13606.Consent to participate and publishNot applicable.ResultsT3SS genes and transcripts are enriched in HMY animals The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data generated from rumen samples collected from LMY and HMY sheep were analysed by sPLS and the WRS test and 60 genes and 36 transcripts were significantly BH corrected P  0.05 more abundant in the HMY animals in both analyses Addi- tional file .

Further searches for T3SS KOs in bacteria isolated from the rumen showed that T3SS genes were also present in Succinimonas amylolytica DSM 2873 type III secretion genes yscC J LFoldN R S T U and V and Desulfotomaculum ruminis DSM 2154 yscN ATP synthase type III secretion protein N EC3.6.3.14 but in no other rumen bacteria.Analysis of the scaffold sequences of the draft genomes ofS.

Here the microbiomes of HMY animals have been analysed and we report the unusual finding that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial T3SS genes are positively correlated with HMY in sheep.The enrichment of T3SS genes in rumen metagenome sequences from HMY animals is surprising as T3SSs are uncommon in the rumen microorganisms that have been characterised to date.

Most of these genes could not be assigned phylogenetically but several were affiliated with the genus Succinivibrio and genes encoding complete T3SSs were found in the genome sequences of S. dextrinosolvens strains H5 22B and ACV-10 and another rumen succinate-pro- ducing rumen bacterium Succinimonas amylolytica.

The effect of S. dextrinosolvens strain H5 growth on methane formation by rumen methanogens was explored using co-cultures.Results Detailed analysis of the rumen microbiomes of high methane yield sheep shows that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial type III secretion system genes are positively correlated with methane yield in sheep.

Here we report the analysis of the rumen microbiomes of HMY animals and report the finding that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial type III secretion system T3SS genes are positively cor- related with HMY in sheep.MethodsStudy aim and designThis report is part of a larger study  the aim of which was to characterise the rumen microbiomes of sheep which differed in their methane yield g CH4kg DMI day to investigate whether there were corresponding differences in microbial communities and in gene and transcript abundances that could explain the animal methane phenotype.

Most of the bacterial type III secretion system genes could not be assigned to a particular bacterial group but several genes were affiliated with the genus Succinivibrio and searches of bacterial genome sequences found that strains of S. dextrinosolvens were part of a small group of rumen bacteria that encode this type of secretion system.

Subsequent analyses concen- trated on KEGG gene sets or gene categories supported by two or more methods of analysis.Read extraction and assemblyTo gain an overview of the taxonomic origin of bacterial T3SS genes we reassembled these genes based on raw reads and contigs from existing assemblies with hits to any of the KEGG genes encoding for the relevant subu- nits K03219 K03221-K03230 K04056-K04059 fromboth metagenome and metatranscriptome data.

Microorganisms in the rumen also contribute to the methane yield phenotype and differences between HMY and LMY sheep in rumen microbiome composi- tion  and methanogen gene expression  have been reported.
