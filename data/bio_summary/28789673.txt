here the microbiomes of hmy animals have been analysed and we report the unusual finding that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial t3ss genes are positively correlated with hmy in sheep.the enrichment of t3ss genes in rumen metagenome sequences from hmy animals is surprising as t3sss are uncommon in the rumen microorganisms that have been characterised to date.

most of these genes could not be assigned phylogenetically but several were affiliated with the genus succinivibrio and genes encoding complete t3sss were found in the genome sequences of s. dextrinosolvens strains h5 22b and acv-10 and another rumen succinate-pro- ducing rumen bacterium succinimonas amylolytica.

the effect of s. dextrinosolvens strain h5 growth on methane formation by rumen methanogens was explored using co-cultures.results detailed analysis of the rumen microbiomes of high methane yield sheep shows that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial type iii secretion system genes are positively correlated with methane yield in sheep.

here we report the analysis of the rumen microbiomes of hmy animals and report the finding that gene and transcript abundances of bacterial type iii secretion system t3ss genes are positively cor- related with hmy in sheep.methodsstudy aim and designthis report is part of a larger study  the aim of which was to characterise the rumen microbiomes of sheep which differed in their methane yield g ch4kg dmi day to investigate whether there were corresponding differences in microbial communities and in gene and transcript abundances that could explain the animal methane phenotype.

most of the bacterial type iii secretion system genes could not be assigned to a particular bacterial group but several genes were affiliated with the genus succinivibrio and searches of bacterial genome sequences found that strains of s. dextrinosolvens were part of a small group of rumen bacteria that encode this type of secretion system.

this study is part of a larger program characterising the rumen microbiomes of sheep which vary naturally in methane yield g ch4kg dmday and aims to define differences in microbial communities and in gene and transcript abundances that can explain the animal methane phenotype.methods rumen microbiome metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data were analysed by gene set enrichment sparse partial least squares regression and the wilcoxon rank sum test to estimate correlations between specific kegg bacterial pathwaysgenes and high methane yield in sheep.

the effects of s. dextrinosolvens on the growth of rumen methanogens in co-cultures indicate that bacteria- methanogen interactions are important modulators of methane production in ruminant animals.keywords rumen methane bacterial type iii secretion succinivibriocorrespondence 1 agresearch limited grasslands research centre tennent drive palmerston north 4442 new zealandfull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec the authors 2017. this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license  which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.

microorganisms in the rumen also contribute to the methane yield phenotype and differences between hmy and lmy sheep in rumen microbiome composi- tion  and methanogen gene expression  have been reported.

none of the ruminal strains of sharpea or the human gut organism akker- mansia mucinophila the only genome available from a member of the phylum verrucomicrobia isolated from a gut environment contained t3ss gene homologues therefore it is likely that the t3ss assigned to these gen- era by megan belong to unidentified ruminal species.from examination of their draft genome sequences strains of the rumen bacterial species s. dextrinosolvens appear to encode complete t3ss and along with suc- cinimonas amylolytica are the only two characterised rumen bacteria that have this type of secretory system.s.

the hmy phenotype in sheep is thought to be related to rumen size particle retention time and turnover rate such that hmy ani- mals have a larger rumen which retains feed particles for longer and therefore have a slower turnover rate.
