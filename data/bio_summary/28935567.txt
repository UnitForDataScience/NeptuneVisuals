an increase in fecal concentration of cholesterol could be due to an increase in cholesterol excretion by hosts upon administration of l. fermentum ftdc 8312. this may be attributed to several possible mechanisms one notably via binding of cholesterol to the cell surface and incorporation of choles- terol into cellular membranes of l. fermentum ftdc 8312. these bound cholesterol or incorporated cholesterol are less available to be absorbed into the enterohepatic circulation thus leading to increased excretion of cholesterol in feces and reduced serum cholesterol in mice.

no sig- nificant difference was observed for serum tg levels of mice on the ftdc 8312 jcm 1173 and control diets d. these factors have contributed to a decrease in atherogenic indices tchdl-c of mice on the ftdc 8312 diet compared to those on the control diet e. nevertheless the ftdc 8312 diet also decreased the ratio of apo- b100apoa1 f as shown by an increased apoa1 level 35.01 and a decreased apob100 level 18.74 compared to those on the control diet g.determination of cholesterolphospholipids cp ratio and morphology of rbcthe cp ratio of rbc from mice on the ftdc 8312 diet after 7 weeks was lower to those on the control and jcm 1173 diets a. a higher ratio of cp in the rbc membrane of mice on the control and jcm 1173 diets after 7 weeks also contributed to an increase in the number of spur rbc compared to mice on the ftdc 8312 diet b.fecal lipid contentsthere was an increase in fecal tc a tg b and total bile acid c levels for mice on the ftdc 8312 diet compared to those on the control and jcm 1173 diets.

wepostulate that oscillospira may have enzymatic activities that played a role in fecal bile or cholesterol excretion leading to reduced blood cholesterol level via utilization of cholesterol to replace bile lost via the enterohepatic route.

upon induction of hypercholesterolemia where serum cholesterol levels doubled in comparison to their initial serum cholesterol levels they were then divided randomly into three groups of nine mice each 1 the control group hfd  400 ml phosphate buffer saline pbs 0.01 m ph 7.42 the ftdc 8312 group hfd  400 ml pbs containing l. fermentum ftdc 8312 109 cfuml and 3 the jcm 1173 group hfd  400 ml pbs containing l. fermentum jcm 1173 109 cfuml.

a decreased ratio of cholesterol and phospholipids cp was also observed for mice fed with ftdc 8312 leading to a decreased number of spur red blood cells rbc formation in mice.

this was due to a decreased ratio of apob100apoa1 as shown by increased apoa1 levels and decreased apob100 levels in mice fed with ftdc 8312. additionally the con- centration of fecal cholesterol triglycerides and total bile acids were also increased in mice fed with ftdc after 7 weeks.

all serum samples were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at-80 degc until further analysis and rbc samples were processed for immediate analyses.serum lipid and lipoprotein analysesserum total cholesterol tc and triglycerides tg were measured using enzymatic assay kits cholesterol chod-pap biolabo maizy france and trigycerides gpo biolabo maizy france respectively.

the cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations were determined using cholesterol chod-pap biolabo maizy france and phospholipids biolabo maizy france assay kits.

we postulate that via reducing circulating serum lipid and cholesterol by ftdc 8312 less lipid and cholesterol were available for incorporation into the rbc membrane and thus reducing spur cell formation.a high abundance of akkermansia spp.

therefore these cholesterol-reducing bacteria might have exhibited their hypocholes- terolemic effect in mice subsequently reducing serum cholesterol le- vels.
