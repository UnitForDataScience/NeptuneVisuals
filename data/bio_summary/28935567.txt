These bound cholesterol or incorporated cholesterol are less available to be absorbed into the enterohepatic circulation thus leading to increased excretion of cholesterol in feces and reduced serum cholesterol in mice.

No sig- nificant difference was observed for serum TG levels of mice on the FTDC 8312 JCM 1173 and control diets d. These factors have contributed to a decrease in atherogenic indices TCHDL-C of mice on the FTDC 8312 diet compared to those on the control diet e. Nevertheless the FTDC 8312 diet also decreased the ratio of apo- B100apoA1 f as shown by an increased apoA1 level 35.01 and a decreased apoB100 level 18.74 compared to those on the control diet g.Determination of cholesterolphospholipids CP ratio and morphology of RBCThe CP ratio of RBC from mice on the FTDC 8312 diet after 7 weeks was lower to those on the control and JCM 1173 diets a.

A higher ratio of CP in the RBC membrane of mice on the control and JCM 1173 diets after 7 weeks also contributed to an increase in the number of spur RBC compared to mice on the FTDC 8312 diet b.Fecal lipid contentsThere was an increase in fecal TC a TG b and total bile acid c levels for mice on the FTDC 8312 diet compared to those on the control and JCM 1173 diets.

A decreased ratio of cholesterol and phospholipids CP was also observed for mice fed with FTDC 8312 leading to a decreased number of spur red blood cells RBC formation in mice.

Upon induction of hypercholesterolemia where serum cholesterol levels doubled in comparison to their initial serum cholesterol levels they were then divided randomly into three groups of nine mice each 1 the control group HFD  400 mL phosphate buffer saline PBS 0.01 M pH 7.42 the FTDC 8312 group HFD  400 mL PBS containing L. fermentum FTDC 8312 109 CFUmL and 3 the JCM 1173 group HFD  400 mL PBS containing L. fermentum JCM 1173 109 CFUmL.

Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-C and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C were determined using HDL and LDL VLDL cholesterol assay kit Abcam Cambridge MA USA.

Wepostulate that Oscillospira may have enzymatic activities that played a role in fecal bile or cholesterol excretion leading to reduced blood cholesterol level via utilization of cholesterol to replace bile lost via the enterohepatic route.

All data were expressed as mean - standard error of means with n  9 the numbers of samples for each group.ResultsWeight and feed intakeBody weight gain total food intake and food efficiency were similar among all of the mice on the 8312 JCM 1173 and control diets .Lipid profilesFig 2. a Ratio of CP contents in the RBC membrane of hypercholesterolemia-induced mice before week 0 and after probiotic treatment week 7 b RBC morphology of control group during A week 0 and B week 7 of feeding trial FTDC 8312 group duringC week 0 and D week 7 of feeding trial and JCM 1173 group during E week 0 andF week 7 of feeding trial.
