Hence this study recommends the screening of vaginal flora as a routine for all women especially in women undergoing infertility treatment and also suggests the importance of vaginal culture and sensitivity in routine practice.keywords High vaginal swab Lactobacilli Nugent's scoring systemINTRODUCTIONThe vaginal ecosystem is highly complex normally colonized with mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that play a major role in women's health 1-3.

The composition of the vaginal ecosystem is not static exposure to any endogenous and exogenous influences such as antibiotics vaginal medications systemic hormones contraceptive preparations douches frequency of sexual intercourse vaginal deodorants stress levels and poor socio-economic status causes fluctuation in local environment and heighten or diminish specific vaginal microbes or alters the VF over a period of time 12.

In addition knowledge regarding the fluctuations of the vaginal microbiota due to factors such as menstrual cycle concomitant infections other stress history of contraception and vaginal cleansing habits are required for analysing the significant shifts in the vaginal microbiota and also identification of the VF pattern is essential which helps in better interpretation 344556.

The role of vaginal microbiome in infertility is not clear and need to be explored further.Aim To compare the vaginal flora and analyse the incidence of asymptomatic vaginosis among healthy women and in women with infertility problems.Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of six months at Sri Lakshmi Narayana Medical College and Hospital Puducherry India.

Moreover the misjudgment of vaginal complaints is rather high and the diagnosis of vaginal infections is not correctly used.

Comparative Study on the Vaginal FloraDOI 10.7860JCDR201728296.10417and Incidence of Asymptomatic Vaginosis among Healthy Women and in Women with Infertility Problems of Reproductive AgeGeethavani BaBu1 BalaMuru Ganvelu SinGaravelu2 r SrikuMar3 SreenivaSalu v reddy4 afraa kokan5ABSTRACTIntroduction The normal vaginal flora is highly complex dominated by lactobacilli of doderlein that plays a vital role in maintaining the women's health and inhibits other pathogenic microorganisms.

Fluctuation in local environment or exposure to any exogenous and endogenous sources changes the vaginal flora over a period of time.

Disruption of the vaginal ecosystem changes the microflora of the healthy vagina altering the pH and predisposing to lower reproductive tract infections.

A total of 200 high vaginal swabs were collected from Group 1 which included 84 healthy women with regular menstrual cycles without any gynaecological disorder and from Group 2 116 women with infertility problems attending fertility clinic within the age groupof 18 to 45 years.

The smear was also graded using Nugent scoring system.Results The vaginal flora of Group 1 was dominated byLactobacillus 40 27.8  followed by Micrococcus 22 15.3 Enterococcus 16 11.1 Coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp.
