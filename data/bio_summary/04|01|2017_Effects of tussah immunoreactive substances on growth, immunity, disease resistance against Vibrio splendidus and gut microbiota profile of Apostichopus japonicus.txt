The level of SOD activity decreased significantly P  0.05 for all sea cucumbers one day after V. splendidus challenge but sea cucumbers that were fed with the diet containing 2.0 TIS still exhibited significantly higher SOD activity than that of the group fed with the control diet.The level of ACP activity in the coelomic fluid of sea cucumbers fed with TIS diet appeared to increase compared to those fed with the control diet .

However the group fed with 2.0 TIS diet still maintained a significantly higher concentration of C3 than the antibiotic group.Intestinal micro flora countsThe number of Bacillus in the gut of sea cucumbers fed with TIS diets all increased compared to those fed with the control diet but only the increase exhibited by the 1 and 2 TIS were significant.

Within groups LSZ activity was significantly P  0.05 increased 24 h after exposure to V. splendidus.Sea cucumbers fed with TIS diet exhibited significant P  0.05 increase in SOD activity compared to those fed with the control diet .

One day after V. splendidus challenge ACP activity in all sea cucumbers underwent significant decreases with the control group showing the lowest activity while the 0.5 and1.0 TIS groups as well as the antibiotic group still maintained a significantly P  0.05 higher level of activity than the control group.Sea cucumbers fed with TIS diets exhibited a significantly P  0.05 higher level of ALP activity than those fed with the control diet .

How- ever after V. splendidus challenge only the 1.0 TIS group exhibited significant P  0.05 increase in CAT activity relative to the control group.Sea cucumbers fed with 0.5 or 2.0 TIS diet or the antibiotic group exhibited significant P  0.05 increase in the concentration of C3 relative to those fed with the control diet .

The proportion of Vibrio in sea cucumbers fed with 1 TIS diet decreased by 67compared to the control group.Table 6Specific growth rate SGR of Apostichopus japonicus fed with four different diets.

Sea cucumbers fed with TIS diets showed significantly P  0.05 enhanced growth performance compared to those fed with the control diet as shown by increases in SGR .

The specific growth rate SGR of TIS-fed sea cucumbers was significantly enhanced whereas no significant difference in SGR was observed between those soaked in antibiotics and those fed with basal diet only.

Intestinal micro flora counts and high-throughput sequencing showed that dietary TIS could improve the amount of probiotic bacteria yielding a 6-fold increase in Bacillus and 10-fold increase in Lactobacillus for sea cucumbers fed with 2.0 TIS diet compared to the control.

Furthermore TIS-containing diet also greatly reduced the number of harmful bacteria with the number of Vibrio in sea cucumbers fed with 1TIS diet decreased by 67 compared to the control.
