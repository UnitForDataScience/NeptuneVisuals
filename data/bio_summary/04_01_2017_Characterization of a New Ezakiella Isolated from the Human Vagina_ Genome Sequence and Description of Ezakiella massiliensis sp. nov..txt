Strain Marseille-P2951T is non-motile and non-spore forming and exhibits catalase and oxidase activi- ties.

Biochemical tests were performed using API ZYM API 20A and API 50CH strips bioMerieux Marcy l'Etoile France.Growth ConditionsTo determine optimal growth the strain Marseille-P2951T was cultivated on Columbia agar with 5 sheep blood bio- Merieux and incubated at different temperatures in aerobicanaerobic and microaerophilic atmospheres  .

The salinity and pH conditions were also tested  .Cellular Fatty Acid AnalysisCellular fatty acid methyl ester FAME analysis was per- formed by Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry GC MS. Strain Marseille-P2951T was grown on Columbia agar bioMerieux.

A spectral database search was per- formed using MS Search 2.0 operated with the Standard Reference Database 1A NIST Gaithersburg USA and the FAMEs mass spectral database Wiley Chichester UK.Antibiotic Susceptibility TestingAmoxicillin benzylpenicillin ceftriaxone imipenem met- ronidazole and vancomycin were used to test antibiotic sus- ceptibility of strain Marseille-P2951T.

The minimal inhibi- tory concentrations MICs were then determined using E-test gradient strips bioMerieux  .DNA Extraction Genome Sequencing and AssemblyAfter a pre-treatment of 2 h with lysozyme incubation at 37 degC genomic DNA gDNA of strain Marseille-P2951T was extracted on the EZ1 biorobot Qiagen with the EZ1 DNA tissue kit.

The genome of strain Marseille-P2951T was compared to those of closest species.

As this value was 98.7 recommended to delim- ited a species   the strain Marseille-P2951T was clas- sified as a new species named Ezakiella massiliensis sp.
