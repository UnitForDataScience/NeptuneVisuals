as suggested if the 16s rrna gene sequence similarity value was 98.7 the strain was defined as a new species  .phylogenetic treeall species from the same order of the new species were retrieved and 16s sequences were downloaded from ncbi.

as this value was 98.7 recommended to delim- ited a species   the strain marseille-p2951t was clas- sified as a new species named ezakiella massiliensis sp.

the similarity of its 16s rrna gene sequence less than the threshold delineated to distinguish a new species the difference in the gc con- tent the agios values and the ggdc values to 70 con- firmed that strain marseille-p2951t is a distinct species than ezakiella peruensis.

also culturomics concepts enabled the culture of new bacte- rial species such as vaginella massiliensis  olegusella massiliensis  murdochiella vaginalis  and ezakiella massiliensis reported in this paper.ezakiella massiliensis strain marseille-p2951t is a newmember of the genus ezakiella.
