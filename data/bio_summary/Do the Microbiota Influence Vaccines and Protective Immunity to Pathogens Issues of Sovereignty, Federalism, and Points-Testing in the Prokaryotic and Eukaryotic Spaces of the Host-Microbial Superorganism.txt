It is also a time when the microbiota is unstable with both immune responses and the microbiota composition being tuned by transferred maternal antibodies Rogieret al.

For safety especially in view of the inevitability of longer-term genetic recombina- tion either the systems will have to be transitory or there will need to be excellent switches to eliminate aberrant responses.PROSPECTSI have advanced the view that there are impor- tant differences between manipulating the im- mune system to eliminate the bloom of an in-fectious pathogen in which the immune system is trying to secure sovereignty of central tissues and using the federalism of persistent host-mi- crobial interactions for the same ends when mucosal immune responses are to a large extent gardening the microbiota to maintain mutual- ism.Manipulating the microbiota is in itself a multidimensional problem of community structures and dietary conditions.

Do the Microbiota Influence Vaccines and Protective Immunity to PathogensIssues of Sovereignty Federalism and Points-Testing in the Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Spaces of theHost-Microbial SuperorganismAndrew J. MacphersonMaurice Mu ller Laboratories DKF Universitatsklinik fu r Viszerale Chirurgie und Medizin UVCM Inselspital University of Bern 3010 Bern SwitzerlandCorrespondence In contrast to live attenuated vaccines which are designed to induce immunity through a time-limited bloom in systemic tissues the microbiota is a persistent feature of body surfaces especially the intestine.

The immune responses to the microbiota are idiosyncratic depend- ing on the niche intimacy of different taxa and generally adapt the host to avoid overgrowth and maintain mutualism rather than to eliminate the organisms of that taxon.

Immune responses to those members of the microbiota mutually adapted to intimate association at mucosal surfaces have attractive potential durability but for clinical use as persistent vehicles they would require personalization and engineered reversibility to manage the immune context and complications in individual human subjects.Editors Shane Crotty and Rafi AhmedAdditional Perspectives on Immune Memory and Vaccines Great Debates available at Copyright  2018 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press all rights reserved doi 10.1101cshperspect.a029363 Cite this article as Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 201810a0293631A.J.

Yet this is in a setting in which we have good information thatthe benefits vastly outweigh the risks.In this essay I shall take the microbiota as meaning the stable consortia of microbes at body surfaces and not transitory or undefined changes associated with the consumption of preparations with limited evidence for biomed- ical effectiveness.

Taking the yardstick of live organisms the permanence of the microbiota has huge durable potential for delivering health benefits.

Whether the risks are reasonable will depend on the clinical situation An adult patient re- quiring salvage treatment from tumor in relapse or treatment of intractable inflammatory bowel disease contrasts considerably with manipulat- ing the microbiota of a healthy baby.FEDERALISM RATHER THAN SOVEREIGNTYIn these days of Brexit British exit and the political suggestions of building walls along borders let us start with biological sovereignty.

Of course at first sight there is a fair distinction between the living spaces of the predominantlyprokaryotic microbiota and those of the eukary- otic cells of the host.

2011 which themselves have extensive mutual signaling properties effectively provide cross-governance between the microbiota and its host.
