the study design and procedures of the study were carried out in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki.additionally a total number of 503 matched case-control pairs were included in the study biodiva utiliz- ing the diabnorth diabetes registry to form a study nested within the vasterbotten intervention programme vip cohort which is one of the sub-cohorts of the northern sweden health and disease study nshds.

a particular strength of our study is that we were able to find a suggestive association between indolepropionic acid and the incidence of t2d among finnish men in a small sub-sample of the metsim study and finally to replicate the inverse association of indolepropionic acid with t2d risk in an independent study in a swedish men and women.

due to the interrelation among gut microbiota low-grade inflammation and t2d we exam- ined if circulating levels of hscrp would be related with indolepropionic acid or the lipid metabolites associated with t2d risk and either di30 or matsuda isi during the follow-up.serum hscrp was negatively correlated with indolepropionic acid at the time of sampling r  -0.23 p 0.006 independently of bmi p 0.03 both fasting p 0.009 and 2-h glucose p 0.02 and study group p  0.006. nevertheless adjustment for hscrp in the statistical analyses did not modify the association of indolepropionic acid with insulin secretion in non-t2d cases b  0.31 0.09-0.51 p 0.004.table 2. top ranking metabolites associated with t2d in lifestyle and groups and their interaction with study group.

the very-long chain fatty acid c226 docosahexaenoic acid and the long chain fatty acid c182 linoleic acid were also fre- quently part of these protective lipids 1.amino acids and bile acid metabolites increase the likelihood of developing t2d.

strengths of the present study include the well characterized and homogenous study population obese middle-aged individuals with igt andyearly measurements of insulin secretion and sensitivity estimates during a long period of follow-up of a carefully conducted lifestyle intervention study population.

for any of the other metabolites including indolepropionic acid we did not find any interaction with the study group that could modify its association with the chance of developing t2d t2.indolepropionic acid associates with the course of insulin secretion during the follow-up in the dps non-t2d cases.

six pcs and four lysopcs lpcs and one lysophos- phatidylethanolamine lpe were among the metabolites significantly inversely associated with diabetes at fdr-p  0.05 1. most of these lipids contained at least one of the following three fatty acids as part of the metabolite c150 pentadecanoic acid c170 heptadecanoic acid or c151 pentadecenoic acid.

at baseline there was no cross-sectional association between indolepropionic acid and t2d risk p  0.72 but during the 5-year follow-up indolepropionic acid was lower in subjects who developed t2d than in those who remained non-diabetic p 0.027 and they had decreased level of indolepropionic acid during the follow-up whereas in non-cases it was increased .

by applying non-targeted metabolomics approach we investigated here whether serum metabolite profile predicts t2d in a well-characterized study population with impaired glucose tolerance by examining two groups of individuals who took part in the finnish diabetes prevention study dps those who either early developed t2d n  96or did not convert to t2d within the 15-year follow-up n  104. several novel metabolites were associated with lower likelihood of developing t2d including indole and lipid related metabolites.

however we only found an interaction between the study group for two lipids pc181226 and lpc190 whose inverse association with t2d risk was stronger in the intervention group and between the study group with both tyrosine and proline whose direct association with t2d risk remained significant only in the control group .

first of all we did not have baseline samples available from the dps study and therefore we had to use the samples collected one year after the onset of the study.

the study design and procedures of the study were carried out in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki.
