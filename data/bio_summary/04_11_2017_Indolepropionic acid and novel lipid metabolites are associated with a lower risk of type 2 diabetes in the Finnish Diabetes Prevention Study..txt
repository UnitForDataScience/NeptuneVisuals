The very-long chain fatty acid C226 docosahexaenoic acid and the long chain fatty acid C182 linoleic acid were also fre- quently part of these protective lipids 1.Amino acids and bile acid metabolites increase the likelihood of developing T2D.

Phe phenylalanine GCA Glycocholic acid TCDC Taurochenodeoxycholic acid GCDC Glycochenodeoxycholic acid GDC Glycodeoxycholic DC Deoxycholic acid CA Cholic acid.Among study participants who remained non-diabetic non-T2D cases higher LPC151 LPC170 LPC201 PC226182 and PC151182 were directly associated with better insulin sensitivity Matsuda ISI during the follow-up b 0.21 to 0.32 P 0.039 to 0.001 2 whereas higher isoleucine phenylalanine and tyrosine were associated with lower Matsuda ISI b -0.23 to -0.36 P 0.020 to 0.0003 3.

A particular strength of our study is that we were able to find a suggestive association between indolepropionic acid and the incidence of T2D among Finnish men in a small sub-sample of the Metsim study and finally to replicate the inverse association of indolepropionic acid with T2D risk in an independent study in a Swedish men and women.

The study design and procedures of the study were carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.Additionally a total number of 503 matched case-control pairs were included in the study BioDIVA utiliz- ing the DiabNorth diabetes registry to form a study nested within the Vasterbotten Intervention Programme VIP cohort which is one of the sub-cohorts of the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study NSHDS.

Most of these lipids contained at least one of the following three fatty acids as part of the metabolite C150 pentadecanoic acid C170 heptadecanoic acid or C151 pentadecenoic acid.

At baseline there was no cross-sectional association between indolepropionic acid and T2D risk P  0.72 but during the 5-year follow-up indolepropionic acid was lower in subjects who developed T2D than in those who remained non-diabetic P 0.027 and they had decreased level of indolepropionic acid during the follow-up whereas in non-cases it was increased .

Due to the interrelation among gut microbiota low-grade inflammation and T2D we exam- ined if circulating levels of hsCRP would be related with indolepropionic acid or the lipid metabolites associated with T2D risk and either DI30 or Matsuda ISI during the follow-up.Serum hsCRP was negatively correlated with indolepropionic acid at the time of sampling r  -0.23 P 0.006 independently of BMI P 0.03 both fasting P 0.009 and 2-h glucose P 0.02 and study group P  0.006.

For any of the other metabolites including indolepropionic acid we did not find any interaction with the study group that could modify its association with the chance of developing T2D T2.Indolepropionic acid associates with the course of insulin secretion during the follow-up in the DPS non-T2D cases.

Strengths of the present study include the well characterized and homogenous study population obese middle-aged individuals with IGT andyearly measurements of insulin secretion and sensitivity estimates during a long period of follow-up of a carefully conducted lifestyle intervention study population.

indolepropionic acid when adjusted for insulin secretion at follow-up P  0.09 and the amino acids tyrosine and isoleucine when adjusted either for IS P  0.27 and P 0.40 respectively or insulin secretion P 0.72 and P 0.83 respectively.Indolepropionic acid and lipid metabolites are associated with high sensitive C-reactive protein hsCRP levels.
