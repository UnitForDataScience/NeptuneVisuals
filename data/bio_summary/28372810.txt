Due to this behavior persister cells have been likened to cancer stem cells which are also resistant to treatments and can enable a tumor to re-emerge It is thought that a small fraction of microbial cells stochastically transition to a persister state In addition environmental conditions have been shown to induce persistence by trigger- ing a stress response such as shifts in toxin-antitoxin systems or upregulating DNA repair genes after DNA damage due to antibiotics The study of persister cells is ongo- ing within the biofilm community and includes efforts to elucidate mechanisms of their formation as well as develop approaches to increase their susceptibility to antimicrobials.Persister cells are not the only aspect of biofilms thatcontribute to antimicrobial resistance and tolerance It is likely a combination of factors that enable biofilms to result in recalcitrant infections that require up to 1000-fold higher concentrations of antimicrobials as compared to plank- tonic cells For instance biofilm characteristics including reduced diffusivity due to matrix components antimicro- bial sequestering by matrix components cell-cell interactions such as horizontal gene transfer and cell metabolic state can contribute to this response In the oral cavity rele- vant measurements of biofilms on tooth and dental materials can lead to improved understanding of the role of biofilm attributes in the resultant biofilm function including antimi- crobial resistance.Biofilm propertiesThe general attributes of biofilms can be divided into four main categories constituents quantity structure and func- tion  These attributes can be measured over time to characterize biofilm formation and response to perturbations.

Biofilm architec- ture can also affect the types of organisms present as the non-random spatial arrangement of cells defines cell-cell proximity and neighboring cell types leading to physical and chemical cell-cell interactions such as horizontal gene trans- fer metabolic cooperationcompetition and quorum sensing.For instance the obligate anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregates with oxygen tolerant species in oral biofilms in order to serve as a bridge that allows other obligate anaerobes which do not coaggregate well with oxygen tolerant species to join the biofilm Even within monospecies biofilms characterization of biofilm structure can shed light on biofilm properties For multispecies systems oral biofilms are among the most studied in terms of spatiotemporal organiza- tion Oral bacteria found in dental plaque oral biofilms have been classified into early and late colonizers based on studies using enamel surfaces in the oral cavity with saliva.

nutrients.The matrix surrounding the cells is termed the extracellu- lar polymeric substance EPS and represents biopolymers of microbial origin in which biofilm microorganisms are embed- ded Initially thought to be simply exopolysaccharides the EPS is currently recognized as a highly hydrated structure that includes polysaccharides proteins including enzymes glycoproteins glycolipids lipids and extracellular DNA e- DNA These non-cellular components of biofilms are thought to have a protective role providing support struc- tures to shield microbial cells in biofilms from shear forces and host cells serving as nutrient reservoirs reducing diffusion and maintaining cell-cell proximity to promote interactions.

While it has recently been proposed that persister cells might rep- resent a transition state between culturable and VBNC cells the relationships among the various states are poorly understood and difficult to measure Persister cells are genetically unchanged cells with extremely low metabolic activity and can be found in both planktonic and biofilm cultures Their low activity level makes them tolerant to the many antimicrobials that affect metabolically active cells e.g.

Hypothetical data are presented and normalized to biomass with each error bar representing a relative standard deviation of 5.While the biofilms have the same cell density cells in biofilms B and D have higher activity per cell and biofilm C has a lower density of viable cells.

It was demonstrated in 1940 that the presence of solid surfaces available for bacterial growth increased the amount of bacteria present especially under reduced nutrient condi- tions In 1969 electron microscopy of slime layers from streams revealed the presence of a matrix encasing microbial cells While the term biofilm may have first been used in pub-lication in 1975 the ubiquity of biofilms was recognized by Bill Costerton in 1978 Costerton has been deemed the founding father of the field of biofilms for his pioneering work leading to modern biofilm research.

Adding fresh nutrients to wake-up cells may be particularly important for static cultures where nutrients may have been consumed dur- ing biofilm growth as seen with 24 h Streptococcus mutans biofilms that have a large biomass but little metabolic activity One pathogenic function relevant to oral biofilms is cario-genicity which can be characterized via measurements such as acid production matrix production or demineralization potential.

Bulk metabolic activity is related but not identical to viability and vitality as biofilms often have viable but metabolically inactive cells such as dormant and persister cells.

A number of commercially available fluorescent dyes and livedead assays claim to differentiate viable and dead cells based on membrane integrity In other approaches modified qPCR protocols utilize an intercalating molecule such as propidium monoazide PMA to enter cells with compromised mem- branes and bind their DNA to prevent amplification Only DNA from cells with intact membranes should then be available for amplification and detection.

Bacteriostatic antibiotics halt cell growth by affecting intracellular processes such as erythromycin which interferes with protein synthesis Cells stained with ery- thromycin appear live green because their cell membranes are intact however they are not viable as indicated by lack of growth on agar and are therefore false negatives for dead cells Conversely it has also been shown that growing cells can be stained with propidium iodide red produc- ing false positives for dead cells based on the staining alone.
