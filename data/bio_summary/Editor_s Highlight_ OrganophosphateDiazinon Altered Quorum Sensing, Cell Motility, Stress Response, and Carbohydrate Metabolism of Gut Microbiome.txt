As shown in  LexA was down-regulated by diazinon exposure which cleaves itself and initiates the SOS response upon DNA damage  suggesting that diazinon may have induced bacterial DNA damage and bacteria activated defense pathways to maintain genome stability.Diazinon Disturbed Carbohydrate Fatty Acid Amino Acid Metabolic HomeostasisA widespread regulation has been observed for carbohydrate fatty acid and amino acid pathways .

In add- ition we also demonstrated that diazinon exposure activated diverse stress response pathways and profoundly impaired en- ergy metabolism of gut bacteria.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and exposure.

Given the significance of gut micro- biome to human health and widespread use and toxicity of diazinon it is of great interest to understand the interplay be- tween gut microbiome and diazinon.

Therefore in this study we used metatranscriptomics to examine the effects of diazinon exposure on the gut metatranscriptome in C57BL6 mice.

In addition we also found that diazinon exposure activated diverse stress response pathways and profoundly impaired energy metabolism of gut bacteria.

Thus the major goal of this study was to examine whether essential genes involved in quorum sensing was altered by diazinon exposure.
