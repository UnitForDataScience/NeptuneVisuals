When ordered by rank an average of 10 and 20 genera accounted for 99 of sequences in sinus and lung samples respectively C. These data indicate that the lung bacterial community is greater in both richness and evenness relative to the sinuses.Spearman correlations were then calculated to assess relationships between bacterial load alpha diversity and patient clinical data D. These data revealed a significant inverse correlation between Shannon diversity in the sinus and lung r  - 0.664 P  0.022.

These analysesdemonstrate that overall community structure is largely driven by dominant genera and that upper and lower airways select for unique bacterial community structures despite sharing individual taxa.Predicted metagenomes show phenotypic conservation between sitesTo gain insight into bacterial community function PICRUStwas implemented to infer bacterial metagenomes based on 16S rRNA gene content.

These samples are herein referred to as sinus and lung samples denoting their anatomical origin.

A dominant genus was present in 100 of sinus samples but only 33 of lung samples.

Lung samples display significantly greater evenness in OTU distribution relative to sinus samples paired Student's t-test P  0.0127.

Based on these previous studies we hypothesized that samples would cluster more closely by patient rather than by sampling site.To address this hypothesis we compared samples utilizing weighted Unifrac an abundance-sensitive phylogenetically- relevant diversity metric .

Lung samples also demonstrated considerable phylo- genetic variation when compared to sinus samples A.

Gram-negative genera contrib- uting to this phenotype were more varied in lung samples and included Veillonella Prevotella Neisseria Stenotrophomonas supporting the increased richness observed in these samples.

This phenotype was influenced by the presence of Pseudomonas in both airway sites but Burkholderiaand Achromobacter both differentiated sinus from lung samples while Neisseria and Stenotrophomonas were more highly represented in lung samples.

Given the emerging evidence of anaerobes being causative agents of pulmonary disease  increased use of culture- independent diagnostics to detect these bacteria throughout the airways is warranted.Our most intriguing data were that several sinus samples harbored canonical CF pathogens yet these bacteria were absent in the paired lung samples.
