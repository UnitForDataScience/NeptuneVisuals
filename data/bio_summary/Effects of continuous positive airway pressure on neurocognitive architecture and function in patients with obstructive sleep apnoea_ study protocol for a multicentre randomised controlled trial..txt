we hypothesise that patients with osa who undergo cpap treatment will have metabolic improvement and modula- tion of gut microbiota and that these changes will have beneficial effects on neurocognitive impairment.study designthe shanghai multicenter obstructive sleep apnea therapy trial is a multicentre evaluator-blinded randomised parallel-controlled trial performed in five sleep centres department of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery shanghai jiao tong univer- sity affiliated sixth people's hospital department of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery shanghai first people's hospital shanghai jiao tong university department of otolaryngology renji hospital school of medicine shanghai jiao tong university department of otolaryngology head and neck surgery xinhua hospital shanghai jiao tong university school of medi- cine department of otolaryngology the ninth people's hospital affiliated to shanghai jiao-tong universityschool of medicine in the shanghai district.

this study will clarify the complex relationships among osa gut microbiota and neurological functions.methodsdesignstudy aims and hypothesesthe primary aim of this study is to assess the dynamic 3 6 and 12 months effects of cpap on cognitive func- tion neurocognitive architecture and function.

therefore this multicentre trial was designed to investigate whether and when neurocognitive architecture and function in patients with osa can be improved by cpap treatment and to explore the role of gut microbiota in improving neurocognitive function during treatment.methodsdesign this study will be a multicentre randomised controlled trial with allocation concealment and assessor blinding.

the secondary aims of this study are to investigate whether and which sleep parameters are correlated with improvements of cognitive function neurocognitive architecture and function to explore whether the metabolic status assessed by metabolomics can be reversed by cpap and correlated with improve- ment of neurocognitive impairment and to investigate whether cpap modulates the gut microbiota and contrib- utes to alleviation of neurocognitive impairment.

cognitive function structure and function of brain regions metabolites gut microbiota biochemical variables electrocardiography echocardiography pulmo- nary function and arterial stiffness will be assessed at baseline before randomisation and at 3 6 and 12 months.

effects of continuous positive airway pressure on neurocognitive architecture and function in patients with obstructivesleep apnoea study protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial.

the primary hypothesis of this study is that compared with the non-cpap treatment group patients with osa who receive cpap intervention will show improved cognitive function through structural and functional brain modu- lation immediately after 3 months of cpap treatment and that these benefits will persist at the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups.
