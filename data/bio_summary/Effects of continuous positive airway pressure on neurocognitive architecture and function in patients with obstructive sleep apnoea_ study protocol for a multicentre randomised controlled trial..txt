We hypothesise that patients with OSA who undergo CPAP treatment will have metabolic improvement and modula- tion of gut microbiota and that these changes will have beneficial effects on neurocognitive impairment.study designThe Shanghai Multicenter Obstructive Sleep Apnea Therapy trial is a multicentre evaluator-blinded randomised parallel-controlled trial performed in five sleep centres Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery Shanghai Jiao Tong Univer- sity Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Shanghai First People's Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University Department of Otolaryngology Renji Hospital School of Medicine Shanghai Jiao Tong University Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Xinhua Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medi- cine Department of Otolaryngology The Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong UniversitySchool of Medicine in the Shanghai district.

The secondary aims of this study are to investigate whether and which sleep parameters are correlated with improvements of cognitive function neurocognitive architecture and function to explore whether the metabolic status assessed by metabolomics can be reversed by CPAP and correlated with improve- ment of neurocognitive impairment and to investigate whether CPAP modulates the gut microbiota and contrib- utes to alleviation of neurocognitive impairment.

Cognitive function structure and function of brainregions gut microbiota metabolites biochemical variables electrocardiography echocardiography pulmonaryfunction and arterial stiffness will be assessed at baseline before randomisation and at 3 6 and 12 months.Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital approval number 2015-79.

Before randomisation all baseline assessment will be finished.Primary and secondary outcomesPrimary endpointsMoCA.Secondary endpointsMMSE.Default mode network and cortical thickness are measured by functional and structural MRI.Cerebral metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate NAA choline Cho creatine Cr glutamate and glutamine and myo-inositol are measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy MRS.Neuropsychological tests will also be performed including mental arithmetic memory scanning move- ment perception switching attention space location memory span and attention allocation choice reaction time curve fit.Sleep variables include AHI oxygen desaturation index lowest oxygen saturation mean oxygen saturation micro-arousal index total sleep time total REM sleep time total slow wave sleep time etc.Auditory testingCentral auditory processing tests performed include speech-in-noise test competing sentences test gap detec- tion and dichotic listening.Data were recorded using 256-channel high-density electroencephalograph EEG recordings.The gut microbial community will be quantified using metagenomics analysis.
