Epige- netic modifications are implicated in the pathogenesis of many complicated diseases including AIDs e. Furthermore as an environment cue inside human body human microbiome is also possible to influence gene expression by epigenetic modifications which turns out to be a way of crosstalk between microbiome and host cells.Techniques of microbiome and epigenome have already beenapplied in AIDs research but studies combining them together in exploring AIDs pathogenesis have not really started yet.

Those studies involved microbial interventions with probiotic prebiotic antibiotic andor fecal transplantation provided sup- porting evidence for the role of dysbiosis in AIDs pathogenesis.Beyond the known association of dysbiosis of gastrointestinaltract and AIDs oral microbiota changes have also been observed in AIDs patients in particular RA patients.

Intestinal epithelial cells IECs are the main channels for the crosstalk between host cells and microbiome as well as the impact of microbiome on host im- mune function.Studies using germ-free GF mice and specific pathogen-freeSPF mice unmasked the influence of commensal bacteria on the structure and function of immune system.

Alterations in the gut oral microbiome could be used to differentiate RA patients from healthy controls and stratify in- dividuals according to their response to therapy and is helpful in the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of RA patients.

In this review we will focus on the crosstalk between human microbiome and immune sys- tem the microbiome changes in AIDs and their possible patho- genic immunological mechanisms.

Further the possiblemechanism of how human microbiome mediate the pathogenesis of AIDs through epigenetic machinery will be discussed.Human microbiome and immune systemThe gut of fetus is almost sterile.

Although the association between microbiome and epigenetics in AIDs such as T1D has been strongly suggested potent evidences are still needed for the causality.Conclusion and prospectIn conclusion human microbiome is closely associated with host immune system.
