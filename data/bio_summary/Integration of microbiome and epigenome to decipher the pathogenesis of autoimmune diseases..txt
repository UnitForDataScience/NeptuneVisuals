epige- netic modifications are implicated in the pathogenesis of many complicated diseases including aids e. furthermore as an environment cue inside human body human microbiome is also possible to influence gene expression by epigenetic modifications which turns out to be a way of crosstalk between microbiome and host cells.techniques of microbiome and epigenome have already beenapplied in aids research but studies combining them together in exploring aids pathogenesis have not really started yet.

we also found functional changes of microbiota and molecular mimicry of human antigens in ra individuals.by integrating the analysis of multi-omics of microbiome and epigenome we could explore the interaction between human immune system and microbiota and thereby unmasking specific and more sensitive biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets.

intestinal epithelial cells iecs are the main channels for the crosstalk between host cells and microbiome as well as the impact of microbiome on host im- mune function.studies using germ-free gf mice and specific pathogen-freespf mice unmasked the influence of commensal bacteria on the structure and function of immune system.

those studies involved microbial interventions with probiotic prebiotic antibiotic andor fecal transplantation provided sup- porting evidence for the role of dysbiosis in aids pathogenesis.beyond the known association of dysbiosis of gastrointestinaltract and aids oral microbiota changes have also been observed in aids patients in particular ra patients.

future studies aiming at the crosstalk between human dysbiosis and epigenetic modifications and their influences on aids will facilitate our understanding and better managing of these debilitating aids.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.contentsintroduction32human microbiome and immune system32aids and human microbiome33microbiome changes in aids patients and animal models33immunopathological mechanisms of dysbiosis in promoting aids35abbreviation aids autoimmune diseases.

colonization of gf mice with the microbiota from pathogen- free mice revealed that some microrna mirnaexpression were altered in the ileum and the colon of colonized mice.

in this review we will focus on the crosstalk between human microbiome and immune sys- tem the microbiome changes in aids and their possible patho- genic immunological mechanisms.

further the possiblemechanism of how human microbiome mediate the pathogenesis of aids through epigenetic machinery will be discussed.human microbiome and immune systemthe gut of fetus is almost sterile.

although the association between microbiome and epigenetics in aids such as t1d has been strongly suggested potent evidences are still needed for the causality.conclusion and prospectin conclusion human microbiome is closely associated with host immune system.

although studies above suggested that gut dys- biosis may mediate the initiation of aids mainly via th17 cells and related cytokines there was also a research suggesting that auto- immune arthritis was regulated by gut microbiota through follic- ular helper t tfh cells rather than th17 cells in kbxn mice .

all studies above indicate that cross reactions caused by molecular mimicry may be one of the inducing factors of aids occurrence.microbial translocationnumerous studies have confirmed the enhancement of intesti- nal permeability in ra ibd and other aids e providing accessibility for gut microbiota and their metabolites to blood cir- culation.

it is conceivable that micro- biome in oral cavity and respiratory tract may have some connec- tion with aids as in gastrointestinal tract but more work needs be done to substantiate this possibility.immunopathological mechanisms of dysbiosis in promoting aidsalthough studies about aids and human microbiome have been increasing in recent years whether dysbiosis is the cause or the consequence of aids is still controversial.

growing evidence has suggested that the compositional and functional changes of human microbiome are capable of regulating the development and function of immune system via epigenetic mechanisms which may break the immune homeostasis and finally result in the development of aids .
