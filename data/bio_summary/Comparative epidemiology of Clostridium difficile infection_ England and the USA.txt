The proportion of CDI patients with comorbidities was greater in the USA compared to England apart from dementia which was greater in England 9.63 vs. 1.25 P  0.0001.Conclusions The 2012 inpatient CDI rate within the USA was much higher than in England.

Proportions of these comorbidities in patients with CDI were greater in the USA compared to England apart from dementia which wasgreater in England 9.63 vs. 1.25 P  0.0001.Figure 1 CDI by sex and age in England and USA in 2012.

Furthermore the use of FMT for this indication has now been approved in England by NICE  and in national  and international guidelines .The general experience of clinicians caring for people affected byCDI in England is that affected people often have many typical risk factors.

Logistic regression was used for England to produce age-specific OR in unweighted HES data.ResultsThere were 13 371 542 inpatient discharges in 2012 in England HES and the rate of CDI was 19.3100 000 population.

In England IBS was three times more common in women thanTable 1 Proportions of comorbidities consistently coded in the two countriesFigure 3 Rate of CDI per 100 000 inpatient discharges separated by whether it was listed as a primary or secondary diagnosis in the England and the USA.

A CDI as primary diagnosis in USA B CDI as primary diagnosis in England C CDI as secondary diagnosis in USA and D CDI as secondary diagnosis in England.men 0.6 versus 0.2 P  0.0001 and UTI's were more common in women OR 1.55 95 CI 1.54-1.56 P  0.001.DiscussionThe most striking finding in these data are the higher rates of CDI within the USA than in England in 2012.

Most notably different age profiles in those with CDI were found between the USA and England with both countries showing an increased rate of CDI in those 65 years however in the USA there are also high rates at younger ages which are not observed in England.

However it is still the case that the majority of CDI cases within England and the USA are hospital-associated furthermore even though a greater proportion of CDI cases within the US than England appear to be community-associated   recent data indicate that 81 of apparently community-associated CDI occurs in people who have had at least some recent contact with a clinical setting .

Length of stay LOS differences between England and the US could also partly explain these data although the fact that the LOS is longer in England than in the USA  would if anything be expected to increase CDI testing compared to the USA.
