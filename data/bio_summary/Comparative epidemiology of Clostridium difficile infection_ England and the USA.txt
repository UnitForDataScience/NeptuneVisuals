young children contribute a greater proportion of the overall cdi cases in england compared to the usa p  0.001. those 75 years in england contribute more to overall cdi cases than in the usa p  0.001. in the usa those aged 25-70 years con- tribute a larger proportion of cdi cases than england p  0.001. comorbidities that are consistently coded are shown in table .

furthermore the use of fmt for this indication has now been approved in england by nice  and in national  and international guidelines .the general experience of clinicians caring for people affected bycdi in england is that affected people often have many typical risk factors.

logistic regression was used for england to produce age-specific or in unweighted hes data.resultsthere were 13 371 542 inpatient discharges in 2012 in england hes and the rate of cdi was 19.3100 000 population.

most notably different age profiles in those with cdi were found between the usa and england with both countries showing an increased rate of cdi in those 65 years however in the usa there are also high rates at younger ages which are not observed in england.

however it is still the case that the majority of cdi cases within england and the usa are hospital-associated furthermore even though a greater proportion of cdi cases within the us than england appear to be community-associated   recent data indicate that 81 of apparently community-associated cdi occurs in people who have had at least some recent contact with a clinical setting .

length of stay los differences between england and the us could also partly explain these data although the fact that the los is longer in england than in the usa  would if anything be expected to increase cdi testing compared to the usa.

in countries with high prevalence rates of cdi such as the usa investigators may be more selective about inclusion into fmt trials but there are no data to support this.given these striking observations we hypothesized that therewas a true epidemiological difference between the population with cdi in england and the usa.

we used routinely collected adminis- trative data from both countries to investigate this.methodsstudy design and settinga cross-sectional retrospective study was performed using national discharge data from national inpatient sample nis in the usa and hospital episode statistics hes in england.
