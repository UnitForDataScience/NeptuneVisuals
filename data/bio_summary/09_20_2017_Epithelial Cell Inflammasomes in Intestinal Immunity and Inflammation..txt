given that intestinal epithelial cells iec act as a barrier between the host and the intestinal microbiota inflammasome expression by these cells is likely important for intestinal immune homeostasis.

iec are composed of various specialized cell types enteroabsorptive cells goblet cells paneth cells neuroendrocrine cells tuft cells and stem cells.

thus although the contribu- tions of il-18 to clinical intestinal inflammation remain unclear evidence suggests that dysregulated il-18 signaling could influ- ence intestinal inflammation.in murine models different studies have drawn conflicting conclusions on whether il-18 plays a predominantly pathogenic or protective role in intestinal inflammation.

a comprehensive understand- ing of the molecular basis of intestinal inflammasome signaling could hold therapeutic potential for clinical translation.keywords inflammasome il-18 il-1b intestinal epithelial cells nod-like receptor pyroptosis inflammatory bowel diseaseintroductionintestinal homeostasis is governed by complex interactions between the host immune system the vast constitutive antigenic load in the lumen and the epithelial barrier.

in addition il-18 has also been demonstrated to promote optimal t regulatory cells responses in the gut with the lack of il-18 associated with increased proinflammatory t effector cells .such studies have led to the conclusion that epithelial-derived il-18 promotes barrier integrity and maintains a healthy microbiota which contributes to protection against intestinal injury and inflammation.

in fact the eicosanoid prostaglandin pge2 was secreted by murine iec upon nlrc4 inflammasome activation 24. examination of the downstream soluble mediators of inflammasome acti-vation aside from il-1b and il-18 remains comparatively understudied in iec compared to classical immune cells.

for example does too little iec death result increased potential for invasive infection due to lack of cell extrusion and does too much iec death perpetuate unnecessary inflammation finally what function does dysregulated inflammasome activation and pyroptosis play in ibd ibd patients are known to have necrotic lesions and increased levels of il-18 and il-1b in the inflamedintestine but their relative contributions to chronic intestinalpathology remain incompletely understood.despite these challenges and limitations understanding gut- associated inflammasome signaling its role in regulating dietary- microbiome-host immune interactions constitutes a critical component in maintaining homeostasis and mediating various immune-mediated disorders.

however it is important to stress that it remains to be demon- strated if this threshold-dependent decision controls differential cell death pathways following inflammasome activation in vivo and in cells other than macrophages.linking inflammasome effector mechanismsboth il-1b and il-18 lack signal peptides and therefore are not secreted through the conventional er-golgi pathway -.

furthermore it will also be vital to understand how inflammasome responses in iec are modulated during pathogenic attack or during inflam- matory conditions where an optimal balance between apoptosis pyroptosis and cytokine release may be required to control potential pathogens and restore homeostasis.conclusion and perspectiveshigh expression levels of many inflammasome proteins are enriched in the steady-state intestinal mucosa implicating their importance in barrier maintenance and immune monitoring.

this caspase-11-dependent il-18 processing was proposed to occur in iec contrary to the caspase-1-dependent cleavage of il-18 and il-1b observed in myeloid cells .the importance of canonical and non-canonical inflam- masomes may vary depending on the nature and characteris- tics of the pathogenic threat and the cell types involved.
