The number of OTUsTable 2 The core gut microbiota of dogs fed a natural diet or a commercial feed at phylum family and species levelTable 2 continuedSequence data of taxon that did not match the existing standard strains were deposited in public database a The core microbiota of the natural diet group but not the commercial feed groupb The core microbiota of the commercial feed group but not the natural diet groupidentified in the current study was nonetheless similar to that of other studies range 129-242 furthermore the Good's library coverage in the current study was higher than that in other studies which suggested that our results might reflect the actual bacterial gut community of dogs enrolled in this study.In this study diets were found to have a greater extent on the gut microbiota than other factors.

Specifically 1 we identified the core microbiota of dogs fed a natural diet or a com- mercial feed up to the species level and 2 compared the differences in alpha diversity beta diversity and the com- position of gut microbiota between animals fed the two different types of diet.MethodsAnimals and dietsFor this study 24 dogs were initially recruited 11 dogs were from a pet owner group Seoul Korea which is a social community of pet owners gathered to feed dogs a natural diet.

Other sequence similarity cut offs were genus 97  x  94.5 fam- ily 94.5  x  86.5 order 86.5  x  82 class82  x  78.5 and phylum 78.5  x  75.Table 1 Information on the dogs enrolled in this study10 gNatural diet group ND dogs fed a natural diet Commercial feed group CF dogs fed a commercial feedBF bichon frise WH white west highland terrier Mal the maltese YT yorkshire terrier Pom pomeranian M male CM castrated male F female SF spayed femaleData and statistical analysesThe alpha atmnd beta diversities were analyzed by using CLmedian read number 317576 range 237356-387829 and 1392243 were from the commercial feed groupcommunity version 3.43 Chunlab Inc..

c.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge the current study is the first to investigate the effect of long-term diet on the gut microbiota of dogs fed a natural diet compared with ones fed a commercial feed that have been actually applicated by dog owners by identifying the core microbiota up to the species level and comparing the differences in the gut microbiota between the two diet groups using NGS technology.In the current study the Illumina MiSeq platform and EzBioCloud database were used to analyze the gut micro- biota of the dog.

The raw data of PCO vectors for all samples are shown in Additional file .The core gut microbiota of dogs fed a natural diet or a commercial feedAt the phylum level we identified eight different bacte- rial phyla in 11 dog samples the core microbiota in the natural diet group comprised Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Fusobacteria Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and in the commercial feed group these were Firmicutes Bac- teroidetes Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria Table .

These core gut microbiota constituted more than 99 of the total microbiota in each group the predominant core microbiota at the phylum level was Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes regardless of the diet type.At the family level 81 families were identified among these 14 families comprised the core microbiota in the natural diet group and constituted more than 99 of the total microbiota in the commercial feed group 13 families formed the core microbiota and constituted ca.

.Alpha diversityThe number of OTUs in the natural diet group was sig- nificantly higher than that in the commercial feed group natural diet group 224.67 - 25.72 commercial feed group 132.4 - 25.28 p  0.004 Fig.

At the family level Fusobacteriaceae was more abun- dant in the natural diet group than in the commercial feed group p  0.004 while Coprobacillusf was more abundant in the commercial feed group than in the natu- ral diet group p  0.004 Fig.

These studies however were only based on nutrition pathogen detection and clinical experience and there were few studies about changes in microbiota composi- tion associated with natural diet and commercial feed in dogs .Given the above factors that can influence the gut microbiota especially diet type in dogs need to be stud- ied.

From among these 11 representative fecal samples 6 dogs fed a natural diet and 5 dogs fed a commercial feed were selected for gut microbiota analysis accord- ing to the selection criteria which included diet medi- cal history living area indoor breed gender age and weight.
