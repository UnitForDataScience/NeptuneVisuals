specifically 1 we identified the core microbiota of dogs fed a natural diet or a com- mercial feed up to the species level and 2 compared the differences in alpha diversity beta diversity and the com- position of gut microbiota between animals fed the two different types of diet.methodsanimals and dietsfor this study 24 dogs were initially recruited 11 dogs were from a pet owner group seoul korea which is a social community of pet owners gathered to feed dogs a natural diet.

c.discussionto the best of our knowledge the current study is the first to investigate the effect of long-term diet on the gut microbiota of dogs fed a natural diet compared with ones fed a commercial feed that have been actually applicated by dog owners by identifying the core microbiota up to the species level and comparing the differences in the gut microbiota between the two diet groups using ngs technology.in the current study the illumina miseq platform and ezbiocloud database were used to analyze the gut micro- biota of the dog.

these core gut microbiota constituted more than 99 of the total microbiota in each group the predominant core microbiota at the phylum level was firmicutes followed by bacteroidetes regardless of the diet type.at the family level 81 families were identified among these 14 families comprised the core microbiota in the natural diet group and constituted more than 99 of the total microbiota in the commercial feed group 13 families formed the core microbiota and constituted ca.

from among these 11 representative fecal samples 6 dogs fed a natural diet and 5 dogs fed a commercial feed were selected for gut microbiota analysis accord- ing to the selection criteria which included diet medi- cal history living area indoor breed gender age and weight.

these studies however were only based on nutrition pathogen detection and clinical experience and there were few studies about changes in microbiota composi- tion associated with natural diet and commercial feed in dogs .given the above factors that can influence the gut microbiota especially diet type in dogs need to be stud- ied.

moreover the differ- ences in beta diversity and the core microbiota observed herein were consistent with the results of other studies that demonstrated that long- or short-term diets play a substantial role in shaping human gut microbiota  .from the perspective of microbial infection this study suggests that the potential risk of opportunistic infection could be higher in dogs fed a natural diet than in dogs fed a commercial feed.

pet owners in this group share information of dogs and raise dogs in the same way walking a dog in a similar way and feeding a natural diet in similar rate of raw meat and vegetables 90 of raw meat 10 of veg- etables.

and 50 of e. coli group and could be at a greater risk of foodborne illness than dogs given a commercial feed because there was no regulation for microbial monitor- ing in raw meat and dogs fed a natural diet was more likely to be exposed to contaminated raw meat   .

however natural diets do not go through anymanufacturing process and are fed to dogs as raw so that more nutrients and microorganisms in the natural habitat are absorbed into the gut of the dog.
