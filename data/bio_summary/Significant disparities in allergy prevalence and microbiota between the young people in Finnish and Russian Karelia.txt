The skin and nasal microbiota were also compared.Methods Randomly selected children from Finnish n  98 and Russian Karelia n  82 were examined in 2003 when the children were 7-11 years of age and again in 2010 Finnish Karelia and 2012 Russian Karelia.

For example Finnish children showed skin prick test positivity to timothy grass in 28.2 as compared to 4.8 in Russian children and hay fever was reported in 15.6 of Finnish and 1.1 of Russian children.

Allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in Finnish subjects.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Differences in allergic phenotype developed in early life remain between populations.

In contrast the environment and lifestyle of people in North Karelia in Eastern Finland Finnish Karelia are notably more western and modern than in Russian Karelia although a large part of this region remains rural.

The Russian Kare- lia and the Finnish Karelia have the same climatic and geographical features and hence comparison of their populations provides an opportunity to examine allergies and individual microbiota in contrasting living condi- tions.

In 2003 schoolchildren from Finnish and Russian Karelia were examined 9-11 and the results showed that increased serum IgE levels and self- reported allergic symptoms were manifold in Finland.

In addition the skin and nasal microbiota on both sides of the border were explored to see how lifestyle and living environment affect microbial colonization.MethodsStudy cohortsIn 2003 randomly selected children aged 7-16 years were examined in North Karelia Finland Finnish Kare- lia n  344 and in PitkEURaranta the Republic of Karelia Russian Karelia n  427 9-11.

Children who were 7-11 years old in 2003 and had participated in the first study were invited to the follow-up Finnish Karelia n  205 Russian Karelia n  209.

This age group was invited because many of the older subjects 12-15 years old in 2003 had moved away from home.The follow-up consisted of 118 Finnish participation rate 58 and 93 Russian participation rate 45subjects.
