the skin and nasal microbiota were also compared.methods randomly selected children from finnish n  98 and russian karelia n  82 were examined in 2003 when the children were 7-11 years of age and again in 2010 finnish karelia and 2012 russian karelia.

for example finnish children showed skin prick test positivity to timothy grass in 28.2 as compared to 4.8 in russian children and hay fever was reported in 15.6 of finnish and 1.1 of russian children.

children who were 7-11 years old in 2003 and had participated in the first study were invited to the follow-up finnish karelia n  205 russian karelia n  209. this age group was invited because many of the older subjects 12-15 years old in 2003 had moved away from home.the follow-up consisted of 118 finnish participation rate 58 and 93 russian participation rate 45subjects.

doi 10.1111cea.12895clinical  experimental allergy 47 665-674significant disparities in allergy prevalence and microbiota between the young people in finnish and russian karelial.

overall diversity was significantly higher among russian subjects pskin  0.0001 pnasal-bacteria  0.0001 and pnasal-fungi  0.01. allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in finnish subjects.conclusions and clinical relevance differences in allergic phenotype developed in early life remain between populations.

in contrast the environment and lifestyle of people in north karelia in eastern finland finnish karelia are notably more western and modern than in russian karelia although a large part of this region remains rural.

the russian kare- lia and the finnish karelia have the same climatic and geographical features and hence comparison of their populations provides an opportunity to examine allergies and individual microbiota in contrasting living condi- tions.

the preva- lence of allergy has increased for decades 2 6 7 although the increase may now be levelling off at least for asthma 8. in 2003 schoolchildren from finnish and russian karelia were examined 9-11 and the results showed that increased serum ige levels and self- reported allergic symptoms were manifold in finland.

in addition the skin and nasal microbiota on both sides of the border were explored to see how lifestyle and living environment affect microbial colonization.methodsstudy cohortsin 2003 randomly selected children aged 7-16 years were examined in north karelia finland finnish kare- lia n  344 and in pitkeuraranta the republic of karelia russian karelia n  427 9-11. a follow-up study was conducted some ten years later.

only those participants for whom specific ige sige measurements were available for both study peri- ods were included in the present analyses of question- naire data and serum samples finnish karelia n  98 38 males 60 females russian karelia n  82 39 males43 females.

the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the helsinki university central hospital a study permission for the russian karelia was obtained from the petrozavodsk state university in the republic of karelia and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.in finnish karelia the follow-up study was per- formed in 2010 when the children were 14-18 years old.

in 2012 additional samples were collected from the finnish cohort n  76. in russia in addition to the original cohort samples from an extra cohort of 88 subjects aged 15-19 years 34 males 54 females were collected.
