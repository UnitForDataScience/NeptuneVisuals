after the intervention period the mice fed with either probiotic referred to as the 'probiotic group' or 'lgg group' or sulindac 'sulindac group' were found to have significantly lower number of intestinal polyps compared with those given only normal diet referred to as the 'control' group fig.

the overall composition of the gut bacterial com- munity did not show great difference after lgg con- sumption table 1. moreover the control group in which the highest number of polyps was formed had a similar level of variation as the lgg-treated group after 8 weeks as shown by the similar beta-diversity values 0060-0073. actually this phenomenon--relative stable- ness of gut microbiota structure--has been observed in previously studied human cohorts for both healthy sub- jects and crc patients after various stimuli lahti et al.

the venn diagram illustrates the overlap between the significantly varied cogs in different groups.the single-organism lgg reduced the development of intestinal polyps possibly by maintaining the functional- ity of a healthy gut microbiota.linking taxonomic with functional variationsbased on our taxonomic and functional investigations the gut microbiota displayed a strong functional variation after the 8-week intestinal adenoma progression control group but remained relatively stable at community composition.

since the faeces from some individual mouse sam- ples were in less quantity and could not meet the minimal dna input requirement of sequencing library preparation stool samples from six equal to the size of the smallest group mice randomly chosen for other groups belong- ing to the same test group were first pooled together.

all phyla with the exception of verrucomicro- bia 94-fold and 25-fold decrease in control and probiotic group respectively did not show obvious abundance changes neither in the control nor probiotic group fig.

the exception was the genus pre- votella in the probiotic group where its relative abun- dance was reduced from 295 to 214. the abundance of the lgg-containing genus lactobacillus increased by 34-fold in the lgg-treated group while it remained almost unchanged in the control or sulindac groups 12- or 098-fold respectively.

the reduction of total polyp counts in the sulindac group 517 was even higher than that of the single-organism lgg 254. spleen weight was considered a marker forsystemic inflammation murphy et al.

5. our analyses and findings supported our specu- lation that the significantly varied functional elements in control group were predominately contributed by a small subset of microbial taxa.lastly we focused on some specific taxa and func- tions of gut microbes that have been demonstrated to be important for the well-being of both microbial com- munity and host.
