These mycobiomes were composed of identifiable fungi such as Tricosporon spp.lingzhi Hypsizygus sublateritium and A. oryzae as well as a large number of sequences that could not be assigned to a known taxa.Although the mycobiota of each individual participant did not show much diversity the identification of those unknown minor fungi in the mycobiota would be the next targets for research on human commensal microorganisms.

The database and methodology described here provide critical tools for the emerging field of mycobiome studies.Keywords mycobiota fungi internal transcribed spacer ITS high-throughtput sequencing HTS the gut mycobiota in JapaneseINTRODUCTIONComprehensive analysis of bacterial communities microbiota has been made possible with the advent of high-throughput sequencing HTS technologies.

Fungal communities mycobiota in the intestines clearly play an important role in the health of the host.Various genera of fungi have been detected in mycobiota analyses of the healthy human gut and the genera Saccharomyces Candida and Cladosporium have been detected in particularly high percentages        .

Among the data associated with a small number of full-passes sequences that could not be identified such as those labeled as fungi or other were confirmed to account for less than 10 of sequences and were not present in data sets with a higher number of full-passes.

While THF has sequences for only 1816 species ntF-ITS1 for 6525 species.

However while the 16S rRNAgene used for bacterial microbiota analysis has a virtually identical length regardless of the species the length of the ITS region in fungi varies between species.

The number of fungal genera and species included in each database were summarized in Supplementary Table S1.Taxonomic Assignment of a Mock CommunityA mock community composed of 26 fungal species representing 15 genera  was used to evaluate the various methods of taxonomic assessment.

Using this strategy for deep- sequencing analysis of the gut mycobiota in healthy Japanese individuals revealed two major mycobiota types a single-species type composed of Candida albicans or Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a multi-species type.

Moreover analyses of the mycobiota in the oral cavity     and skin          have demonstrated that mycobiota populations vary according to sites on the body    .

Because reports of the analysis of human mycobiomes have been relatively rare and the gut mycobiota is particularly poorly understood         we analyzed the mycobiota of feces from healthy Japanese subjects.
