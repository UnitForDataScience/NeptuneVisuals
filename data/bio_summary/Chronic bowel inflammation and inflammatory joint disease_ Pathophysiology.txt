The main points are as followsoligoarthritis and polyarthritis are the most common patterns of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with Behc et's diseasethe knee and ankle are the joints most often involvedpatients with Behc et's disease may experience unusual mus- culoskeletal manifestations such as fibromyalgia myositis pseudo-gout and destructive arthritisaxial involvement may be revealed by back pain 29 isolatedsacroiliitis 7.5 or definite AS 5musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with Behc et's disease rarely occur concomitantly with RA or other systemic diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosusjoint involvement frequently coincides with erythema nodosumand above all mucocutaneous lesions oral andor genital ulcers and pseudo-folliculitis whereas concomitant neurolog- ical relapse is exceedingly rare Pathophysiology of chronic joint inflammation associated with IBDMany prospective studies have documented the occurrence of joint involvement in patients with IBD and of bowel inflamma- tion in patients with SpA.

The HLA-B27 protein may con- tribute to the pathogenesis of the joint disease as it may be able to present arthritogenic peptides from self or bacteria to CD8 T cells The misfoldinghypothesis implicatesatypical folding of the heavy chains of the HLA-B27 protein B.

However the prevalence of CARD15 variants does not seem significantly higher in patients with SpA compared to healthy individuals although the presence of a CARD15 polymor- phism predicts the development of bowel inflammation in patients with SpA Pathophysiology of chronic joint inflammation associated with Behc et's diseaseProspective cohort studies have provided evidence pertaining to the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with Behc et's disease.

The classification crite- ria developed by the Assessment in Spondyloarthritis International Society ASAS distinguish several types of SpA including ankylos- ing spondylitis AS psoriatic arthritis PsA reactive arthritis and undifferentiated SpA The main clinical features of SpA are inflammatory low back pain and inflammation of the tendons or ligament insertions.

The prevalence of musculoskeletal manifestations was 51.2 The characteristics of joint involvement in Behc et's disease have been comprehensively documented by retrospective and prospec-tive studies.

A role for IL-23IL- 17 in the development of joint inflammation in patients with IBD and in the transgenic HLA-B27132 m rat model of SpA has received support from evidence that HLA-B27 misfolding can induce IL-23 production and is associated with Th17 cell activation According to the bacterial hypothesis joint inflammation devel- ops because the gut epithelium and synovial membrane express the same receptors which may be associated with a decrease in HLA-B27-mediated clearance of intracellular bacteria.

A further deterioration in quality of life may occur as a result of extraarticular manifesta- tions of which the most common is joint inflammation seen in 6 to 33 of patients with IBD A very recent prospective cohort study from the Tor Vergata Uni- versity in Rome Italy enrolled 269 patients with IBD and joint pain Patient management by both gastroenterologists and rheuma- tologists allowed the earlier diagnosis of various musculoskeletal diseases in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.

Among patients with Behc et's disease 3 to 60 experience gastrointestinal manifestations associated with a broad range of genetic pathogenic and clinical features typical of patients with IBD A very recently reported prospective study evaluated the preva- lence incidence and patterns of joint involvement in 2312 Iranian patients with Behc et's disease who were followed-up for 5 years.

Fibromyalgia PsA rheumatoid arthritis RA gout and other joint diseases were diag- nosed less often Promptly establishing the correct diagnosis can help delineate the phenotype of patients with IBD who are at high risk for devel- oping SpA thereby improving the management of joint diseases in patients with IBD and creating favorable conditions for developing effective treatments that improve quality of life.SpA associated with IBD has two main presentations periph- eral arthritis and axial arthritis without rheumatoid factors RF.
