the main points are as followsoligoarthritis and polyarthritis are the most common patterns of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with behc et's diseasethe knee and ankle are the joints most often involvedpatients with behc et's disease may experience unusual mus- culoskeletal manifestations such as fibromyalgia myositis pseudo-gout and destructive arthritisaxial involvement may be revealed by back pain 29 isolatedsacroiliitis 7.5 or definite as 5musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with behc et's disease rarely occur concomitantly with ra or other systemic diseases such as sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosusjoint involvement frequently coincides with erythema nodosumand above all mucocutaneous lesions oral andor genital ulcers and pseudo-folliculitis whereas concomitant neurolog- ical relapse is exceedingly rare pathophysiology of chronic joint inflammation associated with ibdmany prospective studies have documented the occurrence of joint involvement in patients with ibd and of bowel inflamma- tion in patients with spa.

however the prevalence of card15 variants does not seem significantly higher in patients with spa compared to healthy individuals although the presence of a card15 polymor- phism predicts the development of bowel inflammation in patients with spa pathophysiology of chronic joint inflammation associated with behc et's diseaseprospective cohort studies have provided evidence pertaining to the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with behc et's disease.

a role for il-23il- 17 in the development of joint inflammation in patients with ibd and in the transgenic hla-b27132 m rat model of spa has received support from evidence that hla-b27 misfolding can induce il-23 production and is associated with th17 cell activation according to the bacterial hypothesis joint inflammation devel- ops because the gut epithelium and synovial membrane express the same receptors which may be associated with a decrease in hla-b27-mediated clearance of intracellular bacteria.

the hla-b27 protein may con- tribute to the pathogenesis of the joint disease as it may be able to present arthritogenic peptides from self or bacteria to cd8 t cells the misfoldinghypothesis implicatesatypical folding of the heavy chains of the hla-b27 protein b. normally the hla-b27 heavy chains assemble with 132 m then load their peptide cargo in the endoplasmic reticulum re before being transported to the cell membrane.

a further deterioration in quality of life may occur as a result of extraarticular manifesta- tions of which the most common is joint inflammation seen in 6 to 33 of patients with ibd a very recent prospective cohort study from the tor vergata uni- versity in rome italy enrolled 269 patients with ibd and joint pain patient management by both gastroenterologists and rheuma- tologists allowed the earlier diagnosis of various musculoskeletal diseases in patients with ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease.

fibromyalgia psa rheumatoid arthritis ra gout and other joint diseases were diag- nosed less often promptly establishing the correct diagnosis can help delineate the phenotype of patients with ibd who are at high risk for devel- oping spa thereby improving the management of joint diseases in patients with ibd and creating favorable conditions for developing effective treatments that improve quality of life.spa associated with ibd has two main presentations periph- eral arthritis and axial arthritis without rheumatoid factors rf.

among patients with behc et's disease 3 to 60 experience gastrointestinal manifestations associated with a broad range of genetic pathogenic and clinical features typical of patients with ibd a very recently reported prospective study evaluated the preva- lence incidence and patterns of joint involvement in 2312 iranian patients with behc et's disease who were followed-up for 5 years.

speca l. dubuquoy  joint bone spine 84 2017 417-420the associations linking hla-b51 or hla-b27 to the development of arthritis in patients with behc et's disease remain unclear recent studies demonstrated a correlation linking hla-b51 to the aminopeptidase erap1 which is expressed by the endoplasmic reticulum of nk cells.

consequently whether behc et's disease consists merely in bowel inflammation with vasculitis or constitutes a true ibd remains unknown to date no single pathophysiological link between spa and ibd andor behc et's disease has been identified.

the classification crite- ria developed by the assessment in spondyloarthritis international society asas distinguish several types of spa including ankylos- ing spondylitis as psoriatic arthritis psa reactive arthritis and undifferentiated spa the main clinical features of spa are inflammatory low back pain and inflammation of the tendons or ligament insertions.

more specifically in the giant cohort gent inflammatory arthritis and spondylitis cohort histological evidence of bowel inflammation was found in 46.2 of patients with axial spa furthermore high concentrations of fecal calprotectin a marker for bowel inflammation were demonstrated in patients who had spa but no gastrointestinal symptoms among whom 12 subsequently developed ibd on the other hand the routine use of mri which is the current reference standard for diagnosing spa has demonstrated asymp- tomatic or symptomatic sacroiliitis in 2.0 to 45.7 of patients with ibd.

speca l. dubuquoy  joint bone spine 84 2017 417-420inflammatory bowel disease and joint diseaseibd affects nearly 4 million people worldwide.

the prevalence of musculoskeletal manifestations was 51.2 the characteristics of joint involvement in behc et's disease have been comprehensively documented by retrospective and prospec-tive studies.

thus the patho- physiological mechanisms responsible for joint manifestations in behc et's disease may resemble those described above for ibd.
