2015 was largely responsible for the assembly and turnover of bacterioplankton communities in Lake Donghu 75-82 Figure 5 while dispersal limitation which causes divergence in community composition due to limited exchange of microbes Stegen et al.

Although planktonic microbes in Lake Donghu have been found to be significantly differ- ent among seasons within a single year Yu et al.

We found that 75-82 of community turnover in Lake Donghu was governed by the determin- istic process of homogeneous selection which causes the community composition to be similar under consistent environmental conditions Dini-Andreote et al.

Although the Great Lake Donghu Ecological Water Network project started a couple of years after our first sampling time March 2006 in Yan et al.

In 2008 a large-scale integrated eco- logical project named the Great Lake Donghu Ecological Water Net- work was started to connect the six lakes around Lake Donghu and also connect to the Yangtze River.

However the six lakes around Lake Donghu are only connected by an ecological water network which is expected to greatly enhance natu- ral water purification and ecological restoration in Lake Donghu.

As signifi- cant change in ecological patterns may result from serious disturbance Ferrenberg et al.

The percentages are given the relative contribution of each process to the community turnover as indicated by different colours DISCUSSION Previous studies on bacterioplankton diversity patterns were mainly restricted to single dimensions such as short time periods 1 or 2 years or horizontalvertical profiles across particular environmen- tal gradients Fortunato et al.

However at much greater spatial scales with clearer environmental gradients such as across river to ocean ecosystems the spatial variability would likely overwhelm seasonal patterns of the bacterioplankton communities Fortunato et al.
