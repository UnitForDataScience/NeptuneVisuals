assembled a reference genome of P. malariae from clinically isolated parasites and they manually curated two draft genomes for both species of P. ovale phylogenetic analysis provided insights into the evolution of the Plasmodium genus and species differentiation.

However when and how microbial community structure and function are established in early life have remained elusive.

carried out a large population-based cohort study of maternal-infant pairs to determine the composition and metabolic function of the early neonatal microbiota and up to 6 weeks after delivery across several body sites including stool oral gingiva nares the skin and vagina.

The neonatal microbiota was sparsely populated and predominantly comprised taxa of the maternal skin and vaginal microbiota.

In addition the microbial community function had expanded and diversified.

Finally although patterns of microbial composition in neonates were influenced by mode of delivery at birth these differences were not present in the infants at 6 weeks of age which suggests that the maturation of the infant microbiota is mainly driven by body site and not by mode of delivery.ORIGINAL ARTICLE Chu D.

Investigating host-specific adaptations they report that P. malariae expresses a family of surface proteins that have structural similaritiesto a protein in Plasmodium falciparum that is essential for erythrocyte invasion.
