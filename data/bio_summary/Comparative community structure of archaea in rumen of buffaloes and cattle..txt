In cattle of 1522 species-level OTUs only 380 OTUs were abundant OTUs 28 abundant OTUs were shared between cattle and buffalo which constitute 6.5 of total abundant OTUs.Methanobrevibacter sequences of cattle origin were clustered into 688 unique present in cattle but not in buffalo species- level OTUs 190 abundant OTUs and 201 shared with buf- falo species-level OTUs 152 abundant OTUs.

The study has also indicated that the percent of species-level operational taxonomic units shared between cattle and buffalo is very low and thus host species-specific methane mitigation strategies need to be developed for cattle and buffaloes.c 2016 Society of Chemical IndustryKeywords archaea rumen buffalo 16S rDNA cattle diversityINTRODUCTIONReducing enteric CH4 emissions has been identified as one key way of lowering global CH4 emissions.

The present study indicated that Methanobrevibacter is the most predominant genus in cattle as well as buffaloes the percentage of Methanomicrobium is much higher in the case of buffaloes than in cattle and the percentage of Methanosphaera- and Methanomassiliicoccus-like methanogens is much higher in cattle than in buffaloes.

In this study the collective comparative diversity of methanogenic archaea in the rumen of cattle and buffaloes was examined by performing a meta-analysis of all the 16S rRNA rrn sequences deposited in GenBank.RESULTS Ruminal methanogen sequences of buffalo were clustered into 900 species-level operational taxonomic units OTUs and ruminal methanogen sequences of cattle were clustered into 1522 species level OTUs.

On the other hand percentages of Methanosphaera- and Methanomassiliicoccus-like methanogens were much higher P  0.05 in cattle than in buffaloes.CONCLUSION This study indicated that there is a substantial difference in community structure of ruminal methanogens of cattle and buffaloes.

The host plays an important role in determining microbial community struc- ture in the rumen.5 Hence development of methane mitigation strategies and improving feed efficiency require comprehensivelivestock respectively.8 With a global population of at least 193 million animals the water buffalo Bubalus bubalis is an important ruminant species in many regions of the world including Asia North Africa southern Europe and South America.9 Compared to cattle the water buffalo is more resistant to disease and parasites and it has a higher adaptability to ambient and local conditions making it a very suitable livestock choice in tropical regions.10 The nutritional value and health benefits of water buffalo meat and milk products are considered by some to be superior to cattle.11 Buffaloes possess an inherent ability to utilize dietary fiber and protein more efficiently than cattle.1213 The buffalo population is showing a faster growth rate than cattle in India.

Thus we hypothesized that the overall diversity of the archaea of cattle and buffalo can be better defined by a comprehensive analysis of all 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences both published and unpublished recovered from rumen of cattle and buffaloes.
