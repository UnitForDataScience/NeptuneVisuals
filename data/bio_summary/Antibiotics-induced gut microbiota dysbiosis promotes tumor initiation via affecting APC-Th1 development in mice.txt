Meanwhile the serum LPS showed statistical decrease after ABX treatment C. ABX treatment triggered disruption of the taxonomy structure of gut microbiota severely which was repre- sented by obvious changes in the fraction of the gut bacteria at phylum levels D. The rarefaction curve of ABX treated sample was also distant below control sample E.Gut microbial dysbiosis compromises host immune defense upon tumor challengeTo testify the potential roles of ABX on the tumor growth ani- mals were subjected to ABX treatment 14 days before tumor challenge and animals receiving water without ABX served as control.

As in spleen proportion of CD11c MHCII and CD11b MHCII APCs also showed reduc- tion in the ABX group compared to that of the control group D and E. In vitro ELISPOT assay revealed the IFNg secreting cells count per 106 splenocytes showed decrease in ABX group compared to that of the control group F. T-cell proliferation was reduced in the ABX group compared to the control group in thepresence of tumor cells however in the absence of tumor cells no statistical difference was identified in the T cell proliferation be- tween the ABX group and control group G. Real-Time PCR showed the mRNA level of Th1 cytokines i.e.

3 in ABX treatment compared with the control.Orally supplemented LPS rescues the immune surveillance on tumor in ABX miceOral supplementation of LPS in ABX treated mice contributed to the decrease of tumor growth which was comparable with control group A.

After ABX treatment the decreased APCs frequency and co-stimulatory function were observed in ABX treated mice and it can be restored by oral administration of LPS in gut microbiota disrupted mice.Materials and methodsCell linesB16F10 melanoma cell line was purchased from Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai China.

The proportion of APCs CD11c MHCII dendritic cell and CD11b MHCII macrophage showed significant decrease in tumor infiltrating leucocytes from the ABX group compared to the control group respectively B and C. Also the proportion of CD4th and CD8th T cells decreased in tumors of ABX group Supplementary Fig.

Similarly the infiltration of CD11c MHC11 and CD11b MHC11 in the tumor of ABX treated mice with LPS was rescued to the level of the control groups C and D. Similarly the mRNA levels of Th1 cytokines in tumor were also rescued E. Moreover the mRNA expression of IL1 IL10 A F480 CD11b CD11c and MHCII in ileum tissues showed significant decrease in the ABX group compared with the control group.

A Tumor growth curve of antibiotics treated with ABX ABX with LPS and control.

Meanwhile the rare- faction curve showed significant decrease in bacterial species in ABX disrupted microbiota indicating that broad-spectrum ABX treatment dramatically decreased gut bacterial loads and depleted more than half of its strains.

Therefore decrease of serum LPS after ABX treatment was mostly contributed by the decrease in this two phylum.Previous study indicated that antibiotic treatment shortened mean survival time of mice with more numerous and larger tumor metastatic foci in the lung  in line with that study our data showed an increase in tumor growth and a shortened palpable tumor latency when B16F10 melanoma cells were implanted sub- cutaneously after two-week ABX treatment.

Administration of a broad spectrum antibiotics combination antibiotics cocktail ABX was applied to induce gut microbiota disruption in C57BL6 mice before B16F10 challenge.
