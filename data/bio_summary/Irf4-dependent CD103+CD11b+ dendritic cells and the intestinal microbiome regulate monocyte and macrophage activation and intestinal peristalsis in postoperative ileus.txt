indeed antibiotic treatment reduced inOS levels and ameliorated POi.Conclusions Our findings reveal that cD103cD11b Dcs and the intestinal microbiome are a prerequisite for the activation of intestinal monocytes and macrophages and for dysregulating intestinal motility in POi.tolerogenic signature.However such conditioning is impaired in acute inflammation so that these cells acquire a proinflammatory signature and induce intestinal diseases.The most frequent adverse condition after intestinal surgery postoperative ileus POI critically depends on the activation of intestinal phagocytes such as macrophages and DCs.We have previously shown in a murine INTRODuCTIONIntestinal phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells DCs are crucial in main- taining gut homeostasisand in regulating intes- tinal motility.Under homeostasis exposure to the luminal microbiota does not induce proinflam- matory responsesbecause these cells possess amodel of POI that surgical injury to the intestinal tract caused intestinal DCs to locally produce the proinflammatory mediator interleukin-12 IL-12 which stimulated memory Th1 cells to produce interferon-g IFNg which in turn activated macro- phages to express inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS.

theirabsence in the intestinal muscularis reduced pathogenic inducible nitric oxide synthase inOS production by monocytes and macrophages and ameliorated POi.Pathogenic inOS was produced in the jejunum by resident ly6c- macrophages and infiltrating chemokine receptor 2-dependent ly6c monocytes but in the colon only by the latter demonstrating differential tolerance mechanisms along the intestinal tract.

In contrast Ly6C monocytes as well as Ly6C- macrophages within the small intestinal muscularis upregulated iNOS after SIM indicating their local activation .Next we analysed the requirement of these iNOS-producing Ly6C- macrophages and Ly6C monocytes for POI by selective targeting.

These findings identify a novel role of this enigmatic intestinal DC subset in a disease model.Macrophages are considered crucial in the regulation of intes- tinal peristalsisand in POI.In particular iNOS production by these cells has been shown to induce POI by directly inhibiting smooth muscle cells.We found a strong CCR2-dependent increase of Ly6C monocytes in the intestine consistent with previous studies in other inflammatory models.These cells resemble recruited Ly6C blood monocytes which can locally be activated to produce proinflammatory mediators.Also in POI they underwent a functional switch from iNOS-negative blood monocytes to iNOS-producing monocytes in the manip- ulated intestinal muscularis.

The small intestinal muscularis of sham-manipulated mice mainly harboured Ly6C-CX CR1high macrophages .tinal immunity.However their role in intestinal disease is3much less understood than that of the other phagocyte subsets.SIM induced a significant increase of cells expressing highlevels of Ly6C but low levels of CX CR1 Ly6CCX CR1lowIn contrast to DCs monocytes and macrophages in the33intestine lack CD103 expression and are defined by expres- sion of F480 CX CR1 and CD64.These cells are further3-high.

These data demonstrate that recruited Ly6C monocytes are essential for colonic POI implying that Ly6C- macrophages are dispensable.ly6C- macrophages in the large intestine are unable to express iNOSNext we wished to clarify why CCR2 deficiency after SIM selectively protected against large intestinal but not against small intestinal POI.

To facilitate detection of Ly6CCX CR1low monocytes also in mice lacking CCR2 welife of 3 weeksand are constantly replaced by blood-derived3 --GFPLy6C monocytes.Hence the majority of intestinal monocytes and macrophages represents a continuum of differen-generated Ccr2Cx3cr1mice.

We found a strong increase of these cells after SIM suggesting that some of these cells might originate from recruited monocytescytes within the manipulated muscularis depends on the recruit- ment of CCR2-dependent Ly6Cblood monocytes.ly6C- macrophages and ly6C monocytes are both sufficient to induce small intestinal POIWe next asked whether Ly6C monocytes andor Ly6C- macro- phages produced pathogenic iNOS in POI.

Indeed depletion of both Ly6C monocytes and Ly6C- macrophages markedly reduced POI  confirming that these iNOS-producing cells are sufficient to induce POI within the small intestine.Only ly6C monocytes induce large intestinal POIWe have shown previously and in that small intestinal POI can spread to non-manipulated large intestinal segments.
