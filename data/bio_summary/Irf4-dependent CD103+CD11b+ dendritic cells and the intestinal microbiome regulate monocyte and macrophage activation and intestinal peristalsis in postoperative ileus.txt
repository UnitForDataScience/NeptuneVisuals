these data indicate that irf4-dependent cd103cd11b dcs locally acti- vate muscularis monocytes and macrophages to produce inos.increase of ly6c monocytes in the manipulated small intestine depends on chemokine receptor 2 ccr2distinct monocytes and macrophages differing in ly6c andcx cr1 expression have been described in the circulation andresponses.dcs expressing cd11b and cd103 develop from3the common flt3l-dependent pre-cdc progenitorby mech-in the intestine.we asked whether inos-producing mono-anisms involving the transcription factors irf4.they are unique to the intestinal tract and have been shown to contribute to intes-cytes or macrophages mediated poi in the intestinal muscu-laris.

these findings identify a novel role of this enigmatic intestinal dc subset in a disease model.macrophages are considered crucial in the regulation of intes- tinal peristalsisand in poi.in particular inos production by these cells has been shown to induce poi by directly inhibiting smooth muscle cells.we found a strong ccr2-dependent increase of ly6c monocytes in the intestine consistent with previous studies in other inflammatory models.these cells resemble recruited ly6c blood monocytes which can locally be activated to produce proinflammatory mediators.also in poi they underwent a functional switch from inos-negative blood monocytes to inos-producing monocytes in the manip- ulated intestinal muscularis.

theirabsence in the intestinal muscularis reduced pathogenic inducible nitric oxide synthase inos production by monocytes and macrophages and ameliorated poi.pathogenic inos was produced in the jejunum by resident ly6c- macrophages and infiltrating chemokine receptor 2-dependent ly6c monocytes but in the colon only by the latter demonstrating differential tolerance mechanisms along the intestinal tract.

in contrast ly6c monocytes as well as ly6c- macrophages within the small intestinal muscularis upregulated inos after sim indicating their local activation .next we analysed the requirement of these inos-producing ly6c- macrophages and ly6c monocytes for poi by selective targeting.

we found a strong reduction of ly6c monocytes whereas the number of ly6c- macrophages and cd103cd11b dcs was not reduced at various time points after depletion  online 3. however depletion of ly6c monocytes did not reduce poi  confirming the find- ings in ccr2-deficient animals .next we hypothesised that inos by ly6c- macrophages are crucial for poi induction.

we found that these cells are absent in the colon  suggesting that the presence of cd103cd11b dcs might be required for inos production by ly6c- macrophages.poi depends on the intestinal microbiotaanother difference between the small and large intestine is the composition and quantity of the microbiota.to investigate the role of the microbiota for the activation of cd103cd11b dcs monocytes and macrophages and the induction of poi we depleted the microbiota by antibiotics online 5. we noted a considerable reduction of il-12  and inos  suggesting that the activation of dcs monocytes and macrophages depends on the microbiota.

indeed antibiotic treatment reduced inos levels and ameliorated poi.conclusions our findings reveal that cd103cd11b dcs and the intestinal microbiome are a prerequisite for the activation of intestinal monocytes and macrophages and for dysregulating intestinal motility in poi.tolerogenic signature.however such conditioning is impaired in acute inflammation so that these cells acquire a proinflammatory signature and induce intestinal diseases.the most frequent adverse condition after intestinal surgery postoperative ileus poi critically depends on the activation of intestinal phagocytes such as macrophages and dcs.we have previously shown in a murine introductionintestinal phagocytes such as macrophages and dendritic cells dcs are crucial in main- taining gut homeostasisand in regulating intes- tinal motility.under homeostasis exposure to the luminal microbiota does not induce proinflam- matory responsesbecause these cells possess amodel of poi that surgical injury to the intestinal tract caused intestinal dcs to locally produce the proinflammatory mediator interleukin-12 il-12 which stimulated memory th1 cells to produce interferon-g ifng which in turn activated macro- phages to express inducible nitric oxide synthase inos.

we found a strong increase of these cells after sim suggesting that some of these cells might originate from recruited monocytescytes within the manipulated muscularis depends on the recruit- ment of ccr2-dependent ly6cblood monocytes.ly6c- macrophages and ly6c monocytes are both sufficient to induce small intestinal poiwe next asked whether ly6c monocytes andor ly6c- macro- phages produced pathogenic inos in poi.

indeed depletion of both ly6c monocytes and ly6c- macrophages markedly reduced poi  confirming that these inos-producing cells are sufficient to induce poi within the small intestine.only ly6c monocytes induce large intestinal poiwe have shown previously and in that small intestinal poi can spread to non-manipulated large intestinal segments.
