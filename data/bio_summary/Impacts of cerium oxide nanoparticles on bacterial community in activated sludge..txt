The diversity index Shannon revealed a fluctuation in diversity as Shannon values for each sam- ples were not inversely proportional to the increase of nCeO2 NP in the reactors as sample containing 40 mgL- nCeO2 had high diversity index 8.178 while those with 30 mgL-nCeO2 NPs was the lowest 7.689.

The Jaccard index exhibited a moderate or no similarity between all bacterial samples ranging with values from 0.479 to 0.999 with the SA 10 mgL and SC 30 mgL bacterial community showing the most similarity 0.479 as compared to others.Table 1 Diversity indices of samples treated with nCeO2 NPs during 5 days of incubationsChange of bacterial community in activated sludge over nCeO2 NP effectsIn the present study Proteobacteria has been noted asthe most predominant phylum in our samples with an average number of reads of 18330 out of 28201 assigned to it in the control samples.

To further investigate the impacts of nCeO2 NPs on the bac- terial communitydiversity it was revealed that 18 phyla were generated from the control samples whereas in the nCeO2 NPs-treatment samples over 11 phyla 13 phyla 10 phyla and 10 phyla in SA 10 mgL SB 20 mgL SC 30 mgL and SD 40 mgL samples respectively.

A further confirmation was noted as the species richness test indicated a drastic decrease of approximately 97.23- 98.48 when comparing the control samples to nCeO2 NP treated samples.When considering the lower taxonomic levels genus it was observed that nCeO2 NPs could mostly affect the bacterial diversity and abundance of bacterialcommunity as the control samples showed 239 genera whereas treated samples have genera decreasing from 123 to 99 genera.

However it is unknown how nCeO2 NPs affect essential activities of these key microorganisms in acti- vated sludge.

Since activated sludge is the most widely used wastewater treatment option the present study aimed at assessing the effect of nCeO2 NPs to activated sludge microorganisms.Materials and methodsBioreactorsFresh activated sludge 1 L each was collected from the Northern Wastewater Works Johannesburg chipped to the laboratory in a cooler box 4C and used within 24 h. The collected activated sludge 100 mL was then inocu- lated in a reactor containing 300 mL of culture media d-glucose anhydrate 2.5 gL MgSO47H2O 0.5 gL and KNO3 0.18 gL in distilled water and treated with differ- ent concentration of CeO2 NPs 10 20 30 and 40 mgL.

In order to assess the impact of cerium oxide nanoparti- cles on the microbial community of wastewater treatment plants the non-treated mixed liquor which contained the mixed liquor medium without nCeO2 NP was used as control.

The correct PCR amplicons of bacteria were pooled together for the respective samples at approximately equimolar concen- trations and submitted to Inqaba Biotechnology Indus- tries South Africa for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq.Enzyme essayIn order to investigate the impact of nCeO2 on functional microbial population in the bioreactor enzymes catalys- ing the degradation of polyphosphate such as adenylate kinase ADK and polyphosphate kinase PPK as well as those involved in the denitrification process namely nitrate reductase NaR and nitrite reductase NiRwere assessed.

Generated data was later made publicly available at the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive DRA under the accession number PSUB005615.ResultsCommunity species richness and diversity indicesThe present study generated approximately 28201 reads from the control samples but when stressed with an increase nCeO2 concentration samples showed an approximately 28.6 decrease 20135 reads to a 57.1 decrease 12082 reads in the samples treated with 10 mgL-CeO2 and 40 mgL-CeO2 respectively.

Similar observation was noted with the operational taxonomic units OTUs as a total of 27967 OTUs was generated from the control samples while the sample with highest nCeO2 NP revealed a total of 6433 OTUs.
