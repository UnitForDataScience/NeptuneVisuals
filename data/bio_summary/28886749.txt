The main conclusions of these studies referred to the absence of a reliable pictorial key to morphologically identify R. sanguineus Latreille 1806 the existence of dif- ferent populations within the morphotype R. sanguineus and the possible confusion with R. turanicus.

Within R. sanguineus s.l.

As no genetic difference using 16S and 12S rDNA fragments was shown between tick speci- mens collected in the sampled regions the possibility that such differences in prevalence of infection could be associ- ated with differences in microbiota within R. sanguineus s.l.

specimens was suggested .To get further insight into bacterial communities hosted by R. sanguineus s.l.

To overcome misinterpretations linked to the controversial taxonomic status all R. sanguineus s.l.

Then high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed to describe the diversity and structure of bacterial communities interact- ing with R. sanguineus s.l.
