nitrogen concentration in the soil sam- ples was measure as follows no3- extracted from soil with 2m kcl was reduced to no - by passage through a column of copperized cadmium and the no - formed was determined colorimetrically by absorbance measurements made at a wavelength of 540 nm .for the purpose of this study four treatments were used treatment 1  n-fertilizer  amino16r treatment 2  amino16r treatment 3  n-fertilizer and treatment 4 crops did not receive n fertilizer or amino16r and coded as no treatment.metagenomic dna was extracted from 10 g of each soil replicate using the nucleospin soil kit macherey-nagel germany following the manufacturer's procedures.

given this situation the qiime pipeline was used in order to construct meaningful operational taxonomic units otus and produce a taxonomic distribution.initially the reads from each sample were joined using the join- pairedends.py command of qiime producing a number of fragments ranging from 727 soil treatment 1 v4 sample to 2622 soil no treatment v2 sample with an average of 1536 fragments per sample.

differences in the relative abundance of those otus between the 4 treatments exist for several proteobacteria and acidobacteria otus which occurred in a higher proportion in the no treatment microbiome compared to the other treatments.hence additional studies are needed in order to enhance our knowledge about the effect of different soil treatments on the soil mi- crobiota with the aim of preserving health and quality of a soil under a specific treatment and at the same time improve plant fitness.acknowledgementwe would like to thank evyp llp and especially mrs. a. michailidou for the support and the offer of amino16r in this research.

moreover the treatment of soil microbiota is emerging as a new strategy in plant breeding to achieve desirable traits.

herein we report metagenomics data for soil microbiota in lettuce lactuca sativa treated with fertilizer amino acids or their combinations as follows n-fertilizer amino16r amino16r n-fertilizer and no treatment control.

dna purity and quantity were also verified by electrophoresis in 1 agarose gels and samples adjusted to 50 ngl.soil dna samples were used to prepare paired-end libraries 2 x 300 bp using 16s rdna 500 cycles illumina san diego ca usa for further shotgun metagenomic sequencing in a high sec 2500 illumina platform illumina san diego ca usa.the concentration of no3-n and the ec was significantly higher in the treatment with n-fertilizer compared with the other treatmentswhile its concentration was significantly reduced in the combination of n fertilizer with amino 16r p  0.001 .

the original number of reads as well as the number of reads after pre- processing is shown in  indicating high quality reads with an average retention rate of 97.86 and a minimum of 95.72.attempting to construct contigs using the trinity suite almost no butterfly assemblies were reported mostly due to the low number of reads used with notable exceptions resulting in very few contigs mostly for the v4 type of reads with a notable exception of the soil treatment 2 v4 which reported 9 contigs ranging between 240 and 340 bp.

ultimately these sequences where clustered into 445 otus which were taxonomically annotated using the silva rrna database .the application of either n-fertilizer or amino 16r in soil cultivated with lettuce plants reduced the relative abundance of proteobacteria and soilbacteriales in each treatment .

the effect of soil im- provement on the lower taxonomical level was not uniform but the relative abundance of the gemmatimonadetes increased in the com- bination treatment n-fertilizer and amino 16r.

soil improvement however reduced the relative abundance of a wide range of bacterial groups in some treatments but had a limited effect in others  however in each treatment application of amino 16r reduced the relative abundance of the acidobacteria.

it is also interesting to men- tion that we found bacteria belonging to nitrospiraceae which are re- duced especially in treatment 2 at the same time archea are also re- duced significantly in treatments 1 2 and 3.otus representing the core microbiome of soil were calculatedseparately for each of the treatments and then summarized .
