Gene gains via recombination have also allowed Staphylococcus aureus ST71 to emerge into a bovine-associated niche .Using contemporary and ancient genomic data from strains of S. saprophyticus we found previously that UTI-associated lineages of S. saprophyticus were not associated with specific gene gains or losses the evolutionary genetic processes underlying the adoption by S. saprophyticus of the human-pathogenic niche are likely more subtle than those previously described for canonical pathogens .

The placement of the 800-year- old strain between bovine-associated and human-associated lineages suggests that it could represent a generalist intermediate between human-adapted and bovid-adapted strains.Core genome analysis of the 58 isolates of S. saprophyticus in our sample showedFIG 2 Recombination in S. saprophyticus.

The roles of adhesins and other virulence factors in the colonization by S. sapro- phyticus of niches in livestock and the environment are also interesting topics for further study.Our demographic analysis of the uropathogenic lineage of S. saprophyticus showed evidence of a population bottleneck and subsequent expansion.
