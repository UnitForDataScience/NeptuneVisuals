methane production as well as current generation data not shown by the reactors at the lower pressure conditions were similar to those at 5 mpa suggesting that catalytic abilities of the bioelectrodes were not affected by the pressure conditions so far tested.phylogenetic analyses of microbial communities associated with the bioelectrodes the microbial communities of the bio- electrodes developed at 5 mpa were examined using pgm ion torrent 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing by targeting the v6 region.

124 2017high-pressure thermophilic electromethanogenic system331study has suggested that the current production between 0.32 to 0.65 v vs. she corresponds to the det-mediated electromethanogesis while the current production at potentials lower than 0.65 v vs. she is likely due to the her-mediated electromethanogenesis e. voltammograms of non- inoculated electrodes showed only background level currents.notably the catalytic behaviors of the bioelectrodes were similar to those observed with the thermophilic biolelectrodes developed at 0.12 mpa in a previous study  further suggesting that these bioelectrodes shares a similar working principle for catalyzing electrochemical reactions in electromethanogenic sys- tems under different pressure conditions.methane production by the electromethanogenic reactor at lower pressures the performance of the electromethano- genesis system developed at 5 mpa was also examined at lower pressures 1.2 and 2.5 mpa the lower limit of the operating pres- sure was around 1 mpa due to maintain the inner pressure of the reactor for gas sampling .

an electromethanogenic system was developed and operated under ahigh-pressure 5 mpa and high-temperature 55oc conditionwhich was similar to the in-situ condition of subsurface reservoirs and bio-electrochemical properties of the system were examined.materials and methodsconstruction of high-pressure single-chamber bes reactors the bes reactor used for incubation under high-pressure conditions was made of stainless steel sus316 equipped with a pressure gage and a sensor-controlled heat jacket to monitor and maintain the pressure and temperature conditions kouka giken kanagawa japan.

yet as previous studies have been mostly done under laboratory ambient conditions knowledge of bes performances under extreme conditions is largely limited .bess operatable under highly pressurized conditions are likelyadvantageous for industrial applications.

thus it was suggested that the electro- methanogenesis system developed under the high-pressure condition shared similar biocatalysts and therefore similar cata- lytic mechanisms with the system developed under the lower- pressure conditions at 0.12 mpa.taken together our results indicated that the electro- methanogenic system can be developed and operated under high- pressure as well as high-temperature conditions thus suggesting that bes applications in high-pressure environments including pressurized reactors and subsurface reservoirs can be technically feasible.

suggests that methane was produced in the electromethanogenesis system developed at 5 mpa in similar manners in  although the ch4- production rate with an applied voltage of 0.3 v was similar to thatwithout an applied voltage the ch4 production was significantly enhanced with an applied voltage of 0.4 v. this was likely because the cathode potential became negative enough for the det- mediated electromethanogenesis resulting in an improvement in the ch4-production rate and current-capture efficiency.

it has been sug-gested that the biocathode can catalyze electromethanogenesis in two different electron-transfer manners depending on the cathode potential first with relatively high cathode potential methane is mainly produced via the det-mediated electromethanogenesis co2 8hth 8e-  ch4 2h2o the theoretical redox potential for the reaction is 0.287 v vs. she.

similarly further acceleration of the ch4 production was detected with an applied voltage of 0.7 v likely corresponding to onset of the her- mediated electromethanogenesis.electrochemical analysis of the bioelectrodes under the high-pressure and high-temperature condition abilities of the bioelectrodes to catalyze electrochemical reactions were evaluated by cv under the high-pressure condition 5 mpa 55oc.
