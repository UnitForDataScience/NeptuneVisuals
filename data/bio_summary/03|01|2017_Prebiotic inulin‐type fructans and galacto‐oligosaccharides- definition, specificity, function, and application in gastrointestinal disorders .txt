crohn's disease is an in- flammatory bowel disease caused by an inappropriate mucosal in- flammatory response against commensal gut microbiota in genetically susceptibility individuals.18animal studies demonstrate the effectiveness of inulin-type fructan prebiotics in treating crohn's disease via beneficial modu- lation of the gut microbiota18 but the evidence in humans is less convincing.

some of the com- mon features of dysbiosis in ibs and crohn's disease are reduced microbial diversity lower bifidobacteria lower bacteroides to firmicutes ratio in ibs and in crohn's disease and decreased faecalibacterium prausnitzii.prebiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

a pilot study of 10 patients showed promise using 15 gd oligofructoseinulin for 3 weeks in active crohn's disease leading to increased bifidobacteria and reduction in disease activ- ity harvey bradshaw index compared with baseline.20 two large rcts using 15 gd oligofructoseinulin in 103 patients with active crohn's disease21 and 20 gd oligofructoseinulin in 67 patients with mildmoderately active or inactive disease22 did not confirm this finding.

two large rcts in active crohn's disease showed no impact of prebiotics on the microbiota and indeed worsened symptoms albeit at high daily doses 15 and 20 gd and only using inulin- type fructans.

furthermore the prebiotic group in the first study had greater severity of symptoms and in the second study had a trend toward greater withdrawal rates due to symptoms.2122 therefore high-dose inulin-type fructans prebiotics may actually worsen symptoms in active crohn's disease perhaps explaining why they also consume lower amounts of naturally occurring fructans and rarely use prebiotic supplements.2324contrasting approaches of prebiotics and the low fodmap diet.

in addition most strains of bifidobacteria produce more than one isotype of these enzymes which would indicate that bifidobacteria have a rapid and broad enzyme response to the pres- ence of this type of prebiotic.2 in vitro studies suggest that bifidobacteria internalize some oligosaccharides prior to digestion.

irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic functional bowel disorder whoseetiology is not entirely understood although a role for the gut mi- crobiota exists including previous gastroenteritis dysbiosis alter- ations in colonic gas production and low-grade inflammation have all been identified in some people with ibs.luminal bifidobacteria are negatively associated with pain in both healthy controls and ibs1617 and bifidobacteria have been found to be lower in ibs compared with healthy controls.1 there- fore as a therapeutic target specific prebiotic-stimulated growth of bifidobacteria is promising.

restriction of naturally occurring dietary prebiotics including fructans and gos improves functional gut symptoms but impacts on the gut microbiota reducing saccharolytic bacteria and specifically bifidobacteria.

human milk oligosaccharides found naturally in human breast milk have some structural similarities to b-gos and lead to greater number of bifidobacteria in breastfed babies.1 however whilst inulin-type fructans occur naturally within many plant-based foods no studies have investigated whether naturally occurring prebiotics in foods spe- cifically impact the gut microbiota.

effect of oligofructose-enriched inulin of-in on bacterial composition and disease activity of patients with crohn's disease results from a double-blinded randomised controlled trial.

consistent prebiotic effect on gut microbiota with altered fodmap intake in patients with crohn's disease a randomised controlled cross-over trial of well-defined diets.

symptom relief measured as a global assessment was significantly improved compared with placebo in both groups receiving the prebiotic but the lower dose re- sulted in lower symptoms scores flatulence bloating and stool con- sistency when individual symptoms were assessed and clustered.19 therefore the type and dose of prebiotics are likely to be important when considering prebiotic use in ibs.prebiotics in crohn's disease.

caccae to the b. thetaiotaomicron nullified this effect demon- strating that this gene cluster contains the required genomic ma- chinery for efficient and preferential inulin utilization.numerous studies have demonstrated that supplementation with inulin-type fructans increases the growth of bifidobacteria in healthy humans.1 a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study of 30 healthy volunteers supplemented with 5 or 8 gd inulin for 2 weeks increased bifidobacteria with both doses.

a higher number of bifidobacteria at baseline led to a reduced response to supplementa- tion indicating that inulin supplementation has a more marked ef- fect on those with low initial concentrations of bifidobacteria.7genetic mechanisms for b-gos specificity have been identified within bifidobacteria.
