Furthermore the prebiotic group in the first study had greater severity of symptoms and in the second study had a trend toward greater withdrawal rates due to symptoms.2122 Therefore high-dose inulin-type fructans prebiotics may actually worsen symptoms in active Crohn's disease perhaps explaining why they also consume lower amounts of naturally occurring fructans and rarely use prebiotic supplements.2324Contrasting approaches of prebiotics and the low FODMAP diet.

Crohn's disease is an in- flammatory bowel disease caused by an inappropriate mucosal in- flammatory response against commensal gut microbiota in genetically susceptibility individuals.18Animal studies demonstrate the effectiveness of inulin-type fructan prebiotics in treating Crohn's disease via beneficial modu- lation of the gut microbiota18 but the evidence in humans is less convincing.

Symptom relief measured as a global assessment was significantly improved compared with placebo in both groups receiving the prebiotic but the lower dose re- sulted in lower symptoms scores flatulence bloating and stool con- sistency when individual symptoms were assessed and clustered.19 Therefore the type and dose of prebiotics are likely to be important when considering prebiotic use in IBS.Prebiotics in Crohn's disease.

Some of the com- mon features of dysbiosis in IBS and Crohn's disease are reduced microbial diversity lower bifidobacteria lower bacteroides to firmicutes ratio in IBS and in Crohn's disease and decreased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.Prebiotics in irritable bowel syndrome.

A pilot study of 10 patients showed promise using 15 gd oligofructoseinulin for 3 weeks in active Crohn's disease leading to increased bifidobacteria and reduction in disease activ- ity Harvey Bradshaw Index compared with baseline.20 Two large RCTs using 15 gd oligofructoseinulin in 103 patients with active Crohn's disease21 and 20 gd oligofructoseinulin in 67 patients with mildmoderately active or inactive disease22 did not confirm this finding.

Two large RCTs in active Crohn's disease showed no impact of prebiotics on the microbiota and indeed worsened symptoms albeit at high daily doses 15 and 20 gd and only using inulin- type fructans.

Further re- search is required on the effect of prebiotics in gastrointestinal disorders and in particular on their use in conjunction with the low FODMAP diet.IntroductionThe prebiotic effect is defined as the selective stimulation of growth andor activityies of one or a limited number of microbial genus eraspecies in the gut microbiota that confers health benefits to the host.1 While much attention is now focussed on dietary restric- tion of fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccha- rides and polyols low FODMAP diet for the management of functional gastrointestinal symptoms the removal of these naturally occurring prebiotic fibers has a marked impact on the gut microbiome with unknown long-term health effects.

Consistent prebiotic effect on gut microbiota with altered FODMAP intake in patients with Crohn's disease a randomised controlled cross-over trial of well-defined diets.

Di- etary restriction of fermentable carbohydrates low FODMAP diet which restricts some nat- urally occurring prebiotics from the diet has shown efficacy in improving symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome but it lowers the numbers of some key gut microbiota.
