Given the extensive body of evidence linking mental stress to adverse cardiovascular outcomes10 and data indicating that chronic stress induces changes in intestinal epithelial permiability11 as well as in the gut microbiome could changes in the intestinal epithelium play a mechanistic role in the transducing mental stress into increased cardiovascular risk More expansively could changes in gut permeability be another dimension to the mechanisms of action of multiple additional risk factors for hypertension that alter sympathetic nerve activityOne of the implications of the current work and that of others in this field is that there are now new opportunities to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting the intestinal epithelium to treat or even prevent hypertension.

Most simplistically could sympatholytic agents have a positive impact on the integrity of the intestinal mucosa If we had a better understanding of the mechanism responsible for the reduction in tight junction proteins could we employ an even more targeted approach by searching for agents that protect the integrity of the intestinal epithelium These types of approaches could have broad impact on the ultimate impact of risk factors that alter intestinal permeability and could extend well beyond cardiovascular disease to the growing list of human conditions associated with alterations in the gut microbiome.This manuscript by Santisteban et al.

Finally they have shown that the changes in sympathetic activity resulting in increased gut permeability are also associated with an increase in inflammatory cells within the intestinal wall thus potentially bringing the contributions of the immune system to hypertension into this pathophysiological mechanism.One question raised by this manuscript is the potential relationship between increased gut permeability and changes in the gut microbiome.

However from earlier observations using mice grown in germ-free environments to more recent advances in identifying unique metabolic products of the gut microbiome1 the data have led to a compelling story linking cardiovascular disease to the trillions of prokaryotic organisms that live in the human gut.In this issue of Circulation Research Santisteban et al2 have provided provocative data demonstrating very definitively that in two different animal models of hypertension there is decreased expression of several tight junction proteins in the gut and a concomitant increase in intestinal permeability.

How this could occur is not at all clear but in the current paper the authors noted that mesenteric blood flow was decreased a phenomenon that has been long been associated with increased intestinal permeability.4 A similar relationship between changes in gut permeability and dysbiosis has been reported with alcohol abuse.5 However it was hypothesized that phenolic compounds from tyrosine breakdown by the bad bacteria resulted in disruption of the gut epithelial barrier not vice versa.

Whatever the initial sequence there is a clear case for multiple synergistic factors functioning in a positive feedback loop involving increased permeability of the gut intestinal epithelium and dysbiosis which ultimately affords the products of an imbalanced gut microbiome access to human host.The nature of the products of the microbiome that are potentially released into the host is potentially vast and includes short chain fatty acids SCFAs polyamines and activators of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor among a myriad of other potential candidates.

Indeed the data suggest that as a result of increased gut permeability a variety of substance produced by the intestinal microbiota will gain access to their human host and ultimately lead to hypertension and potentially some of the pathological consequences of the disease.

A better understating of the pathological metabolites produced by the gut microbiota defining the mechanisms responsible for the development of dysbiosis and the molecular mechanisms linking increased sympathetic nerve activity to increased intestinal permeability are important next steps in gain a better understanding of the fundamental causes of hypertension and insights into potential novel therapeutic strategies.AcknowledgmentsRobert Taylor has developed intellectual property related to devices used for fecal transplantation.SupportThis work was supported by NIH PO1 HL095070ReferencesKoeth RA Wang Z Levison BS Buffa JA Org E Sheehy BT Britt EB Fu X Wu Y Li L Smith JD DiDonato JA Chen J Li H Wu GD Lewis JD Warrier M Brown JM Krauss RM Tang WH Bushman FD Lusis AJ Hazen SL.

Santisteban et al2 reported that there was a significant increase in T cells and monocytesmacrophages in the intestinal epithelium which suggests a potential relationship with the immunological responses that exist in the intestinal mucosa.
