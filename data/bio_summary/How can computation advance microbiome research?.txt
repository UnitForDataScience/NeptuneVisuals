It almost seems like every day inspiring observations come to light.Consider for example the possible link that was observed between gut bacteria of mice and Parkinson disease in which changes in the bacteria populating the gut apparently appear to be associated with a decline in motor skills.

How can computations further speed up the pace of microbiome research as it dashes farther scaling higher summits What can computations accomplish What questions can computations help address and what types of algorithms and software should computational biologists aim to develop These are tantalizing questions that many of us are facing probably in particular new groups aiming to venture into a relatively nascent and fast-developing area that promises rapid accumulation of data emergence of alluring new concepts and significant discoveries.

In another striking discovery it was found that gut bacteria may have a role in autism and curiously there is evidence that a single species of gut bacteria can reverse autism-related social behavior in mice .

A remarkable earlier study suggested that Parkinson disease may start in the stomach because people who had their vagus nerve cut to treat gastric ulcers exhibited a lower risk of Parkinson disease than those whose treatment involved only a partial dissection .

Together we look forward to making a difference.ReferencesSampson TR Debelius JW Thron T Janssen S Shastri GG Ilhan ZE et al.
