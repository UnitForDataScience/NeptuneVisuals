The Alcanivorax and Escherichia genera are more abundant in water meta- genomes while Streptomyces is more abundant in terres- trial metagenomes.Functional comparison of terrestrial and water samples revealed that some cyclic hydrocarbon degradation path-ways namely toluene chlorocyclohexane chlorobenzene and nitrotoluene degradation are significantly more abun- dant in terrestrial metagenomes while linear hydrocarbon degradation pathways as alkane degradation and cyto- chrome P450 metabolism are significantly more abundant in water ecosystems.

Furthermore the functional analysis of this study shows the predominance of the linear alkanes degradation pathway fatty acid degradation in water metagenomes and the predominant degradation genes of P450.

This is probably due to the high incidence of the Alcanivorax genus that has a highly restricted genome of catabolic enzyme since this organism uses predominantly aliphatic hydrocarbons as a source of carbon and energy and has several well-annotated genes encoding for AlkB1 and AlkB2 and Cytochrome P450  Furthermore Alcanivorax and Streptomyces are signifi- cantly abundant in clusters with a prevalence of genes involved in biosurfactant synthesis and hydrocarbon degradation which have also already been reported as biosurfactant producers -Moreover other studies noted the predominance of aro- matic compound degradation genes in soil  when compared to alkane degradation genes AlkB.

Although biogeographical studies of hydrocarbon degradation genes predominate in the literature there is a relative lack of knowledge about the distribution of bacteria producing bio- surfactants in the environment The synergic effects of biosurfactants on solubility sorption and biodegradation of hydrophobic organic contaminants are known as they play an important role during biodegradation processes Biosurfactants can be synthesized by a myriad of microorganisms which is influenced by the composition of the medium and envir- onmental conditions However because most studies of geographic distribution of bacteria oil-degrading genes in environments rely on the analysis of biomes that have been contaminated or enriched with crude oil the understanding of the origin abundance and natural role of degradation and surfactant genes on an ecosys- tem   has been hampered.International microbial surveys - are good examples of large-scale coordinated efforts to explore soil and water taxonomic and functional diversity.

Two filters were used a minimal q-value of 0.05 and a minimum difference of proportions of 1 program defaults.ResultsQuality assessmentFrom the initial dataset of 71 metagenomics samples 24 samples were discarded by failing the quality assessment and 46 samples from the several biomes shown in Table were used for further analysis.

At this stage of the data analysis it was not possible to guarantee a uniform number of samples per biome because for many of the projects the samples were not of acceptable quality.Taxonomy annotation using RefSeqFor the 46 samples the metagenomes annotations were obtained by using the alignment program LAST to com- pare the metagenomic sequences with the RefSeq protein database.

The third cluster is also formed by water metagenomes but from tropical regions.These results validate the samples for consistency as the samples from the same metagenomes are in the same clusters.
