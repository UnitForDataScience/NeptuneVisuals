patterns and concen- trations of secondary bile acids 44 or possibly carotenoid absorption or degradation patterns 45 though it is not sure if a significant fraction of carotenoids can be ab- sorbed from the colon 46.Effects of individual carotenoids on the absorption bind- ing transport and bioactivation of other carotenoids as well as selective absorption binding transport and bioac- tivation of individual carotenoids 33.Any factor associated with vitamin Aretinoid storage and metabolism.Thus as individual responses can depend on many vary- ing factors it is paramount to understand these and their influence on the biological variability of carotenoid ADME.

Future research should focus on correlating carotenoid intake with carotenoid levels in the individual further metabolic conversion to bioactive oxidative carotenoid metabolites and the identification and quantifica- tion of marker genes related to beneficial health effects.Conclusion and perspectiveInterindividual carotenoid variability following intervention studies with dietary carotenoids has been investigated in a number of body compartments including digesta chylomi- crons blood skin and the retina.

In human ker- atinocyte cells it was shown that various CYP enzymes me- tabolized all-trans retinoic acid and cis-isomers into water soluble products 246.Disease conditions altering carotenoid turnoverSeveral clinical conditions related to carotenoid status affect carotenoid concentrations in human plasma in addition to those involved in hampering carotenoid uptake see chap- ter 3.4.

When focussing on health related ef- fects of carotenoids the focus should be placed on correlat-ing carotenoid intake with resulting endogenous carotenoid metabolite levels and their effects on nuclear hormone receptor mediated signaling not merely on the concentra- tions of the native carotenoids however data on these are still scant.

How- ever blood plasmaserum alone may not constitute the best indicator to assess carotenoid status and additional methods such as isotopic labelling similar as for retinoids 16 or easy accessible compartments such as white blood cells 17 or buccal cells 18 may allow for more insights regarding en- dogenous carotenoid levels carotenoid compartments and turnover 19.This intra- and interindividual variability can be attributedin addition to dietary habits 20 21 to host-related factors Table 1 including disease state 22-24 possibly physical activity 25 26 being overweightobese 26 alcohol use25 27 28 smoking habits 26 drug intake 29 age 30 and genetic aspects 31 32.

As most studies do not directly measure carotenoid absorption effi- ciency but rather look at blood carotenoid levels or a plasma fraction it is important to distinguish between direct effects on carotenoid absorption i.e.

In addition we tried to empha- size connections between the individual carotenoid levels in the organisms and their bioactivation resulting in oxidative carotenoid cleavage metabolites mainly retinoids and fur- ther mediation of transcriptional signaling of health related marker genes.In the future studies should aim at identifying additional SNPs related to carotenoid ADME parameters to increase our knowledge on the contribution of genetic variations to interindividual variability.

On the other hand breast adipose tissue carotenoid concentrations from tumor patients were significantly related to serum concentra- tions and were highest for 3-cryptoxanthin 3.5 umolkg 3-carotene 2.3 umolkg and lutein 1.8 umolkg not indi- cating a considerable change of patterns 237.Kidney concentrations as other organ carotenoid levels appear more variable than plasma concentrations and have been reported to be in the range of 0.2-12.7 nmolg for to- tal carotenoids 173.

Again host related factors especially those regarding the genetic variations of the proteins mention above might have impact on carotenoid distribution in these tissues.Host factors interacting with carotenoid storage and excretion pathwaysStorage and turnover aspectsVery little is known on the metabolism of especially non- provitamin A carotenoids in xenobiotic pathways and on the extent of degradation and elimination of the parent com- pounds 238.

with other antioxidants such as polyphenols a larger array of natural occurring carotenoids compared to single carotenoids in high amounts presenta- tion in the form of carotenoid supplements powder solid matrix and continuous intake in case of supplements in- fluence absorption distribution metabolism and excretion ADME and therefore also their bioactivity.
