The most prominent genera in the gut included the genera Shigella Escherichia Yersinia all enterobacteria and Bacillus  third panel from the top while unidentified genera of Microbac- teriaceae Actinobacteria and the genera Flavobacterium and Limnohabitans were dominant in the water samples  bottom.None of the OTUs were present in all of the gut samples and only 14 were observed in 50 of the gut samples.

Our results also demonstrate the importance of abiotic environmental factors and host size in the assemblage of the gut microbiome of fish and the relative insig- nificance of the host genotype and gender.KEYWORDS 16S rRNA gene fragment-based microbiome host-gut microbial community interactions proliferative kidney diseaseNovemberDecember 2017 Volume 2 Issue 6 e00418-17msphere.asm.org 1he interaction between microbiome diversity and host fitness has gained consid- erable attention among biologists in last decade as host microbiomes including those in the gastrointestinal tract GIT play critical roles in the host including pro- moting health and providing resistance to opportunistic pathogens .

However we do not know whether the GIT microbiota influences the progression of PKD in salmonids and more generally to what extent parasites affect the composition function and metabolic activity of the GIT microbiota in wild vertebrate populations.FIG 1 Shown are the numbers of predicted OTUs S.ACE index where S stands for species in both river water samples and fish gut microbiomes grouped in a box plot with median 25 and 75 quartiles and outliers topContinued on next pageThe purpose of this study was to test if the abundance of T. bryosalmonae and the severity of PKD associate with the richness of bacteria in the GITs of juvenile trout collected from 10 genetically distinct but geographically close populations.

The most strongly decreased OTUs in T. bryosalmonae-infected fish were close relatives of bacteria of the genus Yersinia that are found in the bacterial communities in healthy skin tissues  and the gut microbiome of insects.DISCUSSIONThe GIT of fish supports a complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem that is intimately linked to host nutrient acquisition epithelial development immune system priming and disease prevention.

The graph in the middle shows the relationships of the gut microbiome to measured environmental variables for details see Table S1 and the symbols are sample scores of gut samples.

Thisindicates that both the habitat and abiotic environmental factors are important drivers of microbiome differentiation in the fish gut  .Similar to an earlier report  both the length and the mass of fish showed significant relationships with the GIT microbiome.

These observations corroborate that the dominant bacteria in the streams are typical ubiquitous freshwater organisms.Typical phyla found in the GIT communities belong to Proteobacteria Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi  second panel from the top however few OTUs are shared by phyla abundant in both stream water and GIT communities.
