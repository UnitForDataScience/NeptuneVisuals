Addi- tionally this pathogen has a highly complex genome with widespread aneuploidy  the variation in mucosal inhibition between different B. dendrobatidis isolates dem- onstrated here may be linked to differential phenotypic or genotypic traits associated with these isolates as has been suggested in other studies .Overall most B. dendrobatidis isolates showed reduced growth in the presence of mucosomes from both species .

Mucosomes were challenged against eight B. dendrobatidis GPL isolates using an in vitro spectrophotometer assay method adapted from Bell et al.

It has previously been shown that individual bacteria isolated from amphibian skin also show variation in their ability to inhibit across a range of B. dendrobatidis isolates - suggesting that the bacteria or their metabolites within the mucosome play a role in determining inhibition of a given isolate of B. den- drobatidis.

Almost all B. dendrobatidis isolates were inhibited when challenged with mucosome fromdelalandii with the exception of two isolates that showed negligible growth or inhibition South Africa 1a and UK2 .

There were significant differences in A. delalandii mucosome inhibition among B. dendrobatidis isolates Kruskall-Wallace chi-squared21.686 d.f.7 P0.003 and a Dunn post hoc analysis indicated significant differen- ces among a number of isolates .

The Dunn pairwise comparisons  show that UK1 was significantly different to all other isolates of GPL with the exception of South Africa 1b which was sig- nificantly different to the Spain and Sardinia isolates.Together these results show that the growth of different iso- lates of B. dendrobatidis GPL varies significantly in the presence of amphibian mucosomes and that there is some variation in mucosome inhibition between host species across the range of isolates.
