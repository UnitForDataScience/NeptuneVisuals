In or- der to demonstrate the causal relationship and the functional capacities of gut microbiota associated with food degradation strict control experiments should be performed using multiple approaches.The relationship between gut microbiota and host phylogenyVarious internal and external factors have been identified that influence the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota including host phylogeny gut morphology diet disease state geography and body weight Ba ckhed et al.

Our results thus suggest the gut microbial composition is associated with host phylogeny and further suggest that dissimilarity of animal gut microbiota may predict host divergence time.Keywords Glires lagomorphs rodents gut microbiota host divergence timeINTRODUCTIONAnimals and microbes have likely been coevolving since animals first diverged from their protist ancestor 700-800 million years ago McFall-Ngai et al.

Therefore the gut microbiota may be thought of as an extended phenotype of the host.Differences in the composition of the gut microbiota as an extended phenotype may result from neutral host divergence natural selection acting on the gut microbiota or both.

Although there are intensive reports on the evolutionary history of the clade Glires little is known regarding the gut microbial ecology of these ani- mals and the relationship between host phylogeny and gut mi- crobiota.In order to understand the relationship between host phy- logeny of Glires and their gut microbiota we examined the com- position including core microbial taxa and diversity of the gut microbiota in the clade Glires.

Accordingly the gut microbiota may be significant in the diver- sification of host species.Our previous work has explored the relationship between pika gut microbiota and diet Li et al.

Thus diet may also explain the differences of phylogenetic relationship in host-gut micro- biota.Differences in the gut microbiota as an extended phenotype may result from neutral host divergence natural selection act- ing on the gut microbiota or both Sanders et al.

The weighted UniFrac and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metrics were compared with the distance matrix of the host genes COI and cytb using Mantel's test in order to test the correlations between the host phylogeny and gut microbiota.

The Mantel test between the distance metrics of host genes and weighted UniFrac or Bray- Curtis dissimilarity showed a significant overall correlation be-tween host phylogeny and gut microbiota r  0.406 P  0.05r  0.431 P  0.05 respectively.

These results provided key information for un- derstanding the relationship between gut microbiota and host phylogeny.The implications of functionally variable gut communities in Glires evolutionSeveral studies have indicated that core bacteria may have evolved in close association with the host and are potentially commensal or beneficial Turnbaugh and Gordon  Mar- tinson et al.
