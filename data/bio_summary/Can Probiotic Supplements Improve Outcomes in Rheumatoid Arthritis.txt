The only positive trend was a within group improve- ment in HAQ in the probiotic group.

The authors noted that their study differed from all previous studies in that clinical and bio- chemical measures showed significant differences attrib- utable to probiotic use.

The DAS28 improved in both groups probiotic4.0 - 0.7 to 3.7 - 0.7 p  0.001 control 4.1 - 0.7 to4.0 - 0.7 p  0.31 and the improvement was statistically significantly better in the probiotic group than in the pla- cebo group p  0.01 but did not represent a clinically meaningful change in either group.

The hs-CRP fell in the probiotic group 7.27 - 6.24 to6.61 - 6.03 p  0.25 and rose in the control group 6.02 - 5.78 to 9.09 - 7.46 p  0.001 and the difference was statistically significant p  0.001.

The insulin level and homeostatic model assessment B HOMA-B a mea- sure of beta cell function declined in the probiotic group and rose in the control group p  0.3.

No statistically significant change inclinical outcomes measures though TJC SJC patient and physician GA improved among probiotic usersNo statistically significant improvement in inflammatory biomarkersBorderline statistically significant improvement in pain scale in HAQ-DIThough a trend towards reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines was seen among patients taking probiotics thisreduction was generally greater among the placebo group with statistically significant difference in favor of the placebo group seen in IL-15 IL-17 GM-CSF andMIP-1a.No statistically significant difference in clinical outcomes though physician GA patient pain and HAQ improved more among probiotic users than within the placebo group ACR-20 response was reached by 20 of probiotics users vs 7 within the placebo group.YesYes in favor of placebo group onlyAlipour B.et al.

Kolasinski1Published online 2 November 2017 Springer ScienceBusiness Media LLC 2017AbstractPurpose of Review The purpose of this review is to frame the discussion of the potential use of probiotics for the manage- ment of rheumatoid arthritis RA in the historical and scien- tific context linking the human microbiota to the etiology pathogenesis and treatment of RA.

The human microbiome is a term that encompasses all microorganisms living in and on the human body as well as the interactions that have arisen from the co-evolution of microbial life with other microbes and with us their human hosts.

The decades leading up to the launch of the HMP were marked by revolutionary scientific developments advancingThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Sharon L. Kolasinski 1 Division of Rheumatology University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine  Penn Musculoskeletal Center 3737 Market Street Philadelphia PA 19104 USAmolecular approaches to the study of genomics followed by breakthrough data covering the genomic sequences of myriad microorganisms and finally of the human genome when the first draft sequence was published in 2001 by two research teams  .

The early studies identifying the human intestinal microbiome exposed its complexity and characterized the remarkable inter-subject variability in gene content and encoded functional attributes   .
