Our data clearly demonstrates the gut microbiota associated with insects resistant to insecticides offers a rich environment for the isolation of potential microbials for bioremediation against target compounds.The association of different bacterial species with the gut of insecticide resistant lines of S. frugiperda able to grow on selective media based on insecticides the host insect was resistant against indicates the gut microbiota of S. frugiperda is also under pressure during the directed selection of resistant lines.

We hypothesized the gut microbiota associated with insect-resistant lines carry pesticide degrading bacteria and predicted they carry bacteria selected to degrade pesticides they were resistant to.

As current data have demonstrated that phenotypes are the result of the expression of the genomes of all organisms living in a close association  we hypothesized that labora- tory insect strains selected for insecticide resistance would also carry bacteria selected to degrade the pesticides their hosts were selected against and as such serve as potential new sources for the target-oriented selection of bacteria for bioremediation applications.Materials and methodsInsectsField populations of Spodoptera frugiperda have been exposed to F2 screening procedure for selection of genotypes and establishment of resistant lines  to pyrethroid deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin organophosphate chlorpyrifos ethyl naturalyte spinosad and to chitin synthesis inhibitor lufenuron.

Scale bar indicates 0.02 substitutions per nucleotide position.Growth of insecticide-degrading bacterial isolates obtained from the gut microbiota of strain of Spodoptera frugiperda resistant to the insecticides chlorpyrifos ethyl A lambda-cyhalothrin B deltamethrin C spinosad D and lufenuron E when cultured in minimum medium M9 added of 10 mgmL of the insecticide the host insect strain was resistant to.. Isolates obtained from the gut of larvae resistant to several insecticides such as E. mundtii e E. casseliflavus were not as competitive to grow on insecticide-based media .Isolates with the best growth performance were further selected to investigate their growth response under different concentrations of insecticide.

While contribution of primary obligate insect-associated bacteria is basically related to nutrient provisioning to the host insect secondary facultatively insect-associated bacteria may influence a range of fitness traits of their host insect including host nutrition.

Each treatment was replicated three times and each sampling time was done in technical triplicates.Bacterial growth under different concentrations of insecticidesDose-dependent studies of the effects of insecticides on the growth of the isolated bacteria were conducted only for the best growing bacteria obtained from the previous experiment.

Chlorpyrifos ethyl was the least used 27 while spinosad mainly the spinosyn D fraction was the most used by bacteria 77 .DiscussionWe demonstrate the gut of insecticide-resistant lines of S. frugiperda is a successful environ- ment for the isolation of insecticide-degrading bacteria revealing an underexplored niche for the search of microbials targeted to biodegradation applications.

We isolated and accessed the pesticide-degrad- ing capacity of gut bacteria from the gut of fifth instars of Spodoptera frugiperda strains resistant to lambda-cyhalothrin deltamethrin chlorpyrifos ethyl spinosad and lufenuron using insecticide-selective media.

In conclusion resistant strains of S. frugiperda are an excellent reservoir of insecticide-degrad- ing bacteria with bioremediation potential.
