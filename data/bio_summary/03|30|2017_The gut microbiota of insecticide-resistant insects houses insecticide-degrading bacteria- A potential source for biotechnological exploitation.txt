our data clearly demonstrates the gut microbiota associated with insects resistant to insecticides offers a rich environment for the isolation of potential microbials for bioremediation against target compounds.the association of different bacterial species with the gut of insecticide resistant lines of s. frugiperda able to grow on selective media based on insecticides the host insect was resistant against indicates the gut microbiota of s. frugiperda is also under pressure during the directed selection of resistant lines.

we also demonstrated that lines resistant to different insecticides carry particular gut symbionts capable of exploring the source insecticide as a food resource.more than 120 bacterial morphotypes were isolated from the gut of s. frugiperda larvae resistant to insecticides .

all samples were run in biological triplicates and averages within each treatment were compared by a t test p  0.05.resultsselective isolation of insecticide-degrading bacteriasupplementation of the basal medium mm9 with insecticides was very efficient to sustain the growth of gut bacteria adapted to such substrates as their nutritional resource from the gut of resistant lines of s. frugiperda but no bacterial isolates were obtained from the gut of suscepti- ble larvae .

no bacterial growth was obtained from cultivation of the gut microbiota of susceptible larvae of this species even though the microbiota of resistant and susceptible larvae share different phenotypes of identical phylotypes.

more we investigate on the role of bacterial associations with insects more we learn on how diverse their contribution to insects is.

secondary bacterial symbionts improve host immune response to entomophages - and entomo- pathogens - influence host plant selection  provide protection against heat stress  and contribute to the process of detoxification of metabolites produced for plant defense against herbivores -.

bacteria have been exploited as one of the main targets for the development of biotechnological products that could be used in such applications and contaminated soils are usually the source of potential bacterial candidates for bioremediation of contaminated areas -.the exploration of new niches as sources of new microorganisms or microorganisms with higher potential for degradation of xenobiotics remains a necessity.
