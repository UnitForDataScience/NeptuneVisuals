In a word all the results suggested that FBTPS could pass through the digestive system without being broken down by saliva simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion and reach the large intestine safely thus it was expected that gut bacteria could use it.Fermentation of FBTPS by gut microbiotaIt has been reported that indigestible polysaccharides by gastric and small intestinal fluids could be broken down and utilized by gut mi- crobiota .

Thus these polysaccharides could serve as main energy and carbon source for gut microbiota and stimulate their growth to yield healthy compounds such as SCFAs  .Basic information of FBTPS fermentation in vitro by gut microbiotaThe fermentation of FBTPS by gut microbiota in vitro was evaluated by possible changes in molecular weight during the fermentation 6 12 and 24 h. As expected it was obvious that the response of FBTPS in HPLC significantly decreased with the increase of fermentation time .

The content of carbohydrate was significantly decreased by fermentation in vitro of gut mi- crobiota suggesting that FBTPS could be broken down and utilized by gut microbiota.

Knowledge about the relationships among FBTPS gut microbiota and bacterial metabolites can be beneficial for health im- provement and disease prevention through modulating the gut micro- biota.

It has been reported that Bifidobacterium was undetectable in gut microbiota of pigs fed with pectin or mice fed with Ganoderma lucidum poly- saccharides  .Effects of FBTPS on production of SCFAsSCFAs such as acetic lactic propionic n-butyric i-butyric n-va- leric and i-valeric acids are the main fermentation products of poly- saccharides metabolized by gut microbiota.

Moreover the present results showed that FBTPS could slowly release its function of modulating the gut microbiota but not suddenly changing the gut microenvironment.

FBTPS could significantly modulate the composition and abundance of gut microbiota.
