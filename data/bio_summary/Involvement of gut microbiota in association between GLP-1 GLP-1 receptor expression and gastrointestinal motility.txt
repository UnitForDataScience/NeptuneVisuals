Thus since GI neural cells play a role in GI tract motility GLP-1 may modify GI motility by stimulating neural cells in the GI wall.To examine the role of the gut microbiota in the GLP-1 GLP-1R axis we used GF mice with FT.

The number of GLP-1R-positive cells in the GI wall of GF mice with FT was significantly decreased relative to the age-matched GF control mice suggesting that the FT treatment had led to a reduction of GLP-1R-positive neuron cells throughout the GI wall Fig.

B-D immunostaining using anti- GLP-1R antibody B the supernatant after the absorption of anti-GLP-1R anti- body C and no anti-GLP-1R antibody D. Immunoreactivity for GLP-1R is observed in the neural cells in the muscular layer in the colon B but not in cells when immunostained using the supernatant C or no GLP-1R antibody D.treatment has a suppressive effect on the number of myenteric neural cells in the GI wall of GF mice.

B changes in the number of GLP-1-positive cells in the colon of GF mice without open bars or with filled bars FT GF and age-matched GF mice at 6 and 10 wk of age respectively.

B changes in the number of GLP-1R-positive cells in the gastrointestinal tract of GF mice without open bars or with filled bars FT GF and age-matched GF mice at 6 and 10 wk of age respectively.

C number of S100- and GLP-1R-positive cells in the gastrointestinal tract of GF mice without or with fecal transplantation FT. Open bars age-matched GF mice without FT filled bars GF mice 28 days after FT. All results are expressed as means - SE of 3 samples.

GLP-1R-positive cells throughout the GI wall were significantly fewer in GF mice with FT than in GF mice without gut microbiota reconstitution.

GITT was significantly shorter in GF mice with FT than in control GF mice without FT and correlated with the number of GLP-1R-positive cells throughout the GI wall.

3B.Behavior of myenteric neural cells expressing GLP-1R in GF mice with FT. We next examined whether FT treatment affects the number of myenteric neural cells in the GI wall.
