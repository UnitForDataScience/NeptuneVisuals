A Observed diversity index B Shannon diversity index.community structures between nursing home and community participants by body site showed that samples of nursing home participants clustered with overlap to the community participants .

The throat microbiota was less diverse in nursing home participants streptococci were more abundant and Prevotella was less abundant in nursing home participants than in community participants.

Our finding supports the rationale for improved hygiene in nursing home residents to reduce the risk of infection and transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms such as vancomyin-resistant enterococci or resistant GNR.We also found a pattern of decreased abundance of specific Proteobacteria in nursing home participants at the anterior nares and both skin sites compared with the community participants.

This could be because our sample size of nursing home participants was too small to detect a difference if one existed or more likely it could be because we recruited a relatively healthy group of nursing home participants as we excluded those with antibiotic use in the past 3 months.

We found that the microbiota composi- tion of the different body sites was similar between nursing home and community participants but we identified differences in relative abundance levels.

The nursing home NH participants were older more likely to be male have diabetes and have an indwelling medical device compared to the community partic- ipants.

Of note the samples from community and nursing home partici- pants overlapped completely with unweighted UniFrac analysis which scores the presence or absence of taxa but not with weighted UniFrac analysis which scores the relative abundance of taxa.

The eight ellipses represent 95 confidence intervals for clustered specimens from older adults from the nursing home and community study populations at each of the four body sites.

S. epidermidis Corynebacterium and Achromobacter were the most abundant bacterial taxa in the femoral skin.We identified a number of OTUs that were significantly differentially abundant between nursing home and community participants .

On the skin above the subclavian vein numerous OTUs predominantly Proteobacteria were decreased in nursing home participants compared to community participants.
