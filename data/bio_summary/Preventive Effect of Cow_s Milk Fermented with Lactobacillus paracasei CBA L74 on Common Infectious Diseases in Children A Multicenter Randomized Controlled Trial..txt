As an inactivated probiotic was used in this study we confirm that the viability of the bacteria is not essential to exert an effect on the immune system .On the contrary differences in the bacterial strains used for the preparation of the fermented products could affect the immune function because the immune response to probiotics is usually strain-dependent even within the same species -.In the present study we observed an immunostimulatory effect consisting of a significant increase of the production of innate and acquired immunity peptides.
