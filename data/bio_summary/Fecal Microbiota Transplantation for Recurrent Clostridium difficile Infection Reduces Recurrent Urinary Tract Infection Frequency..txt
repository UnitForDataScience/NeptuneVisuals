A control group of patients with 3 CDI episodes managed with antibiotics and 3 or more UTIs the year prior to the third CDI episode was also included.Data CollectionWe recorded patient demographics CDI history and frequency of UTIs in 1 year before and 1 year after FMT.

Conceptually FMT may have reduced colonization with multidrug-resistant E. coli clones such as ST131 sequence type in favor of less pathogeniccoli clones or other largely commensal enteric organisms.Although patients with a history of recurrent CDI are at high risk of recurrence of CDI on exposure to systemic antibiotics none of the patients in this series experienced CDI recurrence even after receipt of multiple courses of antibiotics for recurrent UTIs after FMT.

These organisms are likely the major pathogens respon- sible for recurrent UTIs especially in patients who have profuse diarrhea due to CDI 4.Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT has emerged as an effective therapy for recurrent CDI by restoring the normal gutmicrobiota 5.

There were no changes in antimicro- bial-resistance pattern comparing 13 E. coli isolates before the third CDI to 9 the year after or comparing the 10 Klebsiella iso- lates before the third CDI to 13 the year after.

It is estimated that UTIs account for nearly 7 mil- lion office visits 1 million emergency room visits and about 100 000 hospitalizations per year and cost 1.6 billion annu- ally 1.Clostridium difficile infection CDI is the most common nosocomial infection and has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality with an estimated 29 000 deaths annu- ally within 30 days of infection and a high risk of recurrence 2 3.

The most common risk factor for recurrent CDI is ongo- ing broad-spectrum systemic antibiotic exposure used to treat infections such as recurrent UTIs.

These antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiota and not only lead to recurrent CDI but also facil- itate emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms MDROs in the gut.

Interestingly there may be additional benefits from FMT in addition to resolution of CDI.

A recent study demonstrated that FMT for recurrent CDI eradicated vancomy- cin-resistant enterococci VRE colonization in 73 of VRE- positive patients 6.We hypothesized that FMT would reduce the frequency of recurrent UTIs from antibiotic-resistant organisms by decol- onization of MDROs from the gut.

The institutional review board approved this study and receipt of informed patient con- sent was verified.METHODSPatient SelectionWe retrospectively identified patients with 3 or more UTIs in the year preceding FMT for recurrent CDI from May 2012 to September 2016.
