Generally more samples were found to be positive in VD 97 of VD infant samples than in CSD infants 86 of CSD infant samples and archaeal presence wasas well-detected in the samples from the very first time points Figure 1B.Presence of fungal organisms was detected in 37 24 out of 65 samples of all samples ranging from 0.0007 - 0.0005 ng of fungal DNA per mg of stool on day 3 to 0.002 - 0.002 ng of fungal DNA per mg of stool on day 365 with generallymore samples being positive for fungi in VD 43 of VD infant samples compared to CSD infants 31 CSD infant samples.

2015.General Delay in Colonization Rates in CSD InfantsOverall archaea and fungi were more often detected by qPCR in VD infants compared to CSD infants and the yield of fungal DNA was lower in CSD infants compared to VD infants except at 1 year and after introduction of solid food in all infants.

When linking samples according to the type of milk the infants received per time point it became apparent that at day 5 and 28 infants that received combined feeding and formula-fed infants had a significantly lower microeukaryoticdiversity compared to breast milk-fed infants P  0.01 at day 5 and P  0.03 at day 28 Kruskal-Wallis test.We calculated the Soerensen distance between the community structure at each time point and the community structure of the same individual in the most mature sample i.e.

At the same time CSD infants had microbial community structures with a significantly higher richness compared to VD infants at day 3 P  0.02 Wilcoxon rank sum test Figure 3A.To provide an overview of the development of the microbiome of the eight VD 34 samples and the seven CSD infants 30 samples the 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon data wererepresented by an ordination of their respective Jensen-Shannon distances Figure 4 a method that is commonly used for human microbial community structure analyses Koren et al.

Moreoverat day 5 significantly lower extraction yields P  0.03Wilcoxon rank sum test were observed for samples derived from infants whose mothers received antibiotics prior to birth Supplementary File 1 Figure S1.The presence of archaea was detected in 91 of all samples 59 out of 65 samples and the concentration of archaeal DNA relative to the mean of all samples ranged from 5.5 - 7.8 on day 1 to 0.5 - 0.4 on day 365.

Fecal samples originating from CSD infants are represented on the left side of each barplot and by blue points samples from VD infants are on the right side of each barplot and by green points.archaeal commensal has a highly restricted energy metabolism Fricke et al.

The four DNA dilution samples were 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequenced using the same primer pair as for the collected study samples.RESULTSCohort CharacteristicsSixty-five fecal samples were collected between September 2012 and April 2014 at the CHL from eight healthy VD and seven healthy CSD infants at six time points samples collected around days 1 3 5 28 150 and 365.

The fungal DNA yield tended to increase over time even though the magnitude of the increase was smaller compared to prokaryotes Figure 1C.Validation of GIT Microbiome Profiles in Low-Yield SamplesThe absolute quantification of prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene copy numbers in all samples showed that the earliest samples contained significantly less microbial DNA compared to all other visits Figure 1 Supplementary File 1 Table S2.Analyzing the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data obtained for the dilution series of the human adult fecal control sample we observed that the undiluted sample reflecting the concentration of most samples in the study Figure 1 and all three dilutions simulating low-yield samples showed highly comparable diversity and evenness indices Supplementary File 1 Figure S2A.

Preceding the drastic decrease in Bacteroidetes at day 5 there was already a significant difference at day 3 between infants born at different gestational ages whereby full term 39 weeks infants showed a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes when compared to late preterm 34-36 weeks and early term 37-38 weeks born infants P  0.05 Kruskal-Wallis test Supplementary File 1 Figure S7.In addition we also more specifically analyzed richness evenness and diversity within the Bacteroidetes phylum Figure 6.

compared to earlier and later time points in CSD infants and the subsequent shift in dominance inside the Bacteroidetes phylum the diversity and evenness inside this phylum at day 28 were significantlyAdditional Differences in Prokaryotic Community Structure in CSD InfantsWe further aimed to determine whether other bacterial taxa also showed different changes in CSD infants compared to VD infants during the first year of life.
