E. coli F2S2 E. coli K88F4 E. coli F3P3 and E. coli F18ab at a concentration of 1 x 107 cfu were exposed to nisin 33 ugmL cinnamaldehyde 125 ugmL and EDTA 1 2 2 0.25 respectively at 37 C for 3 h.In general an approximate 1-log reduction in E. coli counts was observed for the antimicrobial combination compared to the initial inoculum Figure .

The majority of the E. coli targets were resistant to erythromycin tetracycline and penicillin with the exception of E. coli F2S2 which remained sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline Table  and were overall in agreement with previous studies with E. coli strains of swine origin .

Nisin at 16x MIC 33 ugmL had little or no impact on the growth of the targets E. coli K88F4 Figure A E. coli F3P3 Figure B or E. coli F2S2 Figure C affirming the relatively poor activity of nisin against Gram-negative bacteria.

However pronounced inhibitory effects wererecorded when nisin was used in combination with cinnamaldehyde and EDTA against E. coli K88F4 Figure A E. coli F3P3 Figure B E. coli F2S2 Figure C as observed by the exceptionally extended lag phase in all cases compared to the untreated control.

When compared to the untreated control a 2-log differential in cell numbers was observed between the antimicrobial combination and the control in each case for E. coli K88F4 p  0.046 E. coli F3P3 p  0.043 and E. coli F2S2 p  0.005.

These results highlight the potential benefits of combining the natural antimicrobial nisin with trans-cinnamaldehyde and EDTA as a new approach for the inhibition of E. coli strains of swine origin.Keywords antimicrobial resistance antibiotics antimicrobial peptide enterotoxigenic E. coli nisin bacteriocin essential oil cinnamaldehyde EDTAIntroductionPost-weaning diarrhea PWD is one of the most life-threatening diseases in the swine industry worldwide.
