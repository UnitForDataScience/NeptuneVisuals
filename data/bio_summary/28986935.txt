considering the influence of the feces' ph and enzymes on the impairment of the stratum corneum bacteria from feces are also more likely to cause worsening of the dermatitis add to the already present inflammation and contribute to a more severe form of diaper dermatitis with secondary infection.4142in addition a variety of factors could influence the infant's susceptibility to irritant diaper dermatitis or could worsen the dermatitis once it has appeared.1143-45 these include infre- quent diaper change the use of broad spectrum antibiotics in infants poor skin care in the diaper area the use of liquid soaps for skin cleansing and the use of talcum powder.46 the inflammation in the diaper area starts the repair cascade while the epidermis remains impaired until irritation begins to diminish after a few days resulting in gradual restoration of skin health.47clinical manifestations related to diaper dermatitisthe different types of diaper dermatitis differ in their etiology.chaffing or frictional dermatitis is very common in infants and appears in areas where friction from the diaper is most preva- lent including the inner surface of the thighs buttocks abdo- men and the surface of the genital areas.845 it appears as mild redness in the affected area and resolves quickly on its own with frequent diaper changes.8irritant contact dermatitis is the most likely cause of diaper dermatitis and is commonly found in the gluteal crease but- tocks and perianal and pubic areas48 fig.

since irritant diaper dermatitis is indeed a preventable condition it is of utter impor- tance that all parents learn about common ways to lessen thesikic pogacar et al.diaper dermatitis and microbiota in diaper area review273figure 4 differential diagnosis of diaper dermatitisfigure 5 topical preparations for the treatment of diaper dermatitislikelihood of the condition through use of proper diaper hygiene and learning the means to restore a healthy skin and prevent repeated occurrences of diaper dermatitis.27 exposure of the buttocks to air for as long as possible reduces the duration of direct contact of the skin with the wet fabric surface and reduces friction.4527 a fresh diaper should preferably be put on after each urination or defecation.46 for infants at risk of devel- oping diaper dermatitis a barrier cream should be applied at each diaper change.2662 this forms a protecting lipid film on the skin that significantly diminishes exposure to moisture and irritants whereas the healing of the skin underneath the cream is almost unaffected.5the unique environment of the diaper area including the local skin microbiota continuous irritation through bacteria in urine and feces the changing ph of the skin in the area as well as the composition of cleansing agents and adjunctive topical preparations have to be considered to develop suitable cleansing practices for the diaper area.

some studies showed that breastfed babies may have a reduced risk.5-7chaffing dermatitis irritant contact dermatitis and diaper can- didiasis are the three most common types of diaper dermatitis.8 the predominant form of diaper dermatitis is irritant contact der- matitis the most common rash of the diaper area caused by a combination of factors such as extended periods of wetness and urine in the diaper friction and mechanic abrasion the presence of bile salts and other irritants in feces that break down the protective lipids and proteins in the top layer of skin the increase in the skin ph levels by a mixture of urine and feces and occasionally the presence of microorganisms.910 although rashes within the diaper area are most often just sim- ple cases of irritant contact dermatitis which are easily treated by topical treatments and parental education on proper diaper- ing practices severe forms of diaper dermatitis require medical265266review diaper dermatitis and microbiota in diaper areas ikic pogac ar et al.attention.511 the latter could indicate a more serious yet unre- lated condition that has manifested in the diaper area.

urine can have aph ranging from 4.6 to 8 and feces typically has a higher ph of 6.5-7.5 while the normal ph of the buttocks is approxi- mately 5.5.1928 therefore it is rather straightforward that the exposure of the skin to a mixture of urine and feces con- tributes to an increase in the ph in the diaper area to more alkaline values 7. this increase in turn leads to an increased activity of fecal proteases lipases and ureases all of which are highly irritating to the skin.3637 an increased activity of fecal lipases and proteases is also present owing to an acceleration of gastrointestinal transit.38 therefore a higher prevalence rate of diaper dermatitis is observed in babies that have had diarrhea in the previous 48 hours.26 furthermore fecal ureases produced by a variety of fecal bacteria catalyze the breakdown of urea to ammonia which in turn contributes to an increase in the skin ph.3637 these enzymes contribute to increased skin permeability to bile salts and other potential irritants.52839 the supposed positive effects of breastfeeding in the prevention of diaper dermatitis might be linked to less irritating feces as it is known that the feces of exclusively breastfed babies has a significantly lower ph a lower protease and lipase activity as well as a lower urease content when compared to formula-fed babies.540sikic pogacar et al.diaper dermatitis and microbiota in diaper area review269since the skin in the diaper area is often exposed to feces bacteria normally found only in the gut are present there as well.

the integrity of healthy skin is compromised by the very nature of the diaper environment and therefore a normal intact skin remains an elusive goal of current diapering practices.27 the management of diaper dermatitis includes numerous approaches.548 however for correct diagnosis and proper treat- ment the physician should have knowledge about the etiology of diaper dermatitis the skin physiology and the skin micro- biome.

5. consequently these repair stratum corneum and protect the skin against diaper dermatitis.105556 other useful creams include vitamin a and d ointment dexpan- thenol treatment and burow solution a mixture of aluminum acetate in water.511 creams used for the treatment of moderate diaper dermatitis also contain ingredients such as mineral oils aloe vera and wax to provide an adequate protection to the skin.11 more severe forms of diaper dermatitis with clinical signs of secondary infections require medical attention with careful diagnosis and therapeutic treatment.552as candidal infection is quite common in more severe cases of diaper dermatitis antifungal agents such as nystatin clotri- mazole miconazole ketoconazole and sertaconazole can be applied to the diaper area with every diaper change.57 in addi- tion mild topical corticosteroids may be used if skin is infected with c. albicans.4 relapse of diaper dermatitis with a secondary infection after treatment with nystatin is common because of the failure to eradicate concomitant bacterial infections recoloniza- tion from reservoir sites and occasional resistance to antifungal agents.1 in addition potential adverse effects of antifungals include irritation burning and itching.31if a secondary bacterial infection is present topical or oral antibiotics may be necessary.

showed that staphylococcus spp streptococcus spp enterococcus spp as well as other variable or transient taxa such as prevotella spp veillonella spp and clostridium spp were present at the buttock site.12 the unique microbiota within the diaper area is also a consequence of less likely competition from other skin microbiota during the early development of the buttock skin.12 in one study that included neonates during the first 6 days of life bifidobacteria and bacteroides were most commonly iso- lated from the diaper area followed by enterobacteria eubacte- ria lactobacilli and others.18 normal microbiota favors acidic ph levels and any rise of skin ph in the diaper area allows the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms including c. albicans and s. aureus which play a predominant role in diaper dermati- tis.102425 severe diaper dermatitis is strongly correlated with the presence of c. albicans and the frequency of dermatitis is inversely correlated with the diaper change frequency.15 on the other hand in children without diaper rash s. epidermidis was the most abundant organism isolated.3 other microorganisms including streptococcal species escherichia coli or non -e. coli fermenters were seen less often and c. albicans was only rarely isolated from the skin.

in addition there appears to be no difference in the microbiota composition of infants wear- ing disposable diapers or cloth diapers however exclusive use of disposable diapers is associated with reduced frequency of diaper dermatitis.18even though pathogenic microorganisms have been isolated from the skin affected by diaper dermatitis the compromised skin that allows pathogenic microorganisms to gain access to the epidermis is a prerequisite for the development of this con- dition.19 furthermore microorganisms from the feces of the infant can easily gain access through the damaged stratumsikic pogacar et al.diaper dermatitis and microbiota in diaper area review267figure 1 microbial communities colonizing the skin differ greatly depending on anatomical location and specific conditions of the site.

2. other factors characteristic of the diaper area are excessive wetness elevated ph high enzymatic activity and friction all of which to some extent compromise the epidermal barrier function.2728 however to understand the etiology of diaper dermatitis it is important notto forget the peculiarity of the infant skin physiology and hence their skin barrier function affecting also the water han- dling properties.5 these include histologic biochemical and functional differences as well as differences in the composition of the skin microbiota.342728 there are also other significant differences between the infant and adult epidermis which include smaller keratinocytes denser microrelief structures thinner stratum corneum greater cell proliferation and a differ- ent organization of collagen fibers in the dermis.5 the extracel- lular lipid matrix of the stratum corneum acts as a barrier preventing water loss and entry of hydrophilic substances including water whereas the corneocytes differentiated ker- atinocytes provide mechanical protection from the external environment.2829268review diaper dermatitis and microbiota in diaper areasikic pogacar et al.figure 2 factors involved in pathophysiology of diaper dermatitisprolonged wetness in the diaper area leads to maceration of the stratum corneum.

frequent diaper changing air exposure gentle cleansing choice of diapers and use of topical barrier preparations.531frequent diaper changing every 1-3 hours is essential in the management of diaper dermatitis as it helps to reduce the amount of time the skin is in contact with moisture and irri- tants.28 care should be also taken to avoid rubbing or friction during diaper changes and to gently cleanse the diaper area rinse and pat dry to minimize further trauma to the skin.5 ide- ally an infant with irritant diaper dermatitis should be allowed periods of rest without a diaper exposing in that way the dam- aged skin to air reducing the contact time between skin with urine feces moisture and other irritants.5 the best choice of diapers for use in infants is a controversial issue.

microbial colonization of the infant skin is crucial in cutaneous homeostasis and significantly contributes to a proper skin immune function development.12 in utero the skin is sterile but soon after the birth environmental microbes start colonizing the stratum corneum transforming in that way a sterile skin into a complex microbial ecosystem that is in homeostasis with the host.

however infant skin microbiome is rela- tively unstable which makes infant skin prone to inflammatory conditions such as eczema and diaper dermatitis and more vul- nerable to opportunistic pathogens and allergens from the envi- ronment.12the human skin is mainly colonized by four different phyla actinobacteria 51.8 most dominant reported genera propi- onibacterium and corynebacterium proteobacteria 16.5 firmicutes 24.4 mostly represented by staphylococcus spp.

while these are meant to aid the maintenance of an intact skin barrier or promote the healing of a compromised barrier improper practices can makethe diaper rash worse.3 bathing of infants should be performed with warm water 37-40 degc and a small amount of a mild cleanser.5 in addition an acidic skin surface is essential for the maintenance of the normal microbiota which provides innate antimicrobial protection against invasion by pathogenic bacteria and yeasts.5conclusionsdiaper dermatitis is the most common skin condition in newborn and young infants.

recent findings have proven that the key to efficient eradication of irritant diaper dermatitis lies in its prevention.introductiondiaper dermatitis or diaper rash is a nonspecific term used to describe any of the various inflammatory reactions of the skin within the diaper area including the buttocks perianal area genitals inner thighs and waistline.12 it is one of the most com- mon skin disorders in neonates and infants with a prevalence between 7 and 50. however the real incidence of diaper der- matitis in the general population might be higher because not all cases are reported to the physician as they usually resolve within a few days without the need for medical treatment.34 even though it rarely causes problems for longer periods of time it causes considerable distress to both infants and parents at the same time.
