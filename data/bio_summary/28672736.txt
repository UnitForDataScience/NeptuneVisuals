this review will discuss the regulation of at homeostasis in relation to innate immunity.keywords adipose tissue browningbeiging innate immunity macrophage metabolic disease microbiota rip140doi 10.1515hmbci-2017-0013received march 23 2017 accepted may 1 2017introductionaccording to the world health organization who obesity is a growing global epidemic that affects more than 600 million people 1. obesity often leads to metabolic complications such as cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes fatty liver disease dementia and cancers and is associated with adipose tissue at inflammation and dysfunction 2 3. at mainly brown at bat and white at wat is an important metabolic and en- docrine organ that maintains whole-body homeostasis 4. bat contributes to non-shivering thermogenesis whereas wat stores energy and produces adipokines to fine-tune metabolic and inflammatory responses 5. obesity is often characterized by an over-expanded and inflamed wat harboring mainly pro-inflammatory macrophages resulting in a state of chronic low-grade inflammation and leading to insulin resistance and metabolic complications 2 3. macrophages constitute the major component of innate immunity and can be activated as a m1 pro-inflammatory or m2 anti-inflammatory phenotype in response to environmental stimuli 6. m1 macrophages are the major culprits of at inflammation whereas m2 macrophages are generally protective.

found that cold exposure could sustain adaptive thermogenesis by increasing m2 macrophages that secrete catecholamines to induce the expression of thermogenic genes in bat and lipolysis in wat 50. in addition il-4-primed atms express high levels of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase alox15 leading to in- crease in pparg ligands 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid hode and 13-hode which contributes to wat browningbeiging 51. it has now been established that various manipulations can lead to an increase in m2 macrophage such as type 2 cytokine induction 52 exposure to cold 50 and lowering the level of pro- inflammatory coregulator receptor interacting protein 140 rip140 in macrophages 26 53. further these m2 macrophages can be delivered by bone marrow transplantation or local injection to induce wat brown- ingbeiging 26 27 46 47 49 50 54 55 56. thus elevating m2 atms is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating metabolic diseases and related complications.regulators of m1m2 polarizationmacrophage m1m2 polarization is activated by various stimuli that elicit different signaling cascades 57. generally lipopolysaccharide lps or interferon-g ifn-g stimulates m1 polarization though activating sig- nal transducer and activator of transcription stat 1 or nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cell nfkb signaling pathways 58. the m2 activation signals include il-4 il-13 il-10 immune complexes ic glucocorticoids gc and transforming growth factor b tgf-b in various contexts 59 60 61 62 which can be transmitted by various mediators.

m2 atms not only resolve inflammation but also improve insulin sensitivity by inducing wat remodeling or browning as demonstrated in various transgenic mouse models 26 39 40 41.m2 macrophage and wat browningbeigingin 2010 two research groups found that adiponectin a protective adipokine against inflammation and insulin resistance could prime macrophage m2 polarization 42 43. m2 macrophages can be activated by cytokines il-4il-13 secreted from various cells in at such as adipocytes 44 45 eosinophils 46 47 and type 2 in- nate lymphoid cells ilc2 48 49. these findings associated at with the regulation of macrophage activation.brought to you by  asu library2authenticatedde gruyterlin and weinguyen et al.

for example irisin stimulated by pgc-1a can be secreted from muscle to facilitate wat browning by acting on beige preadipocytes 15 17 18 19. fibroblast growth factor 21 fgf21 can stimulate wat browning via pgc-1a and the sympathetic nerve system 17 20 21 22. natriuretic pep- tides can be secreted from heart muscle to promote beige adipocyte development through the p38mapk signaling pathway 23 24. kruppel-like factor 11 kfl11 can induce the pparg signaling pathway to pro- mote wat browning 25. our recent studies show that altering innate immunity either systemically or locally could stimulate wat browning 26 27 see following.

polarized m1 macrophage causes at inflammation whereas polarized m2 macrophage promotes wat remodeling into the bat phenotype also known as wat browningbeiging which enhances insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.

functionally categorized mainly as m1 vs. m2 macrophages are also classified by their tissue local- ization as various tissue-resident macrophages such as kupffer cells in the liver microglia in the brain alveolar macrophages in the lung and atms in ats.

in human wat browningbeiging is still poorly understood and the effects of beiging factors secreted from m2 atms remain to be explored.figure 1 relationship of m2 macrophage with wat browningbeiging.

adipose tissue at mainly brown at bat and white at wat is an important metabolic and endocrine organ that maintains whole- body homeostasis.

reducing rip140 expression in macrophage alters atm infiltration facili- tates white adipose tissue browning and prevents high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance.

injecting engineered anti-infllammatory macrophages therapeutically induces white adipose tissue browning and improves diet-induced insulin resistance.
