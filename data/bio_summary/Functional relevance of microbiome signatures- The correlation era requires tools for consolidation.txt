to reach this goal research strategies need to go beyond metagenomics sequencing aiming at identi- fication of functional mediators and most importantly addressing mechanistic links between microbiota-derived signals and host sensors finally leading to evidence-based intervention strategies selectively targeted to specific human diseases .references....... ..... ............. ............ ....... ...... .

hypothesis- driven and evidence-based selection of single bacteria or syn- thetic consortia of bacteria might provide the next generation of probiotic intervention without risking adverse consequences because of use of undefined bacteria.table i. microbiome signatures in several human pathologiespathologic conditionstaxonomic alterationsreferenceimmune diseasesmetabolic disordersobesityd low species richness and inflammation at disease onsetd increased or decreased ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetest2dd decrease of butyrate-producing bacteriad increase in opportunistic pathogens eg clostridium ramosum eggerthella lenta and escher- ichia coli and prevotella copricardiovascular diseased on carnitine treatment several bacterial taxa were increased and associated with cardiovascularrisks.othersautism spectrum disorder asdd increase in abundance of sutterella species and ruminococcus torquesd reduced prevotella speciescolorectal cancer crcd overexpression of specific pathobionts including fusobacterium nucleatum streptococcus gal-lolyticus enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides fragilis escherichia coli streptococcus bovis helicobacter pylori bacteroides fragilis enterococcus faecalis clostridium septicum alistipes species akkermansia species fusobacterium species and escherichia coliliver cirrhosisd overexpression of veillonella megasphaera dialister atopobium fusobacterium andprevotellamicrobiome research requires standardization and mechanistic validation novel strategiesfunctionality beyond sequence acquisition from biosynthetic gene clusters to isolation of metabolites and the unculturable biomassin recent years technologies available to interrogate the human microbiome such as metagenomics metatranscriptomics meta- proteomics and metametabolomics have been developing at a remarkable pace and as a consequence protocols require efficient harmonization and standardization at all levels.

a very recent study demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome and proposed a novel workflow based on spore isolation which allows culture of a substantial proportion of human gut uncultur- able bacteria.establishing a comprehensive repertoire of cul- turable bacteria representing key functions or species of the microbiome allows analysis of a wide range of physiologic func- tions and diseases in gnotobiotic model organisms.these as- pects are highly pertinent to the selection of bacterial strains for human functional and translational research.in conclusion the future workflow of metagenomic analysis certainly goes toward the identification of functional mediators and in combination with the effort to cultivate novel bacterial strains from the ''unknown biomass'' the correlation era in microbiome will be overcome.gnotobiotic model systems from single-strain to bacterial consortia to humanization protocolsgnotobiotic models have been used to reveal causative asso- ciation between changes in the microbiome in health and disease and to gain functional insights into host-microbe interactions.

an important goal in the next years is to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of humanized murine models to draw adequate conclu- sions from these novel tools in translational microbiome research.conclusioncompelling evidence from human and mouse studies supports the view that the microbiome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human diseases.

current perspectivesfunctional relevance of microbiome signatures the correlation era requires tools for consolidationludovica f. butto phd and dirk haller phdfreising germanycompelling research over the past decade identified a fundamental role of the intestinal microbiome on human health.

compositional and functional changes of this microbial ecosystem are correlated with a variety of human pathologies.

however the search for microbial risk patterns in human cohorts is often confounded by environmental factors eg medication and host status eg disease relapse questioning the prognostic and therapeutic value of the currently available information.

in addition to a better stratification of human phenotypes the implementation of standardized protocols for sampling and analysis is needed to improve the reproducibility and comparability of microbiome signatures at a meaningful taxonomic resolution.

numerous studies identified microbiome signatures with patterns of dysbiosis eg reduction of diversity in patients with a large variety of chronic disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases ibdirritable bowel syndromeallergy asthmarheumatoid arthritistype 1 diabetes multiple sclerosis obesity type 2 diabetes t2dcardiovascular diseaseautism spectrum disorder colorectal cancerand liver cirrhosis .an essential question arising from these association studies is whether microbiome alterations are the cause drivers or simply the consequence passengers of human pathologies.given the substantial interindividual variation in the microbial community structure and the pleiotropy of confounding factors microbiome analyses in cross-sectional studies are correlative and require vali- dation in well-controlled replication studies using careful selec- tion of participants based on extensive phenotyping.

the implementation of prospective longitudinal and treatment- naive early-onset or birth cohorts might help identify the disease-relevant microbiome signature in a progressive fashion and at very early stages.unfortunately disorders with low incidence require prospective cohorts with probably unrealistic size to reach relevant numbers of cases and thus patient stratifica- tion according to drug and other confounding factors might pre- vent false-positive results.1092fig 1. number of publications related to the contribution of the intestinal microbiota to human diseases in the last decade grouped per year.
