Hypothesis- driven and evidence-based selection of single bacteria or syn- thetic consortia of bacteria might provide the next generation of probiotic intervention without risking adverse consequences because of use of undefined bacteria.TABLE I.

A very recent study demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome and proposed a novel workflow based on spore isolation which allows culture of a substantial proportion of human gut uncultur- able bacteria.Establishing a comprehensive repertoire of cul- turable bacteria representing key functions or species of the microbiome allows analysis of a wide range of physiologic func- tions and diseases in gnotobiotic model organisms.These as- pects are highly pertinent to the selection of bacterial strains for human functional and translational research.In conclusion the future workflow of metagenomic analysis certainly goes toward the identification of functional mediators and in combination with the effort to cultivate novel bacterial strains from the ''unknown biomass'' the correlation era in microbiome will be overcome.Gnotobiotic model systems From single-strain to bacterial consortia to humanization protocolsGnotobiotic models have been used to reveal causative asso- ciation between changes in the microbiome in health and disease and to gain functional insights into host-microbe interactions.

IBD are chronically relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastro- intestinal tract with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis as the main clinical entities.Genome-wide association studies sub- stantiated clinical and animal studies in assigning an essential role of the microbiome for disease cause.In this context Ge- vers et alconfirmed in a pediatric cohort RISK of freshly diagnosed patients with Crohn disease that dysbiosis is associated with a loss of species diversity and selective changes in the community structure.

Integrated approach for functional analysis of microbiome signatures.bile acids up to 1 mmolL in the large intestine.Ruminococcus gnavus was identified as a novel inducer of isobile formation demonstrating the power of this reverse genetic approach to iden- tify functional metabolites and relevant taxa responsible for their production.First efforts to isolate and characterize the ''unculturable biomass'' of the human and mouse microbiota are underway and most desiredyet the highest efforts have been made to build bacterial gene catalogues from human mouse and pigmetagenomic data sets.

An important goal in the next years is to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of humanized murine models to draw adequate conclu- sions from these novel tools in translational microbiome research.CONCLUSIONCompelling evidence from human and mouse studies supports the view that the microbiome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human diseases.

However the search for microbial risk patterns in human cohorts is often confounded by environmental factors eg medication and host status eg disease relapse questioning the prognostic and therapeutic value of the currently available information.

However a follow-up study already made clear that the integration of patient-specific transcriptional profiles and micro- biome signatures allow a better stratification of patients with Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.Loss of species diversity is associated with a variety of human pathologies and therefore might only be the consequence of drastic changes in the environmental milieu.

Isogenic mutant strains lacking bacterial components substan- tially improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of microbe-host interactions in disease initiation or protec- tion.Because the use of single bacteria most likely does not represent the complexity in microbiome-related human dis- eases the logical next step is to generate combinations of well- characterized and fully sequenced bacterial strains eg SIHUMIand Oligo-Mouse-Microbiota.
