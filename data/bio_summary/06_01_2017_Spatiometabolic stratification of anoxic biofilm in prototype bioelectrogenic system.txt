The in- crease in electrode distance develops an oxidative stress on the anode which is a virtue for enhanced substrate degradation whereas for power optimal electrode distance is essential as observed from the po- larization curves.Cyclic Voltammetry CV profiles vs AgAgCl showed variation in electron e- discharge patterns with the function of electrode distances b. Amongst the four variations 6 cm depicted the maximum oxidative catalytic currents seen in the forward sweep of 13.6 mA followed by 4 cm 12.78 mA 2 cm 10.9 mA and 1 cm 8.0 mA reit- erating the increased electrode distance which play majorly in oxidative reactions that would help in improved substrate degradation compared to lower electrode distances.

Inter-electrode distance plays a pivotal role in proton gradient development and transfer across the chambers up to an opti- mal electrode distance.

The decrement in the currents with decrease in the electrode distance 2 cm and 1 cm correlates with the reduced cathodic currents and increased oxidation with the func- tion of distance.

A multiphasic approach was employed where the influence of DO on bio-electrogenic activity was optimized initially later optimal anode to cathode inter-electrode distance was enumerated.

The redox behavior showed an increase in cathodic catalytic activity with an increase in the inter-electrode distance.

The study was carried out using a multiphasic approach that includes a startup phase optimization of DO concentration optimization of interelectrode distance and microbial diversity analysis.

Vertical bars with a screw facility was provid- ed to enable placement of the anode at the desired distance from the stationary cathode viz.

The start-up phase was evaluated by placing anode at a 6 cm distance from the cathode.

3.45 mg DOL 1.6 mg DOL 0.8 mg DOL andmg DOL were evaluated at a constant anode and cathode distance of 6 cm.

The performance of SBR-BET at an op- timized DO concentration from second stage by varying interelec- trode distance was studied as the third phase.
