in human studies firmicutes dominance of the gut microbiota was consistently seen in obese subjects and some diet therapies for obesity have been reported to be effective in modulating the composition of the gut microbiota toward a lean type population-based cohort studies conducted in china and european countries indicated that the gut microbiota of type 2 diabetic patients was enriched with non-butyrate-producing species of the genus clostridium and that there was a decreased abundance of butyrate- producing species however no further common patterns of gut microbiota community composition and predicted function were identified suggesting the significant impacts of distinct lifestyles and long-term diets between the cohorts on the structure and functionality of the gut microbiota the gut microbiota associated with obese and diabetic phenotypes is also characterized by a reduced abundance of akkermansia muciniphila which has been suggested to offer protection against excessive adiposity inflammation in adipose tissue metabolic endotoxemia and insulin resistance a. muciniphila was also found to be less abundant in older subjects and subject fed a high-fat diet recent mechanistic studies on the physiological role of a. muciniphila indicate that it contributes to the amelioration of insulin resistance by mediating the negative effects of a pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma ifn-g on glucose metabolism on the other hand the interaction between an outer membrane protein of a. muciniphila and the toll-like receptor 2 tlr2-mediated signaling pathway has emerged as a candidate mechanism that underlies the beneficial role of a. muciniphila in host energy metabolism roux-en-y gastric bypass rygb represents a surgical therapy indicated for morbid obesity that enables substantial and sustained weight loss.

in particular the mechanisms underlying the impacts of short chain fatty acids scfas a group of key metabolites of the gut microbiota on host insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis and adiposity will be discussed.gut microbiota structure and obesitythe earliest evidence that substantiated the role of the gut microbiota in modulating host adiposity as reported by gordon and coworkers described specifically the observation that germ-free gf mice consistently had less body fat than conventionalized spf specific pathogen free ones albeit with increased food consumption and less energy expenditure.

colonization of non-operated gf mice with the cecal contents of those that had undergone rygb allowed for significantly reduced host adiposity and body weight substantiating the role of the gut microbiota in host metabolism and its potential in remediatinalternations of the gut microbiota have also been indicated to affect host metabolic homeostasis by inducing changes in the serum metabolomic profile as revealed by recent efforts based upon exhaustive description of the human gut microbiota and serum metabolomics analysis.

transplantation of an altered gut microbiota conferred diminished insulin response and an increased susceptibility to obesity in the recipient mice the tlr5-dependent innate immune signaling hence provides a mechanism for the crosstalk between the gut microbiota composition and products and the immune and metabolic responses of the host individual.dietary fiber-derived short chain fatty acids and obesityscfas as described above are a group of important gut microbiota metabolites that are indeed dietary fiber-derived fatty acids with up to six carbon atoms including primarily acetate propionate and butyrate.

cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 with the immune system therefore dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in a multitude of metabolic alterations.this article will review the current perspectives and recent advances with regard to the role of the gut microbiota in shaping host metabolism and modulating the predisposition to obesity.

gordon and colleagues further revealed that the obesity phenotype was correlated with a shift in the relative abundance of the bacteroidetes and firmicutesphyla which collectively constitute more than 90 of all phylogenetic types of gut microbes toward firmicutes dominance significantly implantation of normal and obese microbiotas into the gut of a gf mouse led to increased body fat mass adding to the evidence that the gut microbiota is a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of obesity in a structure-dependent manner in the light of these findings the pathological implications of the gut microbiota in obesity have been increasingly discussed in animal models and human cohorts with the aid of the state-of-the-art genomics and other omics tools e.g.

for instance p. copri seemed to promote host glucose metabolism in a separate study using mice that were fed on a high-fiber low-fat diet this discrepancy suggests that the interactions between the gut microbiota and host metabolism may be subject to regulations via diverse mechanisms in different disease models or cohorts which remain to be deciphered.antibiotics and obesityantibiotic exposure is increasingly believed to modify the composition and thus the function of the gut microbiota.

hence it is suggested to account forthe increased risk of childhood obesity the differential effects of antibiotic use during and after early infancy are presumably related to the substantial modifications in the gut microbiota associated with the weaning process which in humans often begins naturally at age 6 months.gut microbial metabolites and obesitycurrently a growing body of evidence reveals that the molecular interactions between the wide range of metabolites and cell components of the gut microbiota and host metabolism are essentially but differentially involved in the development of obesity with diverse mechanisms being proposed to account for the related metabolic alternations.

this review will discuss the recent advances in understanding the mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota modulates the effects of diet and shapes the host metabolism either towards or away from obesity and related metabolic conditions.

in particular the interactions of short chain fatty acids scfas a subset of key gut microbial metabolites with their specific receptors will be reviewed in relation to host energy homeostatic regulation and evaluated for potential as novel therapeutic targets for diet-induced obesity.key words scfa gut microbiota energy metabolism obesity dietary fiberintroductionobesity is a metabolic disorder characterized by disrupted dynamics of energy homeostasis which depends on the equilibrated dietary intakes and expenditure.

multiple obesity-associated health consequences have been documented including increased risk for type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and several cancers contributing to an enormous economic burden and consumption of medical resources in recent years the gut microbiota has emerged as an integral mediator in diet-induced obesity and hence attracted increasing attention as a potential nutritional and pharmacological target in the management of obesity and related conditions.
