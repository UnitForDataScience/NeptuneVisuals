Amplification process contained one cycle at 95 degC for 10 min as initial denaturation and after that 40 cycles of 95 degC for 15 s followed by annealing at 60 degC for 30 s and then at 72degC for 30 s.

The decreases of total VFA in alfalfa may be attributed to the alfalfa used in thisstudy containing higher ADF which is not easily degraded by the rumen microbiodegradation to produce VFA.Ammonia in the rumen is a metabolite of microbial degradation proteins and amino acids which can be used by microorganisms to synthesize bacterial proteins.In this study CSFA increased the concentration of NH3-N in the rumen indicating that it can promote the biodegradation of protein and resulting in increasing the apparent digestibility of CP.

In this study the substitution of alfalfa for Leymus chinensis did not affect the biochemical parameters of the detected plasma especially the activity of several transaminase which indicated that the amino acid composition of alfalfa protein did not change the metabolism of protein in the liver.Fatty acids are mainly absorbed into the bloodstream in the duodenum while the intestine is the main site of cholesterol synthesis.CSFA released fatty acids in abomasums.

Alfalfa can increase the daily weight of Holstein cowsmilkunsaturated fatty acids in meatand reduce lipid peroxidation of meat.On the other hand alfalfa can bring undesirable flavor substances into meat products.The utilization of alfalfa in beef cattle production needs further study.
