dietary supplementation of csfa increased plasma cholesterol and ldl-c concentrations inhibited the biodegradation of unsaturated fatty acids byrumen microorganisms resulting in an increase in theproportion of unsaturated fatty acids in plasma while reducing the c14-c17 fatty acids except c160.author informationcorresponding authorse-mail .e-mail .

those fatty acids can interact with the rumen environment and be hydrogenated by the rumen microorganism.this mechanism was not caused by the released calcium in diet possibly owing to the unsaturated fatty acids in csfa improved the cholecystokinin secretion in intestine.

the absorption of fatty acids in the small intestine requires the delivery of lipoproteins and dietary supplementation of csfa needed more amino acids to synthesize lipoproteins.

at the same time butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ruminobacter amylophilus prevotella bryantii and ruminococcus albus can secrete proteases and degrade proteins into peptides.however the effect of alfalfa on these protein degrading bacteria did not change the concentration of rumen nh3-n and the apparent digestibility of cp.butyrivibrio f ibrisolvens the most active rumen bacteria in the hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids can generate conjugated linoleic acid and trans-11 181 as intermediate products during the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

in this study the substitution of alfalfa for leymus chinensis did not affect the biochemical parameters of the detected plasma especially the activity of several transaminase which indicated that the amino acid composition of alfalfa protein did not change the metabolism of protein in the liver.fatty acids are mainly absorbed into the bloodstream in the duodenum while the intestine is the main site of cholesterol synthesis.csfa released fatty acids in abomasums.

alfalfa instead of leymus chinensis did not change the composition of fatty acids in plasma except to significantly reduce c200 whose relative ratio is less than 1. the dietary csfa has a great influence on the composition of plasma fatty acids.
