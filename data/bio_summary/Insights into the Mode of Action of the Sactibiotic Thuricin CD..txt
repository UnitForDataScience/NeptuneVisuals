The thuricin CD peptides were also tested at concentrations three-fold their MIC 9 uM  and at these concentrations it was found that the combined peptides  causedfaster depolarization approximately 5 min after addition of the peptides compared to the initiation of depolarization approximately 10 min after addition of 9 uM Trna  and approximately 7 mins after the addition of 9 uM Trnb .

The similar structure of the two thuricin CD peptides their potent activity against Gram positive spore-formers and the observations from this study which indicate that sequential addition of the peptides has negligible effects point to a unique mechanism of action for these peptides.

Taken together these results lead us to postulate that the lytic activity of thuricin CD involves the insertion of thuricin CD peptides into the membrane of target cells leading to permeabilization due to pore formation and consequent flux of ions across the membrane resulting in membrane depolarization and eventual cell death.Keywords bacteriocin mode of action cytometry membrane potential viabilityINTRODUCTIONBacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized peptides that exert antimicrobial effects predominantly against closely related bacteria often in the nanomolar range .

To assess the effects of individual and combined thuricin CD peptides diluted DPC6349 cells were exposed to known equimolar concentrations of Trna Trnb or both peptides and incubated at 37C with vigorous agitation 400rpm.

This slower depolarizing effect compared to the combined peptides is in agreement with initial observations .Light microscopy was also conducted in order to assess the impact of the thuricin CD peptides on DPC6349 cells .

As was the case for the membrane potential findings described above the sequential addition of the thuricin CD peptides did not appear to be an important factor governing cell viability.DISCUSSIONIn this study real-time FC was utilized to monitor the time course alterations in membrane potential and physiology of sensitive B. firmus DPC6349 cells upon exposure to individual and combined Trna and Trnb peptides.

Altogether these results led us to hypothesize that the mode of action of thuricin CD involves pore formation eliciting membrane depolarization due to the influxefflux of ions across the membrane and ultimately resulting in lysis of the target cells.To provide further support for this hypothesis sequential addition studies were carried out whereby DPC6349 cells were initially exposed to valinomycin before being challenged with either the individual peptides or combinations of the thuricin CD peptides.

The pre-incubation of cells with sub-lethal concentrations of one of the peptides followed by the addition of higher amounts of the second peptide revealed that there was little difference between the treatments in terms of the sequential addition of the peptides when assessed with membrane integrity probes.

Furthermore light microscopy analyses showed the presence of shorter rods in DPC6349 cells after 1 h of exposure to thuricin CD peptides whereas small and apparently fragmented cells resembling remnants of lysedcells were detected after 5 h of treatment.

Notably we found that the thuricin CD peptides elicit depolarization of the membrane most likely as a consequence of the pore-forming ability of the peptides triggering the movement of ions across the membrane and this occurs with reductions in cell size and granularity.MATERIALS AND METHODSThuricin CD PurificationThuricin CD for these assays was purified as described previously with minor alterations  .
