Seven days later the front upper limbs chest and front portion of the PI-IBS model rats were wrapped with adhesive tape for 1 h. The rats had free access to food and water except when the procedure required deprivation.Grouping and AdministrationTwenty-eight rats were divided into 4 groups with 7 rats per group.

The structure of gut microbiota is modulated by different ingesta among which TCM is the equivalent of fertilizer to affect some favorable specie in gut lumen.

These findings suggest that Wuji Wan may remit IBS by modulating the gut microbiota and stabilizing the gut mucosal barrier indicating that the use of a classical formula of Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM that exhibits a prebiotic effect may be a promising strategy for PI-IBS treatment.Keywords Wuji Wan post-inflammation irritable bowel syndrome gut microbiota mucin tight junctionsINTRODUCTIONIrritable bowel syndrome IBS comprises multiple functional bowel disorders including recurrent abdominal pain associated with discomfort diarrhea or constipation and the prevalence of IBS is between 5 and 20 of the population worldwide and between 5 and 10 of Chinese adults  .

The control rats were handled identically to the other rats except that saline was instilled instead of 4 acetic acid.

In the present study we observed that the abundance of A. muciniphila was 20-fold lower in the IBS rats than in the normal rats and that the abundance was 234-fold higher in the IBS rats that received Wuji Wan treatment.

The solution was evaporated in vacuum to yield a brown residue 106 g. The dried root 3000 g of Radix Paeoniae Alba was pulverized and extracted twice with boiling water.

The aqueous solution was evaporated in vacuum to yield a pale-yellow powder 279 g. The Wuji Wan extract was a mixture of the above three extracts and was stored in a light- resistant container at 4C before use.

The phylogenetic affiliation of each 16S rRNA gene sequence was analyzed with RDP Classifier against the SILVA SSU115 16S rRNA database using a confidence threshold of 70.Fecal Pellet Water Content and MUC2 ConcentrationFecal pellets were then weighed wet weight in mg desiccated in an oven 50C 6 h and weighed again dry weight in mg.1 2 The fecal water content was calculated according to the following equation Water content  100 wet weight - dry weightwet weight.

The major differences in the gut microbiota structure corresponded to the Wuji Wan treatment along the first ordination axis which explained 34.2 of the total variability .

The TCM formula comprises several herbal ingredients.The influence of a formula on the gut microbiota is the result of the comprehensive balance of each herb in the prescription.
