How do age sex duration and intensity of exercise influence its effects on the microbiota Is there an optimum balance where exercise ex- erts maximum benefits on human physiology without creating detrimental effects on gut barrier Are dietary components used differently by the gut microbiota of active and sedentary indi- viduals These questions and others may be the next frontier in microbiota research.4Tiffany WeirDepartment of Food Science and Human Nutrition College of Health and Human SciencesColorado State University Fort Collins COReferencesBackhed F Manchester JK Semenkovich CF Gordon JI.

They propose several mechanisms supported by current literature by which exercise-microbiota interactions may influence host physiology.Evidence from animal studies supports exercise as an impor-tant factor modulating gut microbial communities.

Although reduction of intestinal inflammation may play a role in microbial modulation in moderate exercise intense exercise has well-studied negative effects on gut barrier function suggesting that beneficial mi- crobial profiles reported in elite athletes may be modulated by other mechanisms.

It will be interesting to see if gut microbial profiles in humans are predictive of athletic performance.

Exercise and associated dietary extremes impact on gut microbial diversity.

Two important modifiable fac- tors that potentially have significant impact on the gut microbi- ota are diet and exercise.

In general exercise seems to beneficially impact the gut microbiota al- though relevance of these studies to human populations is diffi- cult to ascertain.

In particular the elite athletes consumed higher levels of protein which may have been re- sponsible for the observed effects on the gut.

This raises the provocative idea that specific dietary components affect micro- bial metabolism differently in active and sedentary individuals.Authors for this section are recruited by Commentary Editor Russell R.

Campbell and Wisniewski 2 in a paper published in this is- sue present a conceptual framework highlighting the role of exercise in stimulating microbial diversity and favorably influencing general health through microbiota-mediated in- teractions.
