We identified many uncharacterized family members including a universally distributed enzyme that enables commensal gut microbes and human pathogens to dehydrate trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline the product of the most abundant human posttranslational modification.

For example the human gut microbiome metabolizes non- digestible dietary components produces essential vitamins and nutrients and synthesizes metabolites that are linked to human disease 2 3.

Despite these intriguing connections to human biology little is known about the abundance and distribution of different types of GREs in human microbiomes.

Unlike PFL HPAD and CutC are detected in only a subset of stool metagenomes which is consistent with the observed variability in the levels of downstream metabolites p- cresol sulfate and trimethylamine-N-oxide in humans 14 17 and could potentially contribute to interindividual differences in drug metabolism and disease susceptibility.We also obtained information about the abundance of uncharacterized GREs in human microbiomes and our data suggest that many unappreciated GRE-mediated activities exist in the human gut.

Our analysis of the GRE superfamily in human microbiomes provided both new insights about GREs of known activity including enzymes linked to human disease and the ability to identify enzymes of unknown activity in these communities revealing intriguing targets for further study.
