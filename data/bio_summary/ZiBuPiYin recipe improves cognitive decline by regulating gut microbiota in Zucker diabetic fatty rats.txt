Con control ZDF rats PSD ZDF rats treated with PS PDZ ZDF rats treated with PS combining ZBPYR administration.Heat map of the relative abundance of microbial species altered by PSDACD and ZBPYR treatment showed the differences of gut bacterial compositions compared among Con group PSD group and PDZ group at the genus level Figure 5.

All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Useof Laboratory Animals at Dalian Medical University Dalian China which were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Dalian Medical University Permit Number SYXK Liao 2008-0002.Experimental protocolAfter 1 week acclimatization the obese ZDF rats were randomly distributed in 3 groups n3 each ZDF control group -induced Diabetes- Associated Cognitive Decline PSD group and PS combined ZBPYR administration PDZ group.

Con control ZDF rats PSD ZDF rats treated with PS PDZ ZDF rats treated with PS combining ZBPYR administration.in ZDF rats with PSDACD Figure 1A-D and also enhanced learning and memory performance in PSDACD ZBPYR rats Figure 2-3.

To elucidate the role of ZBPYR in regulating the balance of gut microbiota affecting -induced diabetes-associated cognitive decline PSDACD we used male Zuker diabetes fatty ZDF rat as T2D model which presents developing hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycaemia 23 and is initiated with a mutation in the leptin receptor gene 24 25.RESULTSZBPYR improves glucose metabolism in ZDF rats exposed to PSThree chronic PS restriction rotation and congest were imposed on ZDF rat to establish a model of PSDACD while ZDF rat without PS was as control.

These results indicated that ZBPYR administration evidently improved cognitive decline of ZDF rats with PSDCAD.Figure 1 Effects of ZBPYR on glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in ZDF rats.

The relative percentage of Roseburia was less in model group than that in control group 0.18 vs. 2.15 Figure 6B in contrast greater numbers of Roseburia were detected in PDZ group compared with PSD group 0.53 vs. 0.18 Figure 6B.

Consistent with previous reports we found that the Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio was higher in PSD group compared with control group in addition it was recovered by ZBPYR administration in PDZ group Figure 6A.

In the Open Field test there were significant differences between the rats in Con group and PSD group but no differences between Con group and PDZ groupindicating that the model of depressive-like behaviors was successfully established in ZDF rats.

Compared with PSD group there were significant differences in PDZ ZDF rats with PSDACD by ZBPYR treatment group of the OGTT and ITT P  0.01 but the blood glucose did not recover to normal at the end point Figure 1A-1D.
