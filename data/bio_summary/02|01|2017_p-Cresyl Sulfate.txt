urinary p-cresol levels were still more pronounced as kidney function declined in ckd patients after normalisation for dietary protein intake .

accordingly in batch culture incubations with human faecal slurries phenol and p-cresol are the predominant end products of tyrosine fermentation  whereas the predominant end products of phenylalanine are phenylacetate and phenylpropionate .disturbed protein assimilation in ckdassimilation of protein digestion metabolism and absorption in the small intestine is impaired in both non-dialyzed and dialyzed ckd patients  which might contribute to protein malnutrition a well-known problem in ckd patients .

to the contrary when protein intake was enriched by 8.4 in healthy humans urinary p-cresol levels increased from a mean concentration of 7.71 - 2.47 mgg creatinine in the control period to 17.59 - 4.58 mgg creatinine in the protein rich period .

since pcs remains difficult to remove by dialysis the gut microbiota could be a future target to decrease pcs levels and its toxicity even at earlier stages of ckd aiming at slowing down the progression of the disease and decreasing the cardiovascular burden.keywords p-cresyl sulfate intestinal microbiota chronic kidney diseaseintroductionwhen kidney function deteriorates a myriad of compounds the so-called uremic retention solutes accumulate in the circulation and tissues -.

administration of ast-120 in ckd rats resulted in a decrease of serum pcs  and of p-cresol levels and a reduction of p-cresol urinary excretion .

the 13c protein breath test is used to measure the impairment of protein assimilation in ckd which worsens as kidney function declines.

it is of note that these levels reflect the sum of both conjugates pcs and pcg since p-cresol is not present at detectable levels in the circulation .diet and endogenous proteins and peptidessmall oligopeptides and amino acidsl-tyrosineol-phenylalanineoec 1.14.16.1.hoohnh2phenolec 1.4.1.20.ec 2.6.1.5.ec 2.6.1.57.4-hydroxyphenylpyruvateoec 1.4.1.20.ec 2.6.1.42.ec 2.6.1.57.phenylpyruvateohoho4-hydroxyphenylacetate-phenylacetaldehydehec 1.1.1.27.phenyllactateoo-ooohoec 4.1.1.83.p-cresolch3ec 1.2.1.39.phenylacetate-ohoec 2.8.2.1.ec 2.4.1.17.p-cresyl glucuronidep-cresyl sulfateo oh-ch3o oshoch3ooohooohfigure 1. conversion pathway of tyrosine and phenylalanine into p-cresyl sulfate.

exclusion of dietary protein intake by adhering to a vegan diet was shown to decrease bacterial urease activity by 66  and also to cause a decline of serum and urinary p-cresol and phenol levels .

this suggests that the reduced serum pcs levels are primarly due to blocking of p-cresol entry from the intestine into the circulation through restoring the intestinal tight junction protein expression by l. acidophilus .

from the section above it becomes clear that the information in this field of research is still scattered and incomplete underscoring that the characterization of the uremic intestinal microbiota will require further investigation before the composition of the responsible bacterial species contributing to the increased pcs and phenyl sulfate levels in ckd patients has been unraveled completely.next to the gut microbiota composition also its functional characteristics play a role in determining the gut levels of p-cresol.

correction of metabolic acidosis in ckd patients results in a normalization of the catabolic response to a low-protein diet by reducing amino acid oxidation and protein degradation and stimulating protein synthesis to normal levels .gut microbiotaintestinal phenolic compounds generating microbiotain general the most abundant bacterial phyla among the human adult gut microbiota are firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia and to a lesser extent cyanobacteria fusobacteria lentisphaerae spirochaetes and tm7 .

this is in agreement with a study in healthy subjects on a controlled diet whereby increasing the protein intake by 73.3 gday mainly by increasing meat intake resulted in a an elevation of the level of total urinary volatile phenol from a concentration of 74 - 14.5 mgday in the low protein diet period to 108 - 14.6 mgday in the high protein diet period.
