Among the possible causes the increase of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies during EBV primo-infection of Infectious mononucleosis IMN may damage the integrity of the blood-brain barrier facilitating the transfer of EBV-infected B cells and anti-EBV T cell clones in the brain.We investigated the change in titers of anti-Neu5Gc and anti-a13 Galactose antibodies in 49 IMN in 76 MS and 73 clinically isolated syndrome CIS patients as well as agegender-matched healthy individuals.Anti-Gal and anti-Neu5Gc are significantly increased during IMN p  0.02 and p b 1.10-4 respectively but not in acute CMV primo-infection.

Since 13 Gal antigen in con- trast to Neu5Gc is not derived from the diet and does not accumulate in human ECs we favor again that the elevated antibodies titers against both epitopes are the result of an increase of the antibody pool in the context of a strong percentage of EBV-infected B cells affecting both anti-Gal and anti-Neu5Gc progenitors.Nevertheless this first set of data suggests that anti-Neu5Gc increase during the IMN disease may enhance the transfer of anti-EBV committed T cells and EBV infected B cells in the brain following endothelial cell ac- tivation during IMN possibly favoring an autoimmunity process .The second aim of the study was to explore whether patients having developed a clinically definite MS exhibit elevated anti-Neu5Gc com- pared to age and gender matched normal individuals after having expe- rienced an EBV infection as it occurs for anti-EBNA antibodies for instances.

A shows that there was a significant increase in anti-Neu5Gc IgG in IMN patients 3.3 - 0.4 vs 1.8 - 0.2 ngul for controls a 1.8-fold increase p  0.02 consistent with studies sug- gesting that the anti-heterophile antibodies of the Paul-Bunnell- Davidsohn reaction were mainly anti-Neu5Gc Abs .

We show that whereas there was no change in anti-Neu5Gc in MSCIS the two populations exhibit a significant decrease in anti-Gal combined p  2.7.10-3 in contrast with patients with non-MSCIS central nervous system pathologies.Since anti-Gal result from an immunization against a13 Gal lacking in humans but produced in the gut our data suggest that CIS and MS patients have an altered microbiota or an altered response to this microbiotic epitope.c 2017 The Authors.

No significant difference between the levels of anti-Neu5Gc of the MS patients compared to matched healthy controls was noted when all the MS patients A 2.9 - 0.5 vs 2.3- 0.2 ngul p  0.71 or the sub-groups was observed data not shown.

However compared to age- and sex-matched healthy individuals we report for the first time that both MS and CIS patients ex- hibit a significant decreased level of anti-Gal IgG and discuss the poten- tial interest of this new observation with respect to MS etiology.PatientsPatients with infectious mononucleosis IMNSera from 49 patients with IMN were collected at disease onset from the University Hospital of Grenoble and Nantes between 2007 and 2014.

Unfortunately we could only study an anecdotical number of patients for whom several sera post IMN were available and a limitation of our study is the absence of long term survey of anti-Neu5Gc titers and possible exposure to these antibodies.

Indeed the rem- nant immunological traces of such an initial biological signal are only assessed when clinical symptoms of the disease are identified years after the initiating event.We first revisited the change of anti-Neu5Gc and anti-a13 Galactose antibodies resulting from the lack of synthesis of these two sugars fol- lowing the lost-mutation of the CMAH and GGT1 enzymes respectively  during IMN and show a significant increase in anti-Neu5Gc as well as in anti-Gal during this disease.
