among the possible causes the increase of anti-neu5gc antibodies during ebv primo-infection of infectious mononucleosis imn may damage the integrity of the blood-brain barrier facilitating the transfer of ebv-infected b cells and anti-ebv t cell clones in the brain.we investigated the change in titers of anti-neu5gc and anti-a13 galactose antibodies in 49 imn in 76 ms and 73 clinically isolated syndrome cis patients as well as agegender-matched healthy individuals.anti-gal and anti-neu5gc are significantly increased during imn p  0.02 and p b 1.10-4 respectively but not in acute cmv primo-infection.

a highly significant increase in anti-gal titers was however also observed during imn b 10.4 - 0.7 vs 4.2 - 0.7 ngul for controls a 2.4-fold increase p b 0.0001 ruling out a specific response against neu5gc in imn disease and suggesting a non-specific response.

the results are expressed in ngml as individual plots with median and interquartile range for each group for anti- neu5gc igg a and anti-gal igg b n  7676 and in uml for anti-ebna1 c n  7667. p b 0.05 p b 0.01 p b 0.001 using a wilcoxon non-parametric paired test for anti-neu5gc and -gal iggs and a mann whitney non-parametric unpaired test for anti- ebna1.elevated titers of so called heterophile antibodies against bovine or horse red blood cells during imn have been reported several decades ago an observation that has been the basis of the paul-bunnel- davisohn test in imn .

as ebv also infects b cells during imn  we suggest that the very high proportion of b- cells infected by ebv during imn provides a better rationale to explain the rise of anti-neu5gc and anti-gal in this disease by comparison with acute cmv primo-infection.

since 13 gal antigen in con- trast to neu5gc is not derived from the diet and does not accumulate in human ecs we favor again that the elevated antibodies titers against both epitopes are the result of an increase of the antibody pool in the context of a strong percentage of ebv-infected b cells affecting both anti-gal and anti-neu5gc progenitors.nevertheless this first set of data suggests that anti-neu5gc increase during the imn disease may enhance the transfer of anti-ebv committed t cells and ebv infected b cells in the brain following endothelial cell ac- tivation during imn possibly favoring an autoimmunity process .the second aim of the study was to explore whether patients having developed a clinically definite ms exhibit elevated anti-neu5gc com- pared to age and gender matched normal individuals after having expe- rienced an ebv infection as it occurs for anti-ebna antibodies for instances.

high titers of anti-ebna1 antibodies prior to ms onset or at the time of a clinical- ly isolated syndrome as well as a previous history of infectious mononucleosis imn or high anti-ebv titers have also been shown to increase the risk of developing ms.the relationship between ms and response to ebv has led to specula- tion in the context of a hygiene theory of autoimmunity .

we suggested that the vigorous produc- tion of anti-neu5gc a major component of the paul-bunnell- davidsohn reaction  which occurs in imn  may represent a key factor in altering the bbb selectivity consistent with the high fre- quency of circulating ebv committed t cells and of ebv infected memory b cells of the ebv primary infection.

we suggested that the anti-myelin pro- cess is a secondary event resulting from an anti-ebv immune response imported in the central nervous system cns and initiating local autoimmunity.establishing evidence for a causal role for a peculiar immune re- sponse to imn in ms etiology faces various difficulties.

indeed the rem- nant immunological traces of such an initial biological signal are only assessed when clinical symptoms of the disease are identified years after the initiating event.we first revisited the change of anti-neu5gc and anti-a13 galactose antibodies resulting from the lack of synthesis of these two sugars fol- lowing the lost-mutation of the cmah and ggt1 enzymes respectively  during imn and show a significant increase in anti-neu5gc as well as in anti-gal during this disease.

however compared to age- and sex-matched healthy individuals we report for the first time that both ms and cis patients ex- hibit a significant decreased level of anti-gal igg and discuss the poten- tial interest of this new observation with respect to ms etiology.patientspatients with infectious mononucleosis imnsera from 49 patients with imn were collected at disease onset from the university hospital of grenoble and nantes between 2007 and 2014. the gender ratio was 22f27m.

imn was serologically confirmed by the detection of vca igm without anti-ebna1 igg.

four patients had multiple blood samples harvested from 7 to 820 days after imn diag- nosis.

each sample from mscis imn cmv primo-infection or non-mscis central nervous system diseases was compared to a sample from a normal indi- vidual paired for age and gender.

in contrast the anti- neu5gc igm test had low reproducibility and was further excluded from the analysis icc  0.32 p  0.93.statisticsfor each antibody the statistical significance of the comparisons were assessed using non-parametric matched pairs-wilcoxon tests to account for any possible effect of age or gender on the observed traits imn and mscis are age-dependent traits and gender is a well-established dimor- phism in ms. neu5gc sensitization may be associated with age as ob- served in the controls r  0.14 p  0.048. statistical analyses were performed using graphpad stata 13 se and r statistical software.resultsanti-neu5gc and anti-gal antibodies in a normal populationsince ms has a strong bias for gender and age our initial design pre- dicted a possible similar bias in the anti-neu5gc igg without any pub- lished reference values in the literature and with a trend for an effect of age in normal individuals.

however al- though the analyses were performed using agegender matching values the various patient cohorts including imn ms and cis tested did not show a correlation with agegender.
