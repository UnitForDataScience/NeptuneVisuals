Neverthe- less the study aim is not to evaluate the role of airway microbiota and CCL5 on the development of bronchiolitis but to investigate their integrated contributions to the disease severity among infants with bronchiolitis.

Association of nasopha- ryngeal microbiota profiles with bronchiolitis severity in infants hos- pitalized for bronchiolitis.

In the current analysis we studied the same cohort of infants with severe bronchiolitis to determine the interaction between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and CCL5 with regard to the disease severity.

METHODS We analyzed data from a multicenter prospective cohort study of infants with severe bronchiolitis.

Briefly this cohort study the 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration MARC-354 enrolled 1016 infants aged12 months hospitalized for bronchiolitis at 17 sites across 14 US states Table S1 during the 2011-2014 winter seasons.

RESULTS Of 1016 infants with bronchiolitis 1005 98.9 met the 16S rRNA gene sequencing quality control requirements for the analysis.

DISCUSSION In this multicenter cohort study of 1005 infants with severe bronchiolitis we found a statistically significant interaction between nasopharyngeal airway CCL5 and microbiota profiles with regard to the disease severity.

It is possible that a specific function not struc- ture of the airway microbiota through altering the expression of CCL5 locally influences bronchiolitis severity.
