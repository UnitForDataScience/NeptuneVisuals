The CPW was dominated by Rhodobacteraceae mainly Marivita 33.31 Rhodobacteraceae 12.34Differences in bacterial communities between the source water SWW and SWS pond water with E. prolifera CPEW and CPES and pond water in which E. prolifera-free CPW and CPS.

The most prominent exampleHeatmap showing the differences in the distributions of the most abundant bacterial species  1 among the source water SWW and SWS pond water with E. prolifera CPEW and CPES and pond water in which E. prolifera -free CPW and CPS.

In addition pond water samples with E. prolifera clustered together and they were separated from inlet water and pond water without E. prolifera indicating that bacterial com- munities in the CPEW were affected by E. prolifera.Taxonomic compositionAll sequences were classified from phylum to genus according to the program QIIME using the default setting and 53 different phyla or groups were identified in the samples.

Colored bars represent relative percentages.Detrended correspondence analysis DCA of bacterial community between the source of water SWW and SWS pond water with E. prolifera CPEW and CPES and pond water in which E. prolifera -free CPW and CPS.of this difference is the presence in the CPW and CPS of many species that are rare in the CPEW and CPES samples .

These findings indicate that the samples obtained from pond water with E. prolifera had distinctly different species compositions com- pared with the samples from the pond without E. prolifera ANOVA p  0.01.DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to explore the bacterial diversity from source seawater to the aquaculture environment and especially to compare bacterial communities in environments with or without E. prolifera.

a Phylum taxonomic level b Order taxonomic level.Heatmap showing the phylogenetic distribution between the source water SWW and SWS pond water with E. prolifera CPEW and CPES and pond water in which E. prolifera -free CPW and CPS.

The clustering results also indicated that groups of pond sediment communities were more similar to each other than to those of the pond water samples.

There were also many dominant bacterial taxa such as Roseobacter Saprospiraceae Thalassobaculum Loktanella and Lutibacterium in the pond water of CPW which were rare in the CPEW pond.

The CPS was dominated by Gamma- proteobacteria incertae sedis 10.37 Aliifodinibius 6.00 Marinobacter 5.64 Rhodo-bacteraceae 4.59 and Chitinophagaceae 3.83.The most abundant bacterial species and a detrended correspondence analysis DCATo explore the effect of E. prolifera on the bacterial communities highly abundant  1 species were illustrated with a heatmap  and a DCA .

The samples obtained from pond water with E. prolifera were mainly composed of Microcella Candidatus Aquiluna rubra Rhodobacteraceae and Actinomycetales.
