Throughout the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test IPGTT DIOPB mice showed improved glucose and insulin profiles compared to DIOPF animals E and F. Likewise the DIOPF group showed a striking reduction in the glucose infusion rate measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp compared with control animals and the probiotic treatment partially restored insulin sensitivity in DIOPF G. It is important to mention that the probiotic treatment did not induce significant difference in any physiologic and metabolic parameters studied in animals fed on chow diet A-G.Effects of probiotic treatment on insulin signaling in liver and muscle of DIO miceAs expected in liver and muscle of mice fed on HFD insulin- stimulated AktSer 473 phosphorylation levels were significantly reduced compared to the control animals A-B.

As expected in parallel there was an increase in activation of insulin signaling in liver and muscle improving insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance .The positive feedback loop between JNK and proinflammatory cytokines can perpetuate a vicious cycle of low-grade inflammatory signaling contributing to enhanced insulin resistance .

These findings shed light on probiotics as an important tool to prevent and treat patients with obesity and insulin resistance.c 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Prime insulin Human recombinant insulin Eli Lilly Indianapolis IN USA was continuously infused 30 mU kg-1 min-1 up to 120 min.

Fasted mice for 12 h received intracerebroventricular ICV infusion of vehicle or insulin 200 mU in 2 ml Eli Lilly and Company Indianapolis IN USA at 800 a.m. Foodintake was recorded over 4 and 12 h. Next day same mice were fasted for 12 h and received ICV infusion of vehicle or insulin 15 min before the hypothalamic tissue dissection.

In addition to greater leptin sensitivity we observed an enhanced anorexigenic effect in response to ICV insulin administration in the DIOPB group after 4 and 12 h C. In parallel Akt phosphorylation was increased in response to ICV insulin in the hypothalamus of DIOPB compared to DIOPF mice D. We further measured mRNA levels of NPY and POMC in the hypothalamus since these neuropeptides have major action regulating food intake.

In the current study we evaluated the effects of probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidumi on gut microbiota changes in permeability and insulin sensitivity and signaling in high-fat diet and control animals.

More importantly we investigated the effects of these gut modulations on hypothalamic control of food intake and insulin and leptin signaling.

Blood was drawn to determine levels of glucose insulin LPS cytokines and GLP-1.
