lab populations in either untreated or citrus extract-treated tzatziki salad were high irrespective of tempera-ture during the entire storage period in agreement with counts reported for yogurt with fruit stored at 5 oc for 60 days   and tzatsiki salad treated with citrus extract or nata- mycin at 4 oc .citrus extract did not cause a major reduction in the numbers of lab in agreement with results recently reported by on effects of citrus extract or chitosan on turkey meat.

citrus extract solutions 0.1 or 0.2 ml were added into 100 g tzatziki salad resulting in final citrus extract concentrations of 1 or 2 mlkg.bacterial strainstwo strains of e. coli o157h7 e. coli serotype o157h7 nctc 12900 purchased from health protection agency culture collec- tions salisbury uk and e. coli serotype o157h7 atcc 43888 was courtesy of professor dr. hilde nilsen matforsk norway were used.

tzatziki samples were subsequently kept under refrigeration in a cooling incubator 4 - 0.5 oc before the addition of the antimicrobials and the deliberately inoculated bacterial cultures see below.citrus extract solution and its addition to tzatziki saladcitroxr a commercial citrus extract containing 18 g citric acid 100 ml 18 g malic acid100 ml and 5 g ascorbic acid100 ml withtrade name progarda 14wplus was purchased from polypan group s.a. athens greece.

the least significant difference lsd procedure was used to test for differences between means p  0.05. microbiological counts were converted to log cfug and were subjected to analysis of variance using the software stat graphics statistical graphics corp. rockville md usa.resultseffect of citrus extract treatment on tzatziki microbiotathe mesophilic tpc data not shown lab a and band yeasts a and b in the tzatziki samples both with and without citrus extract were monitored during storage at 4 10 and 21 oc for 70 35 and 15 days respectively.

therefore the aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of citrus extract on a the naturally occurring microbiota in the traditional greek yogurt-based appetizer salad tzatziki and b the survival of e. coli o157h7 and l. monocytogenes and in the saladwhen stored in air at 4 10 and 21 oc for 70 35 and 15 daysrespectively.materials and methodstzatziki samplesfresh tzatziki was provided by a local ready-to-eat rte salad- processing company amvrosia sa veria greece within 1h production and delivered in 1 kg vats insulated polystyrene on ice flakes.

3. survival of e. coli o157h67 within tzatziki a traditional greek yogurt-based salad during storage oc at 4 a 10 b and 21 c in the absence of citrus extract e  and in the presence of citrus extract added at 1 mlkg e1 - and 2 mlkg e2 .

in a recent study it was demonstrated that citrusextract combined with chitosan was effective against s. enterica and e. coli inoculated in turkey meat stored under vacuum pack- aging at 4 and 10 oc .conclusionthe results of our study demonstrated the potential of citrus extract as a natural compound with powerful antibacterial activity that can control the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria such as l. monocytogenes and e. coli o157h7 in tzatziki a yogurt-based salad.

the volume of the inoculum added to each sample serially diluted in ringer as appropriate was 1 ml.fresh tzatziki samples approximately 100 - 10 g were pack- aged in low density polyethylenepolyamide ldpepa barrier pouches ver pack thessaloniki greece of 75 mm thickness having an oxygen permeability of 52.2 cm3 m-2 d-1 at 75 relative humidity rh 23 oc a carbon dioxide permeability of 191 cm3 m-2 d-1 atm-1 at 0 rh 23 oc and a water vapor permeability of2.4 g m-2 d-1 at 100 rh 23 oc.

additionally the addition of citrus extract reduced the typical garlic flavor of tzatziki salad thereby imparting a fruity flavor sensory data not shown.regarding the presence of l. monocytogenes and e. coli o157h7 in tzatziki we wanted to reflect post-processing contamination rather than survival during production processes.

1. changes in the lab log cfug within tzatziki a traditional greek yogurt- based salad during storage oc at 4 a 10 b and 21 c in the absence of citrus extract t  and in the presence of citrus extract added at 1 mlkg c1 - and 2 ml kg c2 .

4. survival of l. monocytogenes within tzatziki a traditional greek yogurt-based salad during storage oc at 4 a 10 b and 21 c in the absence of citrus extract l  and in the presence of citrus extract added at 1 mlkg l1 - and 2 mlkg l2 .

apparently in the present study the use of citrus extract was effective for the inhibition of yeasts maintaining significantly lower p  0.05 counts approximately 2.0e3.4 logs than control samples on finaldays 70 35 15 at 4 10 21 oc respectively during storage a bc in agreement with results reported for tzatziki salad treated with citrus extract or natamycin .

two experiments were conducted experiment a in the absence of pathogens and in the presence of citrus extract and experiment b in the presence of both artificially inoculated pathogens and citrus extract.in experiment a effect of added antimicrobials in tzatziki salad absence of inoculated pathogens salads were subdivided into three lots t control absence of antimicrobial c1 with added citrus extract 1 mlkg and c2 with added citrus extract 2 mlkg.

allstrains were available as frozen  30 oc cultures in trypticase soybroth with 0.6 yeast extract tsbye lab m athens greece tsbye and 20 glycerol merk darmstadt germany and were activated by transferring 1 ml of stock culture in 9 ml of tsbye incubated at 37 oc for 24 h. working cultures were kept on slants of tsbye at 4 oc and transferred monthly.

coli o157h7 in the untreated tzatziki salad are in agreement with the findings of who demonstrated that the viability of e. coli o157h7 in camel yogurt was reduced significantly by 3.4e3.5 log cfuml during storage at 4 or 10 oc.
