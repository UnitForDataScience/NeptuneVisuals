Citrus extract solutions 0.1 or 0.2 mL were added into 100 g Tzatziki salad resulting in final citrus extract concentrations of 1 or 2 mLkg.Bacterial strainsTwo strains of E. coli O157H7 E. coli serotype O157H7 NCTC 12900 purchased from Health Protection Agency Culture Collec- tions Salisbury UK and E. coli serotype O157H7 ATCC 43888 was courtesy of Professor Dr. Hilde Nilsen Matforsk Norway were used.

coli O157H7 showed very diverse patterns of survival in the E untreated and E1 E2 citrus extract-treated salad samples that varied according to storage temperature a b c. Populations of inoculated 6 log cfug E. coli showed major declines in both E untreated and E1 E2 citrus extract-treated samples from day 0e70 35 and 15 at 4 10 and 21 oC respectively a b c. Citrusextract had a significant effect P  0.05 on inoculated E. coliO157H7 resulting in reductions of 2.8e4.8 log cfug in the E1 E2citrus extract-treated samples.

In Experiment B effect of added antimicrobials on the survival of pathogens inoculated in the Tzatziki salad six treatments three for each strain were tested as follows E E. coli with no added antimicrobial E1 E. coli with C1 E2 E. coli with C2 L L. monocytogenes with no added antimicrobial L1 L. monocytogenes with C1 and L2 L. monocytogenes with C2.

In a recent study it was demonstrated that Citrusextract combined with chitosan was effective against S. enterica and E. coli inoculated in turkey meat stored under vacuum pack- aging at 4 and 10 oC .ConclusionThe results of our study demonstrated the potential of citrus extract as a natural compound with powerful antibacterial activity that can control the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria such as L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157H7 in Tzatziki a yogurt-based salad.

Survival of E. coli O157H67 within Tzatziki a traditional Greek yogurt-based salad during storage oC at 4 a 10 b and 21 c in the absence of citrus extract E  and in the presence of citrus extract added at 1 mLkg E1 - and 2 mLkg E2 .

LAB populations in either untreated or citrus extract-treated Tzatziki salad were high irrespective of tempera-ture during the entire storage period in agreement with counts reported for yogurt with fruit stored at 5 oC for 60 days   and Tzatsiki salad treated with citrus extract or nata- mycin at 4 oC .Citrus extract did not cause a major reduction in the numbers of LAB in agreement with results recently reported by on effects of citrus extract or chitosan on turkey meat.

coli O157H7 Listeria Tzatzikia b s t r a c t The antimicrobial effect of citrus extract at 1 mLkg C1 and 2 mLkg C2 on naturally occurring microbiota and inoculated pathogens E. coli O157H7 and L. monocytogenes at ca.

Strains were sub- cultured twice in TSBYE 37 oC 24 h before use in the experiments.Tzatziki salad inoculation packaging and treatmentsTzatziki was inoculated with a cocktail of two strains for each of the pathogens added at equal concentration 11 of inocula namely E. coli serotypes O157H7 NCTC 12900 ATCC 43888 and L. monocytogenes L. innocua prepared by mixing 1 mL of TSBYE culture 37 oC 24 h. The initial inoculum of E. coli O157H7 and Listeria spp.

Citrus extract had a significant effect on the survival of the inoculated E. coli O157H7 with reductions of 2.8e4.8 log cfug in the citrus extract-treated samples at the end of the storage period.

Therefore the aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of citrus extract on a the naturally occurring microbiota in the traditional Greek yogurt-based appetizer salad Tzatziki and b the survival of E. coli O157H7 and L. monocytogenes and in the saladwhen stored in air at 4 10 and 21 oC for 70 35 and 15 daysrespectively.Materials and methodsTzatziki samplesFresh Tzatziki was provided by a local Ready-to-Eat RTE salad- processing company AMVROSIA SA Veria Greece within 1h production and delivered in 1 kg vats insulated polystyrene on ice flakes.
