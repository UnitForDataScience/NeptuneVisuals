In addition prolonged treatment with broad- spectrum antibiotics in the neonatal period has been associated with colonization of infants with antimicrobial-resistant Gram- negative bacteria at the time of discharge from the NICU with the potential for dissemination of resistant Gram-negative bacteria from colonized infants to other medical facilities or to the com- munity .Opportunities for antibiotic stewardship in neonatal careThere are certain clinical paradigms where the routine use of antibiotics and choice of antibiotics is being re-examined i empirical antibiotics for suspected sepsis in term and late preterm infants born to mothers with chorioamnionitis ii continued antibiotic use in the NICU for culture-negative sepsis iii choice of antibiotics for late onset sepsis.Chorioamnionitis and empiric therapy for suspected sepsisChorioamnionitis has long been recognized as a significant risk factor for early onset sepsis EOS.

Similarly preterm VLBW infants born by cesarean section solely for maternal in- dications such as pre-eclampsia without preterm labor or prema- ture rupture of membranes are at markedly reduced risk of EOS and consideration may be given to not initiating antibiotics or for discontinuing antibiotics early .Reasons for extending antibiotic treatment include concernsabout the reliability of blood cultures when blood volumes are small or due to intrapartum antibiotics.

Revised terminology and diagnostic criteria were proposed as well as changes in the management of newborns of mothers with sus- pected intrauterine infection most notably a proposal to consider close observation of asymptomatic infants greater than 34 weeks gestation born to mothers with suspected not confirmed intra- amniotic infection rather than initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy .Decreasing antibiotic use in the NICUThe other group of infants that receives a large proportion of antibiotics are those admitted to the NICU particularly preterm or VLBW infants.

When standard antibiotics are no longer effective second- and third-line antibiotics are required with po- tential delays in effective therapy increased morbidity and mor- tality adverse effects and costs.Antimicrobial stewardship is a co-ordinated program that pro- motes the appropriate use of antimicrobials including antibiotics improves patient outcomes reduces microbial resistance and de- creases the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant or- ganisms .

Most of the intermediate-level NICUs reported zero rates of culture-proven infection and yet 50 were in the highest antibiotic use quartile.Adverse effects of antibiotics in neonatesWhereas the benefits of antibiotics cannot be denied there are real and potential risks of the prevalent exposure of the mater- nalefetal dyad to antibiotics.

Antibiotic pro- phylaxis given after cord clamping to avoid neonatal exposure to antibiotics has been supplanted by pre-incision prophylaxis similar to prophylaxis for other surgical procedures again increasing the exposure to antibiotics to the neonate albeit briefly .Chorioamnionitis or acute inflammation of the chorion and amnion layers of the membranes is estimated to occur in 3e10 of deliveries at term but clinical diagnosis is subjective and variable leading to antibiotic treatment in the mother and invariably evaluation and antibiotic treatment of the newborn .Antibiotic use in neonatesSuspected sepsis is the most usual working diagnosis for infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units NICUs .

This included recommendations for laboratory evaluation and treatment for babies born to mothers with suspected chorioamnionitis including empiric treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics even in asymptomatic infants with the direction to discontinue antibiotics after 48 h if the infant remains asymptomatic blood culture is negative and the laboratory results complete blood count - C-reactive protein are normal.

DOT may be applied to all or to select antibiotics and measured monthly to monitor trends.Antibiotic use rate AUR is the total number of patient-days on which infants are exposed to antibiotics or antifungals adminis- tered intravenously or intramuscularly per 100 patient-days expressed as a percentage.

The COFN report also recommended treating asymptomatic neonates with prolonged antibiotics despite a sterile blood culture if the mother received intrapartum antibiotics and the laboratory tests were abnormal.

Decreasing rates of central-line-associated bloodstream infections with infection prevention measures will result in lower rates of CONS infections and may have a further impact on antibiotic uti- lization rates overall and on vancomycin use in particular .A combination of antibiotics is normally used in critically illinfants with necrotizing enterocolitis NEC or complicated intra- abdominal infections where polymicrobial infection with aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms is probable but again there is significant variability in the choice of antibiotics and duration of treatment.
