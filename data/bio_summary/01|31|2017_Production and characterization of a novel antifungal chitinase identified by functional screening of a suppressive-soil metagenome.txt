in all the above experimen- tal conditions an intense protein band at the expected molecular mass for chi18h8 was observed in sds- page only in the insoluble fractions from the recombi- nant strain harboring the chi18h8 gene no signal was detected in cytoplasmic soluble fractions nor in cell-free culture broths after protein precipitation with trichloro- acetic acid.

b. indeed none chitinolytic activity was found when the contaminating proteins were eluted from wa11 resin by an isocratic elution using 50 vv ethanol in 100 mm hepes ph 5.6. as summarized in table  the two-step lactic acid solubilizationhic purification method allowed the recovery of more than 55 of the recombinant enzyme accumulated into ibs with a 320-fold increase of specific activity from 0.2 umg protein in the ibs to 63.9 umg protein after hic purification.table 1 chi18h8 solubilization from ibs of e. coli bl21 startmde3pet24bchi18h8 cells in acidic ph conditionssolubilization yield was estimated by densitometric analysis of proteins separated by sds-page.

solubilized protein was about 70 pure as revealed by sds-page densitometric analysis simi- larly to the results obtained with the protein produced in flasks not shown.

importantly both upstream cultivation and protein expression induction and down- stream ib recovery and solubilization and protein puri- fication processes were scalable from shaken flasks to 3 l bench- and to 30 l industrial pilot scale-bioreactors giving comparable results in terms of recombinant e. coli biomass ib solubilization and purification yields and chi18h8 biological activity.

however the extremely low production and purification yield of chi18h8 21 mgg cell at that time prevented any further investigation on its properties including its potential biotechnological applications.here we report how we succeeded in producing hun- dreds of milligrams of pure and biologically active chi18h8 by developing and scaling up a high-yielding process in a 30 l bioreactor based on the recovery of the recombinant protein from e. coli inclusion bodies ibs.

for lb tb and sb media protein expression was induced by add- ing 0.4 mm isopropyl b-d-thiogalactopyranoside iptg to cells at early- or late-exponential growth phase.

when cell culture reached an od600nm  0.6 protein production was induced by adding 0.4 mm iptg cultivation was then prolonged at 20 degc for further 24 h.recovery of ibs and solubilization of chi18h8escherichia coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3220xg for 20 min washed with sodium chloride-tris- edta ste buffer 10 mm tris-hcl ph 8.0 1 mm edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 100 mm nacl.

the solubilized protein was then dialyzed overnight against 100 mm sodium acetate buffer ph 5.0 or 100 mm 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesul- fonic acid hepes ph 5.6.chi18h8 purificationenzyme samples following dialysis were used for testing different chromatographic methods described in details in additional file  table s2.

chi18h8 purification enrichment was achieved by loading the protein sample after dialysis against 100 mm hepes ph 5.6 onto the weak anionic exchanger diaion wa11 resin resindion s.r.l.

the chro- matography run under hydrophobic interaction hic conditions allowed to fully recover the chi18h8 protein in the flow-through whereas other proteins retained by the wa11 resin were then recovered by an isocratic elu- tion using 50 vv ethanol in 100 mm hepes ph 5.6. the chi18h8 concentration was estimated using the the-oretical extinction coefficient at 280 nm 77015 m-1cm-1 based on the amino acid sequence of the protein.sds-page electrophoresis and zymogram analysis chi18h8 size production and solubilization were ana- lyzed by sds-page with 12 wv polyacrylamide gels and estimated by densitometric analysis quan- tity one bio-rad laboratories hercules usa using known amount of his6-glycine oxidase his6-go from bacillus subtilis  as a standard.

briefly the protein sam- ples were diluted in a sample buffer lacking any reduc- ing agent and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.

stability of the enzyme was tested by incubating the recombinant protein at 30 degc at differ- ent phs in 100 mm sodium acetate ph 5.0 or 100 mm sodium phosphate ph 6.0 and 7.0 after different incu- bation times from 0 to 144 h the residual chitinolytic activity was assayed on 4-mu-glcnac2.effect of metal ions organic solvents detergents and other compounds on chi18h8 activitythe effect of metal ions ca2 cacl2 x 2h2o cu2cucl2 x 2h2o fe3 fecl3 x 6h2o k kcl mg2 mgcl2 x 6h2o mn2 mncl2 x 4h2o ni2 nicl2x 6h2o nh4 nh4cl zn2 zncl2 co2 cocl2 x6h2o reducing agents dithiothreitol dtt 2-mer- captoethanol the chelating agent edta detergents sds triton x-100 tween-20 doc n-lauroylsarcosine nls nonidet-40 organic solvents ethanol metha- nol propanol dimethyl sulfoxide dmso sugars glc- nac chitobiose and salt nacl on chi18h8 activity was investigated by adding each compound to the fluorimetric assay mixture.
