Accordingly 550 protein groups involved in flagellar assembly were matched including flagellin FlgL FlgE FlgK FlgG FliFYscJ FlgJ FliN FlhF FliG MotB and MotA and the sum of LFQ intensity of flagellin and FlgL occupied 99.6 of these proteins B. Subtotals of LFQ intensities were calculated according to annotated COG protein names and each of these COG-annotated proteins were examined with a t test revealing significant partial contributions of mucin to the expression of flagellin and related hook-associated protein FlgL C flagellar hook protein FlgE flagellar motor component MotA and flagellar biosynthesistype III secretory pathway M-ring protein FliF YscJ .Second we compared the classical BCM medium and medium 3 because these media only differ by the presence of mucin.

We found that 19 out of the 79 proteins in cluster V were matched to the Bacteroidetes or Proteobacteria phyla and were annotated as peroxiredoxin rubrerythrin thioredoxin superoxide dismutase catalase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit AhpF  which are major components involved in oxidative stress re- sponse- and heat-shock proteins GroEL GroES and DnaK which are involved in general stress response.Among the 52 proteins in cluster VIII 14 proteins all matching to Bacteroidetes  were outer membrane receptor OMR proteins related with iron transport and cobalamin acquisition suggesting an important effect of inorganic salts on iron-related pathways.Bile salts showed significant effects in clusters II 48 and 24 h a  0.01 12 h a  0.05 IV 48 and 24 h a  0.05 24 h a 0.1 and VI 48 and 24 h a  0.01 12 h a  0.001.

The taxonomic annotation phylum level of the leading protein in each protein group was directly extracted from the annotation file 184sample.uniqgene.NR.anno.mer- ge.gz published by Xiao et al.using an in-house Perl script.PLS-DA ModelingAll missing values of the log10-transformed and Q95-filtered protein group abundance data were imputed using the KNN algorithmand then partial least-squares discriminant analyses PLS-DA was performed in MetaboAnalyst for discriminating proteins differentially abundant in response to each medium component.

A Mucin starvation increased flagellin and related hook-associated protein FlgL marked with a red block 51.22 of total LFQ intensity in cluster 7 and co-up-regulated several proteins with STRING functional links as shown by lines linking each protein size of circles indicate relative abundance of the proteins.

Generally 57.3 of these responding proteins were assigned to COG categories of energy production and conversion C amino acid transport and metabolism E carbohydrate transport and metabolism G translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis J and cell wall membrane and envelope biogenesis M. Taxonomic analysis using protein sequences of each cluster suggested that most of the proteomic responses were taxonomy-dependent C. A total of 87.5-96.8 of the proteins of each protein group from clusters I VI and VIII were assigned to Bacteroidetes while 74.4-95.1 of those from clusters II IV and VII were assigned to Firmicutes.The cultured microbiome's responses to inorganic salts were significant in clusters I 48 h a  0.05 24 and 12 h a  0.1 V 48 and 24 h a  0.0001 12 h a  0.00 001 and VIII 48 and12 h a  0.001 24 h a  0.01.

We summarized a detailed list of responding proteins in response to medium components  including protein IDs COG functional informa- tion taxonomic estimation and fold-changes for aiding researchers with selecting proper medium for their specific experimental purposes.For general purpose culturing maintenance of the micro- biome both functionally and compositionally would be demanded.

Regardless of the technical approach nutritional components in the culture medium are key determinants for the performance of in vitro culturing systems of gut microbiomes.For decades most experiments have been conducted with basal culture medium BCM which contains peptone and casein yeast extract inorganic salts bile salts vitamin K and hemin.-Many studies have employed modified versions of the BCM medium to study microbial communities.gut microbiome and drugs.

Using Perseus version 1.5.2.4 the LFQ intensity of each protein group was log10- transformed and filtered with the criteria that the protein should be identified by 1 unique peptides in 95 of the samples Q95.The protein group abundances were Z-score- normalized across all samples and analyzed by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis PCA todetermine if any intrinsic clustering or outliers existed within the data set.

For each row cluster obtained above the average of Z-scores of the clustered proteins in each sample was calculated as the response of factors in the multifactor ANOVA.Protein-Protein Interaction AnalysesThe proteins with VIP values 1.0 were aligned against the COG database ftpftp.ncbi.nih.govpubCOGCOG2014 data with DIAMOND using the default parameters e-value cutoff of 0.001.The COG ID of the best hit for each protein was used for protein-protein interaction network analysis on the STRING database version 10.0  and visualized using enhancedGraphics on Cytoscape.
