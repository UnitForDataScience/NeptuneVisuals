in vivo animal models and human cohort trials have been used to study thefunction and dynamics of host-associated microbiomes.- however logistical constraints preclude testing the effects of multiple compounds on the microbiome using these models.instead compounds are generally tested against a single bacteriumand occasionally cultured microbiomes.it is promising to adopt in vitro culturing of the whole gut microbiome because it reveals the direct interaction betweenin vitro culturing of gut microbiome is typically achieved by means of static batch cultures.for example we have adopted static batch cultures in conjunction with our stable isotopically labeled microbiota silami-based metaproteomic strategy to assess the microbiome response to fructo-oligosaccharide and different monosaccharides.
