Glomeromycota represented 3.9 and 10.1 of the total number of sequences in the DNA and RNA fractions respectively but the differences between these fractions were not significant .At the population level very few fungal OTUs were shared by all co-occurring plantsNine OTUs out of a total of 635 OTUs were found in both the DNA and RNA fractions of all of the 19 co-occurring A. stolonifera plants accounting for 33 of the total number of sequences .

a special case of Hill diversity numbers when q  0 was significantly higher in the RNA fractions than in the DNA fractions with on average 149 OTUs in the RNA fractions and 133 OTUs in the DNA fractions p  0.01 .

This new understanding resulted from the application of DNA and RNA co-extraction strategy.OTU richness and taxonomic composition of the root fungal microbiome differed between the DNA and RNA fractionsIn previous studies the fungal community composition in roots was essentially analyzed either by cloning of PCR products e.g.

This metric was obtained for each OTU by dividing the mean relative abundance in the RNA fractions mean RARNA by the sum of the mean relative abundance in the DNA mean RADNA and RNA fractions among all samples.mean expression ratio mean RARNAmean RARNA  mean RADNAwithmean RA n i1RAOTUinn  number of plants showing the OTUi within their DNA andor RNA fraction The standard errors were then calculated for each OTU of the 19 samples.

Comparison of the phylogenetic relatedness of the OTUs in the DNA and RNA fractions of each sample with the local pool of OTUs OTUs found in all samples was based on two indices the mean pairwise distance MDP and the mean nearest taxon distance MNTD described by .

Moreover the OTUs shared by all the plants in both their DNA and RNA fractions were mainly abundant OTUs affiliated to Pezizomycotina Ascomycota which represented more than 30 of all the sequences.An increased sequencing depth would lead to an increase of the rare rather than abundant OTUs.

stolonifera fungal endophytic communities exhibited significant phylogenetic clusteringWe found that the fungal communities in plant roots exhibited a significant phylogenetic structure whether the analyses were based on DNA or RNA which confirmed our working hypothesis that the fungal communities in plant roots are not random assemblages .

Kse values below one indicated that the OTUs were more divergent in their 'mean expression ratio' than would be expected under a Brownian motion model of trait evolution whereas a value above one indicated that the values of the 'mean expression ratio' were more similar between phylogenetically related OTUs than between OTUs drawn at random.DISCUSSIONIn this study we assessed the complexity of the fungal root microbiome of co-occurringA.

Strikingly most of the OTUs in the fungal potential 'core microbiome' were only distantly related to known species .The fungal root microbiome is phylogenetically structuredWe tested our working hypothesis that the host plant acts as an environmental filter on microbial communities by examining the phylogenetic structure of the fungal root microbiome.

Two analyses were performed to create the null communities one using all the OTUs and another one using the OTUs obtained separately from the DNA and the RNA fractions.
