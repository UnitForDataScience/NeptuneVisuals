Thecycling protocol was 94 oC for 5 min initial denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 94 oC for 45 s denaturation 50 oC for 45 s annealing and 72 oC for 1 min extension with a final extension of 72 oC for 10 min.All the PCR products were run on agarose gel and visualized with Gel Red Nucleic Acid staining Biotium USA.A quantitative PCR qPCR and melting curve analysis were performed for T. gondii and C. cayetanensis in a CFX-96 Real Time Instrument BioRad Italy.

For the second amplification the cycling protocol was 94 oC for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 oC for 45 s 55 oC for 30 s and 72 oC for 1 min with a final extension at 72 oC for 10 min.For Cryptosporidium spp.

For both amplifications the cycling protocol was 94 oC for 7 min initial denaturation followed by 40 cycles of 95 oC for 50 s denaturation 50 oC for 40 s annealing and 72 oC for 50 s extension with a final extension of 72 oC for 10 min.End point PCR protocol was used for Blastocystis and Dien- tamoeba with a PCR mixture containing 10.5 ml of Ready Red Taq Mix Sigma-Aldrich USA 10 mM of each specific primer 3.25 ml of distillated water and 2 ml of genomic DNA.

Cycling con- ditions were as follows initial denaturation at 98 oC for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 98 oC for 5 s then 62 oC T. gondii and 59 oC C. cayetanensis for 15 s. Fluorescence data were collected at the end of each cycle as a single acquisition.

For the primary amplification the cycling protocol was 94 oC for 5 min initial denaturation followed by 35 cycles of 94 oCfor 45 s denaturation 50 oC for 45 s annealing and 72 oC for 1 min extension with a final extension of 72 oC for 10 min.

The diagnostic Tm peak was 80 oC for T. gondii and 83.5 oC forC.

As to Cyclospora the prevalence of 1.3 found here appears close to that recorded byin Canada where T. gondii was also detected but with a lower prevalence  than in the present study 0.8.In Europe G. duodenalis andor Cryptosporidium oocysts have been documented in fresh produce in Norway   Turkey gv  Spain  and Poland   and also in Italy since 1968   and later .
