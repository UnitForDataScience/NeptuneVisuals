this biomodality in community composition appeared to arise during recovery from a low- diversity state that followed initial cellulose degrada- tion and sulphate reduction.introductionmicrobial communities mediate many of the key steps in global carbon sulphur and nitrogen cycling falkowski et al.

2013. microbial gut communities are also essential to human and animal health walter and ley 2011 hanning and diaz-sanchez 2015. however the processes that drive the establishment maintenance and function of microbial communities remain poorly understood prosser et al.

2016. in particular it remains unclear whether microbial ecosystem development is inherently predictable being controlled by deterministic factors or unpredictable being controlled by stochastic factors langenheder and szekely 2011 pagaling et al.

2014. establishing a clear picture of the factors controlling predictability in microbial ecosystem development would have significant environmental eco- nomic and medical implications including improved reliability of wastewater treatment improved energy produc- tion or yield from bioreactors and better treatment of human gut conditions ju and zhang 2015 widder et al.

these factors are expected to act as an ecological filter imposing 'species sorting' and driving microbial community composition towards a pre- dictable stable state martiny et al.

2006 langenheder and szekely 2011. however ecosystem dynamics can also be influenced by stochastic processes such as immigration and emigration events and random births and deaths volkov et al.
