Real-time analysis performed on CFX96 System Biorad Hercules CA USA and the expression of all target genes were calculated relative to GAPDH expression using Ct method.Quercetin Quantification from Fecal SamplesStool and intestinal content samples were thawed accurately weighed and extracted as follows Samples were solubilized in Methanol and subjected to ultrasonic bath for 15 min.

This work suggests that antigen presenting cells DCs residing at the tip of the intestinal villi project dendrites into a quercetin-rich intestinal lumen and subsequently upregulate Slpi expression.

Our data indicate that nutritionally-derived quercetin is able to imprint Slpi expression in DCs resident in the tip of the intestinal villi where the frequency of DC protrusions into the intestinal lumen is far greater.
