This principle has been demonstrated using an SD Card- based genetic assay featuring an integrated circuit and reaction chamber with thermal controls and ISFET pH sensors demonstrating the potential scale of miniaturisa- tion that can currently be achieved  of miniaturised analytical modules currently available at the prototype level has the capacity to revolutionise ocean molecular-biological sensing pending furtherdevelopment and integration with existing sampling and sensing instrumentation.ConclusionsThe deployment of molecular biological sensing and sampling platforms has demonstrated the utility of in situ microbiology enabling researchers to study microbial communities in their natural environment.

To address this a suite of ocean- deployable sampling and sensing instrumentation has been developed to retrieve archive and analyse water samples and their microbial fraction using state of the art genetic assays.

This review highlights the most recent developments in this field and emerging capabili- ties for in situ genetic analysis which will influence the future development of aquatic microbial sensors.In situ microbial sampling and sensing instrumentationThe available suite of ocean-deployable instrumentation for molecular ecology is summarised in .

Describes an in situ sensor for the detection of microbial genetic sequences.43.Different microbial secies dislay similar time-variable synchronous atterns in gene regulation indicating cross-secies coordination of metabolic networks.This study demonstrates co-detection of both RNA and DNA-based genetic targets using a minuaturised analytical platform.
