QIIME allows analysis of high-throughput community sequencing data.

However a robust understanding of the potential risk of using struvite as fertilizer in agriculture remains elusive.In the present study by using high throughput qPCR with 296 validated primer sets targeting almost all major classes of ARGs and 10 MGEs marker genesand illumina sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene we aimed to 1 investigate the impact of struvite application on the profile of ARGs and bacterial communities in soil rhizosphere and phyllosphere of Brassica 2 reveal the shared ARGs between struvite soil and phyllosphere based on bipartite network analysis and 3 explore how antibiotic resistance in struvite transferred to the surface of plants.

They are described clockwise i forty-four genes unique to struvite since these genes do not colonize in soil or plants and are thus of little concern ii 13 ARGs shared by soil and struvite but not in plants are again of little concerna single outlier mtrC only found in soil is again of little concern iv ten ARGs already in the soil that also find their way onto the phyllosphere are of possible concern but struvite is not responsible for their presence v 25 ARGs and aFigure 2.

In the present study we found a much higher level of ARGs in struvite than soil and the application of struvite increased both the abundance and diversity of resistome in soil rhizosphere and phyllosphere of Brassica confirming that struvite recycled from wastewater as fertilizer can increase the dissemination of resistome into environment.

Struvite crystallization is an efficient process to recover phosphate from wastewater.-Presently struvite production has been commercialized worldwide and the sale price is approximately198-1885 per ton in Australia and Japan.Struvite could be a promising fertilizer with the depletion of phosphate rock and its usage in agriculture is likely to increase in the near future.Wastewater especially those from livestock industries has been well documented to be a hotspot of antibiotic resistance.-Therefore struvite recovered from wastewater could be contaminated by ARGs ARB and antibiotic residues.

Bipartite network analysis revealing the shared ARGs and MGEs between struvite soil nonplanted soil without struvite and phyllosphere of Brassica planted in soil amend with struvite.Figure 4.

Of most concern were the 30 genes shared exclusively by phyllosphere and struvite since these genes were the clear candidate ARGs transferring from struvite to phyllosphere.

The shared ARGs between struvite and phyllosphere suggested that struvite could be an important source of resistome in phyllosphere.
