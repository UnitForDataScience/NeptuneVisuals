Addition of the AHR precursor ligand indole-3-carbinol I3C to purified diet reverses this cell loss.Both IELs and ILC3s are major sources of IL-22 in the gutand the AHR is vital for the expression of IL-22 in these lymphocyte subsets and conventional T cells.In addition to immune cell maintenance dietary- and microbiome- derived AHR ligands have been shown to be effective in treating ameliorating a different infectious disease vaginal candidiasis at mucosal surfaces in mice in an IL-22-dependent fashion.Using this information we hypothesized that the inclusion of I3C in the diet could reduce the severity of CDI.

For those experiments where a diet low in AHR ligands was desired mice were placed on either ''semipurified diet'' AIN- 76A Semi-Purified Diet TestDiet St. Louis MO or ''I3C diet'' AIN-76A containing 1000 ppm I3C for the remainder of the study.

AHR heterozygotes AHRth- mice which have AHR expression equal to that of wildtype B6 mice and AHR null AHR-- mice on aAnnals of Surgery  Volume XX Number X Month 2016  1C57BL6J backgroundwere bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions.

As seen in Supplemental Figure 1 the difference in loss of diversity between the semi-purified diet and I3C-supplemented diet before or after antibiotics is small and likely does not account for the dramatic improvement in survival with I3C-supplementation.Dietary Supplementation With I3C Increases Neutrophil Response But Reduces InflammationDespite significant differences in the clinical course of CDAD in diet- versus diet I3C-fed mice no difference in colony-forming units of C. difficile in the cecum of mice at day 2 and day 4 was found between the 2 dietary groups Fig.

1C D. Both groups presented with peak mean clinical score on day 3 postinoculation.Given that grain-based diet likely contains naturally occurring AHR ligandssimilar experiments were performed utilizing semi- purified diet manufactured with and without I3C.

Semipurified diet lacks the majority of AHR ligands found in regular chow.After 2 weeks on diet mice underwent CDI induction receiving 104 spores.

When mice were placed on either semipurified diet or I3C-supple- mented diet I3C-fed AHR heterozygous mice demonstrated improved clinical outcomes as measured by increased survival and reduced CDAD similar to that seen in the wild-type B6 mice.
