A widely used murine model of chronic alcohol abuse is chronic intermittent ethanol EtOH CIE exposure because it resembles the prolonged repeated patterns of alcohol abuse seen in humans Prior studies using the CIE model have reported changes in a range of neu- ral indices and behavioural phenotypes including increased EtOH self-administration The CIE model could be advantageous for studying potential changes in the gut microbiome resulting from chronic EtOH expo- sure as compared to other methods such as EtOH drinking becausethere is less potential for confounding effects of caloric intake 2 administration dose is consistent among subjects and 3 vapour administration circumvents the physiological effects of EtOH in the gastrointestinal tract such as altered nutrient absorption.

A previously described vapour inhalation procedure was employed Prior to being placed in the vapour chambers test subjects received IP injections of1.5 gkg of 20 EtOH vv with 71.6 mgkg of an alcohol dehydro- genase ADH inhibitor pyrazole Sigma St. Louis MO USA in a combined volume of 10 mLkg body weight to initiate intoxica- tion and stabilize blood EtOH concentrations BECs.

However our current study found reductions in Clostridium cluster IV also seen in this aformentioned study The genus Clostridium cluster IV is populated by bac- terial species believed to confer an anti-inflammatory effect and therefore beneficial to the host Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum are among these beneficial species within this genus and are reduced in studies of alcohol consumption and hep- atitis There is limited information about the functions of genra Propionibacterium and Clostridium XIVb within the gut microbiome though they are known to include species that produce short-chain fatty acids which are implicated in behavior and cogni- tion Similar reductions in Dorea and Coprococcus which have previosly been observed in chronic social stress and correlated to increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 Future studies are needed to examine the relative importance of these alterations to the pathophysiology in disease states.Despite its advantage of mimicking the most common route of alcohol administration in humans oral EtOH self-administration in rodents has several limitations including 1 dosage vari- ability between test subjects 2 inconsistent and unreliable self-administration in animals 3 difficulty in achieving and main- taining a desired BEC and 4 experimental confounds such as caloric intake While vapour exposure is not a common form of achieving intoxication in humans this method is valuable in differentiating the underlying mechanisms involved in micro- bial changes caused by gastrointestinal EtOH exposure and other changes acting through the brain-gut-microbiota axis.

For these reasons the current study employed the CIE method in order to investigate the consequences of chronic vapour EtOH on gut micro- biome.Adult male C57BL6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Lab-oratory Bar Harbor ME USA at 7 weeks of age.

95 EtOH was passed through a vapour- ization stone at 19-22 mg EtOHL of fresh air and delivered at a rate of 10 Lmin.

The Control group received a68.1 mg kg IP injection of pyrazole and was exposed to air at a rate of 10 Lmin in Plexiglas vapour chambers directly adjacent to the EtOH vapour chambers.

Pyrazole dose was adjusted based on solubility for mice to receive equal concentrations thus dosage was higher in the CIE treated group because the solubility of pyra- zole a hydrophobic heterocyclic compound is lower in EtOH than in saline 0.9 NaCl.

Extracted DNA was further concentrated using a standard EtOH precipitation pro- tocol.

Significant decreases in Dorea log2 fold change  2.5 p  0.01 Coprococcus log2 fold change  1.6 p  0.05 and Propionibacterium log2 fold change  1.7 p  0.05 were observed in the CIE group relative to Control Although disturbances in the microbiome are linked to a vari- ety of health states and the action of a variety of pharmacological agents there is a paucity of information on the impact of chronic EtOH on microbiome composition Here we found that the bacterial composition in mice exposed to CIE as measured from Bray-Curtis and PCoA analyses exhibited a clear separation from that seen in air-exposed Controls.

Increases in Alistipes and reductions in Clostridium cluster IV have been found in mice receiving fecal micro- biota transfer from alcoholic patients with severe hepatitis An increased population of Alistipes has also been observed in chronic fatigue syndrome inflammation inflammatory bowel syndrome and depression We observed a decrease in genus Dorea in CIE relative to Control B. Conversely a study by Leclerq and colleagues found increases in Dorea associated with high intesti- nal permeability in alcoholics.
