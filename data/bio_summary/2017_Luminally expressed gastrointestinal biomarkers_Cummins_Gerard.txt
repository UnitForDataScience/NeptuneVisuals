However biomarkers continue to be limited in sensitivity and specificity for various GI diseases.Several biomarkers show potential but further study is needed to determine their efficacy validate their use and overcome barriers to clinical adoption.New and emerging GI biomarkers could improve disease diagnosis and monitoring through better sensitivity speci- ficity andor ease and speed of measurement.A greater understanding of the role of the microbiome in GI disease is important for future biomarker identification and more effective use of existing but not yet well-established biomarkers.The ideal biomarker is easy to obtain from patients e.g.

The management of patients with 'borderline' FC levels 50-150 ugg remains unclear as many such patients are not eventually diagnosed with IBD .
