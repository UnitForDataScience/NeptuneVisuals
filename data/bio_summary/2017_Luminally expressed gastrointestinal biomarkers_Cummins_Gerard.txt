a useful biomarker has the potential to improve diagnosis discriminate ill patients according to disease reduce healthcare costs expedite drug develop- ment and monitor therapeutic efficacy.in this review a general overview is given of established and potentially new biomarkers found within the intestinal lumen such as proteins enzymes microbes and their metabolic products summarized in  are assessed in terms of their usefulness for the diagnosis of conditions such as colorectal cancer crc and inflammatory bowel disease ibd.

however biomarkers continue to be limited in sensitivity and specificity for various gi diseases.several biomarkers show potential but further study is needed to determine their efficacy validate their use and overcome barriers to clinical adoption.new and emerging gi biomarkers could improve disease diagnosis and monitoring through better sensitivity speci- ficity andor ease and speed of measurement.a greater understanding of the role of the microbiome in gi disease is important for future biomarker identification and more effective use of existing but not yet well-established biomarkers.the ideal biomarker is easy to obtain from patients e.g.
