Taken together these results suggest that Romidepsin leads to increases in histones in acetylation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.The cytotoxic effects of Romidepsin on SH-SY5Y cells are caspase-dependentTo determine whether Romidepsin induces apoptosis in SH- SY5Y cells cultures were co-treated with a broad-spectrum caspase-3 inhibitor which inhibits to the pro-apoptotic caspase-3 that functions upstream of other pro-apoptotic caspases caspase-6 and caspase-7 An MTT assay revealed that caspase-3 inhibi- tion significantly inhibited Romidepsin-induced cell death in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at 4 DIV A.

All cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 CO2 at 37 C. For cell viability assays cells were plated at a density of 1 105 cellswell in a 24-well plate.

Where indicated cells were treated with 5-5000 nM of Romidepsin MedChem Express andor 1 ugml caspase-3 inhibitor Calbiochem or with 15 uM 6-hydroxydopamine 6-OHDA Sigma for 24 h or daily for 4 days in vitro DIV.Cell viability and cell death assessmentThiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide MTT assays were per- formed to assess cell viability MTT was added to cells at a concentration of 0.5 mgml.

The fluorescence intensity of individual cells stained for pAcH3 was measured using Image J and the relative fluorescence intensity was calculated as the intensity of each individual cell after subtraction of the background noise.Measurement of cellular morphologyNeurite growth analysis as a proxy measure differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells was performed as previously described using the using the formula neurite length  a T TI2 where a is the number of times the neurite intersects the grid lines and T is the distance between the gridlines on the magnified image.Western blottingWestern blotting was carried out as described Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for 1 h on ice and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation.

To provide proof of principle for this SH-SY5Y cells were co-treated with 6-OHDA which is a potent cytotoxin that has been shown to induce SH-SY5Y cell death through increasing reactive oxygen species SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 15 uM of 6-OHDA with or without 20 nM of Romidepsin a concentration which does not adversely affect cell viability or morphology but induces hyperacetylation for 24 h at which time LDH assays were performed to assess cell death.

MYCN amplification is the primary and most important prognostic marker of poor survival in neuroblastoma Based on the dose-response experiments carried out in SH-SY5Y cells these cells were treated with 40 nM or 100 nM of Romidempsin for 4 DIV.

Here we examined the ability of the FDA-approved drug Romidepsin a selective HDAC12 inhibitor to act as a cyto- toxic agent in neuroblastoma cells.

Romidepsin significantly increased histone acetylation and significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of the cytotoxic agent 6- hydroxydopamine which has been shown to induce cell death in neuroblastoma cells through increasingAbbreviations 6-OHDA 6-hydroxydopamine pAcH3 p-acetylated-histone H3 DIV days invitro HDAC histone deacetylase LDH lactate dehydrogenase MTT Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide N number of repetitions.

Romidepsin was also more potent in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells which is an important prognostic marker of poor survival.
