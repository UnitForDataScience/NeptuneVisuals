In fecal samples primer set1 showed 98.75 efficiency whereas primer set 2 showed 99.59 efficiency and in the gut samples primer set 1 showed 98.29 while primer set 2 showed 99.07 efficiency.

Among the primer sets the second primer set showed higher efficiency than primer set 1.

The RT-PCR reaction volume was kept at 25 mL comprising of 12.5 mL of master mix 1 mL of forward primer 1 mM 1 mL of reverse primer 1 mM 2 mL of template DNA and 8.5 mL of PCR grade sterile water Sigma.

The two designed primer sets showed specificity for the target 16S rRNA gene ofP.

The selected primer sequences were subjected to BLAST search to check similarity and specificity and only those matching with P. histicola were included into the study.

Two primer sets that were specific for P. histicola in the in silico studies  were synthesized Integrated DNA Technologies.

Specificity of P. histicola primer sets.

Lanes 5 to 8 show the bands of PCR amplified DNA from P. melaninogenica DSM-7089 using A Prevotella genus specific primer set B Primer set 1 and C Primer set 2.

to avoid cross-reactivity of the designed primers in PCR reaction we have validated the specificity of the P. histicola primer sets with phylo- genetically closely related species.
