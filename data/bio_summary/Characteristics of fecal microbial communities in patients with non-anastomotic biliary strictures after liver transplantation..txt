furthermore whether the changes of gut microbiota contribute to the occurrence of nas after olt is still obscure.in this study we explored the potential relationship between gut microbiota and nas by investigating the changes in microbial communities in patients diagnosed with nas.materials and methodszhang j et al.

after centrifugation for 1 min and discardingzhang j et al.

results of blood routine tests were generally in normal ranges and showed no differences among the groups p  0.05 table 1. while for liver function all median or mean values were obviously abnormal for patients diagnosed with nas but no differences existed between thezhang j et al.

similarly these manifestations were also applicable to the otus distributions at the order familygenusspecies levels table 3. meanwhile both two post-lt groups showed smaller a-diversity index including chao1 ace simpson and shannon indexes than the healthy controls p  0.01 table 4. all of these indicated that patients who underwent lt had a lower gut microbiota diversity including richness and species number than healthy controls.zhang j et al.

however phylum of bacteroidetes was substantially decreased in the nas group with a constituent ratio of only 5.11 nearly one fifth of that in the healthy group p  0.05 table 5. the decrease of bacteroidaceae and prevotellaceae at the family level played the inducing role in this change from the normal 11.60 and 11.60 to 2.70 and 0.70 respectively p  0.05 for both table 5. as for the phylum of proteobacteria it increased obviously in the two post-lt groups especially for patients with nas in whom the proportion of proteobacteria was up to nearly 30 times than that in the healthy group 32.44 - 7.32 vs 1.99 - 0.25 p  0.05 figure 5. the proportions of family of enterobacteriaceae in the three groups were 0.70 12.80 and 27.60 respectively and those of pseudomonadaceae were 0.00 0.00zhang j et al.

ren et al38 also found that liver ischemic preconditioning can improve intestinal barrierzhang j et al.

unbalanced ratio of pathogenic bacteria to dominant bacteria really existed in patients with nas after liver transplantation.zhang j et al.

to learn more interaction relationship between microbiota and biliary inflammatory injury technology based on functional genomics may be used for future research.referencesh xu x yang j ruan b li l. effect of intestinal microbiota alteration on hepatic damage in rats with acute rejection after liver transplantation.
