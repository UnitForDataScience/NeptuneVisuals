Fecal microbial communities in NAS patientsAbstractAIMTo explore the possible relationship between fecal microbial communities and non-anastomotic stricture NAS after liver transplantation LT.METHODSA total of 30 subjects including 10 patients with NAS 10 patients with no complications after LT and 10 non- LT healthy individuals were enrolled.

In this study we investigated the fecal microbial communities in patients diagnosed with NAS by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region taking the well-recovered recipients uncomplicated after OLT as negative controls and normal non-LT individuals as healthy controls to explore the possible relationship between post-LT biliary complications and host's gut microbiota.According to our results a structural change of fecal microbial communities was observed in patients who underwent LT especially for those diagnosed with NAS.

Gut microbiota has been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of some post-LT complications while the characteristics of microbial communities in patients with NAS have never been investigated.Research motivationThe purpose of this study was to explore the possible relationship between fecal microbial communities and NAS after OLT.Research objectivesTo perform possible mechanism research about NAS after LT to shed some light on its prevention in future.Research methodsA total of 30 subjects including 10 patients with NAS 10 patients with no complications after LT and 10 non-LT healthy individuals were enrolled.

Fecal microbial communities in NAS patientsWhat are the implications of this Bacterial intervention may be a new therapy for preventing the occurence of NAS.Research perspectivesAccording to our study shifts of fecal microbial communities may participate in or exacerbate the process of bile duct inflammation.

Fecal microbial communities were assessed by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology.RESULTSDifferent from the uncomplicated and healthy groups unbalanced fecal bacterium ratio existed in patients with NAS after LT.

But up to date the definite mechanisms of NAS remain unknown.Gut microbiota is the general term for all mi-croorganisms mainly for bacteria living in the human intestine with a microbial density larger than 1014 cellsg containing 100 times more genes than human's910.

But so far the detailed relationship between them has never beenZhang J Ren Fg Liu P Zhang Hk Zhu Hy Feng Z Zhang Xf Wang B Liu XM Zhang Xg Wu Rq Lv Y. Characteristics of fecal microbial communities in patients with non-anastomotic biliary strictures after liver transplantation.

Furthermore whether the changes of gut microbiota contribute to the occurrence of NAS after OLT is still obscure.In this study we explored the potential relationship between gut microbiota and NAS by investigating the changes in microbial communities in patients diagnosed with NAS.MATERIALS AND METHODSZhang J et al.
