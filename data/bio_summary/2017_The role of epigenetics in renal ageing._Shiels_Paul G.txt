Few studies have examined the relationship between telomere length and age-related functional decline and those that have were equivocal and all lacked statistical power929.Longitudinal analyses of renal allografts acting as a source of healthy tissue and yielding eGFR as a472  AUGUST 2017  VOLUME 13REVIEWS Risk factors for renal dysfunction ExogenousSocioeconomicPsychologicalLifestyle factorsAccess to health careEnvironmental toxinsEndocrine disruptorsHormonal exposureIntrauterine environmentPathogensPhenotype and dysfunction Accelerated ageingVascular diseaseInsulin resistanceReduced renal functionChronic kidney diseaseFrailtyMuscular wastingOsteoporosisCognitive dysfunctionDisease outcome and progressionFeatures of the epigenetic landscape that affect renal function Functional consequences in cellular biology ageing genomic instability telomere attrition epigenetic alterations loss of proteostasis deregulated nutrient sensing mitochondrial dysfunction cellular senescence stem cell exhaustion and altered intercellular commu- nication33 that represent common denominators of ageing in different organisms.

The activities of the miRNAs in the epigenetic sig- nature miRNA-125a-5p miRNA-125b miRNA-96 and miRNA-217 therefore relate to the nine hallmarks ofwith longevity frailty and both cognitive and physical fitness4546 and has been used to demonstrate accelerated ageing in a range of conditions including diverse neuro- degenerative conditions Parkinson disease Alzheimer disease-related neuropathologies lung cancer lifetime stress menopausal age obesity metabolic syndrome coronary heart disease and renal disease45.

Improved knowledge of how epigenetic processes regulate ageing and how they interact with disease processes will enable the identification and stratification of patients at increased risk of age-related morbidities including renal disease.

In particular we highlight the interplay of epigenetic signalling pathways with environmental fac- tors such as psychosocial lifestyle and nutrition medi- ators of ill health in the context of renal biology and discuss how the epigenetics of ageing might be modified to treat age-related morbidities.Ageing and renal dysfunctionDistinguishing normal features of the ageing pro- cess from age-related dysfunction is critical to enable understanding of age-related organ health.

Little is known about the role of epigenetic inheritance in kidney disease.MethylationFigure 1  The epigenetic landscape mediates the interplay between stressors and renal dysfunction.

In addition the human epigenetic landscape needs to be evaluated as a whole in concert with both genetic variation and epigenetic drift during natural age- ing and in the presence of disease milieu such as uraemia.
