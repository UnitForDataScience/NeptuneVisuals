This is not surprising given the route of administration and mechanism of action of clodronate 41 42 48 macrophages in the intestinal tissue would likely be more available to uptake the liposomes than those deep within the tumor tissue and clodronate does not result in complete depletion of macrophages and there is evidence to suggest that TAMs may lose their phagocytic activity as tumorigenesis progresses 12.

However given the fact that tumorigenesis was decreased with clodronate and that we J. E. Bader R. T. Enos K. T. Velazquez and E. A. Murphy unpublished observations and others 5 have found a decrease in food consumption andor body weight with clodronate macrophage depletion 5 24 we suggest that this is an effect of clodronate treatment independent of the tumorigenesis out- comes.

OE Mice in the vehicle VEH group  mice in the clodronate CLD group.We used clodronate liposomes to deplete macrophages dur- ing the final cycle of DSS i.e.

Despite the fact that these findings should be validated using FACS we conclude that clodronate administration has bene- ficial effects on tumorigenesis and that even larger effects may be possible if M2 macrophages can be selectively depleted in the tumor microenvironment.Given the significant effects of clodronate administration oncytokines in the colon tissue we next examined downstream transcription factors in the normal tissue.

Al- though we and others have successfully used clodronate to deplete macrophages the possibility of also impacting den- dritic cells has been reported 42 and these cells can influence CRC 25.

Un- derstanding the importance of macrophages in CRC is likely to have significant therapeutic implications.G220193-185718 Copyright c 2018 the American Physiological SocietyIMMUNE-MICROBIOTA INTERACTIONS IN CRCG23Increasing evidence implicates gut microbiota in the initia- tion and progression of CRC 43.

Despite the increasing evidence supporting an immune-microbiota interaction in CRC there are no studies that have directly examined the role of macrophages on gut microbiota in a model of CRC.The purpose of this study was to examine the role ofmacrophages in the progression of CRC.

Because emerging evidence implicates immune-microbi- ota interactions in CRC we also sought to examine the inter- action between macrophages and gut microbiota in CRC.

Our data indicate that clodronate administration a well-established method to deplete macrophages 41 42 48 during late-stage tumorigenesis results in a decrease in polyp number reduced expression of select macrophage markers diminished activa- tion of transcription factors and alterations in the gut micro- biota profile.G26IMMUNE-MICROBIOTA INTERACTIONS IN CRCFig.

Although clodronate liposomes are a well-established method of macrophage depletion in the colon 41 42 48 we wanted to confirm successful depletion in our hands and further establish whether it was effective at depleting macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.
