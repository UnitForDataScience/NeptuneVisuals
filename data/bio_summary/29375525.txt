the temperate phage can remain as a prophage coexisting in the lysogenized host which it leaves unharmed until conditions are unfavorable for growth in which case the phage if integrated may then excise itself from the genome and enter a lytic cycle.both obligately lytic and temperate phages may exhibit pseudolysogeny a controversial topic but defined by some authors as a state of stalled development of a phage within its host in which neither phage replication nor prophage formation occurs lo's and wegrzyn 2012. this state is triggered by conditions that cause sub-optimal growth of bacteria or starvation allowing the co-existence of both the resulting inactive and unstable phage and the starved host within low resourceenvironments without mutual destruction brendan and lenski 1997. pseudolysogeny is resolved with the change of nutrient conditions which enable growth at which point the phage can either form a stable prophage or enter the lytic cycle.

2010. with 10 to 30 of pregnant women colonized with gbs the potential for antibiotic exposure is widespread le doare and heath 2013. this is a prime example of a single species target in which phage therapy could excel.exploitation of the key components of virulent phage such as the lysins that result in bacterial cell lysis have been pursued as therapeutic options gaca and gilmore 2016. bacteriophage lysins are responsible for the final stage of the lytic cycle which involves disruption of the bacterial host envelope and release of phage progeny and cell contents inevitably destroying the host grundling et al.

valuable information gained from each phage administration could be used to build individualized drug profiles for each phage which will likely influence future administration.local-topical oral or inhaled phage administrationthe thorough review by dabrowska and others outlined numerous studies that have revealed the extent of bacteriophage penetration in vertebrates dabrowska et al.

furthermore the refinement of clinical practice can be largely influenced by case studies and despite patient heterogeneity similarities in phage pharmacokinetics may be observed which are informative nonetheless and should not impede standard care.the ethical implications of phage therapy thus far have not been greatly explored as many instances of human phage therapy have been for compassionate use as a final option.
