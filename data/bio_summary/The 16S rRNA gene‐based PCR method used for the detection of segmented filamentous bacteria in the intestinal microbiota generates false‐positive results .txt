we evaluated this method for the detection of sfb in the feces of human infants.we analyzed 20 fecal samples collected at 6 and 12 months of age from five healthy swedish infants from the allergyflora birth-cohort recruited in 1998-2003 8. bacterial dna was extracted using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen hilden germany according to the manufacturer's instructions with a slight modification 9 that is we increased the dna yield by adding an extra step in which 10-12 glass beads 2 mm in diame- ter were added to the fecal-buffer suspension and shook at 3.2 g for 30 min at 5 degc.rectal swabs were also obtained from 18 rwan- dan children age 5 years seeking care at health centers in kigali in the period 2009-2012 10. the swabs copan regular flocked swab 502cs01 were transported in a sterile tube containing 1 ml of saline to a local laboratory for storage at 80 degc 11 and dna was extracted as previously described 10 11 using the easymag instrumentbiomerieux marcy1'etoile france.for all 38 samples the presence of intact bacte- rial 16s rrna genes was confirmed by pcr 9with the universal primers env 1 and env 2 12 data not shown.to detect sfb we performed the previously described pcr approach using sfb 16s rrna gene primers 779 f and 1380 r using the published pcr protocol 5. samples that yielded a positive pcr amplicon in the sfb-specific pcr should indicate the presence of sfb 5. in total 438 dna samples generated positive signals fig.

as the published pcr for the identification of sfb is not sufficiently specific to identify sfb in human fecal samples it needs to be complemented with sequencing of the pcr amplicons.we thank ph.d. student maria andersson dr. fei sjoeurberg and prof. magnus lindh department of infectious diseases gothenburg university for pro- viding the dna samples purified from the gut flora of the swedish and rwandan children and shora yazdanshenas for excellent technical assistance.

the use of 16s rrna as the sole tool for iden- tification is also of concern given that the bacterial genome can contain multiple 1-15 copies of the 16s rrna operon 14 that may differ in sequence 15. horizontal transfer of 16s rrna gene seg- ments and the presence of mosaic-like structures in the 16s rrna genes have also been reported 13. accordingly species identification based exclusively on 16s rrna gene-specific pcr may result in misidentification so the 16s rrna gene may not be suitable for differentiating closely related species 14 16. ideally identification based on 16s rrna should be combined with sequencing analysis or pcr assays that detect single-copy genes 13 thatc 2017 apmis.

the sequences were compared using blast n2.6.1 on may 22 2017 and employing the 'nucleotide collection nrnt' and the '16s ribosomal rna sequences bacteria and archaea'.the trimmed sequences of the four samples onerwandan and three swedish samples comprised 485-601 nucleotides.

nc015913 nc016012 nc017294 nzcp008713'revealed similarity of only up to 82 to the 16srrna gene sequences of these four genomes.our results show that while the sfb-specific pcr assay can positively identify sfb bacteria it also generates false-positive results from commensalgut bacteria that were sufficiently common to gen- erate 8 false positive among the 38 tested sam- ples.

thus an amplicon of a size suggesting the presence of sfb dna might be generated by amplifying gene segments from other bacteria in the allegedly specific sfb pcr reaction 13.since the design of primers targeting specific 16s rrna genes is based on the 16s rrna sequences assembled in databases their specificities cannot be guaranteed as numerous bacterial species in the gut microbiota remain uncultivated and unidenti- fied.
