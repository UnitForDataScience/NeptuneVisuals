for example in chronic hepatitis c virus hcv infection which is commonly associated with fatty liver the percentage of steatotic individuals and their fatty liver extent is affected by hcv genotype and host metabolic features similarly hiv infection is associated with fatty liver as a result of multiple viral and host factors when associated with either hivor hcv infection fatty liver isfig.

moreover current guidelines provide no specific therapeutic recommendations for persons with nafld older than 65 years.well-designed studies characterizing the epidemiology pathogenesis clinical out- comes and potential therapeutic interventions for liver disease and associated meta- bolic comorbidities in older hiv-infected patients are urgently needed.copyright c 2017 wolters kluwer health inc. all rights reserved.aids 2017 31 suppl 2s147-s156keywords aging cardiometabolic risk hiv metabolic syndrome nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nonalcoholic steatohepatitis virus-associated fatty liver diseaseintroductionearly in the haart era metabolic derangements that were observed among hiv infected persons were presumed to reflect primarily dysregulation of lipidmetabolism resulting from use of specific antiretroviral arv drugs now 20 years into the haartera we realize that the broad range of metabolic abnormalities observed is multifactorial in nature.

optimal monitoring that is which test or combination of tests should be performed and timing of monitoring remains unclear.nonalcoholic fatty liver disease treatmentthe combination of lifestyle changes informed choice of art agents management of secondary causes of fatty liver and use of targeted pharmacological therapies will bekey to nafld management.

findings from clinical trials suggest that low-calorie low-fat and low-carbohydrate diets may significantly improve fatty liver levels of inflammation and liver fibrosis the advisability of dietary restriction in fructose-rich food and polyunsaturated fatty acids fas long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fas remains controversial hiv suppression and the choice of antiretroviral therapynafld may in part represent long-term toxicity of art therapy and of sustained hiv viremia.

the fatty acid-bile acid conjugate aramchol reduces liver fat content in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

in this review we summarize clinical data that support the roles of aging and metabolic dysregulation as factors contributing to fatty livernafld among hiv-infected persons.age-related metabolic alterations include hepatic anatomic and functional changes altered homeostasis of gastrointestinal microbiota and anthropometric changes such as a shift of body fat depots from the subcutaneous to the visceral compartment that are often associated with the development of insulin resistance and increased cardiovas- cular risk.fatty changes in the liver occur not only with metabolic disruption but also with virus- induced injury.

chronic hepatitis c virus infection is commonly associated with fatty liver and can be related to both hepatitis c virus genotype and host metabolic features.

similarly hiv infection is associated with fatty liver as a result of multiple viral and host factors.

the term 'inflamm-aging' that refers to age-associated increases in inflammatory marker levels has been coined to characterize this phenomenon in contemporary antiretroviral therapy art-treated hiv- infected cohorts the often used term 'nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld referred to the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome mets' but the term nafld fails to connote the link existing between these two diseases .mets predicts type 2 diabetes mellitus t2dm and cardiovascular diseases cvd in the general population.

nafld which spans fatty liver to nonalcoholic steato- hepatitis nash with or without liver fibrosis has a bidirectional relationship with the mets .

we argue that among hiv-infected persons the assessment of nafld provides a window through which overall metabolic health can be accurately evaluated and that liver fat content is a modern 'barometer of metabolic health' .in this updated review we summarize clinical data that support the roles of aging and metabolic dysregulation as contributing factors to fatty livernafld among hiv- infected persons.
