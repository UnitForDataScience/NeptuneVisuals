Studies supplementing fiber-rich whole foods have been shown to increase GI microbial diversity   while most short-term feeding trials with purified NDFCs    or even whole-plant-based diets  had no effect.In summary although clear associations exist be- tween the consumption of NDFCs GI microbial diver- sity and improved metabolic and inflammatory markers of CNCDs rigorously controlled human intervention studies with NDFCs that assess well-defined clinical and microbial endpoints are needed to determine i if di- versity can be enhanced by NDFCs and ii to what ex- tent this constitutes a microbial-dependent mechanism by which NDFCs can improve human health.Impact of NDFCs on GI Microbiome Function The provision of NDFCs not only impacts microbiota composition as described above but also changes the profile of microbial-derived metabolites within the GI tract .

Because there is currently no uni- fying concept that describes NDFCs that target the GI microbiota for health purposes we will continue to refer to these carbohydrates as NDFCs for the purpose of this review.HOW DO NDFCs MODULATE GI MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION AND FUNCTIONModulation of GI Microbiota Composition and DiversityConsumption of NDFCs has the potential to improve human health by changing both the composition structure and diversity and the function metabolism of the microbial communities that reside in the GI tract.

The total amount and proportion of individual SCFAs produced is dependent on the type of NDFC  as well as the individual microbiota  further reinforcing that the response of human GI microbiota to NDFCs is individualized.Fermentation of NDFCs within the GI tract leads to various systemic effects on the host including an influence on energy homeostasis and metabolism .8Using Nondigestible Fermentable Carbohydrates To Improve Human HealthA majority of the SCFAs produced are rapidly absorbed in the GI tract with only around 5 to 10 being ex- creted in the feces .

Furthermore by providing SCFAs directly through colonic infusions studies have demonstrated that SCFAs do promote a systematic increase in PYY and GLP-1 while also benefiting markers of inflamma- tion  .Clinical research that establishes clear connections between the health benefits of NDFCs and the GI micro- biota as well as clear evidence for the role of the GI microbiota in the health effects of NDFCs including the underlying mechanisms involved is altogether limited.13Deehan et al.As described above NDFCs can exert health benefits through microbiota-independent mechanisms such as a reduction in nutrient absorption through viscosity or binding of bile acids and cholesterol .

Furthermore even though NDFCs such as human milk oligosaccharides are important for infant growth and development and have tremendous potential to be included in infant formula  we will focus this article on the application of NDFCs in weaned children and adults.MODULATION OF THE GI MICROBIOME THROUGH NDFCs THREE CONCEPTSPrebioticsAlthough the potential to modulate the human GI mi- crobiome through NDFCs had been recognized decades earlier especially in Japan the term prebiotics was coined by Gibson and Roberfroid in 1995.

Research employing fecal microbiota transplantation methodology supports these findings and further suggests a causative link in that upon transferring the GI microbiota from mice fed an12Using Nondigestible Fermentable Carbohydrates To Improve Human HealthNDFC resistant maltodextrin to antibiotic-treated dbdb mice a model of type 2 diabetes the improved glucose homeostatic phenotype was likewise transferred .Work with GPR41 and GPR43 knockout KO mice or their specific receptor antagonists provides addi- tional evidence that the NDFC-associated metabolic health effects described above are mediated by the GI microbiota and specifically through the production of SCFAs.

Although RS is utilized by many members of the human GI microbiota    the species that become enriched under compe- tition B. adolescentis R. bromii and E. rectale have been shown to directly adhere to this substrate in the human GI tract .Furthermore the degradation of many complex NDFCs does require a different species with comple- mentary enzymatic repertoires for their degradation which establishes syntrophic interrelationships within the GI microbiota -.

NDCs provide the host with 0 to 2.5 kcalg with diges- tible carbohydrates providing 4 kcalg dependent on their level of fermentability by the GI microbiota .A low intake of NDFCs leads not only to a reduction in SCFAs but also to shifts in GI microbiota metabolism toward the utilization of less favorable nutrients par- ticularly dietary and endogenously supplied proteins .

These microbiota-independentmechanisms can be difficult to distinguish from microbiota-dependent mechanisms especially because they still might lead to strong correlations between diet- induced shifts in microbiome composition and host markers .Elucidation of the role of the GI microbiota in the health effects of NDFCs and the underlying mecha- nisms will require innovative experimental approaches such as utilizing animal studies in parallel with human intervention studies to directly test the role of the GI microbiota in health outcomes  .

The current concepts by which NDFCs can be administered to humans including prebiotics fermentable dietary fibers and microbiota-accessible carbohydrates as well as the mechanisms by which these carbohydrates exert their health benefits are discussed.Epidemiological research presents compelling evidence for the health effects of NDFCs with clinical studies providing further support for some of these benefits.However rigorously designed human intervention studies with well-established clinical markers and microbial endpointsare still essential to establish i the clinical efficiency of specificNDFCs ii the causal role of the GI microbiota in these effectsiii the underlying mechanisms involved and iv the degree by which inter-individual differences between GI microbiomes influence these effects.
