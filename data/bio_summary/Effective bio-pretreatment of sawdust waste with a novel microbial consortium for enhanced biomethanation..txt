The higher biomass loss rate might be attributed to the synergism among the complex population of bacteria and yeast that exist within LCDC.Effect of pretreatment on biogas and methane productionshows the daily biogas production rate and biogas yield of the pretreated and untreated sawdust.

The recorded cumulative biogas yield is comparatively better than that obtained by  who used spent sawdust after Gymnopilus pampeanus cultivation and obtained maximum biogas yield of 147.8 mL g-1 VS after 105 days of AD.The untreated sawdust showed a maximum daily methane pro- duction of 7.4 L kg-1 VS d-1 after 20 days of AD.

Noteworthy the recorded increase in methane yield as a result of the pretreatment is not only due to enhance- ment of biogas production but also because of increased methane ratio in the produced biogas B. studied the effect of P. chrysosporium on methanation of corn stover and corn stover silage.

The later is hardly metabolized by most microbial species during AD leading to high resistance of lignocellulose to enzymatic attack because of the tight association between lignin cellulose and hemicellulose .Pretreatments including solubilization and biodegradation of lignin and cellulosic components of the substrates are essential to enhance biogas production by overcoming hydrolysis limita- tions .

The aim of an efficient pretreatment is delignification sugar solubilization and reduction of cellulose crystallization in the used lignocellulosic feedstock .

The volume of the generated biogas was monitored daily via water displacement method  .

The composition of biogas was analyzed using 1 ml injec- tion volume by GC Agilent HP5972 Wilmington DE USA fitted with 10 m capillary column with an internal diameter of0.32 mm.

The holocellulose content of the studied sawdust is in accordance with other research studies on sawdust   while lignin content showed relatively higher value.Pretreatment induces desired physical and chemical changes in the lignocellulosic biomass enhancing the biodegradability pro- cess which leads to enhanced biogas production.

The pretreatment aims mainly to break lignocelluloses into three major polymeric constituents lignin cellulose and hemicellulose.
