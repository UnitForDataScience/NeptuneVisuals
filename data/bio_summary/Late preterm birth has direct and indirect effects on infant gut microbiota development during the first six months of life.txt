As well as prematurity the mode of birth intrapartum and neonatal antibiotic exposure and the duration of breastfeeding had an additional impact on gut microbiota development.Conclusion The gut microbiota composition was significantly different between late preterm and full-term infants at least six months after birth.

Antibiotic exposure was common in late preterm infants and modulated gut colonisation but preterm birth also affected gut microbiota development independently.INTRODUCTIONPreterm birth accounts for 5-18 of all deliveries and is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality 1.

Early gut colonisation has been recog- nised to exert a significant impact on health and disease 3 and specific members of the infant gut microbiota including bifidobacteria clostridia and Akkermansia muciniphila have been associated with subsequent development of atopic disease and allergy 45 as well as overweight and obesity 67.

Use of the specific probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus exerted no significant effect on the prevalence of the gut microbes assessed in this study.DISCUSSIONOur study demonstrated significant differences in gut colonisation patterns between late preterm and full-term infants during the first six months of life.

It is of note that thedifferences in early gut microbiota composition between late preterm and full-term infants were still detectable six months after birth.Previous studies have mostly provided data on gut microbiota composition in very low birthweight infantsduring their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit.

The differences in gut microbiota activity and their functional correlates in thehost in term and late preterm infants remain to be established in future studies.The mechanism underlying deviant gut colonisation resulting from prematurity irrespective of environmental exposures remains elusive.

Given the recently discovered role of gut microbiota in the development of obesity and metabolic disease 3 it is conceivable that the increase in cardiometabolic risk factors observed in young adults born preterm and late preterm 19 may be at least partly mediated by the intestinal microbiota.While no effective means of preventing preterm birth are currently available there are measures that might attenu- ate the detrimental consequences of preterm birth on the gut microbiota.

We investigated whether the differences in gut microbiota between late preterm and full-term infants results from prematurity or external exposures.Methods This study comprised 43 late preterm infants 3407-3667 and 75 full-term infants based on faecal samples collected following birth and at two to four weeks and six months of age.
