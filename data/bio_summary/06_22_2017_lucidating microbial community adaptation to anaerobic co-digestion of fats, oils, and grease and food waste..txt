For Run 4 sludge from a full-scale thermophilic AD at Hyperion WWTP was used as seed whereas for Run 5 biomass from Run 4 30 FOG FW condition was used as seed for all vessels.

A Cumulative biogas production normalized to initial organic loading in mL g TVS-1 for Run 1 Run 2 and Run 3.

Due to experimental error one of the triplicate vessels for the following substrate mixtures and runs were excluded from the mean analysis and standard deviation PSthTWASthFOG in Run 1 PSthTWASthFW in Run 3 and PSthTWASthFOGthFW in Run 3.

A Relative activity based on 16S rRNA sequencing identified at the genus level where possible for PSthTWASthFOGthFW for Run 1 Run 2 and Run 3.

The increase in mean methane production for the 30 FOG condition compared to Run 1 PS TWAS was insignificant p  0.05 due to high variability within the triplicate vessels for the substrate mixture.For Run 5 10 FW addition was applied uniformly to 30 4050 and 60 FOG  since Run 4 suggested that co-digestion of FW at high FOG addition increased performance.

Given that all substrate mixtures for Run 5 were seeded from Run 4 30 FOG FW similar microbial activities were observed at the beginning of Run 5 .

For Run 4 30 and 60 FOG TVS addition was evaluated with and without 10 FW TVS whereas in Run 5 30 40 50 and 60 FOG TVS addition were evaluated with 10 FW TVS  and the balance from PS and TWAS i.e.

Resulting sequences from the first phase of the study Run 1e3 and the FOG inhibition study Run 4e5 were analyzed separately as described in detail in Appendix S1.

Bench-scale PS TWAS FW showed a higher improvement in performance in Run 3 than was obtained at the full scale  but overall PS TWAS FW performance was inconsistent with insignifi- cant performance improvements in Run 1 and 2.
