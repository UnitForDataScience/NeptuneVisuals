the lowest lag phase was observed for ps twas ranging from 40.6 to 62.3 h of all substrate mixtures followed by ps twas fw ranging from 53.0 to 88.6 h. the largest decrease in lag phase was observed for ps twas fog which decreased from 118 - 2 h in run 1 to 46.3 - 12.5 h in run 3. a more moderate decrease in lag phase was observed for ps twas fog fw which decreased from 114 - 10 h in run 1 to85.0 - 23.1 h in run 3. conversely ps twas fw showed an in- crease in lag phase comparing run 3 and run 1. these results suggest that addition of fog increased lag phase initially but was significantly diminished in subsequent runs due to adaptation of the microbial community.

2. a relative activity based on 16s rrna sequencing identified at the genus level where possible for psthtwasthfogthfw for run 1 run 2 and run 3. for run 1 and run 3 triplicate and duplicate samples are shown respectively to represent methodological precision.

the relative activity of methanogens increased from run 1 to run 3 in all substrate mixtures except for ps twas a. the increase was highest in ps twas fog fw where the relative activity increased from 0.410 at the end of run 1 to 0.873 at the end of run 3. ps twas fog fw also showed the highest methane production increase with subsequent runs .

in ps twas fog these populations resurfaced in run 3 after dis- appearing in run 2. tepidanaerobacter significantly increased in relative activity in all substrate mixtures other than the control from run 1 to run 3 b. overall the observed increase in relative activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and syntrophic fatty-acid oxidizers with increasing biogas production highlights the signifi- cance of syntrophy in co-digestion.

relative activity data for run 3 showed that syntrophomonas and syntrophothermus were not significant in ps twas each comprising less than 1.00 of the relative activity b. ps twas fw showed substantially higher relative activity of these key populations accounting for 2.53 and 1.44 of the relative activity respectively b. the enrichment of these populations in ps twas fw by run 3 may be the reason for the enhanced performance observed compared to ps twas.

for example mean methane production for ps twas fog fw increased by 38.8 ml ch4 g tvs-1 p 0.0125 in run 3 relative to run 1. it is important to note that all vessels in run 2 and 3 were seeded with the same inoculum biomass from the preceding run from the ps twas fog fw substrate mixture.

due to experimental error one of the triplicate vessels for the following substrate mixtures and runs were excluded from the mean analysis and standard deviation psthtwasthfog in run 1 psthtwasthfw in run 3 and psthtwasthfogthfw in run 3. therefore each bar represents the mean of only two vessels for these substrate mixtures and runs.table 2non-linear regression analysis on all substrate mixtures in run 1 2 and 3.a ml g tvs-1l hmm ml g tvs-1 hr2run 1psthtwas114 - 255.4 - 3.71.09 - 0.120.980 - 0.001psthtwasthfog123 - 3118 - 21.32 - 0.0010.943 - 0.004psthtwasthfw115 - 753.0 - 3.21.10 - 0.070.943 - 0.012psthtwasthfogthfw116 - 12114 - 101.30 - 0.030.909 - 0.045run 2psthtwas127 - 462.3 - 16.51.15 - 0.160.989 - 0.007psthtwasthfog146 - 16115 - 101.41 - 0.320.971 - 0.023psthtwasthfw121 - 274.9 - 16.61.13 - 0.110.976 - 0.012psthtwasthfogthfw148 - 32103 - 91.66 - 0.050.980 - 0.016run 3psthtwas142 - 440.6 - 4.31.27 - 0.010.993 - 0.004psthtwasthfog156 - 1146.3 - 12.51.64 - 0.040.967 - 0.031psthtwasthfw139 - 2288.6 - 13.01.45 - 0.250.952 - 0.014psthtwasthfogthfw142 - 3885.0 - 23.11.53 - 0.250.965 - 0.030syntrophic fatty-acid oxidizers were critical to increase methane productionrna-based sequencing was more sensitive than dna-based sequencing in evaluating microbial population dynamics across various substrate mixtures.

all data are expressed as a percentage normalized using total 16s rrna sequences bacteria and archaea.0.467 at the beginning of run 5 in biogas producing 40 fog to 16.9 at the end of run 5. the 40 fog with low biogas production only showed an increase in relative activity of these populations to 5.83 at the end of run 5 suggesting their importance.

nonethe- less considering the four different substrate mixtures the ratio of mcra transcripts to 16s rrna copies increased substantially with increasing run  and with increasing methane production except for ps twas where run 2 ratios exceeded run 3. in the control where methane production was lowest in all runs mcra gene expression was high likely due to decreased relative activity of other populations such as hydrolytic bacteria and fermenters that were not receiving substrates.

interestingly these populations had low relative activity in ps twas fog in run 3. notably there was a positive correlation between methane produc- tion and total relative activity of syntrophs r 0.475 p 0.0192 and relative activity of syntrophomonas r 0.406 p 0.0491 table s2.

for example a study on the impact of high fog addition in a mesophilic semi- continuous anaerobic digester found an increase of hydro- genotrophic methanogen methanospirillum from a relative abun- dance of 1.3e34 over 138 days along with an increase in relative abundance of syntrophomonas .the observed increase in the sum of the relative activity of syn- trophomonas and syntrophothermus in ps twas fog fw relative to ps twas fog and ps twas fw suggests that these pop- ulations of syntrophic fatty-acid oxidizers   may be key to the in- crease in biogas production observed at the bench and full scale.

for run 4 sludge from a full-scale thermophilic ad at hyperion wwtp was used as seed whereas for run 5 biomass from run 4 30 fog fw condition was used as seed for all vessels.

the increase in mean methane production for the 30 fog condition compared to run 1 ps twas was insignificant p  0.05 due to high variability within the triplicate vessels for the substrate mixture.for run 5 10 fw addition was applied uniformly to 30 4050 and 60 fog  since run 4 suggested that co-digestion of fw at high fog addition increased performance.
