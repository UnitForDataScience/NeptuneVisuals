In order to achieve higher homogeneity in the transplantation procedure feces from the three CD donors on the one hand and the HFGFD donors on the other hand were pooled to be used for the heterolo- gous transplantation in stage 2.Stage 2 Effects of IM TransplantationTwo additional groups of rats were fed the CD n 5 23 or HFGFD n 5 27 for 8 weeks and then underwent an IM transplant according to the proce- dure described in the .

In HFGFD rats transplantation with feces from CD donors caused a significant reduction of PH to levels comparable to CD without significant changes in NASH histology.

Finally the 8-week HFGFD intervention induced a marked and etiology- dependent dysbiosis similar to what is observed in NASH patients.18 For studies focusing on the role of IM this is another critical advantage of diet-induced NASH models over genetic models of NASH or clas- sic PH models.

The same procedure was followed for the HFGFD group one HFGFD subgroup received a heterologous transplant with CD microbiota from stage 1 donors HFGFD-Tr n 5 14 and the other underwent an autologous fecal transplantation HFGFD-Atr n 5 13.

3C.IM TRANSPLANT INDUCED IM CHANGES IN HFGFD RATSOnce the differences in IM between the CD and HFGFD groups were confirmed three representative rats of each group were selected as IM donors based on weight HOMA-IR and PP .The changes in the IM triggered by the IM trans- plantations were analyzed by comparing stool samples collected immediately before transplants and 12-14 days after the autologous and heterologous transplants.

The IM present in the HFGFD-Tr group HFGFD rats transplanted with feces from CD rats was signifi- cantly different from that of the HFGFD-Atr groupHFGFD rats receiving an autotransplantation but also from the microbiome of HFGFD samples col- lected before intestinal decontamination Fig.

In CD rats the transplant with IM from HFGFD CD-Tr did not induce significant changes in the microbiome composi- tion in comparison with CD-Atr or with the micro- biome present in CD samples collected before intestinal decontamination Fig.

As seen in healthy animals receiving a CD transplanta- tion with IM from HFGFD donors was not able to induce relevant changes in IR NASH histology or portal hemodynamics in the 14-day period between the IM transplant and final analysis.

However IM transplantation from healthy controls to HFGFD rats that already had NASH was able to significantly reduce PP compared to their corresponding HFGFD-Atr controls to levels similar to CD groups Table 2 and Fig.
