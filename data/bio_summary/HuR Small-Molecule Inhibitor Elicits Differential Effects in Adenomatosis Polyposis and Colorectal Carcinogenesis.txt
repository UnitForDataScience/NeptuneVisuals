MS-444 administration decreased the number of apoptotic cellstumor FoV in the large bowel of AOMDSS mice A and B but not in small bowel tumors of APCMin mice P 0.333 C and D. Representative images of TUNEL-positive cells green of control topLang et al.Page 27and MS-444-treated bottom mice are shown.

Currently we cannot specify the cell types upon which MS-444 is acting but assume that its block of apoptosis is a major contributor to the increase in tumor burden.In contrast to AOMDSS mice MS-444 treatment in APCMin mice led to a 25 reduction in small intestinal tumors without a change in tumor size or invasiveness Fig.

Whether MS-444 administration affects intronic binding and potential splicing functions of HuR or regulation of miRNA expression is yet to be determined.In summary systemic administration of MS-444 alters the profile of inflammatory mediators proliferation and apoptosis in the two mouse models investigated being favorable in APCMin mice and deleterious in AOMDSS mice for intestinal tumor progression see also summary Fig.

Measurements were carried out in duplicates.Lang et al.Page 6Intestinal microbiota analysisFecal pellets were sampled from AOMDSS-treated mice one day before the AOM injection and the day before colonoscopy from APCMin mice one day before colonoscopy from individual mice.

IHC analysis of c-myc expression in large bowel tumors of AOMDSS mice B small intestinal tumors of APCMin mice C and Ki-67 expression in small intestinal crypts of AOMDSS mice D was performed.

3E.HuR inhibition attenuates tumorigenesis in APCMin miceHere we treated 5- to 6-week-old female and male APCMin mice with MS-444 similar to AOMDSS mice Fig.

S2B.MS-444 increases cytoplasmic HuR levels in polyps of APCMin mice and in an acute colitis modelAnalysis of HuR subcellular distribution in small bowel tumors of APCMin mice revealed an increased cytoplasmic abundance upon MS-444 treatment in APCMin tumors as shown by IHC Supplementary Fig.

The effect of MS-444 treatment in APCMin mice was also visible in a principal coordinates analysis PCoA which shows how different microbiota composition is between samples beta diversity but not in AOMDSS mice Fig.

Such discrepancy was also observed in mice as the low molecular weight HuR inhibitor MS-444 increased tumor burden in the AOMDSS colitis model but reduced number of tumors in APCMin mice.

UponMS-444 the number of eosinophils was significantly reduced upon MS-444 in AOMDSS- treated mice D top but not in APCMin mice E top.
