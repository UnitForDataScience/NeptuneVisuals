With these data we asked several questions.i How do microbial communities differ across pika populations Also given that the biogeographic relationships across these populations have been well studied is there phylosymbiosis between host phy- logeny and similarities in gut microbial communities ii Which mi- crobial members are present across pika populations and thus may represent a core microbiota iii Which microbes are enriched in the moss-feeding pika population and thus may represent an adaptation to this difficult diet Both core microbial members and those enriched in the moss-feeding pikas may give insight into these animals' abilities to feed on fibre-rich protein-deficient food sources.2  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Sample collectionLike all lagomorphs pikas are coprophagic and produce two types of scat or droppings.

Specifically pikas from Colorado harboured communities enriched in Tenericutes pikas from Utah hosted communities with high abundances of Firmicutes and gut communities of pikas from Oregon were enriched in Melainabacteria.

Thus populations of pikas in the Columbia River Gorge may harbour distinct microbial communities that help them to cope with these nutritive challenges.We inventoried the gut microbial communities of several popula- tions of American pikas.

In fact moss-feeding pikas har- boured a community highly enriched in Melainabacteria when com- pared to the communities of pikas from the other populations in our study and to other mammalian herbivores that have been previously studied Figure 4b.

Unlike most lagomorphs which void caecal pellets at night and con- sume them directly pikas produce caecal pellets throughout the day and may either consume them immediately or cache them in haypiles for later consumption Smith  Weston 1990.A total of 55 fresh caecal pellets were collected from individual pikas in five populations the Wasatch mountains of northern Utah n  6 samples the Gallatin range of western Montana n  3 samplesthe Front range of Colorado n  5 samples and two populations in northern Oregon where we sampled at Mt.

Given that the plant material consumed by pikas is generally high in fibre and plant defensive chemicals there may be strong selective pressure to maintain these fibre- and toxin- degrading microbes.We were also interested in the microbial communities that might facilitate the ingestion of large amounts of moss by pikas in the Columbia River Gorge.

In this paper we used microbial com- munity inventories from pika caecal pellets to test for i phylosymbio- sis between the genetic structure of various pika populations and their gut microbial communities and ii potential microbes that may assist pikas in feeding on high-fibre plant material especially moss.

Should microbial variability of different host popula- tions be maintained in conservation efforts Will the gut microbial communities of source populations be compatible with the food material available in environments where pikas are introduced Incorporating microbial ecology into the conservation strategies may be important for the preservation of this sensitive species and others.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSWe are grateful to Chris Ray Mallory Lambert and Joshua Horns for assistance with obtaining samples.

Here we inventoried the microbial communities of pika caecal pellets from various populations using 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate structuring of microbial com- munities across various populations with different natural diets.4.
