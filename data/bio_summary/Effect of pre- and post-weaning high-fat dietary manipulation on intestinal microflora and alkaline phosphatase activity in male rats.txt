After weaning male pups nursed by control dams continued on a standard diet CC or HF diet C-HF while offspring nursed by HF dams continued on HF diet HF or standard diet HF-C.

Half of the rats 10 nursed by HF dams continued on HF diet HF whereas the other half 10 were given access to standard pellet diet only HF-C.

Comparing control dams with HF dams the mean values of milk fat concentration expressed in g100 ml milk were 13.0-0.58 vs. 18.3-0.92 g100 ml respectively p0.001.During lactation period in HF diet-receiving dams as compared with those fed the control diet significantly increased mean energy intake 213.5-8.7 kcalday vs. 168.5-4.1 kcalday p0.01 was recorded respectively.Effect of pre-weaning dietary manipulationThere were no significant differences in the average body weight between pups of control and HF dams on postpartum day 1 7.6-0.13 vs. 7.6-0.22 respectively.

To induce postnatal over- nutrition or normal nutrition in their offspring rat mothers were divided after parturition into two dietary groups a a control C group with free access to a standard laboratory diet Laboratory diet M1 Ricmanice Czech Republic containing 3.2 kcalg with26.3  energy as protein 9.5  as fat and 64.2  as carbohydrate and b a high-fat diet HF group which were given access to the same standard diet ad libitum but were additionally given access to a high-fatenergy diet high-energy nutritional liquid product Ensure Plus containing 1.5 kcalml with 16.7  energy as protein 30  energy as fat and 53.3  energy as carbohydrate.The weaned male rats day 21 from Control and HF mothers were randomly divided into two dietary groups.

For comparison of the post-weaning energy intake and weight gain differences between standard and HF diet groups one-way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Tukey's test was used.ResultsMilk compositionExposure of rat dams to HF diet resulted in significantly-increased milk fat concentration on postpartum day 11.

The evidence from experimental studies suggests that sustained exposure of rats to a high-fat diet results in permanently increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase AP activity Mozes et al.

AP is a crucial enzyme highly expressed in the brush border-bound duodenal enterocytes decreasing longitudinally to the large intestine Akiba et al.
