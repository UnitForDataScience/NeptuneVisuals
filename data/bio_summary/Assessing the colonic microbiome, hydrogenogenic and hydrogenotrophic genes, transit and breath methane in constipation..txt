The abundance of the methanogenic gene mcrA and the hydrogenogenic gene FeFe-hydA were respectively not correlated with breath methane and hydrogen production perhaps because breath methane and likely also hydrogen are not accurate markers of colonic methane and hydrogen produc- tion.8 Furthermore the abundance of the methanogenic gene mcrA or the hydrogenogenic gene FeFe-hydA may not reflect their activity.36The colonic mucosal abundance of hydrogenogenic and hydrog- enotrophic genes was associated with the overall composition of the colonic mucosal microbiome evaluated with unweighted and weighted analyses.

Associations between hydrogenogenic genes and breath hydrogen production and separately hydrogenotrophic genes and breath meth- ane production were assessed after adjusting for methane production and hydrogen production respectively.

Taken together these observations suggest that breath methane and hydrogen excretion is not a useful measure of the abun- dance of hydrogenogenic and hydrogenotrophic genes in humans.The abundance of hydrogenotrophic and hydrogenogenic genes was significantly correlated in both colonic mucosa and feces.

Breath hydrogen and methane concentrations were measured with model SC Quintron gas chromatograph Quintron Instrument Company Milwaukee WI USA and summarized as area under the curve AUC.A positive breath test was defined by an increase in breath hydrogenand methane exceeding 20 ppm over baseline.15  GI and colonic transit by scintigraphyColonic transit was measured by asking participants to ingest a methacrylate-coated delayed-release capsule containing indium-111 111In adsorbed on activated charcoal particles.4 The delayed-release coating dissolves in the alkaline pH of the terminal ileum releasing 111In in the cecum.

All statisti- cal analyses were performed in R-3.0.2 R Development Core Teams Vienna Austria.3  RESULTS  Participant characteristicsThe results of symptoms diet colonic transit breath hydrogen and methane excretion and phylogenetic assessment of the colonic and mucosal microbiome with 16S rRNA gene techniques in these par- ticipants have been published.4 This paper focuses on the results of functional genes and their relationship with other characteristics in this cohort.Of the 25 patients 13 had symptoms of FC six had IBS-C and six had mixed IBS with predominant constipation.

Associations between the abundance of fecal FeFe-hydA and breath hydrogen production remained nonsignificant even after adjusting for methane production and separately for abun- dance of individual hydrogenotrophic genes.

No other associations between these genes and diet colonic transit and breath methane or hydrogen excretion were significant.
