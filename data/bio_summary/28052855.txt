Of the 11 subjects enrolled in study 1 and 15 subjects enrolled in study 2 10 and 14 subjects respectively completed both periods in each study and were considered evaluable for pharmacokinetics PK .

Study 1 enrolled 11 subjects while study 2 enrolled 15 subjects 3 subjects participated in both studies.

Of the 11 subjects enrolled in study 1 6 subjects were randomly assigned to receive 75 mg of ribaxamase and 5 subjects were assigned to receive 150 mg of ribaxamase.

In study 2 14 of the 15 subjects completed the study while one subject prematurely discontinued study participation due to an AE stoma site hemorrhage related to ceftriaxone and ribaxamase administration.

There were no deaths or serious AEs reported during either study and other than the one subject from each study that discontinued as described above no other subjects discontinued either study.

Two of the subjects in study 1 seemed to have delayed appearance of ribaxamase in their chyme during period 2 compared to the other eight subjects subjects 1006 see Fig.

The graphs display the mean plasma ceftriaxone concentration - the standard deviations SD over time for 10 subjects from study 1 A and 14 subjects from study 2 B.

Missing data points indicate that no chyme was available for collection at that time point.but in period 2 ribaxamase was generally detected earlier in the chyme than for the same subjects in period 1 .Three of the subjects participated in both studies which occurred several months apart and a comparison of their ribaxamase concentrations in chyme for study 1 period 2 and study 2 period 1 are presented in Fig.

A washout period of 3 to 7 days separated period 1 and period 2 of study 1 and in study 2 a run-in period of 5 to 7 days occurred during which subjects self-administered 40 mg of oral esomeprazole daily in the morning.

Mean and median vital signs were similar in both periods in both studies and not significantly different from predose values in either study except for one subject in study 2 who had a potentially clinically significant change in pulse rate that was unrelated to study drug administration.
