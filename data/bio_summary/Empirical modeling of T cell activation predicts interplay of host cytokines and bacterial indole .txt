Th17 cells comprise a class of activated Th cells that express high levels of RORgT IL-17 IL-17F IL-21 and IL-22 in addition Th17 cells are reported to readily differentiate to IFN-g  Tbet Th1-like cells in vivo Zuniga et al.

2014.Treg and Th17 cells are two major Th cell lineages found at mucosal sites such as the GI tract Shale et al.

Th17 cells play an important role in autoimmune and aberrant inflammatory responses of mucosal surfaces in the GItract Weaver et al.

In the periphery Th17 cells are produced when Th cell activation occurs in the presence of TGF-b and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b IL-6 and IL-23 Shale et al.

Th17 cells and their secreted cytokines are increased in IBD Eastaff-Leung et al.

2009 and genome-wide association studies have linked IBD and polymorphisms in the receptor for IL-23 a main driver of pro- inflammatory Th17 differentiation Weaver et al.

Mouse models of IBD have shown a similar importance for Th17 cells in pathogenesis Ahern et al.

Promotion of a Th17 response and subsequent inhibition of Tregs is thought to be important in the pathogenesis ofaberrant inflammation in the GI tract Ahern et al.

segmented filamentous bacteria SFB presence for proliferation in the GI tract but the role of Th17 cells is reported to be clearance rather than tolerance of antigen Basu et al.

In addition to responding to foreign antigen Th17 cells may also contribute to epithelial barrier integrity Rutz et al.
