Three groups were identified in group 1 a surgical mask was worn group 2 had no mask worn and group 3 had no mask but used agar plates pretreated with 5 povidone-iodine as a negative control.

Use of a face mask decreased the number of plates with CFUs by 93 from 29 to 2 plates and decreased the total number of CFUs by 95 from 63 to 3 CFUs.

Each surgeon repeated the process 10 times for all groups totalling 30 plates per surgeon and 300 plates for the experiment.

Use of face masks decreased the number of plates with CFUs by 93 from 29 to 2 plates and decreased the total number of CFUs by 95 from 63 to 3 CFUs.

In brief different colony morphotypes from the agar plates were isolated and the identification of bacteria was conducted by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from each colony morphotype.Power calculation and statistical analysisA power calculation was performed prior to the experi- ment that determined that 100 plates per category exceeded the number needed to detect a difference in mean CFUs per group of 0.5 at a power of 0.95.

The purpose was to examine the effect of wearing a face mask on bacterial microbiota counts cultured on agar plates during an experimental corneal scrape procedure.METHODSExperimental structureA total of 10 ophthalmologists or ophthalmology trainees participated in the experiment.

Group 3 had no mask and used agar plates pretreated with 5 povidone-iodine Betadine 5 Sterile Ophthalmic Prep Solution Alcon USA to act as a negative control.

Currently masks are not routinely worn for corneal scraping.Samarawickrama C et al.

There was a 95 reduction in CFUs with the use of a surgical face mask.2Samarawickrama C et al.
