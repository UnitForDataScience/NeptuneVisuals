demonstrates the difference in the number of cfus isolated after 24 hours between group 1 and group 2. use of a face mask decreased the number of plates with cfus by 93 from 29 to 2 plates and decreased the total number of cfus by 95 from 63 to 3 cfus.

use of face masks decreased the number of plates with cfus by 93 from 29 to 2 plates and decreased the total number of cfus by 95 from 63 to 3 cfus.

group 1 mask had a meanfigure 1 histogram of number of colony forming units cfus after 24 hours of incubation between group 1 and group 2. there was a 95 reduction in cfus with the use of a surgical face mask.2samarawickrama c et al.

all plates were masked and incubated aerobically at 37 c for 24 hours and the number of colony forming units cfus was determined.results at 24 hours group 1 had a mean of 0.3cfus per surgeon group 2 had 6.4 cfus per surgeon and group 3 had 0.1 cfus per surgeon.

in brief different colony morphotypes from the agar plates were isolated and the identification of bacteria was conducted by sequencing the 16s rrna gene from each colony morphotype.power calculation and statistical analysisa power calculation was performed prior to the experi- ment that determined that 100 plates per category exceeded the number needed to detect a difference in mean cfus per group of 0.5 at a power of 0.95. the mann-whitney u test for non-parametric testing was used to determine the significance of the difference between means per group.resultsall 300 plates were successfully incubated.

three groups were identified in group 1 a surgical mask was worn group 2 had no mask worn and group 3 had no mask but used agar plates pretreated with 5 povidone-iodine as a negative control.

improved diagnosis of keratitis is needed because it is a significant and increasingcause of visual loss worldwide it was estimated that over 1.5 million people worldwide developed corneal ulceration annually and its prevalence is rising with the increased use of contact lenses.the reliability of corneal sampling may be compromised by contamination of the spec- imen.

our results high- light that oral microbiota when identified from corneal samples could be contaminants and should be consid- ered in progressive keratitis triggering the clinician to repeat the corneal sampling to identify the causal organism.

in contrast group2 had 63 bacterial cfus identified predominantly from respiratory microbiota.discussionour study shows that wearing a surgical mask decreases the risk of agar plate contamination during an experi- mental corneal scrape scenario.

the purpose was to examine the effect of wearing a face mask on bacterial microbiota counts cultured on agar plates during an experimental corneal scrape procedure.methodsexperimental structurea total of 10 ophthalmologists or ophthalmology trainees participated in the experiment.

currently masks are not routinely worn for corneal scraping.samarawickrama c et al.

we found that the spread of respiratory and skin microbiota was reduced by a factor of 21 the number of plates contaminated was reduced by 93 and the total number of cfus was reduced by 95. the use of a face mask was found to approximate the antiseptic properties of povidone- iodine in its effect on bacterial cfus.recognising organisms that are potential contami- nants is clinically important.
