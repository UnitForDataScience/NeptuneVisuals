the interaction between the ecb system and the gut microbiota modu- lates adipogenesis directly by acting upon adipose tissue and indirectly by increasing plasma lps levels.regulating the gut microbiota with prebiotics in ob ob mice decreases cb1 mrna expression in adipose tis- sue reduces lps levels in plasma and increases adipo- cyte lipogenesis and differentiation these effects indicate that the gut microbiota may have critical functions inadipose tissue plasticity during obesity and may deter- mine adipose tissue physiology through lps-ecb sys- tem regulatory loops .

nevertheless our understanding of the diversity of the gut microbiota was largely limited and biased and it showed that the gut microbiota is mainly composed of four phyla namely firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobac- teria and proteobacteria.

moreover the gut microbiota contains 600000 genes  which is approximately 25 times more than the number of genes in our own genome highlighting the existence of a highly complex microbiota ecosystem with the poten- tial for profound effects on metabolism and immune function.

therefore it was vital to understand the gut ecosystem by comprehensively analyzing the host the gut microbiota and their interactions.the gut microbiota was thought to possess a variety of functions in human physiology and pathology.

therefore a comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiota manipulation and an assessment of risk factors in related disorders was necessary to generate therapeutic approaches to cure these diseases.history of probiotics and prebioticsone approach to modulating the gut microbiota was the ingestion or administration of probiotics.

thus specific strategies for modifying the gut microbiota by probiotics and prebiot- ics could be potential targets for reducing the impact of high-fat feeding on the occurrence of metabolic diseases.ecb systemanother potential mechanism involved in the modula- tion of the gut microbiota on the development of ms and other related disorders is the endocannabinoid system ecb which is a summation of several bioac- tive lipids enzymes and distinct types of receptors .

therefore prebiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiota reduce both adipose tissue and intestinal ecb system respon- siveness consequently normalizing adipogenesis and improving the gut barrier.modulation of the intestinal microbiota with specific probiotics has been shown to upregulate cb2 receptor expression in rodents.

however it should be noted that even if potent interrelation exists between the composition of the gut microbiota and elements con- trolling the ecb system the direct involvement of spe- cific gut microbes andor of microbial metabolites needs further elucidation.summarythe gut microbiota is now considered to be involved in the regulation of multitudinous physiological pathways and to impact different host functions .

the fourth mechanism is down-regulation of ecb system responsiveness which impacts the regu- lation of energy homeostasis and the normalization of adipogenesis.conclusionaccumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a significant role in the initiation and progression of ms. the gut microbiota was proven to modulate plasma glucose appetite serum lipids and pro-inflammation.

thus preventative and therapeutic strategies to reduce themorbidity and mortality caused by metabolic diseases are significant.to date the human intestinal microbiota has gained increasing interest for its equivocal impact on human health such as its comprehensive physiological and path- ological functions -.

the human intestinal microbiota composition is the result of a bi-directional interaction between the host and its microbial consortium.

immune factors such as secretory iga and endogenous secretions end up in the intestine and have been proven to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota  .
