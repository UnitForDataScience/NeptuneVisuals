Apart from the morphological differences between the proximal and distal colon the contents too are dissimilar in their consistency and humidity the proximal colon content is liquid whereas the contents of distal colon normally form pellets with a firmer consistency.

In collapsed proximal colon bacteria mixed with mucus remain present in the lumen of folded tissue.that the distal colon contains a mostly transient microbiota confined to the faeces which means that most of the resident gut microbiota is hosted higher in the gut in the proximal colon and cecum as we have indeed observed.

c ABHE stained sections of full and empty mouse distal colon corresponding to the schematic overview of a.colon is only observed further towards the transition to distal colon after the chyme has been shaped into a rudimentary pellet under influence of water extraction by normal functioning of the colon Fig.

These results obtained from faecal material illustrate the organisation of the contents of distal colon which does not necessarily reflect the situation in the proximal colon.

a Close-up of rat empty distal colon b FISH staining indicating the absence of bacteria in the lumen of collapsed rat colon.

e FISH staining of rat colon containing faeces Bacteria red nuclear staining DAPI blue serving as a positive control.Mucus barrier in proximal colon is affected by consistency of contents.

The colonic contents were seen to form the first pellet in the distal end of the proximal colon on the transition towards the distal colon.

In mostly or completely collapsed proximal colon bacteria-colonised mucus was found in contact with the intestinal tissue unseparated by a sterile mucus barrier Figs and  in contrast to the situation described earlier for distal colon.

In full proximal colon we observed bacteria in contact with the epithelium too with the microbiota present in an increasing gradient towards the tissue Figs and  the highest concentration of bacteria was present around and especially below the tissue folds specific to the proximal colon.DiscussionLongitudinal sections of distal colon reveal that the colonic load is a determining factor in the organisation of the colonic mucus.

This heavily diminished presence of microbes in empty distal colon is of relevance to the host because in the absence of digesta a large microbial population could be deleterious in the distal colon.
