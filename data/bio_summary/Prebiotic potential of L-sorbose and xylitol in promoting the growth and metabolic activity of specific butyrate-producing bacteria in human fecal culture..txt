modulation of the metabolic activity of these bacteria might be a promising ap- proach for enhancing butyrate production and consequent pre- vention of colonic disease.the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of soluble ldcs including xylitol on butyrate production by in vitro human fecal culture and to isolate and characterize the human gut bac- teria responsible for producing butyrate from soluble ldcs so as to assess the prebiotic potential of these substances.materials and methodsbacterial strains and culture conditionsanaerostipes caccae dsm 14662t a. hadrus dsm 3319t rose- buria faecis dsm 16840t r. hominis dsm 16839t r. intestinalis dsm 14610t r. inulinivorans dsm 16841t coprococcus catus atcc 27761t eubacterium hallii atcc 27751t e. rectale atcc 33656t faecalibacterium prausnitzii atcc 27768t e. limosum atcc 8486t and megasphaera elsdenii jcm 1772t were obtained from ger- man collection of microorganisms and cell cultures dsmz braunschweig germany the american type culture collection atcc rockville md usa or the japan collection of microor- ganisms jcm tsukuba japan.

the average ra- tios of butyrate to total scfas acetate  propionate  butyrate in all cultures with l-sorbose and xylitol were 49 and 54 re- spectively those with the other substrates ranged from 15 to 35. the average ph values in each culture with d-sorbitol d- mannitol l-sorbose and xylitol were 5.84 5.86 5.95 and 6.06respectively these were slightly acidic compared with the con- trol 6.75. gos and fos gave more acidic ph values of 5.56 and 5.70 respectively.changes in the bacterial community in fecal cultures with l-sorbose or xylitolto evaluate the effects of l-sorbose or xylitol on bacterial com- munities in the fecal cultures a dgge analysis of bacterial 16s rrna gene fragments was performed.

all sequences ob- tained from the dgge bands were deposited in the ddbj nu- cleotide sequence database with accession numbers.isolation and identification of l-sorbose- or xylitol-degrading butyrate-producing bacteriafresh fecal samples 1 g collected from two healthy donors donors c and e 30 and 29 years old respectively who were among the donors who had donated the fecal samples for prepa- ration of the fecal cultures and had indicated high butyrate for- mation from both l-sorbose and xylitol were diluted in 9 ml of anaerobic phosphate-buffered saline in an anaerobic chamber.

by using an agar plate culture two strains of a. hadrus that produced butyrate from each substrate were isolated from the feces of two donors.furthermore of 12 species of representative colonic butyrate producers only a. hadrus and a. caccae demonstrated augmented butyrate production from l-sorbose or xylitol.

xylitol also stim- ulated significant butyrate formation 20 mm but propionate was the major end product in culture a. although d-mannitol and d-sorbitol also gave significant increases in butyrate con- centration in all cultures the mean butyrate values in cultures a to c with d-mannitol and in cultures a to d with d-sorbitol were lower than those with l-sorbose or xylitol.

phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of fecal isolates were analyzed as described in supplementary materials.phylogenetic characterization of fecal isolatessequences of the 16s rrna genes of clostridium clusters iv and xiva including bacterial species closely related to the fecal iso- lates were retrieved from genbankemblddbj.

the ability of various ldcs to promote butyrate production was evaluated in in vitro human fecal cultures.

the effects of oligosaccharides monosaccharides sugar alcohols and polysac- charides on butyrate formation have been investigated by in vitro human fecal culture mortensen holtug and rasmussen  rycroft et al.

anaerostipes hadrus was detected in four of five individuals and at 108.2-8.8 cells ml-1 of 10-fold-diluted feces in the control culture the counts of a. caccae were lower detected in only two of five individuals at 106.9 or 107.3 cells ml-1 of 10-fold-diluted feces than those of a. hadrus.utilization of l-sorbose or xylitol by butyrate-producing bacteriafinally the ability of representative human colonic bacterial strains including two fecal isolates to produce butyrate from l-sorbose or xylitol was evaluated.

however it remains to be clarified which bacteria are responsible for butyrate forma- tion from xylitol in the human gut.many research efforts using cultural and molecular biological methods have revealed the major groups of butyrate-producing bacteria in the human colon barcenilla et al.

in the fecal cultures was quanti- fied as described in the supplementary materials.pathway analysis of l-sorbose and xylitol metabolism in anaerostipes spp.analysis for the pathways of l-sorbose and xylitol metabolism based on the protein sequences predicted from the draft genomes of a. hadrus dsm 3319t and a. caccae dsm 14662t was performed by the method described in supplementary materi- als.butyrate production from l-sorbose and xylitol by human colonic bacteriarepresentative butyrate-producing strains in the human colon--16 strains within 12 species in 6 genera--were precul- tured in pyag broth.

a human study has suggested that ingestion of a single dose of xylitol 30 g person-1 induces a shift in the popu- lation of fecal gram-positive bacteria as a ratio of the total and affects the composition and metabolic activity of microbiota in the human colon salminen et al.

recent draft genome analysis of several human colonic butyrate-producing strains has enhanced our understanding of their metabolic activity and functional roles in human health the human microbiome project consortium  kant et al.
