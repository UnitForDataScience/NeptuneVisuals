To examine whether elevated circulating TMAO in CKD reduces eNOS activity we measured expression of total eNOS and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1177 and Thr495.

No significant differences in above renal function parameters were observed between two sham groups or between two CKD groups.Circulating TMAO levelsAt the end of the study protocol CKD-vehicle group showed markedly higher levels of plasma TMAO compared with sham- vehicle group A. DMB treatment significantly reduced plasma TMAO levels not only in CKD group but also in sham group compared with respective vehicle groups.Vascular reactivityThe dose-response curves of ACh-mediated endothelium- dependent relaxation in aortic rings are shown in B. CKD- vehicle group exhibited a significant reduction in ACh-induced relaxation when compared with all other groups.

Additionally impaired renal function may reduce the capacity of the kidney to excrete TMAO especially when TMAO synthesis is elevated resulting in increased circulating TMAO levels.

Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 leads to increase in eNOS activity whereas phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495 results in decrease in eNOS activity .

Endothelial dysfunction has been reported in patients with all stages of CKD e and in different animal models of chronic renal failure e. Although multiple factors have been proposed to contribute to endothelial dysfunction in CKD the precious underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive.Trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO a gut microbiota-dependent metabolite has recently gained much attention due to its poten- tial role in mediating cardiovascular disease CVD pathogenesis e. For example elevated TMAO worsens the outcomes of pressure overload-induced heart failure  exacerbates hyper- tensive effect of angiotensin II  and promotes atherosclerotic development .

Circulating TMAO is elevated in patients with CKD and associated with increased cardiovascular events e. To date however no studies have directly examined the role of TMAO in mediating endothelial dysfunction in CKD.

These findings suggest that CDK- associated increase in circulating TMAO may impair eNOS- derived NO production through vascular oxidative stress and inflammation contributing to endothelial dysfunction in CKD.In summary the present study demonstrates that CKD leads to increases in gut microbiota-generated metabolite TMAO in the circulation which promotes vascular oxidative stress and inflam- mation contributing to endothelial dysfunction in CKD F. These findings may provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for CKD-associated endothelial dysfunction and car- diovascular disease.
