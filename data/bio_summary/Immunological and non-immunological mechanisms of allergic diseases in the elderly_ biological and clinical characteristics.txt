Be- cause of their association with pathological cases and chronic diseases inflammatory mediators can also act as biomarkers or risk factors for age-associated diseases and predictors of mortality.Both the IRP and inflammageing demonstrated being independent predictors of successful ageing and survival suggesting that the physiological immunosenescence of T cells and low-grade inflammation are vital in late-life survival Major functions known to decrease with age are IL-2 production and T-cell proliferation This in vitro evidence would suggest an in vivo clonal expan- sion deficiency following antigen recognition partly explaining age-associated increased susceptibility to in- fections auto-immune diseases and cancers.The dysfunction age-related of the immune system de- scribed above might also influence the efficacy of the vaccination in the old patient Although efficient in the great percentage of the indi- viduals only a small percentage of frail elderly is pro- tected after influenza vaccination  This is partly due to the fact that antibodies produced by aged B cells are commonly of low affinity providing less efficient protection compared to young individuals B-cell lymphopoiesis is also reduced which leads to an in- crease in the percentage of antigen-experienced cells compared to newly produced naive B cells parallel to the situation with T cells Recently Minciullo et al.

Better understanding of the mechanisms of immunosenescence and its effects on allergic inflammation will most certainly lead to improved therapy - Optimal treatment of eld- erly patients requires an alliance between the patient geriatrician and allergist.AbbreviationsABC Atopic blepharoconjunctivitis AKC Atopic keratoconjunctivitisAPC Antigen-presenting cells AR Allergic rhinitis CMV Cytomegalovirus COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease DC Dendritic Cell GM-CSF Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor GPC Giant papillary conjunctivitis IFN-g Interferon-g IOIS International Ocular Inflammation Society IRP Immune risk profile MCH Major histocompatibility complex NCBF Nasal ciliary beat frequency NK Natural Killer NMCC Nasal mucociliary clearance PAC Perennial allergic conjunctivitis SAC Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis Th T helper TLR4 Toll-like receptor-4 VKC Vernal keratoconjunctivitisAcknowledgementsNoneFundingThis work was entirely supported by the authors' respective institutions.Availability of data and materialsNot applicable.Authors' contributionsGDL wrote the paper.

The symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis were reported byTable 1 Immunoglobulin and cells involved in ocular allergic diseases68.6 of subjects with current rhinitis accounting for a prevalence of rhino-conjunctivitis of 20.5 95 CI 19.2-21.8 in the studied population .Allergic rhinitisAllergic rhinitis AR is prevalent among older people af- fecting around 5.4 to 10.7 of patients over 65 years old .

The IRP was constituted by immune subsections consisting of a high count of CD8 T cells a reduced number of CD4 T cells and CD19 B cells a reverted CD4-CD8 ratio and a diminished response to concanav- alin A  Extensive analysis to search for associations between this IRP and various psychosocial parameters revealed that the IRP was associated only with evidence of persistent CMV infection becoming prevalent in the very old.

Animal and in vitro models substantiate the existence of immunosenescence in humans NK cells are cytotoxic cells that play a significant role in innate defence against virus infected cells and possibly cancer.

Macropino-cytosis endo- cytosis response to chemokines and cytokine secretion are also impaired probably as a consequence of de- creased activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase path- way Immune longitudinal studies in octo- and nona- genarians performed to establish predictive factors for longevity - in the context of function and also measuring disability parameters favour the hypothesis that the immune risk profile IRP predictive ofsubsequent mortality seems to depend in part on CD4  CD8 low B cells poor proliferation response high CD8 CD28 cells low native cells cytomegalovirus CMV seropositivity and expansion of CMV-specific clones.

The main hallmarks of immunosenescence are lymphocyte sub-population imbalances decreased naive and increased memory lym- phocytes with accumulation of dysfunctional senescent cells with shortened telomeres thymus involution with decreased new T-cell generation hematopoietic stem cell dysfunctions defects in apoptotic cell death mitochondrial function and stress responses and malfunc- tioning of immune regulatory cells.

The number of goblet cells decreases resilient structures atrophy and the basement membrane gets thicker with ageing.

In other words the genetic background of any subject controls immunity and inflammation and influ- ences the chronic antigen load and the inflammation in ageing responsible for immunosenescence and hence age-related disorders.Immunosenescence is the name given to the global age-associated immune dysfunctions - There are several hypotheses to explain the ageing process the same is true for immunosenescence  Virtually all cells of the immune system can undergo immunosenes- cence which can lead to the general erosion of immune capacities.
