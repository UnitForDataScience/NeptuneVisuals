be- cause of their association with pathological cases and chronic diseases inflammatory mediators can also act as biomarkers or risk factors for age-associated diseases and predictors of mortality.both the irp and inflammageing demonstrated being independent predictors of successful ageing and survival suggesting that the physiological immunosenescence of t cells and low-grade inflammation are vital in late-life survival major functions known to decrease with age are il-2 production and t-cell proliferation this in vitro evidence would suggest an in vivo clonal expan- sion deficiency following antigen recognition partly explaining age-associated increased susceptibility to in- fections auto-immune diseases and cancers.the dysfunction age-related of the immune system de- scribed above might also influence the efficacy of the vaccination in the old patient although efficient in the great percentage of the indi- viduals only a small percentage of frail elderly is pro- tected after influenza vaccination  this is partly due to the fact that antibodies produced by aged b cells are commonly of low affinity providing less efficient protection compared to young individuals b-cell lymphopoiesis is also reduced which leads to an in- crease in the percentage of antigen-experienced cells compared to newly produced naive b cells parallel to the situation with t cells recently minciullo et al.

animal and in vitro models substantiate the existence of immunosenescence in humans nk cells are cytotoxic cells that play a significant role in innate defence against virus infected cells and possibly cancer.

macropino-cytosis endo- cytosis response to chemokines and cytokine secretion are also impaired probably as a consequence of de- creased activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase path- way immune longitudinal studies in octo- and nona- genarians performed to establish predictive factors for longevity - in the context of function and also measuring disability parameters favour the hypothesis that the immune risk profile irp predictive ofsubsequent mortality seems to depend in part on cd4  cd8 low b cells poor proliferation response high cd8 cd28 cells low native cells cytomegalovirus cmv seropositivity and expansion of cmv-specific clones.

the irp was constituted by immune subsections consisting of a high count of cd8 t cells a reduced number of cd4 t cells and cd19 b cells a reverted cd4-cd8 ratio and a diminished response to concanav- alin a  extensive analysis to search for associations between this irp and various psychosocial parameters revealed that the irp was associated only with evidence of persistent cmv infection becoming prevalent in the very old.

in other words the genetic background of any subject controls immunity and inflammation and influ- ences the chronic antigen load and the inflammation in ageing responsible for immunosenescence and hence age-related disorders.immunosenescence is the name given to the global age-associated immune dysfunctions - there are several hypotheses to explain the ageing process the same is true for immunosenescence  virtually all cells of the immune system can undergo immunosenes- cence which can lead to the general erosion of immune capacities.

for many years asthma in older patients was char- acterized as non-atopic however in the past two decades data from large populations or from studies in- corporating data from multiple sites of asthma care demonstrate that some older patients with asthma are also atopic demonstrated either by serum evaluation or skin prick testing.

in a study focusing on the lung function and inflammatory differences between asthma and copd it was observed that in the asthma subjects there was significantly more allergic sensitivity higher values for alveolus-capillary diffusion of carbon monoxidegreater increases in forced expiratory volume in the 1st second following bronchodilator or corticosteroids and more eosinophils in peripheral blood bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum however it is also likely that an overlap syndrome exists for some patients in which fea- tures of asthma and copd are both present but this subset of patients has yet to be carefully examined and is typically excluded from investigation studies.

the dutch hypothesis is an interesting view of asthma and copd that proposes there is one common obstructive lung disease that includes both asthma and copd this hypothesis suggests that a common genetic predis- position for obstructive lung disease exists and that asthma and copd differ with respect to the lung expo- sures allergen versus tobacco smoke that trigger and drive the disorder towards airway obstruction.

hormonal changes that also play a role in the ageing of skin especially in females lead to earlier signs of ageing for women however skin ageing can also produce significant mor- bidity pervasive dryness and itching and increased risk of numerous skin diseases including cutaneous malig- nancy.

the main hallmarks of immunosenescence are lymphocyte sub-population imbalances decreased naive and increased memory lym- phocytes with accumulation of dysfunctional senescent cells with shortened telomeres thymus involution with decreased new t-cell generation hematopoietic stem cell dysfunctions defects in apoptotic cell death mitochondrial function and stress responses and malfunc- tioning of immune regulatory cells.

it was speculated that the cytotoxicity of nk cells is directly correlated to a successful ageing a weaker response in also related to augmented morbidity and mortality due to infective and cardiovascular agents and to a worse response to influenza vaccination.

the number of goblet cells decreases resilient structures atrophy and the basement membrane gets thicker with ageing.
