For genomic DNA isolation six colonies were randomly selected from every stock plate a total of 48 colonies out of 416 colonies from eight individual fecal samples Table 1.

The bacterial 16S rRNA gene has been used to detect bacterial pathogens from various environmental sources such as wildlife feces Maciel et al.

The plates were incubated at 37degC for 24 h. Bacteria were cultured following the procedure of Jolt et al.

The universal 16S rRNA primer set for polymerase chain reaction PCR amplification was as follows 27f 5'-GAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG-3' Ludwig et al.

The fecal samples were brought to the laboratory in ice boxes where they were processed within 3 h. The sample collection was conducted with the permission and following the guidelines of local government.Culture of fecal coliformThe fecal samples 0.1-1 g were suspended in 9 mL of distilled water and mixed vigorously to produce a uniform suspension.

The objective of the present study is to detect pathogenic bacteria from bacterial colonies collected from fecal coliforms of wild mice using the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.MATERIAL AND METHODSSample collectionWe captured eight individuals of two species Apodemus agrarius and A. peninsulae of wild mice using a Sherman trap in agricultural areas near Odaesan National Park South Korea in May 2016.

The average aerobic plate count APC colony numbers rangeaThe stock plate contains 52 colonies that were selected randomly from TSA LB and MRS medium.

To identify them the sequences were compared for similarity with those of bacteria deposited in GenBank using the NCBI BLAST available at The bacterial colonies were identified by 99100 identity of 100 sequence coverage in the sequence similarity comparison as the following species Bacillus sp  KY047617 Bacillus sp OSM29  KY458805 B. amyloliquefaciens DSM7 T  KY047618 B. amyloliquefaciens SVN01  KY458798 Staphylococcus xylosus ATCC 29971T  KY047619 Serratia liquefaciens ATCC 27592 T  KY047620 S. liquefaciens LZ-24 KY458800 Serratia sp K20-49  KY458799 Serratia sp UIWRF1065  KY458801 andEscherichia coli TSA3  KY458803 and E. coli M9  KY458802 Table 1.In the four bacteria species identified B. amyloliquefaciens S. xylosus S. liquefaciens and E.coli B. amyloliquefaciens was detected from fecal pellets of A. peninsulae while the other three bacterial species were identified from those of A. agrarius Table 1.Phylogenetic analysis revealed with the exclusion of the genus Bacillus group all species were well placed within their own genera Figure 1.

First we isolated bacterial colonies onto the common media LB lactose broth agar TSA tryptic soy agar and MRS de Man Rogosa and Sharpe agar and then randomly select colonies from each plate and stocked them to the mother plate for genomic DNA isolation.

With the sterilized toothpick the selected colonies were transferred to 5 mL LB and incubated for at 37degC for 18 h. Then they were maintained at -80degC.Genomic DNA extraction PCR and sequencingThe 48 LB-cultured colonies Table 1 were used for genomic DNA isolation with Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit Quagen Valencia according to the manufacturer's protocol.
