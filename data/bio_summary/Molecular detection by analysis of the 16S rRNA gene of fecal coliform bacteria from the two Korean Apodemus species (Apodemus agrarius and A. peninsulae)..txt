for genomic dna isolation six colonies were randomly selected from every stock plate a total of 48 colonies out of 416 colonies from eight individual fecal samples table 1. with the sterilized toothpick the selected colonies were transferred to 5 ml lb and incubated for at 37degc for 18 h. then they were maintained at -80degc.genomic dna extraction pcr and sequencingthe 48 lb-cultured colonies table 1 were used for genomic dna isolation with qiagen dneasy blood and tissue kit quagen valencia according to the manufacturer's protocol.

thus the early detection of pathogenic bacteria in wildlife is very important as a preventative step for the public health of farm workers.molecular markers are one of the molecular tools for the identification of various taxa from bacteria to mammals kim et al.

thus only single representative sequence of each bacterial strain was submitted to genbank.molecular detection of a. agrarius fecal bacteria5from 5 sd  -1.0 n  3 x 105 colony-forming units cfug in the fecal coliform of a. agrarius m24 to 1.3 - 0.6 n  3 x 1011 cfug in the fecal coliform of a. agrarius m2 table 1.in 12 of 48 colonies we collected 16s rrna gene sequences of 629-1068 bp in length table 1. to identify them the sequences were compared for similarity with those of bacteria deposited in genbank using the ncbi blast available at the bacterial colonies were identified by 99100 identity of 100 sequence coverage in the sequence similarity comparison as the following species bacillus sp  ky047617 bacillus sp osm29  ky458805 b. amyloliquefaciens dsm7 t  ky047618 b. amyloliquefaciens svn01  ky458798 staphylococcus xylosus atcc 29971t  ky047619 serratia liquefaciens atcc 27592 t  ky047620 s. liquefaciens lz-24 ky458800 serratia sp k20-49  ky458799 serratia sp uiwrf1065  ky458801 andescherichia coli tsa3  ky458803 and e. coli m9  ky458802 table 1.in the four bacteria species identified b. amyloliquefaciens s. xylosus s. liquefaciens and e.coli b. amyloliquefaciens was detected from fecal pellets of a. peninsulae while the other three bacterial species were identified from those of a. agrarius table 1.phylogenetic analysis revealed with the exclusion of the genus bacillus group all species were well placed within their own genera figure 1. the group of the genus bacillus were separated into two different clades.

next the fecal samples were serially diluted up to 108 and then 0.1 ml of aliquots were spread on nutrient agar plates of mrs de man rogosa and sharpe lb lactose broth and tsa tryptic soy agar resulting in a total of 24 plates that consist of three kinds of media plates table 1. the plates were incubated at 37degc for 24 h. bacteria were cultured following the procedure of jolt et al.
