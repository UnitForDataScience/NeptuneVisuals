Afterwards the four lactic acid bacteria were characterized physiologically and biochemically and we found that they differed from lactic acid bacteria used in commercial yogurt production.

To gain such knowledge it is crucial to identify and characterize the bacteria in a starter culture.Analysis of protein profiles of microorganisms carried out with the MALDI-TOF Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ion- ization time-of-flight mass spectrometry are compatible with the results of identification made by using molecular methods 25.Therefore MALDI-TOF can be considered a robust and reliable method as well as fast and inexpensive to identify Gram-positive bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria 2530.The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize LAB from collected non-commercial yogurts in southern Anatolia and find out whether they differed from the LAB used for the production of commercial yogurts.Materials and methodsTraditional yogurt production and samples collection.

Today the vast majority of yogurt needs are met bycommercially produced yogurts and the goal of companies isto produce more solid continuous sweet yogurt with a variety of additives.

Commercial yogurts are produced using standard starters while in the production of non-commercial yogurt the microbiota is quite different since yogurts are used as starter for years.

Int Microbiol 201 25-30 2017Keywords yogurt starters  lactic acid bacteria LAB  southern Anatolia TurkeyIntroductionYogurt is a dairy product obtained by the bacterial fermenta- tion of milk.

In several countries LAB are present in yogurt in numbers of at least 106 to 5 x 108 CFUml depending on the type of yogurt 6.

The yogurt bacteria isolated in this study are used in several combina- tions that allow the development of a starter culture that is the basis for the unique taste of yogurt.

The results of this study showed that the pH levels of then non-commer- cial yogurts from villages in Turkey that we analyzed were acidic below 7 as a result of lactic acid fermentation their pH ranged from 3.9-6.0.

As no standard inocula were ap- plied in this study the relatively high pH of some yogurts could be related to both yeasts and bacteria present in the yogurt total microbiota.
