The amount of bacteria decreased after surgery in five studies to different degrees - but only one study found a significant reduction Three studies showed no difference between the pre- and postopera- tive number of bacteria  and two studies did not report the bacterial amount .Surgical procedures tended to result in an increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease ofLactobacilli and Bifidobacteria - The cohort study had a similar result as controlled studies Potentially pathogenic bacteria like Pseudomonas Staphylococcus and Enterococci were identified as a pos- sible source of infection in one study However the changes of gut flora reached except of one study not the level of statistical significance.Effect of applied synbioticsprobiotics on gut microbiome The preoperative application of synbioticsprobiotics caused a change of gut flora before operation - The count of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria were also higher on the seventh postoperative day in patients who were treated with synbiotics  .

The area of surgery was mixed Four studies one cohort study and three RCT evaluated patients after colorectal surgery one study assessed patients after esophagectomy and another one looked at patients after operation of the pancreas and bile-system.

In colorectal surgery the applica- tion of antibiotics is thought to reduce the rate of postoperative wound infection by as much as 75 and is therefore a standard in colorectal surgery To over- come the gap of knowledge we suggest a prospective co- hort study without probioticssynbiotics intervention but with strict control of possible biasconfounding factors comparing patients with and without postoperative com- plications in regards to the microbiome diversity mea- sured with next generation sequencing.ConclusionAs a result from nine RCTs and one cohort study there might be a relationship between the gut flora and the development of postoperative complications.

One study re- ported that first day of flatus was significantly earlier in patients with treatment Another one found a sig- nificant earlier defecation Both studies found a lower rate of postoperative diarrhea in probioticsynbio- tic-treated patients which was significant in one study The rate of typical postoperative abdominal symp- toms like cramping and distension was lower in pro- bioticsynbiotic-treated group  result was significant in one study Risk of bias within the studiesThe reviewed studies showed uncontrolled biascon- founding factors.

Also applied probioticssynbiotics differed shown in Table Just two of the RCTs were double-blinded and placebo-controlled In one study the baseline characteristics of control and intervention group differed significantly Just two studies defined a primary end- point and calculated the sample size All of the other included studies did not define primary endpoints and did multiple testing without adjustment.DiscussionWhether or not the gut microbiota are related to anasto- motic leakage or wound infection after gastrointestinal surgery remains a highly relevant question with regard to the management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
