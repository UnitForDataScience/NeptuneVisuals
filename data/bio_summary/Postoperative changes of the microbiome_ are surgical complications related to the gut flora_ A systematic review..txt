the amount of bacteria decreased after surgery in five studies to different degrees - but only one study found a significant reduction three studies showed no difference between the pre- and postopera- tive number of bacteria  and two studies did not report the bacterial amount .surgical procedures tended to result in an increase of potentially pathogenic bacteria and a decrease oflactobacilli and bifidobacteria - the cohort study had a similar result as controlled studies potentially pathogenic bacteria like pseudomonas staphylococcus and enterococci were identified as a pos- sible source of infection in one study however the changes of gut flora reached except of one study not the level of statistical significance.effect of applied synbioticsprobiotics on gut microbiome the preoperative application of synbioticsprobiotics caused a change of gut flora before operation - the count of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were also higher on the seventh postoperative day in patients who were treated with synbiotics  .

the area of surgery was mixed four studies one cohort study and three rct evaluated patients after colorectal surgery one study assessed patients after esophagectomy and another one looked at patients after operation of the pancreas and bile-system.

in colorectal surgery the applica- tion of antibiotics is thought to reduce the rate of postoperative wound infection by as much as 75 and is therefore a standard in colorectal surgery to over- come the gap of knowledge we suggest a prospective co- hort study without probioticssynbiotics intervention but with strict control of possible biasconfounding factors comparing patients with and without postoperative com- plications in regards to the microbiome diversity mea- sured with next generation sequencing.conclusionas a result from nine rcts and one cohort study there might be a relationship between the gut flora and the development of postoperative complications.

also applied probioticssynbiotics differed shown in table just two of the rcts were double-blinded and placebo-controlled in one study the baseline characteristics of control and intervention group differed significantly just two studies defined a primary end- point and calculated the sample size all of the other included studies did not define primary endpoints and did multiple testing without adjustment.discussionwhether or not the gut microbiota are related to anasto- motic leakage or wound infection after gastrointestinal surgery remains a highly relevant question with regard to the management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

one study re- ported that first day of flatus was significantly earlier in patients with treatment another one found a sig- nificant earlier defecation both studies found a lower rate of postoperative diarrhea in probioticsynbio- tic-treated patients which was significant in one study the rate of typical postoperative abdominal symp- toms like cramping and distension was lower in pro- bioticsynbiotic-treated group  result was significant in one study risk of bias within the studiesthe reviewed studies showed uncontrolled biascon- founding factors.

operations differed four studies dealing with colorectal surgery four dealing with liver surgery  and one with the pancreasbile-system and the esophagus respectively.

four studies focused on liver surgery hereof one study adressed patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation.

in contrast one study showed an opposite ef- fect patients after hepatic surgery had in probiotic group clearly a lower count of lactobacilli and bifido- bacteria on the seventh postoperative day.

it was measured in six studies - one cohort study showed a significant postoperative de- crease of organic acids after colorectal surgery most of the patients in controlled studies had a higher concentration of organic acids in stool after treatment with synbiotics.

randomised clinical trial the effects of perioperative probiotic treatment on barrier function and post- operative infectious complications in colorectal cancer surgery - a double- blind study.

publications were released between 2006 and 2012. one study is related to a cohort study n  81 nine belong to randomized controlled trials n  596. in total the stud- ies comprise 677 patients 367 hereof were treated with probioticssynbiotics.

they found a significant increase of organic acids in control group on the 21st day after operation compared to preoperative measuring ph of stool was measured in six studies  - there were no differences of ph pre- and postoperatively in cohort study three studies re- ported a lower ph for patients who were treated with probioticssynbiotics compared to control groups - this difference was significant on the sev- enth postoperative day in two trials  two rct found no difference one study also correlated amount of organic acids with number of bacteria in the gut if there were more potentially pathogenic bacteria like enterobacter species and pseudomonas amount of organic acids was significantly decreased.
