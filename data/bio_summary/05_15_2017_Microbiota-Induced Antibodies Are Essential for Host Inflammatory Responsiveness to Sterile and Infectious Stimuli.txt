Therefore injection of serum obtained from CV mice into GF mice also restores inflammatory responsiveness during infectious stimuli.DiscussionIn the present study we demonstrate that a soluble factor present in the serum of conventionally colonized mice is able to restore re- sponsiveness to inflammatory challenges in GF mice the serum of Ab-deficient mice is unable to reverse inflammatory hypores- ponsiveness in GF mice and injection of Abs obtained from serum of CV mice into GF hosts restores inflammatory responsiveness previous treatment with Abs from CV mice inhibits production of anti-inflammatory mediators in GF hosts favoring NF-kB ac- tivation and expression of proinflammatory mediators upon inflammatory insult and the reversion of inflammatory respon- siveness of GF mice by serum from CV mice confers resistance to K. pneumoniae pulmonary infection.

The injection of GF serum to CV mice GF serum to GF mice and CV serum to CV mice was also performed as controls.In CV mice that received CV or GF serum an intense local and remote inflammatory response was observed after IR injury that was marked by an increase in vascular permeability Fig.

Therefore conventionalization of GF mice leads to IgG production and se- rum from CVN mice restores inflammatory responsiveness in GF hosts.Our next step was to evaluate whether serum transfer would in- crease levels of circulating IgG in GF mice and whether there would be IgG deposition upon IR induction in GF mice that received serum from CV animals an event that was shown to be important for IR- associated tissue injury.

Transferring serum from Ig-deficient mice to GF animals did not alter their response to inflammatory insult however injecting purified Abs from CV animals restored inflammatory responsiveness in GF mice suggesting that natural Abs present in serum were responsible for altering GF responsiveness.

Therefore these find- ings demonstrate that serum transfer from CV mice to GF mice abrogated IL-10 production in the latter thus favoring re- establishment of the inflammatory response in these mice as shown by vascular permeability neutrophil influx and TNF-a release.Serum transfer-mediated re-establishment of the inflammatory response in GF mice is associated with IgsWe have previously shown that reposition of microbiota in GF mice conventionalization for 14 d re-establishes an inflam- matory phenotype in the conventionalized CVN mice 6 32.

A-D GF mice received 400 ml of CV mouse serum GF mouse serum or CVN GF mouse serum 24 h before ischemia.

With these results we can conclude that serum transfer from CV mice is capable of restraining expression of anti-inflammatory proteins and re- establishing activation of NF-kB upon reperfusion injury.Serum transfer reversal of the anti-inflammatory phenotype restores the capacity of GF mice to deal with K. pneumoniae infectionHaving established that serum transfer is able to reverse the phenotype of GF mice in a model of sterile acute inflammatory injury we next addressed whether the serum transfer would be capable of restoring the response of GF mice against infections.

E The groups that received control GF to GF or CV CV to GF serum are shown.

Taking into account that the deposition of immune complexes is a major event in acute inflammation and that GF mice have a distinct Ig repertoire and B cell activity we aimed to evaluate whether this altered Ig repertoire interferes with the inflammatory responsiveness of GF mice.

In 2007 we reported that the production of LXA4 and ANXA-1 is enhanced in GF mice and both mediators appear to cooperatively activate the shared ALX receptor to induce IL-10 production and mediate the inflammatory hyporesponsiveness of GF mice.GF mice also differ dramatically from CV mice with regard to Ab repertoire and B cell populations.
