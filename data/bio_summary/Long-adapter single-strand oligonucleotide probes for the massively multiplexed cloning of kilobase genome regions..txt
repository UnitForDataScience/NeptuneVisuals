The DNA sequences of single pre-LASSO probes are in Supplementary Table 3Post Capture PCR--The captured ORFs were amplified using 5 ml of the capture reaction containing DNA circles in 25 ml of PCR master mix composed of 0.1 ml of Omni Klentaq LA dNTPs 200 mM and 0.4 mM of primers that annealed in the Long Adapter sequence or in the MIP linker region.

The full table of the ORFs with valid ligation and extension arms and the corresponding pre-LASSO probes subpool  400bp and for the pre-LASSO subpool that only included only the ORFs 2kb subpool  2kb are reported in Supplementary File 1The Long Adapters 242 bp and 442 bp were obtained by PCR performed by using tailed primers and the plasmid pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-Puro System Bioscience as template.

Hybridization and capture were performed as described above.Capture of human ORFs using single LASSO probes from human cDNA--To capture human ORFs total RNA of Jurkat E6-1 ATCC TIB-152 cells was extracted using miRNeasy Micro Kit Qiagen.

7.Multiplex LASSO Cloning of the E. coli ORFeomeWe next evaluated the ability of LASSO probes to capture a library of kilobase-sized ORFs from E. coli genomic DNA using two different adapter lengths 350 bp and 550 bp.These results were additionally compared to capture using traditional MIP probes 120 bp in length.

The sequences of the 242 bp 442 bp Long Adapters are listed in Supplementary Table 1 all DNA sequences of primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2LASSO probe assemblyFusion PCR--The fusion PCR reactions was performed in 25 ml containing 2.5 ml of Klentaq Mutant Buffer 10X 0.6 ml of dNTPs 10 mM 0.2 ml of Omni Klentaq LA DNA Polymerase Technology 20 ng of pre-LASSO probe a single dsDNA pre-LASSO probe or a pool of ssDNA pre-LASSO probes 20 ng of Long Adapter.

The parallel amplification of hundreds of DNA targets 200 base pairs bp in a single reaction using short selector oligonucleotides 70bp that act as a template for the circularization of specific target sequences has been shown2..

The amplicon corresponded to the expected size data not shown and was converted to mature MIPs as described in Materials and Methods.The E. coli ORFeome capture was performed using the two LASSO probe sets and corresponding MIP probes.

The PCR products was loaded in an 1 agarose gel and DNA band correspondent to the expected size of the Long Adapters were cut and purified from the gel using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System Promega USA.

Amplicons corresponding to the expected sizes of the fusion PCR products were purified using QIAquick Gel ExtractionTosi et al.Page 9Kit Quiagen or Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System Promega and eluted in 50 ml of water.Self-circularization--The approximately 45 ml solution containing gel purified LASSO fusion PCR products as described above were digested by adding 5 ml of EcoRI 10X buffer and 1ml 20 unitsml of EcoRI restriction enzyme NEB for 1h at 37degC followed by 10' at 80degC.

The digested DNA was purified using AMPure beads 1.4X and washed twice with 70 ethanol and eluted in 40 ml of water.
