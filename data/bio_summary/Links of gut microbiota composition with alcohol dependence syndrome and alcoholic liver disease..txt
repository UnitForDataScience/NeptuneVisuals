imbalances in these microbial communities are implicated in a wide variety of diseases cho  blaser 2012. the extent to which triclosan exposure may induce microbial perturbations has been studied in fish and rodent models with conflicting outcomes re- viewed in yee et al 2016. triclosan exposure restructures the juvenile fish microbiome narrowe et al 2015 but results in recov- erable alterations following short-term perturbation in adult fish gaulke et al 2016. adolescent rats receiving oral triclosan at levels comparable to human exposures develop lower microbial diversity in the gut and more prominent changes in taxonomic composition than in adult rats hu et al 2016. while triclocarban exposures are less studied in pregnant rats and their offspring 10 days old exposure leads to lowered phylogenetic diversity and revealed a dominance of the proteobacteria phylum in the gut kennedy et al 2016. in a small randomized crossover human study tc wash product exposure did not induce major perturba- tions of the oral and gut microbiomes poole et al 2016. this finding supports other studies that have shown minimal impact of triclosan on dental microbial ecology despite slowing the progres- sion of periodontitis seymour et al 2017.department of genetics stanford university stanford ca usadivision of infectious diseases and geographic medicine department of medicine stanford university stanford ca usadivision of hematology department of medicine stanford university stanford ca usadivision of epidemiology department of health research and policy stanford university stanford ca usacorresponding author.

evidence that antibiotic resistance develops in diverse bacterial taxa following prolonged triclosan exposure suggests that triclosan resistance may be mediated by specific genes forbes et al 2016 hartmann et al 2016 khan et al 2016 and that these genes may be horizontally transferred ciusa et al 2012. although we only identified one significantly enriched antibiotic resistance gene in the tc-exposed mothers point mutations in the candidate cfxa6 have led to antibiotic resistance in the gut following antibiotic exposure raymond et al 2016. future in vitro and potentially in vivo studies will be required to more thoroughly characterize the impact of tcs on antibiotic resistance in the gut microbiota.

tel 1 650 725 4561 e-mail the core microbiome of humans is established in the first few years of life palmer et al 2007. disruptions to the microbiota early in development by extrinsic factors such as antibiotics can have long-term impacts on metabolic regulation cox et al 2014 and can delay normal microbiota maturation nobel et al 2015. the impact of tc exposure through household and personal care products on the developing microbiota is unknown.

although mothers in the tc arm had higher levels of triclosan detected in urine than those in ntc households the median triclosan level we detected in urine of ntc households was higher than those reported in the national health and nutrition examination surveys nhanescohort from 2003 to 2012 geometric mean concentration ofpgll 95th percentile concentration of 459.0 pgll han et al 2016. in addition the urinary triclosan levels of mothers in tc households were lower than might have been anticipated-- approximately half of the levels following a 4-month randomiza- tion to household tc-containing products in a previously published crossover study poole et al 2016. some of the dif- ferences may be due to methodological variations in the protocols used for triclosan detection or differences in exposure due to geog- raphy and inconsistent product usage.

infants did not show an enrichment of specific phyla at any time point but bacteroides fragilis was persistently the most enriched species in ntc infants in combined and time-point analyses at 6 months fig 4a and b. relative abundances of b. frag- ilis at this visit were not associated with delivery method mann- whitney u-test p  0.85 or breast feeding anova p  0.52 as previously reported martin et al 2016. mothers showed a strong enrichment of proteobacteria in the tc arm after the introduction of triclosan-containing toothpaste at the 2-month visit toothpaste was not provided prior to the infants' births fig 4c.

triclosan exposure is known to play a role in allergen and food sensitization hampton 2011 savage et al 2012 topical skin application of triclosan is sufficient to induce peanut sensitivity in mice tobar et al 2016. given the high prevalence of tc exposure on the skin in this study it will be interesting to study the impact of these wash products on the skin microbiota and related health outcomes.

despite the minimal effects of tc exposure from wash products on the gut microbial community of infants and adults detected proteobacteria enrich- ment highlights the need for consumer safety testing of consumer antimicrobial products on the human microbiome and antibiotic resistance.materials and methodsstudy designsubjects in this study were recruited to participate in stanford's outcomes research in kids stork a prospective cohort study of healthy mothers and infants ley et al 2016. briefly pregnant mothers were enrolled in the study at approximately 20 weeks of gestation from both lucile packard children's hospital stanford ca usa and the tully road clinic of santa clara valley medical center san jose ca usa.

this study leverages a nested randomized intervention within stanford's outcomes research in kids stork a prospective cohort study of healthy mothers and infants ley et al 2016. specifically we provided households with commercially available wash products containing or not containing tcs tc and ntc arms respectively to evaluate the relative impact of tcs on the maternal and infant gut microbiota over the first year of the infant's life.resultsstudy demographicsthirty-nine of 136 households from the stork cohort met our inclusion criteria i.e.

infants with higher triclosan levels showed a statistically significant enrichment of the proteobacteria phylum in their stools samples conversely b. fragilis was enriched in infants with lower triclosan levels fdr-adjusted p-value  0.1 appendix table s1.proteobacteria enrichment has been associated but is not directly correlated with increased antibiotic resistance genes in the human gut microbiota independent of antibiotic exposure bengtsson-palme et al 2015. this suggests proteobacteria species may not harbor antibiotic resistance genes in the gut microbiome but expansion may serve as marker for increased antibiotic resistance in a commu- nity.

paired-end 101-bp sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq 4000 at the stanford sequencing service center with an average of 21660032 12825854-31271994 reads per sample.low-quality read ends with a phred score  20 were trimmed using trimgalore v. 0.4.1  and pcr duplicates were removed using super-deduper v. 1.40 high-quality reads were then aligned to the card mcarthur et al 2013 using burrows-wheeler aligner v. 0.7.10 et.

differential gene analysis from card showed an enrich-yatsunenko et al 2012 and this effect was not altered by random- ization to tc.

differential taxa abundance and gene analyses were performed using deseq2 v. 1.10 love et al 2014. a conservative 1 fdr-adjusted p-value threshold was selected for the treatment comparisons across mothers and infants pooling all three visits.
