REVIEWTreatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis past present and futureNicolas Lanthier and Peter StaEURrkelService d'Hepato-gastroenterologie Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc Laboratory of Hepatogastroenterology Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique Universite catholique de Louvain Brussels BelgiumAcute alcoholic hepatitis alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic steatohepatitis what does it mean and what isare the recommended available treatmentsAlcoholic hepatitis AH ranges from mild to severe injury and usually presents on the background of chronic liver disease.

one large trial showing no impact of corticosteroid therapy vs. placebo in patients with severe and nonsevere AH 24 and one trial demonstrating a significant benefit of pentoxifylline in severe AH 22 investi- gators in the United Kingdom conducted last year a very large trial in severe AH patients more than a thousand patients randomized within four arms placebocorticosteroidpentox- ifyllinecorticosteroid  pentoxifylline 25.

Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type I SPINK1 an acute-phase reactant protein produced by the liver increased in AH compared to alcoholic cirrhosis without AH is also the most significantly acute-phase protein upreg- ulated in improvers compared to nonimprovers in AH 30.

For this reason and to avoid prescribing corticos- teroids in patients who do not have histological ASH it is recommended to confirm ASH diagnosis in patients withRecent jaundice and liver function deterioration in an alcohol-drinking patientHistological coexistence of steatosis hepatocellular ballooning and neutrophil infiltration satellitosisMaddrey discriminant function  32Not severe ASHMaddrey discriminant function  32Severe ASHAlcohol withdrawalAlcohol withdrawalN-acetyl-cysteine 5 days Management of infections Nutritional support Prednisone 40 mgdayLong-term alcohol abstinenceGood responseContinue prednisone for 28 daysNull or poor response Stop prednisoneEvaluation of response to prednisolone by the Lille model at day 7 or day 4Figure 1 Definitions of alcoholic hepatitis alcoholic steatohepatitis and treatment algorithm.clinically suspected AH by a liver biopsy.

However a controversy exists on this topic while EASL guidelines rec- ommend to perform a liver biopsy in all severe AH patientsbefore specific therapy initiation 1 the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-funded Alcoholic Hepatitis Consortia suggests a liver biopsy confirmation of ASH only for patients with clinical AH presenting a possible confounding factor and classified as possible AH 4.

Indeed the clinical syndrome of AH may be due not only to ASH but also to decompensated chronic alcoholic cirrhosis without ASH to superimposed toxic hepatitis in alcoholic patients drug- induced liver injury to portal vein thrombosis or biliary stone migration to massive microvesicular steatosis or to infection Fig.

While nonsevere AH identified by a Maddrey score below 32 points usually responds to alcohol withdrawal severe AH Maddrey scoring 32 points or hepatic encephalopathy may lead to liver function deterioration despite alcohol abstinence.

Four larger trials are currently investigating the effect of GCSF in patients with AH NCT02776059 in combi- nation with NAC NCT02971306 or specifically in severe ASH or AH patients with null or partial response to corticosteroids NCT01820208 and NCT02442180 Table 1.Blockade of apoptosis and oxidative stress Hepatocyte cell death and subsequent loss of liver parenchyma constitute a major feature of ASH-inducing loss of liver func- tion and death.

Indeed metabolic steatosis due to overweight appears to potentiate the occurrence of AH in actively drinking patients but could also be deleterious for long-term outcomes in patients with a past episode of AH.Strategies for alcohol abstinenceDuring long-term follow-up 4 years alcohol abstinence has been identified as the only independent predictor of long-term survival in patients who were hospitalized for severe AH.
