Future directions include investigations as to whethergut microbiota produce melatonin and as to whether variations in melatonin synthesis are evident across specific microbiota species.night-time breast milk feeding modulates the devel- opment of the infant gut gut-brain axis and immune system.variations in maternal melatonin production and content in breast milk modulate the infant gut and the susceptibility to an array of childhood and adult medical conditions as well as childhood and adult cognitive ability.the addition of melatonin would bring formula feed closer to the benefits of breast milk.premature infants would further benefit from the addition of melatonin to all feeds.the addition of choline and melatonin to formula feed would have additive or synergistic benefits especially in premature infants.the addition of melatonin to formula feed might lower SIDS risk.melatonin in breast milk modulates not only the immune response but also the effector path- ways involving alterations in the levels of specific TRYCATs.the association of breast milk is mediated in part via the effects of melatonin and choline on depression susceptibility with the biological underpinnings of depression increasing the risk of a host of other medi- cal conditions.and how breast milk melatonin variations interact with the role of prenatal sleep disturbance linked to maternal stress depression and anxiety in the prena- tal period as well as postpartum depression require investigation.192 G. Anderson et al.

A number of different chemokines are evident in breast milk 63.A multitude of growth factors are also evident in breast milk including BDNF glial cell line-derived neuro- trophic factor GDNF and nerve growth factor NGF 64 which along with the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid DHA show altera- tions in the breast milk of women with preeclampsia 65.

Given the importance of the gut micro- biome to an array of childhood and adult-onset disorders 100 including metabolic dysregulation 101 night-time breast milk melatonin is likely to be of some importance to the etiology of a wide array of medical conditions includ- ing SIDS 7.Many of the breast milk components that have been modeled as underpinning breastfeeding's biological ben- efits are regulated by melatonin 102 and NAS 103 sug- gesting that maternal circadian melatonergic pathway activity will modulate the benefits of wider breast milk components.

Overall alterations in the regulation of the melatonergic pathway will have significant impacts on the constituents of breast milk and therefore in the regulation of the infant gut and immune system.Melatonin addition to formula feedThe role of melatonin in night-time breast milk and its influence on the other components of breast milk urgently requires further investigation including as to the role of the melatonergic pathways in the regulation of the infant gut and therefore on the developing gut-brain axis andG.

In this article the overlooked role of melatonin and the melatonergic pathways in breast milk and in the regula- tion of wider breast milk components are reviewed.

The inclusion of the melatonergic pathways in the biological interactions of breast milk and gut development has sig- nificant theoretical and treatment implications as well as being important to the prevention of a host of infant- child- and adult-onset medical conditions.Corresponding author George Anderson CRC Scotland  London Eccleston Square London SWIV 1PG UKail Cathy Vaillancourt INRS-Armand-Frappier Institute and Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Well-Being Health Society and Environment CINBIOSE Laval QC CanadaMichael Maes Deakin University Department of Psychiatry Geelong AustraliaRussel J.

Cabinian and colleagues showed that breast milk leukocyte survival in the suckling infant can occur with most breast milk lymphocytes predominantly T lymphocytes and cytotoxic T cells establishing them- selves in specific intestinal areas called Peyer's patches.

Overall the specific compo- sition of breast milk is of importance to later alterations in the gut-brain axis and immune system responses.Other aspects of breastfeeding may also be relevant for example some mothers with inactive secretor genes have altered human milk oligosaccharide composition and quantities in their breast milk.
