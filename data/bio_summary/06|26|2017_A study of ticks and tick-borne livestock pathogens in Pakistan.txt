a survey of spotted fever group rickettsia from 514 samples from the 13 different tick species generated rickettsial-specific amplicons in 1054 of total ticks tested.

a total of 514 individual ticks of different species were screened for pcr identification of the spotted fever rickettsia group sfgr.

all the raw sequences obtained were submitted to genbank under the pakistani tick microbiome bioproject prjna279069.spotted fever group of rickettsia sfgr detectionsfgr infections were detected using rickettsial outer membrane protein a rompa gene-spe- cific primers in a nested pcr assay .

all the data were generated at the university of southern mississippi and all the sequences generated by 16s rrna and spotted fever group rickettsia detection were deposited in respective public repositories.resultstick species identificationduring the ecological survey of the ruminants in pakistan a total of 3866 ticks belonging to 19 species were collected .

overall oxalobacteraceae staphylococcaceae clostridiaceae enterobacteriaceae coxiellaceae rickettsiaceae streptococcaceae and lactobacillaceae were the predominant families  .in the r. microplus ticks collected from cattle group 1 enterobacteriaceae was the most prev- alent bacterial family.
