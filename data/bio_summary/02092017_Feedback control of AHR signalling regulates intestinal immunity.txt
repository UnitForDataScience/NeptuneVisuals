ficz did not decay in cultures of ahr-deficient th17 cells due to absence of cyp1a1 induction but cultures of r26cyp1a1 th17 cells showed accelerated clearance of ficz compared with those from wt th17 cells fig.1b.furthermore th17 cells generated from r26cyp1a1 mice produced less il-22 to baseline ahr ligands present in culture medium12 and to low but not higher ficz concentrations fig.1c and extended data fig.2.

3c.in contrast mice with constitutive cyp1a1 expression restricted to adaptive immune cells via rag1-cre rag1cyp1a1 had normal numbers of ilc3 under steady state conditions fig.3c and extended data fig.1b.this suggests that constitutive cyp1a1 activity in iecs but not in adaptive immune cells restricts the availability of ahr ligands to cells in the intestinal lamina propria resulting in loss of ahr ligand-dependent ilc3.upon infection with c. rodentium ieccyp1a1 mice rapidly succumbed fig.

these were crossed with villin-cre mice to generate the ieccyp1a1 strain constitutive cyp1a1 expression specific to intestinal epithelial cells and rag1-cre mice to generate the rag1cyp1a1 strain constitutive cyp1a1 expression specific to t and b cells.to generate the cyp1a1 reporter strain cyp1a1cre mice20 with targeted insertion of cre recombinase in the murine cyp1a1 locus were crossed with r26reyfp mice27expressing eyfp from the ubiquitous rosa26 promoter downstream of a cassette containing a loxp-schiering et al.page 6flanked transcriptional stop element.

constitutive expression of cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted specifically to intestinal epithelial cells iecs resulted in loss of ahr-dependent type 3 innate lymphoid cells ilc3 and t helper 17 th17 cells and increased susceptibility to enteric infection.

thus constitutive cyp1a1 activity decreased ahr ligands and compromised il-22 production.ahr deficiency in haematopoietic cells causes the disappearance of intraepithelial lymphocytes13 and innate lymphoid cells ilc3 in the intestinal immune system 14-16. r26cyp1a1 mice exhibited enhanced intestinal cyp1a1 enzyme activity extended data fig.

th17 cells from cyp1 knockout mice failed to metabolise ficz and showed increased cyp1a1 expression as well as enhanced il-22 production in the absence of added ahr ligands with reduced histopathology scores and bacterial burdens upon infection extended data fig.6.increased ligand availability in cyp1-deficient mice was visualized in a cyp1a1 fate-reporter mouse that reports ahr activity via induction of an eyfp reporter activated via targeted insertion of cre recombinase in the murine cyp1a1 locus20.

given that environmental factors such as oxidative stress chemical pollutants and dietary factors modulate cyp1 enzyme activity26 interference with cyp1-mediated ahr ligand degradation has potential consequences for ahr pathway activation and intestinal homeostasis.our finding that the intestinal pathology resulting from constitutive cyp1a1 could be counter-balanced by increasing the intake of ahr ligands in the diet suggests that dysregulated cyp1a1 activity is potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation via dietary supplementation.online material and methodsmicefor the generation of a constitutively active as well as an inducible cyp1a1 allele the coding sequence cds of cyp1a1 was linked to the cds of rat thy1 using a 2a sequence.

th17 cells generated from r26cyp1a1 mice had increased cyp1a1 enzymatic activity compared with wild-type b6 wt or ahr-deficient th17 cells fig.1a.

thus constitutive cyp1a1 activity in iecs reduced the availability of ahr ligands in the body causing theschiering et al.page 5decay of intestinal immune cells such as ilc3 that depend on ahr signals for survival and impairment of the adaptive il-22 response upon infection with intestinal pathogens.conversely lack of cyp1a1-mediated metabolism confined to iecs had the opposite effect increasing protection against intestinal infection.as previously shown in an in vitro setting inhibition of cyp1a1 results in a boost to ahr pathway activation due to increased availability of ahr ligand ficz26.

the targeting vector did not contain any artificial promoter for the expression of both cyp1a1 and rat thy1 to avoid toxicity caused by cyp1a1 overexpression details of the gene targeting and rosa26-targeting strategy extended data figure 1. the targeting vector was generated by biocytogen and used to establish r26cyp1a1-neor mice by homologous recombination in bcgen b61-6 c57bl6 embryonic stem cells.

in contrast enhanced ahr ligand degradation in iecs deprives ilc3 as well as t cells of ahr stimulation thereby causing a more severe deficiency in immune defence against c. rodentium.next we investigated whether lack of ahr ligand metabolism in non-haematopoietic cells affects the immune response to c. rodentium infection.
