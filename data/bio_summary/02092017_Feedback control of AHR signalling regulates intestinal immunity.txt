FICZ did not decay in cultures of Ahr-deficient Th17 cells due to absence of CYP1A1 induction but cultures of R26Cyp1a1 Th17 cells showed accelerated clearance of FICZ compared with those from WT Th17 cells Fig.1b.Furthermore Th17 cells generated from R26Cyp1a1 mice produced less IL-22 to baseline AHR ligands present in culture medium12 and to low but not higher FICZ concentrations Fig.1c and Extended Data Fig.2.

Constitutive expression of Cyp1a1 throughout the body or restricted specifically to intestinal epithelial cells IECs resulted in loss of AHR-dependent type 3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3 and T helper 17 Th17 cells and increased susceptibility to enteric infection.

3c.In contrast mice with constitutive Cyp1a1 expression restricted to adaptive immune cells via Rag1-Cre Rag1Cyp1a1 had normal numbers of ILC3 under steady state conditions Fig.3c and Extended Data Fig.1b.This suggests that constitutive CYP1A1 activity in IECs but not in adaptive immune cells restricts the availability of AHR ligands to cells in the intestinal lamina propria resulting in loss of AHR ligand-dependent ILC3.Upon infection with C. rodentium IECCyp1a1 mice rapidly succumbed Fig.

Th17 cells generated from R26Cyp1a1 mice had increased CYP1A1 enzymatic activity compared with wild-type B6 WT or Ahr-deficient Th17 cells Fig.1a.

Thus constitutive CYP1A1 activity decreased AHR ligands and compromised IL-22 production.Ahr deficiency in haematopoietic cells causes the disappearance of intraepithelial lymphocytes13 and innate lymphoid cells ILC3 in the intestinal immune system 14-16.

In contrast enhanced AHR ligand degradation in IECs deprives ILC3 as well as T cells of AHR stimulation thereby causing a more severe deficiency in immune defence against C. rodentium.Next we investigated whether lack of AHR ligand metabolism in non-haematopoietic cells affects the immune response to C. rodentium infection.

As proof of principle we investigated the effect of constitutive Cyp1a1 expression on Th17 cells which express AHR and produceIL-22 in an AHR-dependent manner11.

CD4 T cells from WT Ahr-deficient or R26Cyp1a1 mice were cultured under Th17 cell conditions in the presence of the endogenous tryptophan-derived AHR ligand 6-formylindolo32-bcarbazole FICZ and residual cellular FICZ levels following metabolic clearance were determined.

Ahr-deficient Th17 cells did not produce IL-22 under any condition Fig.1c.
