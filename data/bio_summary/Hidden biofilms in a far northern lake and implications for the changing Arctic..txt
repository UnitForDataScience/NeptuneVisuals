There is presently no summer bedfast ice in the lake and therefore no benthic sites that remain frozen throughout the year.Large changes in ice cover have already been observed throughout the Arctic with fewer lakes freezing to the bottom as the thickness of winter ice decreases.WHL lost its ice cover on two occasions in recent yearsand a shift from multi-year ice to full ice-out conditions in summer could expand the habitat for communities that remain active during winter.

We found a high proportion of active OTUs in both communities with the rRNA OTUs accounting for 72-88  of1Departement de biologie  Centre d'etudes nordiques CEN Universite Laval Quebec QC G1V 0A6 Canada 2Departement de biochimie de microbiologie et de bio- informatique  Centre d'etudes nordiques CEN Universite Laval Quebec QC G1V 0A6 Canada 3Institut de biologie integrative et des systemes IBIS Universite Laval Quebec QC G1V 0A6 Canada 4Takuvik Unite Mixte Internationale UMI 3376 Universite Laval Canada  Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique France Quebec QC GIV 0A6 Canada and 5Centre Eau Terre Environnement Institut national de la recherche scientifique INRS Centre d'etudes nordiques CEN Quebec QC G1K 9A9 Canada Correspondence Warwick F.

Diatoms also tend to be abundant in Antarctic lake mats found under perennial ice cover and are known to tolerate a range of light conditions with a potential for heterotrophic growth when light becomes limiting.In contrast heterotrophic ciliates were the dominant microbial eukaryotes in the moat mats suggesting a more active microbial food web and dominance of heterotrophy with ciliates grazing on other eukaryotes and bacteria.

It was assumed that benthic communities were restricted to this moat area because earlier ice coring in the central part of the lake had recorded 3.5-4.3 m of ice that extended to the lake bed.

In 2014 an extensive benthic biofilm was discovered in this deep perennially ice-covered zone of WHL SupplementaryVideo 1 and was sampled the following year.We hypothesized that the deep biofilm communities of WHL would have a lower alpha-diversity than the moat biofilms because they would be dominated by microbial specialists that were adapted to a low solar energy regime caused by the thick perennial ice combined with low nutrient conditions in this oligotrophic lake.

In contrast to the deep zone of the lake that does not freeze to theMicrobiomes in the changing Arctic V Mohit et al.3Fig.
