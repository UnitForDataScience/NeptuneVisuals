These differences were visualized by hierarchical cluster analysis Figure 1A which demon- strated the global metabolic shifts in 16-week-old HLA- B27b2m-transgenic animals in addition to more moder- ate changes in 6-week-old animals before disease.To further examine metabolic shifts driven by HLA-B27 expression we also performed pathway enrichment analysis 15 to identify biochemical path- ways that were strongly influenced by HLA-B27 expres- sion Figures 1B and C. Notably HLA-B27 expression impacted metabolites involved in numerous biochemical pathways including those associated with amino acid carbohydrate lipid and xenobiotic metabolism.

B-D Levels of mucus metabolites B dietary metabolites and inflammatory metabolites C and primary and secondary bile acid metabolites D in 16-week-old animals for findings in 6-week-old animals see Supplementary Figure 2 available on the Arthritis  Rheumatology web site at t. Values are the mean 6 SEM n 5 8 rats per group.

To establish the impact of HLA-B27 expression on the intestinal metabolome we performed metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from HLA-B27b2m-transgenic rats and WT controls at age 6 weeks and at age 16 weeks representing animals before disease and those with established disease respec- tively.

Interestingly however while N- acetylmuramate and tyrosine were elevated at 6 weeks in HLA-B27b2m-transgenic animals they were significantly decreased once disease was established at 16 weeks see Supplementary Figure 2.Our subsequent analysis focused on the 16-weekdata set which had a large number of individual metabolites that were significantly impacted by HLA- B27 expression see Supplementary Table 1 available at .

Taken together the liberation of mucus components and the decrease in some plant-derived metabolites but with increased precursors may indicate markedly shifted metabolic function by theintestinal microbiota in HLA-B27b2m-transgenic animals.We also found a number of metabolites indica- tive of an active inflammatory response that were signifi- cantly up-regulated in intestinal contents of HLA-B27 b2m-transgenic animals.

In light of the large number of metabolites detected in our screen of cecal contents and given our relatively restricted sample size n 5 8 animals per genotype per age group we were unable to identify any individual metabolites that exhibited differential abundance in 6-week-old animals that attained statistical significance when we adjusted stringently for multiple comparisons across the entire data set.

For instance at 6 weeks before disease valerate was significantly increased in HLA-B27b2m-transgenic animals versus controls although levels of valerate were significantly lower in HLA-B27b2m-transgenic animals than in controls at the 16-week time point Figure 3B.

Taken together these find- ings further indicate that HLA-B27 expression broadly impacts the levels of microbially derived metabolites in the gut.Association of HLA-B27 expression with altered levels of MCFAs and SCFAs.

In light of the benefi- cial effects of propionate on HLA-B27-associated inflam- matory disease despite the observation that this specific metabolite was not depleted in unmanipulated HLA- B27b2m-transgenic animals versus healthy controls Fig- ure 3 we hypothesized that HLA-B27 expression may alter host expression of SCFA receptors instead and hence disrupt this homeostatic feedback loop.

Of note HLA-B27 misfolding triggers an unfolded protein response which may be up-regulated in the HLA-B27b2m-transgenic rat and is intimately related to oxidative stress responses 2930.Beyondaminoacidmetaboliteswealsoobserved altered levels of other biochemical classes even in animals before disease.
