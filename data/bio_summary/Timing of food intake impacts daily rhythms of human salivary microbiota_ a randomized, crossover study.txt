Participants were not allowed to eat or drink any food or beverage 1 h before the saliva sampling.Salivary samples were collected and extracted from d 0 baseline before starting the food timing intervention d 7 one wk after exposure to either the EE or LE intervention d 14 washout 1 wk after following their habitual food timing and d 21 one wk after exposure to the other food timing intervention.

However to our knowledge no interventional studies have been published in humans showing the impact of changes in the timing of food intake on digestive tract microbiota.The purpose of our study was to fill this gap in knowl- edge by determining the effect of the timing of food intake on human digestive tract microbiota saliva and feces.

Although food timing condition was not a significant factor both time of day and its interaction with food timing condition were significant factors for a diversity at many taxonomic levels Fig.

In our late food timing condition we found higher microbial diversity during the middle of the day as compared with the early food timing condition in salivary microbiota.

Nevertheless fur- ther food timing interventional studies in obese and diabetic subjects are needed to confirm these results.In addition food timing affected salivary microbiota diurnal rhythms in individual bacterial taxa.

Al- though our study provides information on the effect of timing of food intake on the microbiota further re- search is needed to explore the complex and dynamic interrelation between food timing daily rhythms in microbiota composition and health.

Despite these limitations our results indicate that food timing affects salivary microbial diversity and to a lesser extent the structure of the salivary microbial community composition.The impact of these food timing-derived changes inthe daily rhythm of salivary microbiota on the host's metabolism should be further explored in future stud- ies.

The timing of food intake was fixed during the whole intervention and was at 0830 h for breakfast and 2100 h for dinner participants were not allowed to eat be- tween meals and were instructed to follow their habitual sleep patterns which were required to be the same during both meal timing intervention weeks.Anthropometric measurementsBody weight was determined in barefooted participants wearing light clothes with a digital scale accurate to thenearest 0.1 kg.

However whether the timing of food consumption when we eat influences microbiota in humans is unknown.

A ran- domized crossover study was performed in 10 healthy normal-weight young women to test the effect of the timing of food intake on the human microbiota in the saliva and fecal samples.
