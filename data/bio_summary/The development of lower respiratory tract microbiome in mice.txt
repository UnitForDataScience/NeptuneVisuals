Systematic assessment of the role of the lung microbiome in disease manifestation and its control could improve our understanding about the relevance of lung microbiome in respiratory diseases.Current understanding of the lung microbiome has primarily arisen through analysis of microbial communities recovered in sputum samples aspirations from intubation tracheal aspirates sterile brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage samples.

Furthermore evidence emerging from animal models suggests that the lung microbiome can be manipulated through inhalation of desired microbes to improve the outcome of harmful pulmonary infections Although a few studies have utilized mice models to implicate the role of microbiome in lung pathologies  one of the major unanswered questions in the field of pulmonology is whether the manipulation of the lung microbiome can be utilized to alleviate pulmonary pathologies.Exposure to a variety of microbes during the early agesof development has been associated with higher tolerance for common allergens and a lower risk of developingimmune-related diseases such as asthma at a later stage 2-.

Sev- eral rigorous analyses were performed to conclude the relationship between the lung microbiome and the age of mice.This study is different from other studies where the in- fluence of the gut microbiome on lung immunity or lung diseases has been addressed In this study we have tracked the changes in the lung microbiome with the growth.

Due to this prevailing view Correspondence  1Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of MicrobialTechnology Sector 39 A Chandigarh 160036 IndiaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articleexploration of the lung microbiome was not included in the human microbiome project However this para- digm has been contested using culture-independent methods via next-generation sequencing of the highly conserved 16S ribosomal RNA 16S rRNA gene marker These culture-independent methods have shown that the lower respiratory tract of healthy humans har- bors a diverse microbial community The microbial community residing in the lungs undergoes significant changes in terms of composition and diversity in a num- ber of pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis- ease COPD It is also speculated that changes in composition and diversity of the lower respiratory tract may determine pre-disposition and severity towards lungc The Authors.

Further- more differences in microbiome composition were ob- served between bronchoalveolar lavage samples and dissected lung tissues of mice Thus more work is re- quired to establish the role of diversity and composition of the lower respiratory microbiome and their association with the pulmonary pathologies.

In fact the National Institutes of Health NIH has recommended development of animal models to study the mechanistic aspects observed in human studies of host pulmonary interactions with the lung microbiome  Such animal models have been extensively used to under- stand the physiological aspects associated with the gut microbiome 17.

It can be hypothesized that the lung microbiome develops quite earlier in life and that microbiome may guide the development of the immune system.

A better understanding of microbiome development in- side the lung could be established using animal models and such knowledge may further our understanding of the effects of the lung microbiome on lung diseases.

These data appear to show that the mice lung microbiome shares partial similarity to the human lung microbiome while harboring many other genera.

However there could be many other con- founding factors that could influence the lung micro- biome including antibiotics feed type and stress as seen in the gut microbiome In summary using deep sequencing we have tracked the changes associated with the lung microbiome at different ages from 1-week- old mice to adult age.
