in fact the national institutes of health nih has recommended development of animal models to study the mechanistic aspects observed in human studies of host pulmonary interactions with the lung microbiome  such animal models have been extensively used to under- stand the physiological aspects associated with the gut microbiome 17. furthermore evidence emerging from animal models suggests that the lung microbiome can be manipulated through inhalation of desired microbes to improve the outcome of harmful pulmonary infections although a few studies have utilized mice models to implicate the role of microbiome in lung pathologies  one of the major unanswered questions in the field of pulmonology is whether the manipulation of the lung microbiome can be utilized to alleviate pulmonary pathologies.exposure to a variety of microbes during the early agesof development has been associated with higher tolerance for common allergens and a lower risk of developingimmune-related diseases such as asthma at a later stage 2-. it can be hypothesized that the lung microbiome develops quite earlier in life and that microbiome may guide the development of the immune system.

systematic assessment of the role of the lung microbiome in disease manifestation and its control could improve our understanding about the relevance of lung microbiome in respiratory diseases.current understanding of the lung microbiome has primarily arisen through analysis of microbial communities recovered in sputum samples aspirations from intubation tracheal aspirates sterile brushings and bronchoalveolar lavage samples.

sev- eral rigorous analyses were performed to conclude the relationship between the lung microbiome and the age of mice.this study is different from other studies where the in- fluence of the gut microbiome on lung immunity or lung diseases has been addressed in this study we have tracked the changes in the lung microbiome with the growth.

further- more differences in microbiome composition were ob- served between bronchoalveolar lavage samples and dissected lung tissues of mice thus more work is re- quired to establish the role of diversity and composition of the lower respiratory microbiome and their association with the pulmonary pathologies.

a better understanding of microbiome development in- side the lung could be established using animal models and such knowledge may further our understanding of the effects of the lung microbiome on lung diseases.

these data appear to show that the mice lung microbiome shares partial similarity to the human lung microbiome while harboring many other genera.

however there could be many other con- founding factors that could influence the lung micro- biome including antibiotics feed type and stress as seen in the gut microbiome in summary using deep sequencing we have tracked the changes associated with the lung microbiome at different ages from 1-week- old mice to adult age.

by 6 weeks of age a considerable higher diversity in the composition of lung microbiome is achieved and main- tained thereafter to adulthood.methodsexperimental designthe primary goal of this study is to understand the changes in composition of microbiome of the lung during the growth of mice.

although such assessments of composition and diversity of the lower respiratory tract microbiome are valuable they are limited by potential contamination with microbial flora from the mouth and upper respiratory tract.

several studies have reported that the microbiome of the lower respiratory tract is different from that of the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity   however it must be noted that in humans the main route of passage of bacteria into the lower respiratory tract are microaspira- tions from the oral cavity with oral commensals and the upper respiratory tract  and it remains to be under- stood as to why only a few selected bacteria can settle down and enrich in the lower respiratory tract.

therefore small animal models may be utilized for establishing the lung microbiome.

in these models it is possible to physically separate the lower respiratory tract from the upper respiratory tract thereby allowing for inves- tigation of the contribution of the lung microbiome in lung physiology.

furthermore the lung microbiome also de- pends on environmental factors such as geographical loca- tion presence of animals or pets and presence of dust  .
