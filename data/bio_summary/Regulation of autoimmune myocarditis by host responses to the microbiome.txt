After in- ducing EAM we did not observe a substantive difference in the severity of EAM in BALBcJ and BALBcByJ animals Supplemental Fig.

By multiplex interrogation of cardiac homogenates at day 21 of EAM we observed greater expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL1b and IL6 as well as the myelotropic chemokines and growth factors CCL2 MCP1 CXCL1KC CXCL2MIP2 and G-CSF in BALBcJ mice a.Many of these cytokines are well-known canonical transcriptional targets of IL17 signaling .We also examined the infiltration of Th17 cells into the hearts ofanimals with respect to microbiome profiles and EAM susceptibility.

These data indicate that colonization with SFB elicits a Th17-centered defense program in the mouse hindgut.JAX BALBcJ animals develop more severe myocarditis than Taconic BALBcAnNTac miceThese findings predicted that SFB-positive animals sourced from Taconic would be more susceptible to EAM consistent with findings in other Th17-driven autoimmune disease mouse models  .

Primed myocarditogenic CD4 T cells were transferred into lymphopenic RAG2-- or RAG2--gc-- animals d the latter of which demonstrate a clear defect in in- nate lymphoid cell development e. As with the mAb depletion strategy fewer inflammatory leukocytes were found in the hearts of RAG2--gc-- mice following transfer including neutrophils and CD4 T cells f. Together these data supported an important role for the ILC lineages in governing the chemotactic recruitment of leu- kocytes to the inflamed heart.To address a possible role for ILCs in the priming of autoaggressivemyocarditogenic T cells we switched from active AT-EAM to a parking model CD4 T cells were transferred from naive donors into lymphopenic RAG knockout animals prior to the induction of EAM.

Therefore we sought to examine the depen- dence of CCL20CCR6-driven chemotactic recruitment in our experi- mental models of microbiome and ILC regulation of myocarditis.Our data above demonstrate fewer RORgt Th17 cells infiltrating the hearts of antibiotic-treated animals at the peak of EAM d. More comprehensive analysis indicated other CCR6-expressing lym- phoid populations including gd T cells and ILC3s were also less nu- merous in the hearts of dysbiotic animals a. Assessing the ex- pression of CCR6 on heart-infiltrating cells further demonstrated diminution of CCR6-expressing RORgt Th17 cells following antibiotic treatment b.

At the peak of EAM cardiac histopathology enlargement and inflammatory infiltra- tion were significantly diminished in animals treated with antibiotics a-b.

To our surprise at day 21 of EAM we observed more severe cardiac histopathology in BALBcJ animals a in contrast to their ne- gative SFB status.

Antibiotic treatment exerted no effect on the development of EAM in IL17RA-- mice  whereas dysbiosis protected highly Th17-de- viated IFNg-- animals from maladaptive cardiac remodeling heart failure and death .This conceptual disparity could be resolved by examining cells and pathways epistatically peripheral to the Th17 program - a cell type other than a CD4 T cell that still contributed to Th17 responses.
