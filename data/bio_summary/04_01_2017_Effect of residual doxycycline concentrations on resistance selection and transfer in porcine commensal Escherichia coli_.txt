preparation of the competition cultures was done as in experi- ment type 1. appropriate 10-fold dilutions were now plated on mc with dox 8 mgl to count the donor strain with rif 80 mgl to count the recipient total count and with dox 8 mgl  rif 80 mgl to count transconjugants dox-resistant recipient.

however the transfer frequency of pec292 was significantly higher at 1 mgl dox than at 0 p  0.009 and 4 mgl dox p  0.001 when ec 400rif was used as recipient and significantly higher at 1 and 4 mgl both p  0.02 than in blank lb in case of recipient strain ec 588rif.lc-msms analysis showed that the recovery of dox in lb at con- centrations of 1 and 4 mgl ranged from 65 to 76 of the initial concentration after 48 h of incubation at 37 degc table s2.discussioncharacterisation of the teta-carrying plasmids indicated that all three plasmids had well conserved backbones that circulate between e. coli strains from different hosts such as human poultry and pigs figure s2 and s3.

the lower transfer frequency to recipient ec 400rif at 4 mgl than at 1 mgl may be explained by the lower fitness of ec 400rif at 4 mgl than 1 mgl dox.

different concentrations of dox in the medium dox 0  0 mgl dox 1  1 mgl dox 4  4 mgl and sampling time points 24 h 48 h are indicated on the x-axis.

ratios of resistant to susceptible bacteria were significantly higher at 1 and 4 mgl dox com- pared with the blank control but there was no significant difference between 1 and 4 mgl.

plasmid transfer frequencies were affected by 1 or 4 mgl dox in the medium for only one of the resistance plasmids.in conclusion dox concentrations of 1 and 4 mgl can select for resistant e. coli in vitro.

such resistant bacteria can spread to the human gut via different routes where they could transfer their resistance genes to human commensals and patho- gens .the aim of the present study was to investigate the selective pres- sure on dox-resistant e. coli of dox at 4 mgl and 1 mgl which corresponds to intestinal dox concentrations caused by a cross- contamination level of the feed of approximately 3 and 1 respectively.

transconjugants were obtained as follows conjugation experiments with as acceptor a rifampicin rif-resistant e. coli lab strain j5rif were performed overnight in lb at 37 degc with a donorrecipient ratio of 15. transconjugants were grown selectively on macconkey ndeg3 agar mc oxoid ltd basingstoke uk with 8 mgl dox and 80 mgl rif both from sigma-aldrich bornem belgium.d determined by the broth microdilution method according to the clsi document m07-a10.e presence of common tetracycline resistance genes teta tetb tetc tetd and tetg was verified by pcr assays .resultscharacterisation of bacterial strainsthe characteristics of the lactose-negative mutants of dox- resistant porcine e. coli strains ec 682 ec 202 and ec 292 are shown in .

all suscepti- ble strains showed a lower growth rate at 1 and 4 mgl dox than at 0 mgl dox.

growth rates of resistant strains ec 202 and ec 292 were hardly affected by 1 or 4 mgl dox while 4 mgl dox reduced the growth rate of ec 682 by 0.0037 min-1 figure s1.genetic mapping of teta-carrying plasmidsreplicon typing showed that plasmids pec682 pec202 and pec292 belonged to the inci1 incfii and incfii-fib groups respec- tively.

a previous study showed that a 3 carry-over level of doxycycline dox in the feed results in porcine faecal concentra- tions of approximately 4 mgl.the aim of this study was to determine the effect of residual dox concentrations 1 and 4 mgl in vitro on selection of dox-resistant porcine commensal escherichia coli and transfer of their resistance plasmids.three different dox-resistant porcine commensal e. coli strains and their plasmids were characterised.

these strains were each brought in competition with a susceptible strain in a medium containing 0 1 and 4 mgl dox.

these strains were characterised using standard methods .from the same collection three e. coli strains ec 298 ec 400 ec 588 susceptible to all antimicrobials tested were selected as re- cipient strains and to compete with the donor strains.as bacterial fitness plays a major role in competition between strains bacterial growth curves were set up for each strain separately in three different conditions 0 1 and 4 mgl dox using an automated microbiology growth curve analysis system figure s1.conjugation experiments and plasmid analysisthe mobility of the dox resistance-conferring plasmids doxr plasmids in the selected donor strains was first verified using stan- dard conjugation experiments under blank conditions as described previously recipient e. coli j5rif .

to be able to distinguish donor strains from recipient strainsred colonies in mixed cultures on macconkey ndeg3 agar mc non- lactose fermenting mutants white colonies of the donor strains were selected .experiment type 1. the three donor strains and one of the re- cipient strains conjugating strain ec 400 or non-conjugating strain ec 298 were grown separately overnight in miller's lb broth lb at 37 degc on a horizontal shaker ika ks 260 basic ika-werke gmbh  co. kg staufen germany and then mixed in a 11000 ratio donor recipient in three different tubes with lb with a final volume of 30 ml and a final concentration of 0 1 and 4 mgl dox respec- tively.

after 24 h and 48 h of incubation 1 ml was taken from each tube and appropriate dilutions were plated in duplicate on mc with and without 8 mgl dox and incubated overnight at 37 degc.
