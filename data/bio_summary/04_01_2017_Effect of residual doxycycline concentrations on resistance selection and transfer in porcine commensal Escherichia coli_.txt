Appropriate 10-fold dilutions were now plated on MC with DOX 8 mgL to count the donor strain with RIF 80 mgL to count the recipient total count and with DOX 8 mgL  RIF 80 mgL to count transconjugants DOX-resistant recipient.

However the transfer frequency of pEC292 was significantly higher at 1 mgL DOX than at 0 P  0.009 and 4 mgL DOX P  0.001 when EC 400RIF was used as recipient and significantly higher at 1 and 4 mgL both P  0.02 than in blank LB in case of recipient strain EC 588RIF.LC-MSMS analysis showed that the recovery of DOX in LB at con- centrations of 1 and 4 mgL ranged from 65 to 76 of the initial concentration after 48 h of incubation at 37 degC Table S2.DiscussionCharacterisation of the tetA-carrying plasmids indicated that all three plasmids had well conserved backbones that circulate between E. coli strains from different hosts such as human poultry and pigs Figure S2 and S3.

The lower transfer frequency to recipient EC 400RIF at 4 mgL than at 1 mgL may be explained by the lower fitness of EC 400RIF at 4 mgL than 1 mgL DOX.

Different concentrations of DOX in the medium DOX 0  0 mgL DOX 1  1 mgL DOX 4  4 mgL and sampling time points 24 h 48 h are indicated on the x-axis.

Ratios of resistant to susceptible bacteria were significantly higher at 1 and 4 mgL DOX com- pared with the blank control but there was no significant difference between 1 and 4 mgL.

Plasmid transfer frequencies were affected by 1 or 4 mgL DOX in the medium for only one of the resistance plasmids.In conclusion DOX concentrations of 1 and 4 mgL can select for resistant E. coli in vitro.

Such resistant bacteria can spread to the human gut via different routes where they could transfer their resistance genes to human commensals and patho- gens .The aim of the present study was to investigate the selective pres- sure on DOX-resistant E. coli of DOX at 4 mgL and 1 mgL which corresponds to intestinal DOX concentrations caused by a cross- contamination level of the feed of approximately 3 and 1 respectively.

Transconjugants were grown selectively on MacConkey ndeg3 agar MC Oxoid Ltd Basingstoke UK with 8 mgL DOX and 80 mgL RIF both from Sigma-Aldrich Bornem Belgium.d Determined by the broth microdilution method according to the CLSI document M07-A10.e Presence of common tetracycline resistance genes tetA tetB tetC tetD and tetG was verified by PCR assays .ResultsCharacterisation of bacterial strainsThe characteristics of the lactose-negative mutants of DOX- resistant porcine E. coli strains EC 682 EC 202 and EC 292 are shown in .

All suscepti- ble strains showed a lower growth rate at 1 and 4 mgL DOX than at 0 mgL DOX.

Growth rates of resistant strains EC 202 and EC 292 were hardly affected by 1 or 4 mgL DOX while 4 mgL DOX reduced the growth rate of EC 682 by 0.0037 min-1 Figure S1.Genetic mapping of tetA-carrying plasmidsReplicon typing showed that plasmids pEC682 pEC202 and pEC292 belonged to the IncI1 IncFII and IncFII-FIB groups respec- tively.
