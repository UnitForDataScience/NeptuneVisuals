Although C. amycolatum is a normal inhabitant of human skin there is increasing evidence that C. amycolatum has the capacity to act as an opportunistic pathogen causing skin and soft tissue infections.C.

RNase 7 exhibits antimicrobial activity against C. amycolatum and C. xerosis.

a C. amycolatum and b C. xerosis were incubated with the indicated concentrations of RNase 7 in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 BHI and 0.05 BSA.

.RNase 7 exhibits antimicrobial activity against C. amycolatum and C. xerosis.

To determine whether RNase 7 is able to restrict the growth of corynebacteria we incubated C. amycolatum and C. xero- sis with different concentrations of RNase 7 in a microdilution assay for 3 h. As shown in Fig.

RNase 7 dose-dependently inhibited the growth of C. amycolatum and C. xerosis.

indicating that the ribonuclease activity of RNase 7 is not crucial for its antibacterial activity against C. amycolatum.RNase 7 contributes to the antimicrobial activity of human stratum corneum against C. amy- colatum.

RNase 7 contributes to the antimicrobial activity of human stratum corneum against C. amycolatum.a To test the neutralizing activity of the RNase 7 antibody C. amycolatum was incubated for 3 h at 37 degC with RNase 7 1 ugml R7 together with a specific RNase 7 neutralizing antibody R7  R7-Ab.

Our data show that RNase 7 exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against C. amycolatum and C. xerosis.

Here we show that keratinocytes are able to detect the presence of C. amycolatum leading to the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR-dependent induction of the antimicrobial protein RNase 7.
