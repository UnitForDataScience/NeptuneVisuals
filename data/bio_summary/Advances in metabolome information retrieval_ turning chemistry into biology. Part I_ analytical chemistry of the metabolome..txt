hematocrit and blood volume effects may signif- icantly impact quantitative results timmerman et al .of note most metabolomics studies particularly in clinical metabolomics include data from a single biofluid most often blood or urine.

different data-driven ap- proaches have been described for handling these issues by using metabolomics data modeling do et al  torell et al .sample preparationfor untargeted metabolomics minimal sample preparation is generally recommended to avoid metabolite loss.

metabolomics or meta- bolic phenotyping is a well-established omics aimed at com- prehensively assessing metabolites in biological systems.

metabolomics holistically evaluates biological systems in an unbiased data-driven ap- proach that may ultimately support generation of hypotheses.

metabolomics workflows are based on whether the investiga- tor knows a priori what kind of metabolites to assess.

thus a targeted metabolomics approach is defined as a quantitative analysis absolute concentrations are determined or a semi- quantitative analysis relative intensities are determined of a set of metabolites that are possibly linked to common chemi- cal classes or a selected metabolic pathway.

conceptually metabolomics has its roots in the practices of ancient greek doctors who used the organ- oleptic characteristics of urine for diagnosis for example urine sweetness reveals the high glucose levels in diabetes.

thus metabolomics is one of the bomic technologies.

metabolomics has found different applications in many disease studies and in complex diseases with promising perspectives in screening diagnosis progno- sis patient stratification and treatment follow-up bekri  tebani et al  .
