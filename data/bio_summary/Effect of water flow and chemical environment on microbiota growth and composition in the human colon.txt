This effect is modeled by the term ecdc pHTh which includes the observed membrane permeability and the pH- dependent dissociation of CO2 into bicarbonate and protons.Finally local pH is obtained from the local SCFA and carbonate concen- trations pH x t  W s c SI Appendix Eq.

In short pH follows observed buffer behavior of the luminal fluid and a self-consistent solution of the dissociation dynamics For lower pH the buffer components in themarized in SI Appendix Tables S1 and S2.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

2C In a recent in vitro study 11 it has been shown that hydrodynamic mixing in combination with bacterial growth allows maintenance of stable bacterial populations even for high flow rates here we discuss the situation in the human gut in SI Appendix Fig.

This in turn leads to a local drop in pH affecting bacterial growth 12 13.To quantitatively understand this pH change and its influence on bacterial growth physiology in the gut we first conducted controlled experiments with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Bt and Eubacterium rectale Er as members of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes respectively.

These findings clearly illustrate the importance of understanding spatial bacterial growth dynamics in the colon Fecal microbiota compo- sition is a consequence of bacterial growth in the proximal colon.To predict how changes in bacterial and host physiology may affect microbiota composition we performed a sensitivity analysis for a number of physiologically relevant parameters see SI Ap- pendix Table S4 for a comprehensive list of parameters.

Both of these effects lead to a drop in pH and thus via the differential pH feedback on bacterial growth to an advantage for Firmicutes.We have shown that detailed and quantitative data on human and bacterial physiology can be used to understand their interac- tions leading to mechanistic insights into main factors shaping the composition of microbiota in the gut.

We further characterized the rates of bacterial growth carbohydrate consumption and fermentation product excretion for representatives of the two dominant bacteria phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes that typically make up more than 90 of the bacterial cells observed in the gut 6.Combining these aspects of human and bacterial physiology into a coarse-grained mathematical model allowed us to study bacterial growth dynamics in the human gut.
