we found that 24 h of dcf treatment induces high levels of o - in a dose-dependent manner as evident from the fluorescent sensor mitosox red d.to determine whether cell proliferation was influenced by dcf we incubated hsi in media containing edu either 500 or 1000 mm dcf or vehicle control.

there was a significant decrease in dteer when monolayers were treated with 1000 or 2000 mm dcf for 24 h compared to control p  0.02 b whereas 200 or 500 mm dcf did not appre- ciably alter the teer compared to control p  0.6. ly apparent permeability papp in monolayers that were untreated or treated with 200 mm dcf for 24 h was 2.8 - 1.16 x10-7 cm s-1 and2.28 - 2.56 x10-7 cm s-1 respectively.

it has been proposed that dcf and other nsaids inflict mitochondrial damage by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation increasing reactive oxygen species ros diminishing atp production thereby reducing cell via- bility.thus we used mitotracker red cmh2-xros abbre- viated as cmh2-xros to assess the impact of dcf on mito- chondrial potential.

additionally dcf diminished replicative potential as seen by the reduced number of edu and hoechst double positive cells d. overall dcf acutely reduced the histological score of hsi within 24 h e. similar results were seen after a 48 h treatment  with a larger magnitude of effect.tight junctions and low permeability are hallmarks of our hsi monolayer system.

p  0.05. c dcf increases the papp of ly through hsi within 24 h with significant differences observed for 1000 and 2000 mm dcf.

however dcf addition sig- nificantly reduced teer in both lps-treated and lps-free hsi monolayers p  0.001. further staining lps-treated monolayers with f-actin and e-cadherin shows maintenance of the flagstone pattern characteristic of nontreated monolayers confirming that lps alone does not disrupt barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium e. dcf disrupts this regular staining both with and without lps treatment suggestive of increased barrier permeability e.in summary using a novel primary human small intestine monolayer system we have demonstrated that the amphipathic nsaid diclofenac disrupts mitochondrial potential and exerts oxidative stress by generation of the ros species o2-.

initial studies included a lower concentration of 250 mm dcf which was found to not be cytotoxic data not shown.diclofenac like many other nonselective nsaids is amphi- pathic containing lipophilic and charged moieties and is capable of donating a proton.

cmh2-xros fluorescence intensity is directly correlated with cell health with increased fluorescence observed in actively respiring cells.we found that dcf sharply reduces the fluorescence intensity of cmh2-xros in a dose- dependent manner ab.
