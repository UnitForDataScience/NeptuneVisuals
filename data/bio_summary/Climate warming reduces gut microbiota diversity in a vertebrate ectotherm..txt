Hence the increase of bacterial richness over the summer was stronger in present climate climate effect estimate - SE -130 - 46 t  -2.8 p  0.004 mean change in OTUs number over the summer 134 - 194 and 4 - 131 in present and warm climates respectively and resulted in differences in bacterial richness after climatic treatments climate effect estimate- SE -128 - 56 p  0.026 RI  0.63 Supplementary Table 11 mean OTUs number in September 526 - 168 and 400 - 128 in present and warm climates respectively while there were no differences between treatments at the beginning of the experiment F182  0.97 p  0.33.Effect of microbiota on host survival in the third experimentInvestigating whether host future survival was related to bacterial richness in a common garden experiment the averaged best model included bacterial richness climatic treatment theyear before body condition and sex however only bacterial richness and climatic treatment were significant Supplementary Table 17 Supplementary Fig.

We found 12 and 5 additional OTUs for which we could not assign a taxon that had a relative abundance higher in the present or warm climate respectively LDA  2.12 - 3.14 pMW  0.0035.Table 10b Bacterial OTUs with different relative abundances between climatic treatments.Table 11 Short-term impact of climatic conditions lizard sex and bacterial richness at the beginning of the experiment on individual gut bacterial richness after 2 months of climatic treatment total number of OTUs.

Finally we 3 truncated the data with several abundanceprevalence cut- offs to check whether the effect of climatic conditions on bacterial richness did not rely only on a disappearance of very rare bacterial OTUs Supplementary Table 4.We then checked the impact of climatic conditions on OTUs richness of each of the most diverse phyla 5 phyla with the highest number of OTUs plus unidentified OTUs standardized by phylum to avoid heteroscedasticity with a repeated linear mixed model including climatic treatment phylum identity and their interaction as fixed effects and enclosure and lizard identities as random intercepts Supplementary Tables 5 and 6.

Warming also caused greater variability in microbial community composition within host populations mean Jaccard index within a population present climate 0.446 - 0.002 warm climate 0.458 - 0.004 kh2  3.86 p  0.0495.Pathways of impact of climate on bacterial richness in the first experimentInvestigating the mechanism by which climatic conditions affected bacterial richness Supplementary Table 13 we found that the averaged best model included climatic treatment lizard density and both number of arachnid and insect families.

We finally ran the analyses on these 22 KEGG-Level 2 classes within the 4 KEGG-Level 1 functional groups mentioned with a p-value threshold of 0.0022 Supplementary Table 16.Effect of climate change on populations' bacterial richness in the first experimentWe calculated the impact of climate change on the richness at the population level that is the total number of different OTUs per enclosure.

However only the climate effect had a significant negative impact on bacterial richness while lizard density tended to be positively related to richness Supplementary Table 13.Effect of short-term summer climate change on bacterial richness in the second experimentWe additionally studied how climatic conditions affected extinction and colonization processes in our follow-up short-term summer experiment.

About 99.0  of the 6654 OTUs detected in the whole dataset belongs to 5 phyla plus unidentified OTUs Unidentified taxa  28.7  Proteobacteria  28.1  Firmicutes  21.9  Bacteroidetes 9.9  Actinobacteria  9.0  and Fusobacteria  1.3  while the remaining 1 corresponded to 12 other phyla Acidobacteria Candidatus Saccharibacteria Verrucomicrobia Chlamydiae Planctomycetes Spirochaetes Deinococcus-Thermus Tenericutes Cyanobacteria Gemmatimonadetes Chloroflexi and Armatimonadetes.Statistical analysesEffect of climate change on individual bacterial richness in the first experimentWe investigated climatic impacts on total bacterial richness i.e.

Proportion of new OTUs is the number of OTUs present in September but not in May divided by the total number of OTUs present in September and extinction rate is the number of OTUs present in May but absent in September divided by the total number of OTUs present in May.

In a first experiment nine lizard populations were allocated to three climatic treatments throughout the summer 'present climate' current local climate 'intermediate climate' 2degC and 'warm climate' 3degC which are consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections16 and critical for the life history and population dynamics of lizards3.
