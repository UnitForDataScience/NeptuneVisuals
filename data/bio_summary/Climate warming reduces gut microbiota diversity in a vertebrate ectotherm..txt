however climate warming led to higher bacterial extinction rates while there were no differences in the proportion of new otus supplementary table 12. hence the increase of bacterial richness over the summer was stronger in present climate climate effect estimate - se -130 - 46 t  -2.8 p  0.004 mean change in otus number over the summer 134 - 194 and 4 - 131 in present and warm climates respectively and resulted in differences in bacterial richness after climatic treatments climate effect estimate- se -128 - 56 p  0.026 ri  0.63 supplementary table 11 mean otus number in september 526 - 168 and 400 - 128 in present and warm climates respectively while there were no differences between treatments at the beginning of the experiment f182  0.97 p  0.33.effect of microbiota on host survival in the third experimentinvestigating whether host future survival was related to bacterial richness in a common garden experiment the averaged best model included bacterial richness climatic treatment theyear before body condition and sex however only bacterial richness and climatic treatment were significant supplementary table 17 supplementary fig.

finally we 3 truncated the data with several abundanceprevalence cut- offs to check whether the effect of climatic conditions on bacterial richness did not rely only on a disappearance of very rare bacterial otus supplementary table 4.we then checked the impact of climatic conditions on otus richness of each of the most diverse phyla 5 phyla with the highest number of otus plus unidentified otus standardized by phylum to avoid heteroscedasticity with a repeated linear mixed model including climatic treatment phylum identity and their interaction as fixed effects and enclosure and lizard identities as random intercepts supplementary tables 5 and 6. we further investigated climatic effects on bacterial richness for each phylum.

at birth a tail tip from offspring was collected for further genetic identification and parentage analysis according to methods described in 9 allowing to quantify the number of sexual partners of each lizard.second experiment microbiota changes on the short termto investigate whether climate-induced changes in bacterial communities resulted from differences in bacterial extinction rates or in the proportion of new taxa gained we performed an additional experiment during the summer 2013. a set of 84 adults captured in the cevennes mountains was sampled for their cloacal microbiota in june 2013. after sampling of cloacal microbiota individuals were released in 'present' and 'warm' climate enclosures to form 8 populations of 10 females and 11 males in mid-july 2013. there were no differences between treatments in adult body size snout-vent length f182  0.0006 p  0.98 total length f182  0.35 p  0.55 body mass f182  0.08 p  0.78 coloration dorsal blackness f182  0.14 p  0.71 and initial bacterial richness f182  0.97 p  0.33. individuals were maintained in these climatic conditions during the summer and in mid-september after 2 months of climatic treatment we captured all surviving individuals 48 individuals 21 in present climate and 27 in warm climate and resampled their microbiota to monitor changes in microbiota over the summer of climatic treatment.third experiment effect of microbiota on survival in a common gardenin july 2013 we released lizards from the first experiment along with lizards from another experiment in 5 enclosures in 'present climate' to test whether bacterial community richness measured in may 2013 impacted their survival the year after.

we found 12 and 5 additional otus for which we could not assign a taxon that had a relative abundance higher in the present or warm climate respectively lda  2.12 - 3.14 pmw  0.0035.table 10b bacterial otus with different relative abundances between climatic treatments.table 11 short-term impact of climatic conditions lizard sex and bacterial richness at the beginning of the experiment on individual gut bacterial richness after 2 months of climatic treatment total number of otus.

in a first experiment nine lizard populations were allocated to three climatic treatments throughout the summer 'present climate' current local climate 'intermediate climate' 2degc and 'warm climate' 3degc which are consistent with the intergovernmental panel on climate change projections16 and critical for the life history and population dynamics of lizards3.

enclosures were divided into three groups chosen to be homogeneous respective to the plant cover and composition f26  1.01 p  0.42 and f26  0.01  p  0.99 and to the invertebrate abundance and composition insect abundance f26  1.78 p  0.25 spider abundance f26  0.54  p  0.61 insect richness f26  0.91 p  0.45 spider richness f26  0.27  p  0.77. in june 2012 three treatments were created using automatic shutters see2 for details 'present climate' pc 'intermediate climate' ic and 'warm climate' wc.

we finally ran the analyses on these 22 kegg-level 2 classes within the 4 kegg-level 1 functional groups mentioned with a p-value threshold of 0.0022 supplementary table 16.effect of climate change on populations' bacterial richness in the first experimentwe calculated the impact of climate change on the richness at the population level that is the total number of different otus per enclosure.

however only the climate effect had a significant negative impact on bacterial richness while lizard density tended to be positively related to richness supplementary table 13.effect of short-term summer climate change on bacterial richness in the second experimentwe additionally studied how climatic conditions affected extinction and colonization processes in our follow-up short-term summer experiment.

about 99.0  of the 6654 otus detected in the whole dataset belongs to 5 phyla plus unidentified otus unidentified taxa  28.7  proteobacteria  28.1  firmicutes  21.9  bacteroidetes 9.9  actinobacteria  9.0  and fusobacteria  1.3  while the remaining 1 corresponded to 12 other phyla acidobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria verrucomicrobia chlamydiae planctomycetes spirochaetes deinococcus-thermus tenericutes cyanobacteria gemmatimonadetes chloroflexi and armatimonadetes.statistical analyseseffect of climate change on individual bacterial richness in the first experimentwe investigated climatic impacts on total bacterial richness i.e.

proportion of new otus is the number of otus present in september but not in may divided by the total number of otus present in september and extinction rate is the number of otus present in may but absent in september divided by the total number of otus present in may.

3 further showed that the lower number of otus in warm climatic treatments resulted from both a decrease of the number of bacterial taxa at the individual level and a decrease in the number of host individuals due to increased mortality2.looking on the impact of climate on the most diverse phyla 5 phyla with the highest number of otus plus unidentified otus we found a significant effect of climatic treatment supplementary tables 5 and 6 without interactions with phylum identity.
