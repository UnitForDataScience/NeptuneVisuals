These values suggest that inactivation during CUT was negligible.Under isothermal conditions lag time decreased when CO2 pressure increased Table  suggesting that increas- ing the CO2 pressure enhanced the diffusion of supercrit- ical gas into the cell Stahl et al.

Non-linear HPCD inactivation kinetics of E. coli has been frequently reported but sec- ondary models describing the process pressure and tem- perature effects remain in debate Ferrentino et al.

The modified Gompertz model and Monte Carlo simulations were then used in a probabilistic engineering approach to design HPCD treatments ensuring SV  5 with a 95 confidence.Materials and methodsHPCD processed apple juiceMicrobial reduction SV values defined as LogN0Nt with N0 and Nt denoting initial microbial counts and those after t min corresponds to HPCD inactivation data directly provided by Liao et al.

This also explains the large shortening of the lag time when temperature increases under isobaric condition while it is less sensitive to CO2 pressure under isothermal conditions Table .Secondary pathogen inactivation modelsEmpirical models describing the combined temperature and pressure effect on the primary microbial inactivation kinetics model were developed Eqs.

However lag time values were less sensitive to pressure Table  supporting the inactivation mechanisms that suggest temperature levels around 30-50 degC enhances CO2 penetration by increasing both the CO2 diffusivity Stahl et al.
