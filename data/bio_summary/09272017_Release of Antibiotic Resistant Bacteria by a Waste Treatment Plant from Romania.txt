Some treatments of waste- water longer hydraulic residence times may improve the quality of treated water however a higher removal efficiency does not necessarily imply a significant decrease in antibiotic resistance percentages in the outflow 22.Although the overall increase in ARB release and ARG in the environment is not a great direct risk to human health it may increase horizontal gene transfer HGT and the acquire- ment of resistance by environmental bacteria.

The correct recombinant plasmids were usedfor the generation of standard curves.Removal rate calculationCFU  mL in outflow river water 10 km upstream of WWTP S2--entrance to WWTPRemoval rate of ARB 1 ---CFU  mL in inflowx 100S3--discharge of WWTP S4--river water 10 km downstream of WWTP.

If the microbiological load is high the water from the secondary decanter is directed to a tertiary tank for advanced treatment.Physicochemical analysesData from physical and chemical measurements of water samples are shown in Table 2.

Bacteria cell counts in raw water 108 were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in upstream river water 105.

On the other hand just one tetracy- cline concentration was tested and the river water and waste- water bacterial communities have different compositions 18.

Although irrigation with recycled water is an excellent solution to water scarcity the possibility of strains of clinical significance reaching soil and the likelihood of finding these bacteria on vegetables representing a higher risk for consumers cannot be ruled out.In conclusion the results of the present study showed that WWTP in Cluj-Napoca markedly reduced total ARG and ARB.

The main purpose of the present study was to assess the removal degree of bacteria with resistance to antibiotics and identify the contribution of a wastewater treatment plant to the microbiota of Somesul Mic river water in Cluj county.

The main antibiotic sources in the environ- ment are unused antibiotics and their unprocessed removal the large quantities used for veterinary purposes the manure of birds and animals that end up in the soil and ground water feces of human origin and wastewater treatment plants WWTP 19.

WWTP are reservoirs of chemicals bacteria and genes that confer antibiotic resistance 31 and treated water releases numerous bacteria resistant to antibiotics into the environment 12 20 28.

The aim of the present study was to assess the abundance and extent of removal of ARB and the clinically significant intI1 gene at the new modern treatment plant in Cluj-Napoca Romania.Materials and MethodsSample collection and processingAnalyses were performed on water samples from 4 sites S1--the forward and reverse primers and 3 mL of the template.
