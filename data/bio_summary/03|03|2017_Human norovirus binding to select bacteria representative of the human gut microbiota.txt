There were differences between bacteria binding observed for Tulane virus for which individual bacterial strains either bound to the virus at a level statistically equivalent to the other norovirus strains or the bacteria did not bind the virus at all.

All bacteria tested bound the repre- sentative human norovirus strains with high efficiency 1 log10 of input virus remained unbound or 10 unbound and 90 binding efficiency p0.05 there was selective bind- ing for Tulane virus and no binding observed for TCV.

The findings reported here further elucidate and inform the dynamics between human noroviruses and enteric bacteria with implications for norovirus pathogenesis.IntroductionHuman norovirus is the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide  and also the most common cause of foodborne disease at least within the United States .

Until recently the lack of a reliable propagation model for human norovirus reviewed in  had been a significant roadblock and little is still known about the viral replication cycle.About fifteen years ago researchers identified human histo-blood group antigens HBGAs as a putative human norovirus cellular receptor .

In gen- eral TSB5 sheep blood had the greatest negative impact on human norovirus binding toBinding efficiency of human norovirus and representative surrogate viruses to select bacteria.

Binding in PBS was evaluated to three human norovirus strains GII.4 New Orleans 2009 and Sydney 2012 GI.6 and two surrogate viruses Tulane virus and Turnip Crinkle Virus TCV using a sus- pension assay format linked to RT-qPCR for quantification.

These findings and others  informed the development of a mammalian cell culture model for human norovirus propagation in which the target cell line Burkitt's Lymphoma BJAB B cells could support modest replication of the virus only when in the presence of E. cloacae or after supplementation with synthetic HBGAs .

Certainly HBGAs are not the only com- pounds implicated in human norovirus binding and E. cloacae may not be the only strain to which the virus binds.

Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains reference and fecal isolates were screened for binding with genotypes GI.6 and GII.4 New Orleans 2009 and Sydney 2012 human norovirus strains as well as the cultivable Tulane virus surrogate.
