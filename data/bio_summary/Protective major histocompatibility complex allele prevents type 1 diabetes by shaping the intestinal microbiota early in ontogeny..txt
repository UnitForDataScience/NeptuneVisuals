G Pancreas histology from Ea16NOD and GF Ea16NOD mice.Furthermore we generated germ-free GF NOD and Ea16 NOD mice and compared their degrees of insulitis.

Therefore we sought to identify combinations of operational taxonomic units OTUs affected by E and interfering with diabetes by constructing Random Forest classifiers of E or N genotypes based on the microbiome profiles.A 1.510.5B0.40.2C0.40.2D 210NODEa16NOD00NOD Ea16NODNOD Ea16NOD NOD Ea16NODCecal contentCecal tissue0NOD - NOD Ea16NOD - NODFig.

C and D Comparison of the representation of specific IgA-coated taxa between the cecal microbiomes of 18- and 35-d-old NOD and Ea16NOD mice.showed no robust differences in Ea16NOD vs. NOD littermates according to fraction and number of CD4 T-helper cells expressing IFN-g IL-17 IL-10 or IL-22 CD8 T cells and mye- loid cell populations such as CD103-expressing cells.

Ea16NOD females vertically protected their NOD offspring from diabetes and insulitis an effect that was dependent on the intestinal microbiota moreover they developed autoimmunity when treated with certain antibiotics or raised in a germ-free environment.

Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed NOD and Ea16NOD mice to host mild but significant dif- ferences in the intestinal microbiotas during a critical early window of ontogeny and transfer of cecal contents from the latter to the former suppressed insulitis.

Using multi- ple experimental approaches we demonstrate this hypothesis to be true.ResultsEa16NOD Dams Transmitted Protection from Insulitis and T1D Vertically200 010203040Weeks of age10.5Ea16NOD Ea16NOD NODInsulitis Peri-insulitisto Their NOD Progeny.
