therefore we sought to identify combinations of operational taxonomic units otus affected by e and interfering with diabetes by constructing random forest classifiers of e or n genotypes based on the microbiome profiles.a 1.510.5b0.40.2c0.40.2d 210nodea16nod00nod ea16nodnod ea16nod nod ea16nodcecal contentcecal tissue0nod - nod ea16nod - nodfig.

c and d comparison of the representation of specific iga-coated taxa between the cecal microbiomes of 18- and 35-d-old nod and ea16nod mice.showed no robust differences in ea16nod vs. nod littermates according to fraction and number of cd4 t-helper cells expressing ifn-g il-17 il-10 or il-22 cd8 t cells and mye- loid cell populations such as cd103-expressing cells.

indeed the intestinal micro- biome changes in ea16nod mice occurred at the time insulitis typically initiates 3 wk of age 23. this timing corresponds to a wave of islet cell apoptosis 35 and establishment of a lymphatic connection between the intestinal immune system 24 and the plns which is critical for the development of insulitis and t1d 36. the notion of an intestinal impact on the development of t1d is supported by studies in humans and mice and is often referred to as the leaky gut hypothesis 37. in support of a role for the e complex working via such mechanisms cell transfer experiments indicated that protection is mediated by the e- expressing macrophage or dendritic cell lineage 13 which is supported by genetic ablation studies showing a requirement for e-expression on the cd11c but not cd19 cell lineage 12. our observation of increased treg cell proportions in the cecum of ea16nod mice could represent an effect of early-life microbial stimulation on cd11c tolerogenic dendritic cells.

ea16nod females vertically protected their nod offspring from diabetes and insulitis an effect that was dependent on the intestinal microbiota moreover they developed autoimmunity when treated with certain antibiotics or raised in a germ-free environment.

genomic and proteomic analyses revealed nod and ea16nod mice to host mild but significant dif- ferences in the intestinal microbiotas during a critical early window of ontogeny and transfer of cecal contents from the latter to the former suppressed insulitis.

using multi- ple experimental approaches we demonstrate this hypothesis to be true.resultsea16nod dams transmitted protection from insulitis and t1d vertically200 010203040weeks of age10.5ea16nod ea16nod nodinsulitis peri-insulitisto their nod progeny.

since the maternal and neonatal environments0 can influence diabetes development in both nod mice 21 and humans 22 we began by investigating whether protection from diabetes could be vertically transferred from an ea16nod dam to her nod progeny.

diabetes incidence was compared in cohorts of female nod mice born to either nod dams mated to ea16nod sires or to the reciprocal combination.

nod progeny of ea16nod dams had a significantly reduced incidence 39 vs. 65 and delayed onset 21 vs. 14 wk of age of diabetes vis a vis nod progeny of nod dams fig.
