as such the impacts of exogenous contaminants on microbial ecology is an area to be explored to understand what are the chemical and physical conditions that allow the pro- liferation of pathogenic bacteria and to find alternatives for water treatment by identifying organic-degrading bacteria.

in fact weakly chlorinated compounds produced by dechlorination of highly chlorinated ones are substrates for gram negative aerobic bacteria genus pseudomonas alcaligenes achromobacter comamonas sphingomonas ralstonia acinetobacter burkholderia and gram-positive bacteria genus rhodococcus coryne- bacterium bacillus .achromobacter sp.

given the collective ability for these detected bacteria to degrade organic molecules it is not surprising that a majority of these organotrophic bacteria were detected in samples from sites 1-3 where groundwater quality had been severely degraded by hydrocarbons and other vocs.antibiotic resistancesafe drinking water is a necessity and a growing concern as groundwater expands as a major source for drinking water.

oppor- tunistic pathogenic bacteria such as aeromonas hydrophila bacillus cereus pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were identified increasing the risk for consumption of and exposure to these con- taminated groundwaters.

additionally antimicrobial tests revealed that many of the identified bacteria were re- sistant to different antibiotics.

these regulations only cover cryptosporid- ium giardia lamblia legionella total coliforms including fecal coliform and e. coli and enteric viruses  and do not cover other harmful bacteria that can be isolated from different types of potable water .

therefore it is essential to understand the correlation between the environment and bacteria by studying the type and diversity of bac- terial communities and their stress responses to the groundwater con- tamination .there are many different sources of groundwater contamination that generally stem from local human activities.

therefore the impacts of ud activities on bacterial communities in groundwater have yet to be explored thoroughly .the rapid identification of bacteria in contaminated groundwater is necessary for monitoring changes in bacterial communities and to identify any possible health concern.

a minimum of two inde- pendent pcrs were sequenced for each sample.the partial 16s rrna gene sequences of the isolated strains were submitted to the genbank database under accession numbers ky848226 ky848238 ky848240 ky848248 ky848250 ky848251 ky848253 ky848256 ky848257 ky848258 ky848259 ky848260 ky848262 ky848269 ky848296 ky848297 ky848302 ky848304 ky848307 ky848306 ky848308 ky848310 ky848309 ky848311 ky848312 ky848313 ky848314 ky848315 ky848317 ky848319 ky848320 ky848630 ky848628 ky848626 and ky848627.antimicrobial susceptibilitythe susceptibility of isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents was analyzed using the disc diffusion assay .

individual col- onies of bacteria were transferred to nb and grown at 37 degc until reaching a turbidity equivalent to 0.5 macfarland standard.

bacteria were inoculated onto mueller-hinton agar remel lenexa ks usa directly from the suspen- sion spreading the inoculum as evenly as possible.

the sensitivity of bacteria to anti- microbial agents was determined according to the clinical and labora- tory standards institute .

escherichia coli atcc 25922was used as control strain for monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility testing.results and discussioncharacterization of groundwater microbiomethe primary aim of this study was to identify bacteria in contaminat- ed groundwater using maldi-tof ms in order to characterize the groundwater microbiome.
