representative pictures of micro- scopic lymphoid lesions are shown in e f. almost all pigs had some degree of lymphoid depletion with only a single high growth rate pig having normal microscopic lymph node appearance d. al- though mean scores were slightly increased for low growth rate pigs 1.9 compared to 1.6 for high growth rate pigs no significant differ- ence was detected between the two groups p  0.6 mann-whitney utest.the microbiomes of high growth rate pigs had increased diversity ruminococcaceae and streptococcaceae but reduced methanobacteriaceaethe presence of microbial families and species was determined bythe microbial detection array.

mean weights con- tinued to be similar during the acclimation period and on the day of co- infection 19.2 - 2.2 kg for the low growth rate group and19.5 - 1.9 kg for the high growth rate group on 0 dpi p  0.75 unpaired t-test b. no significant difference was detected between the mean weights of the two groups prior to virus infection.after infection the mean weights between the two groups began to diverge initially noting a trend for absolute weight differences on 21 and 28 dpi see b. on 21 dpi mean weights for the low and high growth rate groups were 33.1 - 4.3 kg and 36.1 - 2.6 kg respec- tively p  0.077 unpaired t-test.

streptococcus equi was detected at a sig- nificantly higher rate in high growth rate pigs see c 10 and 70 of the low and high growth rate pigs respectively had strep.

shifts in the microbiome composition of high growth rate pigs included reduced methanobacteriaceae species increased ruminococcaceae species and increased streptococcaceae species when compared to low growth rate pigs.

at 35 dpi 20 pigs were selected to represent high growth rate pigs n  10 and low growth rate pigs n  10. to select these two groups the average daily gain adg was calculated between 0 and 35 dpi as the change in weight over the change in time and reported in kg.

pigs in the high growth rate group had the highest adg and pigs in the low growth rate group had the lowest adg.

proportions of each growth rate group with in- dividual species and families detected were compared using fisher's exact test.resultsweight gain of high and low growth rate groups diverged after co- infectionof the 50 pigs 10 pigs had moderate to severe clinical disease that required veterinary medical treatment 20 overall morbidity.

by 28 dpi mean weights had di- verged by approximately 4.4 kg low growth rate pigs weighed an average of 38.7 - 4.7 kg and high growth rate pigs weighed an average of 43.1 - 6.1 kg p  0.09 unpaired t-test.

final weights on 42 dpi were 52.5 - 5.3 kg and 57.1 - 2.9 kg for the low and high growth rate groups respectively.high growth rate pigs had reduced prrsv and pcv2 replicationprrsv and pcv2 viremia were measured at 9 time points during the course of the study.

overall prrs virus replica- tion in the low growth rate group had a more rapid increase and a more prolonged decay c. on 4 dpi mean viral loads for the low and high growth rate groups were 4.1 and 3.6 log10 copiespcr reaction respectively p  0.03 unpaired t-test.

on 21 dpi the low growth rate group had a trend towards increased mean viremia p  0.086 unpaired t-test.growth rate pigs were 4.4 and 2.8 log10 copiespcr reaction respec- tively 0.004 unpaired t-test.

a trend for reduced prrs virus re- plication in the high growth rate pigs continued on 21 dpi 0.05 un- paired t-test.pcv2 viremia followed a similar trend to prrsv with low growth rate pigs having a more rapid rise in viral load followed by a more gradual decline d. significant differences between the two groups were noted on days 11 and 14 post-infection.

mean pcv2 auc values were higher in low growth rate pigs 57.6 - 28.5 and 35.6 - 22.6 for the low and high growth rate groups respectively.

mean lung lesion scores were 2.3 and 1.2 for low and high growth rate groups respectively p  0.05 mann-whitney u test see a. the majority of high growth rate pigs 80 had normal lung or mild multifocal interstitial pneumonia with  50 lung lobe involvement.

both dna and rna viruses were detected including the families of reoviridae picornaviridae astro- viridae circoviridae parvoviridae and pospiviroidae see a. bac- terial families were detected from several phyla including firmicutes 1022 proteobacteria 611 bacteroidetes 211 actinobacteria 122 tenericutes 122 chlamydiae 122 and spirochaetae 1 22.each of the 29 microbial families were detected at similar pre- valence rates in both the high and low growth rate groups a. both groups had a 100 prevalence rate of the bacterial families lac- tobacillaceae lachnospiraceae prevotellaceae and mycoplasmataceae.
