when ehf is not tolerated and fails to resolve allergy symptoms aaf is recommended aberrant composition and diversity of gut microbiota in early life may disrupt development of the immune system  which is associated with allergy-related diseases 1214 including food allergies such as cma a study of infants with cma showed that gut microbiota composition at 3- 6 months was associated with allergy resolution by the age of 8 years suggesting that during infancy gut microbiota could be a potential mechanism to influence food allergy outcomes in childhood.studies showing that prebiotics and probiotics or their combination synbiotics can positively modulate the com- position of gut microbiota 21 provided the rationale to investigate such an approach in cma.

ehf or formulae containing different types of prebiotics or alternative strains of probiotics.safety concerns have been expressed with other infant formulae containing different probiotics  and it isimportant that safety is established in clinical trials for each specific formula in an appropriate population  the synbiotic-supplemented aaf in this trial was shown to be safe in terms of adverse events use of concomitant medications and achievement of growth targets several studies have shown that b. breve m-16v is safe in infants including preterm neonates although the addition of these specific synbiotics to aaf improves the composition of the gut microbiota so that it more closely resembles the composition observed in breastfed individuals the results of this trial do not change the recommendation that infants with cma should be fed with human breast milk if possible.although these results are specific to subjects with non-ige-mediated cma burks et al.

the ongoing and reported trial will inform future studies primarily focusing at clinical outcomes in the specific cma populations.on the basis of the data showing significant effects on the composition of gut microbiota that extend beyond an increase in bifidobacteria we conclude that the aaf including the specific synbiotics of fructo-oligosaccharides and b. breve m-16v used in this trial was equally well tolerated as aaf without synbiotics suitable for dietary management and supports microbiota development of infants with suspected non-ige-mediated cma.supplementary materialsupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at acknowledgmentswe thank rob slump of the department of gut biology and microbiology of nutricia research the netherlands for the analysis of the gut microbiota data.

the duration of formula administration and length of follow-up mean there is only limited scope for this trial to assess longer-term changes in gut microbiota.this randomized controlled trial adds to the evidence base for prebiotics and probiotics in the alteration of infant microbiota and potentially the dietary management of cma 2242. however caution is required in making comparisons between studies which had different trial entry criteria and tested a range of dietary management strategies.
