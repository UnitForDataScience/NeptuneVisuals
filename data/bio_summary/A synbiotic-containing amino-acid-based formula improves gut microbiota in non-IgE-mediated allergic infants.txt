In addition clinical studies of eHF supplemented with probiotics showed improved symptoms in infants with CMA 2225 however eHF may not be the most appropriate formula for patients with non-IgE CMA such as those presenting with faltering growth or those with persistent clinical symptoms when using eHF and an AAF is recommended in such cases Clinical studies in healthy infants and infants with CMA showed that synbiotic-supplemented AAF was hypoallergenic well tolerated and supported normal growth On the basis of these findings we conducted a randomized trial to assess the effect of an AAF with a specific1Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital Brighton UK 2Nutricia Research Nutricia Advanced Medical Nutrition Utrecht The Netherlands 3Laboratory of Microbiology Wageningen University Wageningen The Netherlands 4University Hospital Verona Verona Italy 5University Hospital Brussels Brussels Belgium 6Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust London UK 7Great Ormond Street Hospital London UK 8Umea University Umea Sweden 9Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty of Science Utrecht University Utrecht The Netherlands 10Great North Children's Hospital Newcastle upon Tyne UK.

When eHF is not tolerated and fails to resolve allergy symptoms AAF is recommended Aberrant composition and diversity of gut microbiota in early life may disrupt development of the immune system  which is associated with allergy-related diseases 1214 including food allergies such as CMA A study of infants with CMA showed that gut microbiota composition at 3- 6 months was associated with allergy resolution by the age of 8 years suggesting that during infancy gut microbiota could be a potential mechanism to influence food allergy outcomes in childhood.Studies showing that prebiotics and probiotics or their combination synbiotics can positively modulate the com- position of gut microbiota 21 provided the rationale to investigate such an approach in CMA.

HBR levels of bifidobacteria and ERCC were 55 and 6.5 respectively.CONCLUSION AAF including specific synbiotics which results in levels of bifidobacteria and ERCC approximating levels in the HBR group improves the fecal microbiota of infants with suspected non-IgE-mediated CMA.ow's milk allergy CMA affects up to 5 of infants and children in Western countries 13 although the number of challenge-proven cases may be lower CMA is associated with a range of distressing and potentially severe clinical symptoms affecting the skin gastrointestinal GItract and less commonly the respiratory tract Infants with non-IgE CMA generally have delayed symptoms and present particular challenges because of difficulty in diagnosis lack of validated tests and a paucity of clinical studies When exclusive breastfeeding is not possible or there is failure of control of symptoms when dairy - soya is eliminated out of the maternal diet the dietary management guidelines for infants with CMA recommend extensively hydrolyzed formula eHF for mild cases and amino-acid- based formula AAF for severe cases.

eHF or formulae containing different types of prebiotics or alternative strains of probiotics.Safety concerns have been expressed with other infant formulae containing different probiotics  and it isimportant that safety is established in clinical trials for each specific formula in an appropriate population  The synbiotic-supplemented AAF in this trial was shown to be safe in terms of adverse events use of concomitant medications and achievement of growth targets Several studies have shown that B. breve M-16V is safe in infants including preterm neonates Although the addition of these specific synbiotics to AAF improves the composition of the gut microbiota so that it more closely resembles the composition observed in breastfed individuals the results of this trial do not change the recommendation that infants with CMA should be fed with human breast milk if possible.Although these results are specific to subjects with non-IgE-mediated CMA Burks et al.

The ongoing and reported trial will inform future studies primarily focusing at clinical outcomes in the specific CMA populations.On the basis of the data showing significant effects on the composition of gut microbiota that extend beyond an increase in bifidobacteria we conclude that the AAF including the specific synbiotics of fructo-oligosaccharides and B. breve M-16V used in this trial was equally well tolerated as AAF without synbiotics suitable for dietary management and supports microbiota development of infants with suspected non-IgE-mediated CMA.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSupplementary material is linked to the online version of the paper at ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe thank Rob Slump of the department of Gut Biology and Microbiology of Nutricia Research The Netherlands for the analysis of the gut microbiota data.
