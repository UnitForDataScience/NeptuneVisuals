Recent evidence suggests that use of macrolides particularly azithromycin may decrease the risk of and duration of lower respiratory tract illnesses and prevent future episodes in specific high-risk populations.Summary Infants and preschoolers who have wheezy lower respiratory tract illnesses have a higher risk of asthma devel- opment.

In another study 219 infants who were 24 months of age and younger and hospitalized for bronchiolitis were randomized to receive three once-weekly doses of azithromycin or placebo and no differences in time receiving supplemental oxygen symp- toms or need for rehospitalization within 6 months were found between the treatment groups .In contrast two recent trials have shown the efficacy of azithromycin in preschool children with recurrent lower respiratory tract illnesses Table .

Compared with controls infants with RSV infection were more likely to be culture positive for the potentially pathogenic organisms Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis 81 in RSV-positive infants vs 65 in controls in samples obtain- ed via nasopharyngeal swab and nasal wash. Thirty-two per- cent of RSV-positive infants versus 4 of controls had growth of more than one potentially pathogenic bacterial species and RSV-positive infants had increased numbers of white blood cells in nasopharyngeal fluid.

This trial assessed if azithromycin when started at the earliest signs of arespiratory tract illness and before the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms in high-risk children aged 12- 71 months could prevent progression to severe episodes .

Azithromycin-resistant organisms in oropharyngeal samples were infrequently acquired occurring in six of 36 participants treated with azithromycin and four of 37 treated with placebo.Another randomized controlled trial found that azithromycin use during an episode of lower respiratory tract symptoms re- sulted in a shorter duration of asthma-like episodes.

A retrospective population-based cohort study found that antibiotic use during the first year of life was associated with an increased risk ofTable 2Summary of referenced studies of the role of azithromycin in children with recurrent wheezingDose 10 mgkgdayCOPSAC Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood LRTI lower respiratory tract illness RDBPC randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled trial RTI respiratory tract illnessasthma development by 3 years of age with a positive rela- tionship between number of antibiotic courses received and risk of asthma .

Furthermore recent evidence suggests that azithromycin use early during respiratory epi- sodes in high-risk preschoolers with recurrent wheeze canshorten episode duration and lower the risk of progression to severe lower respiratory tract illnesses.

The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study reported that children under 3 years of age with predominantly mild RSV lower respiratory tract infections were at increased wheezing risk at age 11 years but not at age 13 years suggesting that the risk after mild RSV infection may diminish with time .

Azithromycin does not improve disease course in hospitalized infants with respiratory syncytial virus RSV lower respiratory tract disease a randomized equivalence trial.

The first was a randomized trial of 21 infants with RSV bronchiolitis which compared clari- thromycin to placebo for 3 weeks and reported that clarithromycin use was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay shorter duration of supplemental oxygen re- quirement lower amount of b2 agonist use and lower rates of readmission to hospital over the ensuing 6 months .
