recent evidence suggests that use of macrolides particularly azithromycin may decrease the risk of and duration of lower respiratory tract illnesses and prevent future episodes in specific high-risk populations.summary infants and preschoolers who have wheezy lower respiratory tract illnesses have a higher risk of asthma devel- opment.

a retrospective population-based cohort study found that antibiotic use during the first year of life was associated with an increased risk oftable 2summary of referenced studies of the role of azithromycin in children with recurrent wheezingdose 10 mgkgdaycopsac copenhagen prospective study on asthma in childhood lrti lower respiratory tract illness rdbpc randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled trial rti respiratory tract illnessasthma development by 3 years of age with a positive rela- tionship between number of antibiotic courses received and risk of asthma .

when added to routine bronchiolitis care azithromycin treatment for 14 days resulted in a lower risk of recurrent wheezing in the subsequent year when compared to placebo.it is interesting to note that wheezing outcomes between the treatment and placebo group were similar at 6 months sug- gesting that the effect of azithromycin therapy may be pre- dominantly on illnesses occurring more than 6 months after treatment .

the tucson children's respiratory study reported that children under 3 years of age with predominantly mild rsv lower respiratory tract infections were at increased wheezing risk at age 11 years but not at age 13 years suggesting that the risk after mild rsv infection may diminish with time .

in another study 219 infants who were 24 months of age and younger and hospitalized for bronchiolitis were randomized to receive three once-weekly doses of azithromycin or placebo and no differences in time receiving supplemental oxygen symp- toms or need for rehospitalization within 6 months were found between the treatment groups .in contrast two recent trials have shown the efficacy of azithromycin in preschool children with recurrent lower respiratory tract illnesses table .

azithromycin-resistant organisms in oropharyngeal samples were infrequently acquired occurring in six of 36 participants treated with azithromycin and four of 37 treated with placebo.another randomized controlled trial found that azithromycin use during an episode of lower respiratory tract symptoms re- sulted in a shorter duration of asthma-like episodes.

this trial assessed if azithromycin when started at the earliest signs of arespiratory tract illness and before the development of lower respiratory tract symptoms in high-risk children aged 12- 71 months could prevent progression to severe episodes .
