all the steady-state samples containing taxon i.In case the samples are not collected exactly at steady states of the microbial community or there is noise in abundance measurements those samples containing taxon i will not exactly align onto a hyperplane.

Under a very mild assumption that J x s x x ds 0 holds if and only if J 0 where x and x are two steady-state samples sharing taxon iwe find that the steady-state samples can be used to infer theab PromotionInhibitionPriorsignJ  ---csignJ  - 0 0 - 0-  -Fig.

We assume that the steady-state samples collected in a data set X correspond to those n on-trivial steadydata is challenging and even ethically questionable as it requires applying drastic and frequent perturbations to the microbial community with unknown effects on the host.To circumvent the above fundamental limitations of inference methods based on temporal data here we developed a new method based on steady-state data which does not require any external perturbations.

Withto infer ecological networks of microbial communities the informativeness of independent steady-state data can be enhanced by simply collecting more steady-state samples with distinct taxa collection.

This assumption might be violated if those steady-state samples were collected from the microbial community under drastically differentenvironmental conditions e.g.

For a microbial community following exactly the GLV dynamics all its steady-state samples sharing one common taxon will align onto a hyperplane in the state space.

c d. Note that for a microbial community of N taxa if we assume that for any subset of the N taxa there is only one stable steady statesuch that all the corresponding taxa have non-zero abundance then there are at most Omax 2N 1 possible steady-state samples.

The steady-state samples were experimentally collected from a synthetic soil microbial community of eight bacterial species.

Later on we will show that this heuristic algorithm can indeed infer the interaction types with high accuracy.In reality due to measurement noise andor transient behavior of the microbial community the abundance profiles of the collected samples may not exactly represent steady states of the microbial community.

Then for any two of those samples xI and xK where the superscripts I K i denote the collections of present taxa in those samples we can prove that the sign-pattern of the i-th row of Jacobian matrix denoted as a ternary vector si  0 N is orthogonal to xI xK see Eq.
