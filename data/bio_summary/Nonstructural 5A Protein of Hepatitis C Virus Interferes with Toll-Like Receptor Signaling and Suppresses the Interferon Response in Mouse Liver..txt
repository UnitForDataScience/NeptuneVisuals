the significance of the difference was determined based on the mann-whitney u-test.resultsgeneration of hcv ns5a gene transgenic miceto examine the role of ns5a in hcv-induced pathogenesis in vivo transgenic mice stably expressing ns5a protein in the liver were established.

since the expression levels of ns5a in our transgenic mice are as low as those in human infected livers the interaction of ns5a with myd88 could not be detected data not shown but the observation that the interaction between irak1 and traf6 was impaired in transgenic mice suggests that ns5a may interact with myd88 in the liver of transgenic mice.lps is a large molecule consisting of a lipid and polysaccharide and a major component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.

further analyses revealed that the interaction between interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-6 was dispersed in transgenic mice suggesting that ns5a may interfere with this interaction via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 which was shown to interact with ns5a.

we previously reported that in a macro- phage cell line hcv ns5a protein impairs cytokine reduction in response to tlr ligands by directly interacting with myd88 a major adapter molecule in the tlr signaling pathway .therefore we examined whether hcv ns5a protein modulates tlr signaling in vivo using transgenic mice.

these results suggest that hcv ns5a may facilitate viral replication by protecting viruses against the immune sys- tem and contribute to liver pathogenesis by hcv.materials and methodstransgenic micetransgenic mice harboring the hcv ns5a gene hcv genotype 1b mouse strain c57bl6 from charles river laboratories were generated in the same way as hcv core-transgenic or envelope-transgenic mice -.

the expression of ns5a was analyzed by immunoblotting and a specific band corresponding to 56 kda was detected in the transgenic mouse liver although the mobility of ns5a protein was slightly dif- ferent between the transgenic mice and huh7 cells harboring hcv subgenomic replicon probably due to the difference in phosphorylation  .

to compare expression levels of ns5a we extracted rna from livers of transgenic mice and hcv-infected patients and quantified ns5a rna expression using real-time pcr.

a expression levels of ns5a protein in liver tissues of ns5a-transgenic tg and non-transgenic nt mice were determined by immunoblotting with mouse anti- ns5a antibody.

to explore whether ns5a expression induces any phenotypes in vivo we bred transgenic mice and sacrificed them at several ages up to 24 months but no significant histological changes were observed in livers or other organs .suppressed cytokinechemokine induction in ns5a-transgenic micesince ns5a is known to be associated with the host immune response in vitro and in vivo we administered lps intraperitoneally to five pairs of the transgenic and nontransgenic mice and examined the effect on the innate immune response in the liver by sacrificing the mice 6 hours after injection.

statistically not significant.doi10.1371journal.pone.0170461.g005impaired tlr4 signaling pathway by ns5a proteinthe above results suggested that hcv ns5a suppresses lps-induced intrahepatic cytokine production and stat3 activation in vivo and that this suppression occurred through the tlr signaling pathway since lps binds to the tlr4 receptor and activates the downstream path- way leading to cytokine induction.

these results sug- gested that ns5a suppresses the tlr signaling pathway by disturbing the traf6irak1 interaction in vivo.discussionin this study we generated transgenic mice expressing hcv ns5a protein in the liver and found that the mice have impaired tlr4 signaling.

however ns5a protein is mainly localized in hepatocytes similar to the core protein in transgenic mice although we could not demonstrate the localization of ns5a using immunohistochemistry due to low expression levels.

analyzed ns5a transgenic mice and showed that ns5a bound to pkr and suppressed the induction of ifn-b 25-oas and pkr in response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection .
