However the CAD loci with the strongest genetic effects such as SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA and chromosome 9p21 still only confer a 20-37 increased risk and the vast majority of the loci modulate risk by 10 or lessTable .

Significant associations with either increased or decreased risk of CAD depending on the biological consequence of the variant were also ob- served with ANGPTL4 LPL and SVEP1  Table .Table 2Genes in which rare variants are associated with risk of CADthrombus formationTargeted sequencingPCSK9Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower LDL levelsAPOC3Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsANGPTL4Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsSCARB1Loss-of-functionIncreaseHigher HDL levels Exome sequencingAPOC3Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsNPC1L1Loss-of-functionDecreaseDecreased intestinal cholesterol absorption andlower LDL levelsAPOA5Loss-of-functionIncreaseHigher triglyceride levelsLDLRLoss-of-functionIncreaseHigher LDL levelsExome chipLPAGain-of-functionIncreaseHigher Lpa levelsPCSK9Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower LDL levelsANGPTL4Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsLPLGain-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsLPLLoss-of-functionIncreaseHigher triglyceride levelsSVEP1UnknownIncreaseIncreased blood pressure and possibly otherunknown pathwaysWhole-genome sequencingASGR1Loss-of-functionDecreaseGlycoprotein homeostasis and lower non-HDLlevelsInterestingly the missense substitution in SVEP1 which en- codes a cell adhesion molecule was associated with a very modest increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Plasma TMAO levels were posi- tively associated with aortic lesion formation in mice and in- creased risk of prevalentincident CAD in humans the effects of which could be mediated at least in part through foam cell formation reverse cholesterol transport bile acid metabolism and platelet hyperresponsiveness    -.One important question raised by these studies is whether intrinsic host genetic variants are associated with plasma TMAO levels and by extension risk of CAD.

This association representsone of the first female-specific genetic risk factors for CAD reported in the literature and its magnitude 12 decreased risk was equivalent to the most significantly associated loci identified for CAD to date .Taken together the results of this study illustrate several important concepts that could be informative future studies.

By comparison evidence that rare variants make a substantial contribution to risk of CAD has been somewhat disappointing thus far suggesting that other biological mech- anisms have yet to be discovered.

Meta-analysis of GWAS data in large numbers of subjects have also been carried out for numerous quantitative phenotypes clinically associated with CAD including conventional risk factors such as lipid levels and blood pressure as well as less traditional bio- markers related to other biological mechanisms such as in- flammation oxidation coagulation and amino acid metabo- lism.

Furthermore the 60 loci for CAD collectivelyexplain 20 of the heritability raising the question of where to search for the remaining genetic risk.

This was based on the assumption that causal variants would be shared among different popula- tions but the shorter LD blocks in subjects of African ances- try for example would improve mapping resolution and pos- sibly even identify additional ethnicity-specific risk loci.

In the absence of pleiotropic effects of the variant it follows that if a biomarker is a causal driver of disease the genetic determi- nants of the biomarker will also be associated with disease risk.Based on this premise Mendelian randomization and ge- netic studies have confirmed the causal relationship between CAD and certain classic risk factors including blood pressure   low-density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol  triglycerides  obesity  and type 2 diabetes - and pointed to novel causal associations with interesting traits such as telomere length  and height .
