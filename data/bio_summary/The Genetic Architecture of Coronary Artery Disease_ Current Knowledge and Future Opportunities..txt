however the cad loci with the strongest genetic effects such as slc22a3-lpal2-lpa and chromosome 9p21 still only confer a 20-37 increased risk and the vast majority of the loci modulate risk by 10 or lesstable .

plasma tmao levels were posi- tively associated with aortic lesion formation in mice and in- creased risk of prevalentincident cad in humans the effects of which could be mediated at least in part through foam cell formation reverse cholesterol transport bile acid metabolism and platelet hyperresponsiveness    -.one important question raised by these studies is whether intrinsic host genetic variants are associated with plasma tmao levels and by extension risk of cad.

this association representsone of the first female-specific genetic risk factors for cad reported in the literature and its magnitude 12 decreased risk was equivalent to the most significantly associated loci identified for cad to date .taken together the results of this study illustrate several important concepts that could be informative future studies.

we also discuss areas of investiga- tion that provide opportunities for further expansion of our knowledge andor translation to improved clinical care.contribution of common genetic variants to cad and clinically associated risk factorsbeginning with the first genome-wide association studies gwas - gene finding efforts over the last decade have transformed our understanding of the genetic architecture of cad.

this studyrepresents the largest and most up-to-date meta-analysis of gwas data for coronary artery disease with 180000 sub- jects and identified 60 risk loci.welter d macarthur j morales j burdett t hall p junkins h et al.

more broadly this study also sug- gests that integration of metabolomics in future genetic studies can potentially reveal novel pathways that are relevant to the development of cad.translational and clinical implications of genetic studiesan important question from genetic studies of cad is wheth- er the findings can be leveraged towards development of nov- el therapeutic strategies.

significant associations with either increased or decreased risk of cad depending on the biological consequence of the variant were also ob- served with angptl4 lpl and svep1  table .table 2genes in which rare variants are associated with risk of cadthrombus formationtargeted sequencingpcsk9loss-of-functiondecreaselower ldl levelsapoc3loss-of-functiondecreaselower triglyceride levelsangptl4loss-of-functiondecreaselower triglyceride levelsscarb1loss-of-functionincreasehigher hdl levels exome sequencingapoc3loss-of-functiondecreaselower triglyceride levelsnpc1l1loss-of-functiondecreasedecreased intestinal cholesterol absorption andlower ldl levelsapoa5loss-of-functionincreasehigher triglyceride levelsldlrloss-of-functionincreasehigher ldl levelsexome chiplpagain-of-functionincreasehigher lpa levelspcsk9loss-of-functiondecreaselower ldl levelsangptl4loss-of-functiondecreaselower triglyceride levelslplgain-of-functiondecreaselower triglyceride levelslplloss-of-functionincreasehigher triglyceride levelssvep1unknownincreaseincreased blood pressure and possibly otherunknown pathwayswhole-genome sequencingasgr1loss-of-functiondecreaseglycoprotein homeostasis and lower non-hdllevelsinterestingly the missense substitution in svep1 which en- codes a cell adhesion molecule was associated with a very modest increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

furthermore the 60 loci for cad collectivelyexplain 20 of the heritability raising the question of where to search for the remaining genetic risk.

in the absence of pleiotropic effects of the variant it follows that if a biomarker is a causal driver of disease the genetic determi- nants of the biomarker will also be associated with disease risk.based on this premise mendelian randomization and ge- netic studies have confirmed the causal relationship between cad and certain classic risk factors including blood pressure   low-density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol  triglycerides  obesity  and type 2 diabetes - and pointed to novel causal associations with interesting traits such as telomere length  and height .

the results of these integrative analyses led to the conclusion that the great majority of causal variation at loci for risk of cad occur in noncoding regions and that genetic variants at these loci affect 98 genes that were not previously linked to cad.

since this effect alone cannot explain the magnitude of the associa- tion with increased risk of cad it suggests the existence of additional unknown and potentially novel genetic mecha- nisms leading to atherosclerosis .taken together the results of rare variant studies illustrated several interesting concepts.

for example given that the known loci for cad still only explain 20 of the genetic variation in risk  the associ- ation of cps1 with cad in only women suggests that a por- tion of the missing heritability may also reside in sex- specific associations.

for exam- ple although statins or ezetimibe were initially developed without the knowledge provided by genetic studies their car- diovascular benefits were further validated when lipid- lowering variants of genes targeted by these drugs hmgcr and npc1l1 were shown to be associated with reduced risk of cad  .

rare variants have also been identified in the population that affect risk of cad mostly through effects on lipids or blood pressure but evidence that these types of alleles make a substantial contribution the genetic variability in cad is only moderate.
