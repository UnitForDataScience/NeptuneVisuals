This studyrepresents the largest and most up-to-date meta-analysis of GWAS data for coronary artery disease with 180000 sub- jects and identified 60 risk loci.Welter D MacArthur J Morales J Burdett T Hall P Junkins H et al.

However the CAD loci with the strongest genetic effects such as SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA and chromosome 9p21 still only confer a 20-37 increased risk and the vast majority of the loci modulate risk by 10 or lessTable .

Significant associations with either increased or decreased risk of CAD depending on the biological consequence of the variant were also ob- served with ANGPTL4 LPL and SVEP1  Table .Table 2Genes in which rare variants are associated with risk of CADthrombus formationTargeted sequencingPCSK9Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower LDL levelsAPOC3Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsANGPTL4Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsSCARB1Loss-of-functionIncreaseHigher HDL levels Exome sequencingAPOC3Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsNPC1L1Loss-of-functionDecreaseDecreased intestinal cholesterol absorption andlower LDL levelsAPOA5Loss-of-functionIncreaseHigher triglyceride levelsLDLRLoss-of-functionIncreaseHigher LDL levelsExome chipLPAGain-of-functionIncreaseHigher Lpa levelsPCSK9Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower LDL levelsANGPTL4Loss-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsLPLGain-of-functionDecreaseLower triglyceride levelsLPLLoss-of-functionIncreaseHigher triglyceride levelsSVEP1UnknownIncreaseIncreased blood pressure and possibly otherunknown pathwaysWhole-genome sequencingASGR1Loss-of-functionDecreaseGlycoprotein homeostasis and lower non-HDLlevelsInterestingly the missense substitution in SVEP1 which en- codes a cell adhesion molecule was associated with a very modest increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Plasma TMAO levels were posi- tively associated with aortic lesion formation in mice and in- creased risk of prevalentincident CAD in humans the effects of which could be mediated at least in part through foam cell formation reverse cholesterol transport bile acid metabolism and platelet hyperresponsiveness    -.One important question raised by these studies is whether intrinsic host genetic variants are associated with plasma TMAO levels and by extension risk of CAD.

This association representsone of the first female-specific genetic risk factors for CAD reported in the literature and its magnitude 12 decreased risk was equivalent to the most significantly associated loci identified for CAD to date .Taken together the results of this study illustrate several important concepts that could be informative future studies.

Using a variety of approaches this study identified rare variants of SRB1 that were associated with increasedHDL cholesterol levels and increased risk of coronary artery disease.TG and HDL Working Group of the Exome Sequencing Project National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Crosby J Peloso GM Auer PL et al.
