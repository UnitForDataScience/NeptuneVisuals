these findings are consistent with minimal impact of maternal vaginal microbiota on infant gut microbiota and potential impact on infant skin microbiota however the clinical significance of the infant skin microbiome remains to be explored.seeding from maternal intestinal tract is the expected source of infant microbiota.

for instance the bacteria in the infant gut receive a very specific food substrate in form of breast milk or infant formula and infant gut microbiota is radically different to adults' yatsunenko et al.

the success rate of obtaining interpretable sequencing data varied among different niches with the greatest success for maternal rectal and vaginal and infant stool samples reduced success for infant nasal samples at 3 weeks old and limited success for maternal breast skin and infant nasal samples at birth supplementary table s2.

the magnitude of changes in similarity between maternal and infant microbiota over the study period was small with the exception of increase of similarity between microbiota of maternal skin at delivery and infant nose collected at birth and at week 3 supplementary table s5.nevertheless the similarities in community membership between microbiotas of maternal sites and of infant stool were associated with delivery mode.

in contrast the similarity to maternal vaginal microbiota was significantly greater for vaginally delivered infants compared to caesarean section delivered infants figure 3c supplementary table s8.similarity between infant and maternal microbiota within mother-infant pairs is not greater than across unrelated mothers and infantsit would be tempting to postulate that the observed pattern of decreased resemblance between rectal and vaginal maternal microbiota to infant stool and nasal microbiota following caesarean delivery was the result of reduced microbiota transfer from the mother.however the infant stool microbiota did not share more community members with the microbiota of their own mothers than with the microbiota of unrelated mothers at any of the maternal sites figure 4a-d supplementary tables s9-s12.

the lines represent medians.minor proportion of infant gut microbiota is shared with maternal vaginal microbiotato further elucidate the role of maternal microbiota as the source of microbial inoculum for the infant we have calculated the proportions of otus detected in the infant stool samples that were shared with the microbiota of their own mothers.

we limited this analysis to maternal rectal and vaginal samples and excluded breast skin samples because of low bacterial abundance resulting in low sequencing success for these samples supplementary table s2 as wellas overall high dissimilarity of microbiota of breast skin samples and infant stool samples supplementary table s3.more than 50 of otus identified in all the infant stool samples at day 3 were not observed in either rectal or vaginal maternal microbiota figure 5. however there was a large degree of inter-individual variation for one infant all the otus in its day 3 gut microbiota were also found in the maternal rectum vagina or both and for three infants none of the otus in their day 3 gut microbiota were found in the maternal samples.

in our study overlap between maternal vaginal microbiota and infant faecal microbiota was minimal while the similarity between maternal rectal microbiota and infant microbiota was more pronounced.

the sources of a large proportion of infant microbiota could not be identified in maternal microbiota and the sources of seeding of infant gut and nasal microbiota remain to be elucidated.keywords microbiota transfer delivery mode perinatal microbiotaissn 1876-2883 print issn 1876-2891 online doi 10.3920bm2017.0064763introductionthe microbiota of human body sites is thought to exert profound influence on the physiology health and disease of its human host.

in pairwise comparison the only sites which could not be differentiated based on bray-curtis distances analyses reflecting similarities in their community structures were maternal breast skin and infant nasal samples at week 3 and infant stool samplescollected at day 3 and week 3 figure 1c mann-whitney test on bay curtis distances p0.72.the maternal vaginal microbiota was dominated by lactobacilli while the rectal microbiota was more diverse with prevotella bacteroides and escherichia among the dominant genera.

the distances and corresponding p-values are listed in supplementary table s3.association of delivery mode and feeding with infant gut microbiota compositionboth delivery mode and feeding mode were associated with differences in the overall composition of infant stool microbiota at day 3 permanova delivery p0.003 feeding p0.001 mann whitney test on bray curtis distances distributions delivery p0.001 feeding p0.002.we compared the stool microbiota of the eight vaginally delivered and exclusively breastfed v-b infants with the ten who were vaginally delivered and mix-fed v-m figure 2a.

despite considerable differences in composition the delivery and feeding modes had no significant impact on bacterial load in stool at day 3 figure 2b.similarity between infant and maternal microbiota by mode of deliverythere was very little resemblance of the initial infant microbiota at any site to the microbiota of any of the maternal body sites figure 1b and 1c.

on the other hand there was a trend for greater similarity between the microbiota of maternal skin and infant stool for caesarean section delivered infants compared to vaginally delivered infants figure 3a supplementary table s6.at week 3 the resemblance in community membership between infant stool and maternal rectal microbiota was no longer impacted by the mode of delivery as the distance between maternal rectal samples and the stools of caesarean section delivered infants had decreased compare figures 3a vs 3b supplementary table s5.
