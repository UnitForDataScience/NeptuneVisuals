Differences in the alpha diversity index Shannon index were statistically significant between the shoot and leaf stages shoot average 14 2.078 leaf average 14 1.195 p  0.05.

OTU15 belongs to the genus Clostridium sensu stricto 1 whose average ratio in the shoot versus leaf stages was 0.0103 versus 0.0477 OTU137 embodies an unknown genus in the order Clostridiales average of representation 0.0035 in shoot versus 0.0287 in leaf.

This group involving digestion of cellulose and hemicellulose included beta-glucosidase blgX EC3.2.1.21 with relative over- representation of 1162.90 in the shoot stage versus 2403.27 in the leaf stage and xylan 14-beta-xylosidase xynB EC3.2.1.37 with relative over-representation of 329.41 in the shoot stage versus 820.33 in the leaf stage.

We posit that the coexistence of the two groups of pathways identified here is required as a kind of reinforcement to secure related bacteria species respon- sible for raw fibre digestion and utilization and therefore maintains the adaptive capacities of gut microbiomes to nutrient scarcity during the leaf stage.d Interactions between the gut microbiome and gut environment in the shoot stageFunctional metagenomic analysis revealed distinctive functionsover-represented in the shoot stage consistent with the high protein content of bamboo during this stage.

Most genes with significant over-representation FDR q-value  0.05 in these pathways were in the shoot stage.A more diverse gut microbiome was observed during the bamboo shoot stage than leaf stage.

The leaf stage was September to April when giant pandas eat Bashania fargesii abbreviated as Bfa hereafter leaves the shoot stage was from May to July when pandas eat Bfa shoots and Fargesia qinlingensis abbreviated as Fqi hereafter shoots and the transition stage was from August when they eat Fqi leaves mixed with Bfa leaves.Bamboo sample collection and nutritional analysesFresh bamboo samples were collected in the same reserve from 2012 to 2013.

The concentration of fat did not differ between the shoot and leaf stages.Changes in gut microbiome diversity and nutritionSixteen Svedberg rRNA-targeted metagenome sequencing resulted in a total of 274 605 raw reads from 30 faecal DNA samples.

The gut microbiome during the shoot stage was always richer and more diverse than in the leaf stage ef electronic supplementary material figure S1.

The distinc- tiveness of gut microbiomes in the shoot and leaf stages was revealed across a series of metabolic pathways within KEGG databases.
