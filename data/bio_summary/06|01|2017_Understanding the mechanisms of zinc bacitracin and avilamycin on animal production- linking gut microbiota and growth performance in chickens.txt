Our results suggest that a lower abundance of the highly dominant genus Lactobacillus could have promoted the growth of other less-dominant taxa increasing the diver- sity and shifting the composition of the gut microbiota in treated chickens.Associations between microbiota and performance measuresThis study found strong associations between gut microbiota and the growth performance of the birds reinforcing previous findings Geier et al.

Here we investigated the effect of zinc bacitracin and avilamycin on growth performance and caecal microbiota in chickens and analysed associations be- tween individual bacteria and growth performance.

Antibiotics have an impact on the intestinal microbiota yet it is unclear whether they increase growth performance by reducing the energetic cost of the intestinal system through reductions oftotal gut microbiota Collier et al.

Despite the reductions in the latter two taxa all growth performance measures remained similar between avilamycin-treated and avilamycin-untreated control chickens suggesting inferior performance of this anti- biotic as a growth promoter in comparison to zinc bacitracin under the conditions used here.

95.40 showed negative correlations with FCR P  0.001 r  -0.368 and P  0.001 r  -0.366 respectively and positive correlations with BWG P  0.021 r  0.168 and P  0.001 r  0.259respectively.DiscussionInter- and intra-trial comparisons of microbiota composition and growth performanceConsidering the widespread use of antibiotics in the poultry industry it is important to discern their impact on gut micro- biota and growth performance in order to understand their mode of action and enable the development of alternative production and treatment strategies for reduced reliance on antibiotic feed enhancers.

Further research is necessary to investigate at a community level the interactions between antibiotic administration and Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species in order to identify the underlying mechanisms leading to improved growth performance.Overall this study found that zinc bacitracin may enhance growth performance and even increase caecal microbiota di- versity in some communities associated with reductions in the abundance of dominant species.

.ResultsGrowth performance measuresComparison of the performance of the birds in trial 1 to that seen in trial 2 showed that the trials differed signifi- cantly in each of the four performance measures.

Additionally other species of Lactobacillus were also correlated with the growth performance of chickens yet their numbers were not affected by the antibiotics.There were contrasting differences in Lactobacillus associ- ations with performance measures.

Avilamycin produced no effect on growth performance and exhibited little significant disturbance of the microbiota struc- ture.
