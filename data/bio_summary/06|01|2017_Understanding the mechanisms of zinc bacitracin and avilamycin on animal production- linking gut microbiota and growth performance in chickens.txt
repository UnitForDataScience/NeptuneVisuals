Here we investigated the effect of zinc bacitracin and avilamycin on growth performance and caecal microbiota in chickens and analysed associations be- tween individual bacteria and growth performance.

Despite the reductions in the latter two taxa all growth performance measures remained similar between avilamycin-treated and avilamycin-untreated control chickens suggesting inferior performance of this anti- biotic as a growth promoter in comparison to zinc bacitracin under the conditions used here.

Our results support the need for more discussion by indicating that some Lactobacillus species might have contrasting consequences for the health of the host expressed as growth performance.In addition to the lactobacilli the genus Bacteroides was also associated with improved growth low FCR values in chickens.

Our results suggest that a lower abundance of the highly dominant genus Lactobacillus could have promoted the growth of other less-dominant taxa increasing the diver- sity and shifting the composition of the gut microbiota in treated chickens.Associations between microbiota and performance measuresThis study found strong associations between gut microbiota and the growth performance of the birds reinforcing previous findings Geier et al.

Further research is necessary to investigate at a community level the interactions between antibiotic administration and Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species in order to identify the underlying mechanisms leading to improved growth performance.Overall this study found that zinc bacitracin may enhance growth performance and even increase caecal microbiota di- versity in some communities associated with reductions in the abundance of dominant species.

For instance research has shown that two antibiotic treatments bacitracinvirginiamycin or monensin promoted the growth of Clostridia and reduced the microbiota diversity in the ileum of broiler chickens Lu et al.

Although this is a generalisation and it is strongly influenced by specific host species it is likely that inter-trial differences in this ratio contributed to differences in productivity outcomes seen in the current trials.The two antibiotics produced different results in growth performance and modification of the caecal microbiota of chickens.
