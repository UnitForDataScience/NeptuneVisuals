in addition lipase activity within the ocular sur- face environment can lead to saponification with further degradation of lipid layer cohesivity and exacerbation of dry eye signs and symptoms.24 it is important therefore that a cleanser reduces that bacterial load but does not significantly affect the diversity of resident species around the eyelids.previous studies have suggested that patients with eyelid abnormalities such as blepharitis are at higher risk for devel- oping postoperative endophthalmitis.25 mino de kaspar et al26 found a significant increase in the incidence of multiresis- tant bacteria in patients with local eg blepharitis andor systemic risk factors diabetes or skin disease compared with healthy patients with normal eyelids.the importance of lid hygiene before ocular surgery was highlighted in a recent study by peral et al.27 this single- center prospective study evaluated the ocular microbiota of 45 consecutive patients who treated their eyes scheduled for surgery twice a day for 5 days with a regimen of heat massage and sterile eyelid wipes containing hyaluronic acid capryloyl glycine iris florentine and centella asiatica.

the total s. epidermidis colony-forming units were reduced by 99.5. the hocl hygiene solution removed staphylococcal isolates that were resistant to multiple antibiotics equally well as those isolates that were susceptible to antibiotics.conclusion the application of a saline hygiene solution preserved with pure hocl acid reduced the bacterial load significantly without altering the diversity of bacterial species remain- ing on the skin under the lower eyelid.keywords blepharitis microbiome propionibacterium acnes corynebacterium staphylococcus aureus staphylococcus epidermidisintroductionthe skin is an ecosystem of diverse habitats and niches that support a wide array of microorganisms including bacteria fungi and viruses.1 many of these species are harmless or even beneficial providing protection against more pathogenic species.

pure hocl is produced naturally as an element of the human immune response.14 during the oxidative burst small highly reactive molecules such as hocl are generated as white blood cells respond to pathogens in the body.15 this compound is an oxidant that kills bacteria through protein and lipid peroxidation andor halogenation.15 hocl has a broad spectrum of activity and exhibits rapid kill kinetics.1617 the compound 0.01 is the key preservative ingredient in an ocular hygiene product that is designed to clean the area around the lids and lashes.17 this study measured the effect of eyelid hygiene solution preserved with 0.01 hocl on ocular skin flora.materials and methodsthis multicenter post-marketing study was conducted across four private practice sites in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the declaration of helsinki1964 1975 1983 1989 and 1996 the international conference on harmonization and good clinical practice and in compliance with local regulatory requirements.

the prevalent species identified prior to treatment in the peral et al's27 study were consistent with those of the current study in patients with blepharitis and mgd.

the change in bacterial load in terms of both numbers of unique strains and cfus dramatically decreased after treatment table 4. treatment with 0.01 hocl hygiene solution resulted in a 99.6 reduction in the number of staphylococci cfusat 20 minutes and a 99.5 reduction in s. epidermidiscfus figure 2.the susceptibility profile to selected antibiotics for thes.

s. epidermidisand s. aureus appeared to participate actively in the physio- pathology of blepharitis.20results from the current study support this conclusion since corynebacterial and staphylococcal isolates par- ticularly s. epidermidis were the most common bacteria recovered in blepharitis and mgd patients prior to treat- ment.

the table of bacterial diversity table 3 demonstrates that although there were fewer spe- cies and strains after treatment the diversity of bacterial genera and species was not appreciably different after treat- ment with the hocl hygiene solution.

epidermidis isolates recovered before and 20 minutes after one application of the eyelid hygiene solution to the surface of the skin just below the eyelid is presented in table 5. the percentage of isolates resistant to each antibiotic tested and the breakpoint used to define resistance dem- onstrates that the percentage of strains resistant to a given antibiotic after a single application of hocl-preserved hygiene solution was comparable to that observed before the use of the cleanser.

and s. aureus were the most common of the 57 unique bacterial species recovered from 332 patient lids with blepharitis and 160 control patients without blepharitis.
