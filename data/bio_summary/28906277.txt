for example cmv and ebv can replicate in the gut and might contribute to local and systemic inflammation during hiv-infection in our study we investigated the effect of subclinical cmv and ebv replication in the intestinal mucosa on cytokine expression and microbiome composition of hiv-infected participants receiving art and hiv- uninfected controls.we observed that cmv and ebv are frequently detected in the intestinal mucosa of virally suppressed hiv- infected and hiv-uninfected participants.

4 and 5 sensitivity analysisto control for potential confounding effects of relevant covariates we performed sensitivity analysis for each outcome with sexual orientation sex age bmi hiv rna viral load dichotomized to detected versus nondetected and race.resultsstudy cohortthere were no statistically significant differences in terms of age sex and race among the hiv-infected and thecontrol participants  1. among hiv-infected participants the median cd4th t-cell count was 334 cellsml.

specifically among the hiv-uninfected controls higher probabilities of detecting cmv was associated with significantly upregulated expression of all six preselected cytokines in the ileum all p  0.02 and higher expression of il-8 and ifn-b1 in the colon p  0.05 2. presence of cmv was not associated with any difference in mucosal gene expression among hiv- infected participants all p  0.14. when cmv was detected at lower probabilities gene expression levels were significantly higher in hiv-infected participants than in hiv-uninfected controls both in the ileum all p  0.001 and in the colon all p  0.05 except for il-1b p 0.09. conversely when cmv was detectable with higher probability gene expression was not significantly different between the two groups in the colon all p  0.17 except for il-1b p 0.04 or in the ileum all p  0.07 except for il-1b p  0.01. there was no significant effect of detectable ebv on any colonic mucosal biopsy site in either group all p  0.17.model results for intestinal microbiome compositionthe relative abundance of the main phyla in the colon and ileum was assessed in relation to hiv-status and presence of cmv or ebv.

hiv-infected individuals were less likely to present detectable cmv than hiv-uninfected controls median or 0.19 95 credible interval 0.03-0.78 pb 0.02 1a and cmv was more likely to be detected in the terminal ileum than in the colon or 3.20 1.002-11.21 pb 0.05. hiv-infected participants were more likely to have detectable ebv than hiv-uninfected controls or 3.92 1.08-21.41 pb 0.04 1b whereasthe odds of detecting ebv in the ilium was similar to that in the colon or 14 1.80 0.64-5.76 pb 14 0.3.model results for cytokine activity levelsas cmv can induce il-6 ifn-g and il-1b those cytokines were selected a priori to be part of the analysis and were not included in the following factor analysis.

the characteristics of the study participants were previously described and are summarized in 1. overall all hiv-infected participants were on art and all but three had hiv rna below the limit of detection at the time of sample collection.bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing sequence processing and quality assessment sequencingsequencing procedures and analysis of generated data were previously described briefly dna was extracted using a commercially available fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon ohio usa.

among hiv-infected participants higher cmv was only associated with lower relative abundance of actinobacteria in the ileum p 14 0.03. presence of cmv was associated with upregulated expression of all selected cytokines in the ileum all p 14 0.02 and higher expression of il-8 and ifn-b1 in the colon all p  0.05 of hiv-uninfected participants but not among hiv-infected.

hiv-infected participants had an increased probability of detecting ebv compared with hiv-negative participants.

the hiv rna levels were below the limit of detection 75 copiesml for 16 out of 19 patients the remaining three participants had viral loads of 179 1094 and 4604 copiesml.among the 19 hiv-positive individuals 12 self-identified as msm three as heterosexuals and for four participants sexual orientation was unknown.

these data highlight the role of cmv as a possible cofactor in intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and suggest a possible novel target to prevent inflammation during hiv-infection.ileum biopsy samples1415right colon biopsy samples2219left colon biopsy samples2216iqr interquartile range.methodsclinical study participants and study design colonic mucosal biopsy samples were obtained from the rush university medical center rumc institutional review board irb-approved gastrointestinal reposito- ry from which 19 hiv-infected participants and 22 controls were matched by demographic variables age sex and race.

surprisingly the hiv-infected participants had significantly less cmv compared with hiv-uninfected participants.

the sequences were rarified to the minimum number of high-quality sequences in all samples and normalized by total count for the diversity analyses model results for intestinal cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus replicationirrespective of hiv status cmv and ebv were detected in at least one intestinal site in 60.5 and 78.9 of the study participants respectively.

the effect of cmv and ebv replication on the microbiome composition and mrna- expression of selected cytokines il-6 ifn-g il-1b ccl2 il-8 and ifn-b1 was evaluated.results overall cmv and ebv were detected in at least one intestinal site in 60.5 and 78.9 of participants respectively.

principal coordinates analysis of all of the samples at the otu level confirmed clustering of samples by hiv-status but not by cmv or ebv 3. among hiv-infected participants a higher probability of detecting cmv was associated with lower relative abundance of actinobacteria p 0.03 in the ileum.

hiv-infected individuals demonstrated less detect- able cmv p 14 0.04 cmv was more frequently detected in terminal ileum than colon p 14 0.04. detectable ebv was more frequent among hiv-infected p 14 0.05 without differences by intestinal site.
