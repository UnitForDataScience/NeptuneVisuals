Characteristics of study population HIV-infected and HIV- uninfected.Infection with HIV is associated with alterations in theHIV-uninfectedHIV-infectedgut-associated lymphoid tissue GALT which occurearly in the course of infection and contributes to persistent immune dysfunction and HIV disease progres- sion Mucosal HIV replication and consequent depletion of GALT-associated CD4th T cells is associated with epithelial barrier damage and increased translocation of bacterial products from the gut into systemic blood circulation microbial translocation In turn microbial translocation is associated with systemic immune activation and predicts disease progression and mortality in untreated and treated HIV-infected indivi- controls n 14 22 participants n 14 19Age in years median IQR 54.5 51-5952 50-55 Sex malefemale175163 Sexual orientationHomosexual412Heterosexual163Not known24BMI in kg median IQR29.7 25.7-3124.8 22.7-32.3Raceduals 7.Recent studies described the effect of HIV-infection onCD4th median cell count median IQRHIV RNA copiesml median min-maxNA334 220-581-nd nd-4604the composition of the gut microbiome and onthe mucosal gene expression profile .

For example CMV and EBV can replicate in the gut and might contribute to local and systemic inflammation during HIV-infection In our study we investigated the effect of subclinical CMV and EBV replication in the intestinal mucosa on cytokine expression and microbiome composition of HIV-infected participants receiving ART and HIV- uninfected controls.We observed that CMV and EBV are frequently detected in the intestinal mucosa of virally suppressed HIV- infected and HIV-uninfected participants.

HIV-infected participants had an increased probability of detecting EBV compared with HIV-negative participants.

HIV-infected participants were more likely to have detectable EBV than HIV-uninfected controls OR 3.92 1.08-21.41 PB 0.04 1b whereasthe odds of detecting EBV in the ilium was similar to that in the colon OR 14 1.80 0.64-5.76 PB 14 0.3.Model results for cytokine activity levelsAs CMV can induce IL-6 IFN-g and IL-1b those cytokines were selected a priori to be part of the analysis and were not included in the following factor analysis.

The HIV RNA levels were below the limit of detection 75 copiesml for 16 out of 19 patients the remaining three participants had viral loads of 179 1094 and 4604 copiesml.Among the 19 HIV-positive individuals 12 self-identified as MSM three as heterosexuals and for four participants sexual orientation was unknown.

These data highlight the role of CMV as a possible cofactor in intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and suggest a possible novel target to prevent inflammation during HIV-infection.Ileum biopsy samples1415Right colon biopsy samples2219Left colon biopsy samples2216IQR interquartile range.MethodsClinical study participants and study design Colonic mucosal biopsy samples were obtained from the Rush University Medical Center RUMC Institutional Review Board IRB-approved gastrointestinal reposito- ry from which 19 HIV-infected participants and 22 controls were matched by demographic variables age sex and race.

Surprisingly the HIV-infected participants had significantly less CMV compared with HIV-uninfected participants.

Overall all HIV-infected participants were on ART and all but three had HIV RNA below the limit of detection at the time of sample collection.Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing sequence processing and quality assessment SequencingSequencing procedures and analysis of generated data were previously described Briefly DNA was extracted using a commercially available FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil MP Biomedicals Solon Ohio USA.

4 and 5 Sensitivity analysisTo control for potential confounding effects of relevant covariates we performed sensitivity analysis for each outcome with sexual orientation sex age BMI HIV RNA viral load dichotomized to detected versus nondetected and race.ResultsStudy cohortThere were no statistically significant differences in terms of age sex and race among the HIV-infected and thecontrol participants  1.

The sequences were rarified to the minimum number of high-quality sequences in all samples and normalized by total count for the diversity analyses Model results for intestinal cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus replicationIrrespective of HIV status CMV and EBV were detected in at least one intestinal site in 60.5 and 78.9 of the study participants respectively.
