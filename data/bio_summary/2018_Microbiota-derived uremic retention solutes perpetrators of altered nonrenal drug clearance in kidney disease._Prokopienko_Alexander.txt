High concentrations of microbiota-derived toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate perpetrate interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters which provides a mechanistic link between increases in drug-related adverse events and dysbiosis in kidney disease.Areas Covered--This review summarizes the effects of microbiota-derived uremic toxins on hepatic phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.

This represents a potential shift for clinical pharmacology from strictly bactericidal antibiotic therapies to innovative and novel microbiota-centered therapeutic strategies.Key IssuesThere are known alterations to hepatic drug metabolism and transport pathways in patients with kidney disease that place this population at increased risk of drug-related adverse events.Prokopienko and NolinPage 13Microbial imbalances known as dysbiosis in kidney disease potentially increases the production and the absorption of microbiota-derived uremic toxins.Microbiota-derived uremic toxins accumulate in advancing stages of kidney disease and directly affect Phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transport pathways.Microbiota-derived uremic toxin research in kidney disease patients presents unique opportunities for clinical pharmacologists.

Advances in human microbiome research provide unique opportunities to systematically evaluate the impact of individual and combined microbial toxins on drug metabolism and transport and to explore microbiota-derived uremic toxins as potential therapeutic targets.KeywordsDrug metabolism drug transporters nonrenal clearance human microbiome kidney disease microbiota-derived uremic toxins microbial toxins uremic toxinsCorrespondence to Thomas D.

Therefore this review highlights the effects of microbiota- derived uremic toxins on drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters focusing on individual toxins rather than uremia in general.We present a comprehensive review of the effects of microbiota-derived uremic toxins on hepatic phase I and phase II drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.

The biotransformation of indoxyl sulfate requires CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 hepatic enzymes and demonstrates the importance of these pathways in microbiota-derived uremic toxin formation Figure 2.Formation of p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate is decreased in chronic kidney disease patients and animal models with advanced liver cirrhosis and thus impaired hepatic metabolism 28.

Nevertheless the evidence to date suggests that microbiota-derived uremic toxins and especially indoxyl sulfate affect CYP3A4 activity and potentially expression.CYP1A2Microbiota-derived uremic toxins also affect CYP1A activity and expression 465558-60 with idole-3-acetic acid and indoxyl sulfate being the most potent.

Microbiota-derived uremic toxins such as p-cresol sulfate indoxyl sulfate indole-3-acetic acid CMPF kynurenic acid and hippuric acid perpetrate interactions withphase III metabolic enzymes and drug transporters.

Similar to its effects on CYP1A2 indoxyl sulfate induces mRNA expression of UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 in primary human hepatocytes 59.In summary microbiota-derived uremic toxins inhibit SULT GST and UGT activity which might contribute to altered drug exposure and response and high rates of adverse drug events in kidney disease patients.

The MEDLINE bibliographic database was searched through PubMed using relevant search terms including uremic toxins uremic retention solutes uremia drug metabolism drug transport kidney disease renal disease nonrenal clearance and human microbiome.

These metabolic interactions and the wide variation of uremic toxin concentrations Table 3 may partially explain the interindividual variability of alterations in Phase I drug metabolism in kidney disease patients.Phase II Metabolic PathwaysMicrobiota-derived uremic toxins also appear to interact with Phase II drug metabolism pathways Table 2.
