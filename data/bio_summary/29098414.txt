krill oil treatment in the ld and hd groups restored the changes in the abundance of bacteroidales 21.89 p  0.05 and 24.69 p  0.05 vshfd group and lactobacillales 4.51 and 10.43 p  0.05 vs hfd group while it exacerbated the differences in clostridiales 12.35 p  0.05 and 7.5 p  0.05 vs hfd group fig.

however fecal microbiota do not represent all the microbial communities in the gi tract and the microbiota is altered by the spatial location within the intestine zhao et al.

in addition the microbiota structural alterations obtained from fecal sam- ple sequencing showed that low-dose ld and moderate- dose md treatments shift the structure to that of the control group while the hd group has a unique pattern that differs from that of the high-fat diet hfd and control groups lu et al.

statistical signifi- cance was defined as p  0.05. the specific phylotypes that were altered by the hfd andor krill oil were screened by redundancy analysis rda models xu et al.

ld and hd treat- ment of krill oil restored the changes in the abundance of bacteroidales 48.14 and 48.71 p  0.05 vs hfd group and lactobacillales 1.48 and 4.13 p  0.05 vs hfd group.

a high-fiber diet alters the gut microbiota and alleviates the symptoms of hypertension and heart failure in hypertensive mice marques et al.

recently 16s rrna gene se- quencing of fecal samples shows that krill oil treatment alle- viates hyperlipidemia and fecal microbiota in a dose- dependent manner moreover high-dose hd krill oil simul- taneously promotes the amelioration of hyperlipidemia and obesity lu et al.

.similar to our previous study on krill oil most studies sequence the microbiota from fecal samples instead of the gi tract bindels et al.
