In comparison of the four groups' treatments the numbers of unique genera for each group were 39 control group 2 low dosage group 6 PKPD dosage group and 32 high dosage group respectively.

The unique genera in the withdrawal periods of the four groups were 29 for control group 3 for low dosage group 29 for PKPD group and 30 for high dosage group.The NMDS analysis was conducted to determine the changes of community structure of the four dosage groups.

In the comparisons of treatment with withdrawal in each group genera whose abundances were higher in the treatment period than in the withdrawal period were marked with orange color otherwise marked with blue.TT treatment WD withdrawal A control group B low dosage group C PKPD dosage group D high dosage group.FIGURE S3  Venn diagram of the core and unique OTUs of the treatment A and withdrawal B period in each group.

The Salmonella was significantly reduced to a lower level in the low dosage group 0-0.006 and PKPD dosage group 0-0.004.

The average values of Chao1 were highest in the high dosage group and followed by control group PKPD group and low dosage group .

Low dosage group and PKPD dosage group were not clustered separately from the non-medicated group.

The results showed that the shedding levels of Salmonella were significantly reduced in the high dosage group as demonstrated by both the culturing method and 16S rRNA sequencing method.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling NMDS analysis results showed that the microbial community of high dosage group was clearly separated from the other three groups.
