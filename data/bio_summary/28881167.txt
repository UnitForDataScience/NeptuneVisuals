tuuli ahlstrand university of turku characterized the binding of il-8 to hofq proposing a mechanism of internalization of il-8 into the bacterial cells.graham stafford university of sheffield brought forward the often-neglected role of glycoproteins on the host-pathogen interface particularly since bacteria have evolved enzymes to access those for their benefit.

pirjo peurarneuranen university of helsinki presented data on a cell wall protein of the opportunistic yeast candida glabrata which could activate prommp-8.dierdre devine university of leeds presented data on the association between the subgingival microbiome periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis using next gener- ation sequencing.

the presentations from the oral sessions are elaborated fur- ther in this meeting report whereas the corresponding abstracts are published in a 2017 supplement issue of the journal of oral microbiology.upon completion of the 12th eomw the satellite symposium integrated diag- nostics for oral infections was held within the frame of the eu horizon2020 consortium diagoras  .oral microbial ecology and the oral microbiomefollowing the opening address of the 12th eomw chair george belibasakis karolinska institutet mike curtis queen mary university of london opened the first ses- sion with his keynote lecture entitled oral microbiology- progress myths and evidence.

nezar al-hebshi temple university presented evidence for the association of the oral bacteriome and mycobiome with oral squamous cell carcinoma.

several inflammatory bacterial attributes were enriched in the tumors whereas mycobiome analy- sis revealed also a dysbiotic fungal community domi- nated by c. albicans.jessica neilands malmeuro university investigated the effect of parvimonas micra on the proteolytic activity of a multi-species bacterial consortium.

susanne bloch university of natural reseour- ces and life sciences of vienna presented data on tan- nerella forsythia's cell surface s- layer and its role in multispecies biofilm formation.

mohamed al-haroni uit the arctic university of norway discussed the conjugative elements of the tn916tn916-like transposons which contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes between bacterial species.

it was shown in selected oral streptococci and enterococci strains that both the excision rate of tn916 and its autonomous replication increased due to antimi- crobial challenge and loss of bacterial fitness was associ- ated with multiple acquisitions of tn916.dental caries and endodontic infectionsthe next session dedicated to dental caries and endodon- tic infections was opened by the keynote lecture of egija zaura university of amsterdam and vrije universiteit amsterdam entitled omics in cariology and endo- dontology - what have we learned so far.

the challenge for the researchers in the coming years will be to reach this next level and be able to integrate multiple complex datasets with clinical meta-data paving the road to clinical breakthroughs.ingegerd johansson umeao university presented data on the salivary and tooth biofilm microbiota in caries and low-caries populations using two sequencing plat- forms.

thuy do university of leeds compared the bacterial metatranscriptome of root caries to sound root surface biofilms using an rna-sequencing approach.

differen- tial analysis indicated unique gene expression profiles in carious and sound root surface biofilms.moving more towards the field of endodontics ilona persoon university of amsterdam and vrije universi- teit amsterdam assessed the complex microbiome of the root canal system using next generation sequencing.

it opened with the keynote lecture of george hajishengallis university of pennsylvania enti- tled dysbiosis and inflammation in periodontitis syn- ergism and implications for treatment.

since inflammatory tissue breakdown prod- ucts serve as nutrients for the persistence of dysbiotic microbial communities it becomes evident that inflam- mation and dysbiosis reciprocally reinforce each other accounting - at least in part - for the chronicity of periodontitis.the next presentation by asil alsam queen mary university of london provided evidence that specific pathogen free spf laboratory mice have a simpler microbiolome composition compared to wild wood mice apodemus sylvaticus which displayed a qualitatively greater and quantitatively more complex oral micro- biome.

disease-associ- ated changes were observed in the distribution ofoligotypes of health and periodontitis-associated genera between the oral niches particularly on the tongue.anders johansson umeao university discussed varia- tions in the expression of aggregatibacter actinomyce- temcomitans' leukotoxin.
