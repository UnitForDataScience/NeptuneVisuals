OTU operational taxonomic unit BW body weight BMI body mass index BMI1 BMI at the beginning of 1st trimester BMI2 body mass index at the end of 3rd trimester BW1 body weight at the beginning of 1st trimester BW2 body weight at the end of 3rd trimester IGF-1 insulin-like growth factor-1.showed that birth weight determines the risks of metabolic syndrome in adult life for the time in a Chinese population 20 21.

For the infants it indicated that birth weight 4441.50-199.17 vs. 3147.00-78.32P  0.001 body length 52.20-1.32 vs. 49.20-1.03 P 0.001 ponderal index 31.02-2.61 vs. 26.47-1.57 P  0.001 and placenta weight 941.00-114.26 vs. 593.75-69.01 P  0.001 were statistically increased in fetal macrosomia compared with newborns with normal birth weight.

Three to four OTUs were positively correlated with body length and placenta weight body weight and BMI at the end of 3rd trimester body weight and BMI increase during pregnancy of mothers and umbilical cord blood IGF-1 concentrations.

Both body weight 20.85-4.72 vs. 16.00-3.57 P  0.018 and BMI 7.86-1.98 vs. 5.96-1.33P  0.021 increase during pregnancy were higher in macrosomia compared to control group Table 2.Validation of the sequencing accuracy and community diversityTo profile the differences of birth weight on placenta microbiota structure we performed Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3 region for 20 placenta samples collected from the two groups.

However significant differences were observed in the estimators of community diversity indices including Shannon 2.76-0.52 vs. 1.97-0.66 P  0.02 and simpson 0.12-0.07 vs. 0.34-0.19 P  0.007between the two groups indicating higher micorbiota diversity in placenta from macrosomia Table 3.Overall structural changes of placental microbiota in response to birth weightCloser analyses of placental microbiota differences by virtue of birth weight were performed.

Theheatmap profile also indicated that microbial community structures in placentas had a marked difference between fetal macrosomia and normal birth weight Figure 4.Placental microbiota composition differ between macrosomias and controlsWe further investigated whether or not certain placental microbiota structure correlated with fetal macrosomia.

Regression analysis showed a cluster of key operational taxonomic unit OTUs phyla and genera were significantly correlated with body length ponderal index and placenta weight body weight increase during pregnancy of mothers and cord blood IGF-1 and leptin concentrations.

One to two key OTUs were negatively correlated with body weight and BMI at the beginning of 1st and the end of 3rdtrimester body weight and BMI increase during pregnancy in mothers.

Of note PrevotellaceaeNK3B31group was negatively correlated with several parameters including ponderal index placenta weight body weight and BMI at the end of 3rd trimester and BMI increased.

Fetal macrosomia is defined as a birth weight of 4000 g. It suggested that the wide variation of the sensitivity of ultrasonographic measurement of the fetal weight 25 we accurately weighed all the newborn immediately after birth which is the most accurate way of diagnosing fetal macrosomia.
