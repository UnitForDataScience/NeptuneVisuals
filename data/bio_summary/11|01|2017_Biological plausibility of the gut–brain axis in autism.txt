Organic abnormalities with neuroinflammatory and psychiatric consequences involving abnormal kynurenine and purine metabolism neurotransmitter and cytokine imbalances and altered levels of nutrients and metabolites are noted in autism and many of these abnormalities--specifically including increased intestinal permeability microbial metabolites and heightened serum levels of endotoxin--originate from the gut.Keywords gut-brain axis autism metabolitesIn their recent review Sherwin et al.1 discuss among many other issues the relationship of the gut microbiome-brain axis with autism under a section subtitled Microbiota-based therapies for the treatment of autism hype or hope Sherwin et al.1 largely discuss preclinical data citing only the 2017 open-label study by Kang et al.2 that used a sequence of oral vancomycin omeprazole polyethylene glycol laxative and standardized human fecal microbiota transplant to produce clinical benefit in subjects with autism.Readers will likely benefit from learning of addi- tional relevant clinical studies including the pub- lication by Sandler et al.3 showing the alleviation of autistic manifestations following treatment with oral vancomycin as well as case reports show- ing positive impact of various antimicrobial ther- apies metronidazole ketoconazole and amoxi- cillin in patients with autism.45 Autistic patients have been shown to have gut dysbiosis with yeast as well as Clostridia species6 the latter being a group of bacteria noted for their production of neu- rotoxic substances.
