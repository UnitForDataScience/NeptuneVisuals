How such data may precisely inform clinical study designs andor results in the future will depend on effective systematic reviews and meta-analysis outcome from the growing body of such data sets.

A Relative abundance of two bacterial species before and after RS4 treatment shown as mean  change log10 with corresponding p values B Percent change from before intervention of the same two bacterial species shown as individual data points with means and standard deviations on the side C Descriptive statistical information from the two data sets presented in A and B.

A recent commentary in Nature Methods discussed similar data presentation approaches in lieu of sample-to-sample variability and irreproducibility of scientific data particularly in biomedical disciplines .

This article brings forward some current perspectives in prebiotic research to discuss why reporting of individual variations in response to interventions will be important to discern suitability of prebiotics as a disease prevention tool.Keywords prebiotics disease prevention dietary bioactives resistant starch type 4 intervention response variabilityThe ancient Greek physician Hippocrates perceived food as the key player in the maintenance of health not just as a fuel to run the human body.

The information presented in the last four rows are less frequently reported in clinical trial publications.Assessing disease risk in susceptible populations remains one major objective of personalized or precision nutrition allowing for stratifications of subpopulations in a manner that improves the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of interventions and follow-ups.

For similar reasons personalized microbiome profiling while deemed promising as a tool for disease risk stratification is not ready for translation to a clinical setting.

Therefore while personalized microbiome profiling may be useful for predicting and mitigating disease it will take a huge scientific undertaking before it is ready for the clinical setting.In the past few decades there has been a surge in metabolic diseases that affect quality of life and pose a substantial medical and economic burden on society.

However here the author focusses on one other question that emerges from all of this will it benefit the scientific community in the long run if such side observations of response variability are routinely reported Is it possible that we are missing out on information that may hold the key to unlocking some of the mysteries of diet and the microbiome interactions by not reporting individual responses to dietary interventions Currently there is little enthusiasm from both scientists and publishers to report such information as data without statistical significance would rarely contribute to the conclusions drawn from the work.

The most common format for reporting such data is mean  change or fold change along with the p-value.

Less frequently individual data points with column means and associated descriptive statistical information are shown Figure BC.
