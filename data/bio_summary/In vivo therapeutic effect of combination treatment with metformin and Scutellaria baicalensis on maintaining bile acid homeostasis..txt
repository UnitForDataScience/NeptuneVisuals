Abundant flavonoids in SB are responsible for these pharmacological effects.Although the principal constituents of SB are baicalin baicalein and wogonin  SB contains almost 70 polyphenols such as chalones flavanonols and anthocyanidines -.

In this study we hypothesized that co-administration of SB extract and metformin could exert a bet- ter effect on obesity-induced insulin resistance and lipid metabolism than treating with met- formin alone.When SB ethanol extract and metformin were co-administered to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats hepatic antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase were ele- vated .

Chicago SPSS Inc..ResultsImpact of co-administration of metformin and SB on serum total cholesterol glucose and insulin tolerances and other clinical parametersThe level of serum total cholesterol in rats exposed to metformin and SB combination MetSB group but not metformin alone was significantly lower compared to the OLETF group  .

In IPITT the AUC of both metformin and MetSB groups was significantly lower than OLETF group and the difference between MetSB and OLETF groups was more pronounced than that between MetSB and OLETF groupsp  0.034 and p  0.001 respectively.Administration of SB up-regulated gene expressions of hepatic CYP7A1 and NR1H4To search for the clues of action mechanism when SB is concurrently administered with met- formin we analyzed RNA extracted from the liver tissues using PCR array  .

This suggests that although metformin and SB both act like FXR agonists CYP7A1 expression was not inhibited when metformin is adminis- tered with SB.

The specific roles of this author are articulatedAbstractThe radix of Scutellaria baicalensis SB is a herb widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat metabolic diseases.

We hypothesized that co- administration of SB extract and metformin exerts a better effect on obesity-induced insulin resistance and lipid metabolism than treatment with metformin alone.

We compared the effect of metformin 100 mg10 mLkgday alone with co-administration of metformin 100 mg5 mLkgday and SB extract 200 mg5 mLkgday on Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty rats a useful model of type II diabetes with obesity and used Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats as a control.

We observed a synergetic effect of metformin and SB on lowering cholesterol level by excretion of bile acid through feces.

Reasonable candidates for the combination treatment with metformin are herbs traditionally used for treating metabolic diseases.The root of Scutellaria baicalensis SB also known as Scutellariae radix or skullcap root is widely used in traditional Oriental medicine for its beneficial effects such as antioxidant  anti-tumor  anti-inflammatory   antiviral  neuroprotective  and anti-diabetic effects .
