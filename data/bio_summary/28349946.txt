Hence in this study the Lactobacillus in the duodenum and cecum might play a major gene role and other differentially abundant microbes in cecum perform the minor gene role in influencing host feed efficiency.In conclusion with the high-throughput sequencing technology this study profiled the microbial communi- ties in the duodenum cecum and feces which represent the niches of the anterior segment posterior segment and the end of gastrointestinal tract respectively.

In addition significant absorption of glucose was observed in the cecum and a higher ability to actively absorb sugars at low concentrations was found in the cecum compared with the jejunum.

However the Lactobacillus in the cecum and feces was weakly corre- lated with corresponding Shannon index.Similarities of the microbial communities among the duodenum cecum and feces.

The results showed that the microbial community in the cecum was quite different from those in the duodenum and feces.

The cecum which is full of microbial fermentations plays important roles in preventing pathogen colonization detoxifying harmful substances recycling nitrogen and absorbing additional nutrients.

The predominant microbes in the duodenum cecum and feces were similar at the phylum level in which Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the major microbes.

The cecum was dominated by Bacteroides 21.7 in BFE 23.6 in PFE followed by Prevotella 6.2 in BFE 3.9 in PFE.

The significantly different taxa in the cecum FDR  0.05 and suggestively different taxa in the feces FDR  0.1 are listed in Supplementary Table.

The top 50 predicted functions were used as variants to hierarchically cluster the samples at the three sites 7 this clustering showed the distinct functions of the metagenome in the duodenum cecum and feces.

The finding that all differentially abundant FDR  0.05 microbes were observed in the cecum in the current study might have revealed a prominent role for cecal microbiota in feed efficiency.
