it is likely that characteristics of these genera allows them to flourish in the res- piratory tract while being rare in other locations such as the gastrointestinal tract .table 1table of common microbiota found within the regions of the respiratory tract.microbiota of the diseased respiratory systemwhile description of the microbial community of the healthy respiratory tract is indeed interesting the comparison to commu- nities found in diseased patients has begun to offer insights into factors affecting disease that were not even considered until about a decade ago.

indeed every surface of the human body in contact with the outside world is coated in microbes including the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus the respiratory tract from the mouth to the lungs the entirety of our skin even our eyes .

in addition to nutri- ents mucus attachment to the epithelial surface provides an adhesion site for bacteria decreasing the rate at which they are eliminated from the respiratory tract despite mucociliary beating that is generally accepted to move mucus out of the respiratory system.many surfaces in the respiratory tract are highly amenable to sampling for bacterial community analyses including those in the oral cavity nasopharynx oropharynx anterior nares and nasal vestibule.

likewise alterations in the diversity of microbial communities have been identified within the respiratory tract of smokers compared to non-smokers  and disease processes such as cystic fibrosis cf chronic obstructive pulmo- nary disease copd and asthma.cystic fibrosis is perhaps one of the best studied diseases affecting the respiratory tract in terms of bacterial community composition and shifts that may be associated with health and disease.

to date most studies in the respiratory tract of diseased individuals rely on a single sample type or do not include a large enough patient pop- ulation to determine this.future directions in respiratory microbial researchlarge knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the composition and function of the microbial community associated with the respiratory tract despite these large leaps in research in the last decade and a half.

these shared traits likely extend to similar niche characteristics that support bacterial communities and as such we suspect that similar microbes exist on upper and lower respiratory tract epithelium.

in this review we provide an overview of the modern collection and sequencing methods involved in respiratory microbiota research and outline the specific microbial communities that have been found to be associated with the healthy and diseased human respiratory tract.

demonstration of a remarkable similarity between the upper and lower respiratory tract in terms of microbiological presence adds further corroboration to the existence of a unified airway.c 2017 published by elsevier ltd.contentsintroduction68human microbiota e modern sequencing methods69sampling the respiratory system as a niche for bacteria69healthy human respiratory microbiota and the unified airway model71microbiota of the diseased respiratory system72the unified airway and implications of the microbiota in respiratory diseases72future directions in respiratory microbial research72financial disclosures72conflicts of interest72acknowledgements73references73introductionrhinitis and asthma share key elements of pathogenesis and have long been noted to co-occur suggesting that the upper and corresponding author.

indeed the unified airway model suggests that immunolog- ical responses in one section of the respiratory tract can be linked to responses in other areas e. data from the human microbiome project hmp presents further supportive evidence of this model.

bacterial communities in healthy lungs have been shown to be highly similar to those in the upper respiratory tract and shifts in one anatomical location may be associated with changes in others .

this is perhaps not surprising due to the ecologically similar 0954-6111c 2017 published by elsevier ltd.niches found throughout the respiratory tract many of which are covered in a continuous mucosal layer and bathed in mucus and saliva.research in the past few decades has shown that many of the roughly 1014 microbial cells that live in and on our bodies are necessary for our wellbeing .

understanding what grows attached to surfaces of the human body may give us not only a better view of what it means to be healthy but also open avenues to a better understanding of chronic diseases that may be associated with an altered microbiota and may aid in development of better treatments and perhaps even preventative measures.the goals of this review are three-fold 1 give a brief overview of how human microbiota research is conducted in general and specifically in the respiratory system 2 review the microbial community found associated with the healthy and diseased human respiratory tract and 3 discuss how this corroborates the unified airway model.human microbiota e modern sequencing methodsstudy of the human microbiota starts with sample collection.

each step in the overall protocol for how samples are handled introduces bias and studies done using different protocols are not always easily comparable to each other.sampling the respiratory system as a niche for bacteriafor the purposes of this review we use the term 'respiratory tract' loosely to include all epithelial surfaces associated with respiration and the path air takes to reach the lungs including surfaces from the anterior nares into the nasal cavity and sinuses back to the nasopharynx the soft tissue of the oral cavity back to the oropharynx down through the larynx trachea and finally to the lungs .

mucin producing goblet cells are found only in ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium while submucosal glands found throughout the respiratory tract are also known to produce mucus.mucin a heavily o-glycosylated protein is found in both saliva and the continuous mucus layer that covers all epithelial surfaces offig.
