However a body of literature suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of exercise depends on exercise intensity with response to variability dependent on the type of exercise cyclingrunningswimming exercise protocol acutechronic and the MS disease status relaps- ing-remitting RRprogressive .In this pilot study we aimed to develop a short two times week for 8 weeks aerobic training programme with multi-target therapeutic potential in individuals with MS.

Given that exercise can increase brain volume particularly in the hippo- campus  it will be of interest to determine if our exercise programme is associated with alterations in grey and white mater volume and integrity in RRMS patients.Exercise among MS patients improves mobility  QOL and walking ability  however a body of literature sug- gests that the therapeutic efficacy of exercise depends on ex- ercise intensity.

However the impact of exercise is depen- dent on the typeintensity of exercise training and hence there is a clear need to establish a routine exercise protocol that results in targeted clinical improvement in the patient reviewed in .

The findings demonstrate that an 8-week exercise programme 30 minday 2 daysweek for 8 weeks is sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness QOL cognitive performance and depression indices and that this exercise intervention was proven to be a feasible safe exercise protocol for RRMS patients.Fig.

Post hoc analysis revealed that exercise did not significantly impact energy levels in the healthy control cohort 64.78 - 3.78 pre-exercise vs. 74.00- 3.92 post-exercise however exercise induced a signifi- cant improvement in the energy levels in MS patients 32.56- 3.96 pre-exercise vs. 50.44 - 5.58 post-exercisep  0.001 Fig.

c however exercise reduced the percentage pain level indicated by MS patients 29.39 - 7.82 pre- exercise versus 12.41 - 4.80 Fig.

Our data also demonstrate that at discharge from the current exercise programme the CANTAB battery indicat- ed that exercise improved attention executive function cognitive flexibility and visuospatial memory in patients indi- cating that a short-term cycling programme can improve cog- nitive performance in this MS patient cohort.

Two patients took vita- min D supplementation.Effect of exercise on VO2peak body weight and BMIOn entry to the study there was no significant difference in aerobic fitness VO2max between healthy subjects 32.70 - 1.83 mlminkg and MS patients 30.00 -1.97 mlminkg Table .

Participants continued their standard medical care during the period of the study and were asked to avoid participation in any additional exercise programmes during the prescribed 8-week exercise pro- gramme.

To monitor this a weekly physical activity log was completed by all study participants.Exercise protocolThe exercise programme was conducted in the Human Physiology Laboratory Department of Physiology University College Cork and consisted of a 30-min exercise session involv- ing cycle ergometry using a static Monark RT2 Recumbent Bike Monark Exercise AB Kroons Sweden.
