Given the role gut microbiota plays in the gut inflammatory response it is highly likely that gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of MDD by influencing the immune system and the inflammation response.Further investigation of the correlation between MDD and the composition of microbiota is required to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which microbiota contribute to mood disorders.Overall gut flora may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and MDD through the production of key molecules andor promotion of intestinal immune response Figure 1.Targeting microbiota in major psychiatric disordersAs we gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between dysbiosis and the development of schizophrenia and MDD initial steps are being taken to explore the possibility of targeting microbiota as treatment options for both 64.

Nevertheless the development of gut microbiota is shaped by early-life events including mode of delivery type of feeding the application of antibiotics to the mother during delivery and the gender of the infant 51-53 therefore the link between schizophrenia and dysbiosis requires further examination.Pathogenesis of MDD and gut microbiotaMounting evidence supports the existence of a correlation between gut microbiota and the development of MDD 54 55.

As gut microbiota plays an important role in host metabolism and intestinal inflammation responses dysregulation of microbiota or dysbiosis can play a key role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases in the host 4-6 and can serve as an alternative target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases 7.In recent years interactions between the brain and gut microbiota have been explored as microbiota has been found to be an important player in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases 8 including multiple sclerosis 9 10 Alzheimer's disease 11 and Parkinson's disease 12.

This review discusses the possible role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder MDD and further summarizes clinical data where the microbiota was targeted as a potential treatment method.Pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the involvement of gut microbiotaSchizophrenia is a serious psychiatric disorder characterized by psychosis in which the involvement of the gut-brain axis has long been recognized 20 21.

The role of serotonin and its receptorsin MDD has long been established 61 62 and gut microbiota probably contribute to the development of MDD by affecting the tryptophan level.Additionally intestinal dysbiosis and a resultant leaky gut condition can lead to an increased immune response and contribute to the etiology of MDD 63.

More studies using larger populations will be required to fully examine the possibility of using probiotics as a treatment for MDD.CONCLUSIONSRecent studies have recognized and underscored the importance of interactions between the brain and the gut mediated by gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and MDD.

Studies comparing the gut microbial composition of patients both during a psychiatric disorder episode MDD or schizophrenia and when in remission should shed light on the interactions between the gut flora and the brain during an active disease state.

More recently Labus et al described a correlation between gut microbial composition and regional brain volume in patients with irritable bowel syndrome 14.

The brain modulates gut functions including motility acid secretion the production of bicarbonates as well as mucus and the immune response via the autonomic nervous system ANS thereby inducing responses to stress in the gastrointestinal system 16.
