Given the role gut microbiota plays in the gut inflammatory response it is highly likely that gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of MDD by influencing the immune system and the inflammation response.Further investigation of the correlation between MDD and the composition of microbiota is required to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which microbiota contribute to mood disorders.Overall gut flora may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and MDD through the production of key molecules andor promotion of intestinal immune response Figure 1.Targeting microbiota in major psychiatric disordersAs we gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between dysbiosis and the development of schizophrenia and MDD initial steps are being taken to explore the possibility of targeting microbiota as treatment options for both 64.

Nevertheless the development of gut microbiota is shaped by early-life events including mode of delivery type of feeding the application of antibiotics to the mother during delivery and the gender of the infant 51-53 therefore the link between schizophrenia and dysbiosis requires further examination.Pathogenesis of MDD and gut microbiotaMounting evidence supports the existence of a correlation between gut microbiota and the development of MDD 54 55.

A Gut flora possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia through modulation of BDNF the immune response in the gut and the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism.
