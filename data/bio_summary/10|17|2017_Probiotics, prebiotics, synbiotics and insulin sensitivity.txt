in a double-blind cross-over design a daily con- sumption of 20 g fos for 4 weeks decreased basal hepatic glucose production with no change in insulin-suppressed hepatic glucose production or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake using a hyperinsulinaemic clamp compared with a daily consumption of 20 g sucrose in twelve healthy subjects.

however in subjects with t2dm supplementation of 20 g fos had no effect on basal hepatic glucose production fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and on blood glucose and serum lipids.downloaded from .
