In a double-blind cross-over design a daily con- sumption of 20 g FOS for 4 weeks decreased basal hepatic glucose production with no change in insulin-suppressed hepatic glucose production or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake using a hyperinsulinaemic clamp compared with a daily consumption of 20 g sucrose in twelve healthy subjects.

However in subjects with T2DM supplementation of 20 g FOS had no effect on basal hepatic glucose production fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and on blood glucose and serum lipids.Downloaded from .
