This review will explore how specific members of the microbiota summarized in and  influence the hallmarks of cancer.How does the microbiota influence cellular proliferation and host cellular energeticsNormal tissues tightly regulate growth-promoting and death-inducing signals to maintain homeostatic cell densities tissue architecture and function.

Given the complexity of the microbial metabolome it will be important to broaden our inves- tigation beyond individual metabolites and consider the impact of the metabolome as a whole on cellular energetics and other hallmarks of cancer.How does the microbiota shape the local tumor microenvironmentThe microbiota influences cancer development by modulating the local tumor microenviron- ment through its effects on tissue remodeling and mucosal immunity.

Together these findings introduce the exciting prospect of manipulating the microbiota as a means of not only modulating cancer-associated tissue remodeling and immu- nity but also enhancing the efficacy of established anticancer therapies.Does the microbiota promote genome instability and mutationsThe breakdown of genome maintenance within the host whether through DNA damage accu- mulation or failure to properly segregate chromosomes allows premalignant and malignant cells to both retain and accelerate the rate of mutations.

However it has become well established that host-associated microbial communities termed microbiota also play integral roles in modulating various aspects of host physiology.

Perturbations to the microbiota also disrupt these homeostatic processes promoting the development of numerous diseases including inflamma- tory bowel diseases IBD and colorectal cancer CRC.

More recently fast and inexpensive next-generation sequencing methods combined with research initiatives to support multi-investigator research teams for example the National Institutes of Health NIH-funded Human Microbiome Project have revolution- ized our understanding of the microbiota and human disease.

Further knowledge defining how the microbiota modulates host physiology and disease pathogenesis particularly in the context of cancer will provide a framework for the holobiont concept of cancer develop- ment and enable the identification of novel microbial targets for preventative and therapeutic strategies.

Further studies will determine whether specific microbes influence angiogenesis and tumor-associated remodeling of the vasculature.The close proximity of the microbiota and mucosal immune system also provides the potential for endogenous bacteria to impact the tumor microenvironment by stimulating a variety of protumorigenic immune responses.
