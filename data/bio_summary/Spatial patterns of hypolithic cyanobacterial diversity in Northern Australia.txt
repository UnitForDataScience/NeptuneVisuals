We also address questions related to the number of rocks that neededto be sampled to determine a representative list of the cyanobacterial community composition a richness estimate of the cyanobacterial op- erational taxonomic units OTUs per rock and how this varies with location and rock size and cyanobacterial diversity as a function of rock characteristics size quartz crystal or quartz matrix.2  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Study site and sampling schemeThe study site was 10 km south of Kalkarindji NT Australia Tracy et al.

In order to test whether rock characteristics had an effect on the commu- nity structure a distance-based linear model and redundancy analysis dbRDA was conducted with factors distance class rock size weight and size dimensions and rock type crystal vs. matrix.

An additional 5.0 of the variance was explained by rock length p  .011 and 4.6 by rock type p  .011 while rock weight did not contribute to the model Fig.

2010 found that the community composition was similar under rocks sampled within an area of 100 m2 but few studies have inves- tigated patterns of hypolithic cyanobacterial community composition at distances small enough that climatic factors do not vary but great enough that immediate rock to rock dispersal is unlikely.

To address a secondary research question on the impact of rock size on the community con- tinuous factor rock length was also included as a co-variable to the PERMANOVA design.The distance-decay relationship was explored in Stata-14 using a generalized linear mixed model with a restricted maximum likelihood and the natural log of the Bray-Curtis similarities as outcome variable and the natural log of the distances between quadrats 1 as fixed factor and the quadrat combinations as random factors.

Data were displayed using GraphPad Prism 6 Graphpad Software CA USA.To test for OTUs changing between distance classes a negative binomial model was conducted in phyloseq on the variance stabilized OTU data implemented as described above.Operational taxonomic unit data were log transformed in Stata-14 and OTUs occurring at more than 0.1 in a sample were displayed in a Cytoscape network using the edge-weighted spring-embedded layout.Secondary analyses addressed the question of the impact of rock type crystal vs. matrix and rock dimensions mass length width and thickness upon the cyanobacterial community.

No difference in the number of OTUs OTU rich- ness nor Shannon diversity was found between different rock types rock weight or linear dimensions Mann-Whitney tests or Spearman's rank correlations p value ranged from .09 to .9 for all comparisons.

To assess whether rock length explained some of the differences in the bacterial com- munity observed between the different distance classes rock length was added as a continuous covariable to the PERMANOVA analysis with distance as a fixed factor.

There was a weak interaction effect between distance and rock length p  .06 indicating that the im- pact of distance upon the community slightly differed based on rock length.

The site at 10 m showed large variations in rock lengths and onceThe last five taxa listed were included because they were in the top 20 most abundant taxa for sites E F G or H.TABLE 2 A list of the top 20 average relative abundance of sequence counts taxa for combined sites ABCD ranked from most to least abundantTABLE 3 Rock characteristics per distance groupNumbers are median rock characteristics with the range in brackets.
