In addi- tion to the decrease of the translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis role of cecal microbiota that are similar to ALV-J infected chickens genes that take part in cell wallmembrane envelope biogenesis were also found to be sharply reduced.Dual infection of E. tenella further aggravated the reduced carbohydrate transport and metabolism function of cecal microbiota caused by ALV-J infection.

Chickens that were dual-infected with ALV-J and E. tenella showed prolif- eration of some bacteria like Planococcaceae and Bacillaceae in different chickens.

No obvious synergistic or additive effects were detected in the above bacteria in dual-infected chicks indicating that these bacteria may play little role in the pathogenicity caused by dual infection with E. tenella and ALV-J.

Thus it is urgent to study the possible role of these proliferated bacteria in regulating the functional abun- dance profile performed by cecal microbiota which might be of vital importance in revealing the pathology of multiply infected individuals.In conclusion both single or dual infection with E. tenella and ALV-J lead to obvious changes in cecal microflora of SPF chick- ens.

A synergy between ALV-J and E. tenella that results in increasing pathogenesis in SPF chickens was underlined previously .

Furthermore a significant enrichment of Lachnospiraceae Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae with the complete depletion of Ruminococcaceae RikenellaceaeTaBle 1  Number of OTUs per groups and estimators of sequence diversity and richness.OTUs operational taxonomic units ALV-J subgroup J avian leukosis virus E. tenella Eimeria tenella.and Porphyromonadaceae was also observed in dual-infected chickens at the family level .Genus distributions were also analyzed among different groups .

As for E. tenella and ALV-J dual infected chicks a marked enrichment of opportunistic pathogens in addition to some other bacteria that may play a role involving cecal microbiota carbohydrate transport and metabolic functions were also found compared to single pathogen-infected chicks.

These indexes preliminarily indicated that E. tenella sharply decreased the diversity and richness of cecal flora and that ALV-J infection induced growth of some bacteria than the control group.

Dual infection with E. tenella and ALV-J mainly caused proliferation of some bacteria compared to single-infected chicks and may play a role involving carbohydrate transport and metabolism function of cecal microbiota.
