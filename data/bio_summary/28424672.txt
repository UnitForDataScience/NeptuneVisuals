Modern metagenomic approaches   may permit the composition and dynamics of the microbiota of grapes from various Vitis species to be explored offering more detailed information on microbial diversity than is retrieved from culture-based studies     .This work reports a detailed analysis on the identity and dynamics of the yeast community present during spontaneous fermentation of grape must from a Vitis cultivar different from Vitis vinifera L. The collection of strains isolated in this work constitutes a potential source of valuable non-Saccharomyces andcerevisiae strains for enology research as well as for biological ecological and evolutionary studies on wine yeasts.

Sequences from representative strains were deposited in the GenBank NCBI database with the accession numbers KY693700 Candida azymoides IT0-016 KY693709 Candida californica IT2-010 KY693702 H. uvarum IT0-031 KY693711 Hanseniaspora vineae IT2-021 KY693701 Issatchenkia hanoiensis IT0-025 KY693704 Pichia cecembensis IT0-042 KY693703 Starmerella bacillaris IT0-033 KY693705 S. bacillaris IT1-027 KY693706 S. bacillaris IT1-033 KY693708 S. cerevisiae IT2-031 KY693710 S. cerevisiae IT4-007 and KY693707 T. delbrueckii IT1-039.Killer Phenotype and Ethanol ToleranceThe killer phenotype was analyzed using the diffusion agar technique   on YPD-methylene blue MB medium i.e.

In the case of S. bacillaris however it has been suggested that this species is not under selective pressure in winemaking environments .Fourteen different non-Saccharomyces yeast species were identified at initial stages of spontaneous fermentation of Isabella must.

Although there are detailed studies on the microbiota of Vitis vinifera L. grapes less is known about the diversity and behavior of yeast communities present on fermenting grape must from other species of Vitis.

Although there are detailed studies on yeast microbiota from Vitis vinifera L. grape musts         less is known about the communities of yeast present on grapes from other species of Vitis.

Our study is the first analysis of indigenous yeasts on grapes from a Vitis species different from Vitis vinifera L. in Argentina.

This finding may have significant ecological andor evolutionary interest as well as for the understanding of the spontaneous assembly of the Vitis microbiota.DISCUSSIONMany yeast species have been recognized in spontaneously fermenting must from Vitis vinifera L. grapes        .

These results indicate that ethanol tolerance may dramatically differ between S. bacillaris strains isolated from various geographic origins andor Vitis species.

10 compared with indigenous S. cerevisiae isolates from Vitis vinifera L.      .Specific Yeast Microbial Communities ofVitis labrusca L. GrapesNon-Saccharomyces species recognized on fermenting Isabella must include a large diversity of yeasts .

cerevisiae strains .Killer Sensitivity and Ethanol Tolerance of S. bacillaris IsolatesBased on the relative contribution of S. bacillaris at t0 and t24 we expected to find at least 10 of S. bacillaris colonies at t48.
