Bacteria belonging to genus Clostridium were significantly more abundant in the TA group 32.7 10.8-51.1 median interquartile range IQR compared to the RA group 4.8 0.5-10.2.Bacteria belonging to genus Streptococcus were significantly P0.05 less abundant in the TA group 0.4 0.08-1.1 median IQR than in the RA group 2.7 0.3-34.8.

TA or RA was the major determinant of the differences for Bifidobacterium Clostridium Lactobacillus Faecalibacterium Prevotella and Streptococcus whereas gender influences predominated for Roseburia and Ruminococcus.Principal component analysis of the distribution of 550 unique taxa showed that the TA and RA group participants clustered according to the community TA or RA with no overlap between the two groups of participants .The most abundant 20 sequences in each individual were identified.

A sample distance matrix of genetic distances between the abundant taxa among RA and TA groups showed that only a minority of the TA group taxa coincided with those of the RA group while the majority showed genetic distances of 0.2 or greater .

The P test using Fast UniFrac with 500 permutations showed that clustering was significant P0.01 when sequences present only in TA were compared with sequences present only in RA or shared sequences.DiscussionThis study on faecal microbiota composition of healthy adults belonging to a tribal and a rural population of south India showed that there were significant differences in the faecal microbiota in these two populations and that they clustered along different patterns.

If one were to use this as a sole measure of eubiosis both the TA group medianratio of 34.0 and the RA group median ratio of 92.9 were strongly tilted in favour of a beneficial gut microbiota when compared to Western adults who have a median Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio of approximately 10.932.

Analyses of genetic distance revealed that the microbiota were distinctly different between TA and RA and principal component analysis using 550 distinct taxonomically identifiable sequences revealed a clear separation of microbiota composition in the two groups.

DNA quantity ranged from 3.2 x 108 to 7.3 x 108median 5.3 x 108 molml in the TA group to 2.9 x 108 to 3.4 x109median 5.8 x 108 molml in the RA group.

DNA libraries were prepared separately for 10 DNA samples from the TA group and 10 from the RA group using multiplex identifier sequence tags MID- adaptors.

The number of reads per individual ranged from 6341 to 18403 in the TA group and from 1705 to 31409 in the RA group this difference was not significant.

The presence of galactooligosaccharides in milk and fructooligosaccharides in fruits has been considered to encourage the growth of Bifidobacterium species and the relative scarcity of Actinobacteria in the TA group might be due to the fact that they did not consume milk or milk products and very little fruit.Bacteroidetes which are abundant in many Western populations constituting around 20 per cent of the faecal microbiota5 were comparatively rare in both TA and RA groups.
