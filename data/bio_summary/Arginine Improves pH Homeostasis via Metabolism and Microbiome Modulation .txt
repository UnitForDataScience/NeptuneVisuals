The pH change over time of each of the differentially treated bio- films is shown in Figure 2.The pH of untreated biofilms nega- tive control remained stable at the start- ing pH of 7 throughout the experiment when maintained in CDM.

Biofilms that were exposed to sucrose at Time 0 expe- rienced a rapid and sustained drop to pH 4.5 while treatment with arginine alone increased the starting pH to a final pH of8.

We next explored the effect of arginine on pH dynamics by pretreating biofilms with 75 mM arginine followed by the addition of sucrose 15 mM after 0 6 20 or 48 h. pH was measured at each time point and biofilms were collected for 16S sequencing and targeted arginine quantification and supernatants were prepared for metabolomic analysis.

Treatment with only sucrose led to a sustained pH drop from 7 to 4.5 while biofilms treated with sucrose after 6 20 or 48 h of preincubation with arginine exhibited a recovery to higher pH.

The dynamics of dental plaque pH were first described over 80 y ago Stephan 1940 when Stephan observed that dental plaque universally undergoes a rapid drop in pH when exposed to a sugar source followed by an eventual recovery to neutral.

pH was measured by pipet- ting 20 mL of each sample onto pH indicator strips.

pH was measured by pipetting 20 mL ontocolor-changing pH strips.

Arg  L-arginine 75 mM Suc  sucrose 15 mM.Pretreatment with Arginine Prevents pH Drop Induced by SucroseUsing the biofilm model as described above we tested whether treatment with 75 mM arginine could inhibit a pH drop induced by sucrose.

The addition of sucrose after 6 h of preincubation with arginine resulted in an initial pH drop followed by an increase to a final pH of 8.

In general biofilms in which protection from the sucrose-induced pH drop occurred clustered sepa- rately from the biofilms in which pH protection did not occur.
