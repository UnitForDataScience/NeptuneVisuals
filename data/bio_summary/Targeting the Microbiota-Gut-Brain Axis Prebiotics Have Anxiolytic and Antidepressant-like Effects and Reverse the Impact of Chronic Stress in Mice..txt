F G Animals from the stress and stressFOS1GOS groups reduced entries to the open arms F and time spent there G however the group administered prebiotics spent more time in open arms compared with the stress-only group G. H The number of entries into the center was reduced in both stress groups compared with the control group p  .05 p  .01 p  .001 comparing with the control group p  .05 comparing with the stress group.

FOS1GOS administration significantly reduced mRNA levels of glucocorti- coid receptor in hypothalamus but not Crfr1 or mineralocorticoid receptor .Study 1 Tryptophan and Tryptophan MetabolitesGOS and FOS1GOS administration reduced L-tryptophan levels in the plasma .Study 1 Brain MonoaminesFOS and FOS1GOS administration increased serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex.

Similarly stress also led to higher levels of corticosterone 45 minutes after the beginning of the forced swim test this was attenuated by prebiotic treatment having lower levels than only stressed animals .Study 2 Spleen Cytokine Production After Stimulation With Concanavalin A and LipopolysaccharideThe only stress group presented a higher concentration of interleukin 6 after stimulation with concanavalin A and animals with prebiotics had similar levels to control animals .

E F Chronic stress increased basal corticosterone levels E and corticos- terone levels 45 minutes after a stress- ful event forced swim test F. The stress group with prebiotics presented lower corticosterone levels at 45 min- utes after a stressful event F. G Spleen cytokine production without stimulation vehicle or following stimu- lation with lipopolysaccharide LPS and concanavalin A ConA is shown.

The stress group presented increased levels of released interleukin 6 IL-6G and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-a H after ConA stimulation.p  .05 p  .01 p  .001 comparing with the control group p .05 p  .01 comparing with the stress group one-way analysis of var- iance followed by least significant difference post hoc test n 5 9-10 data represent mean 6 SEM.

A B The stress group presented increased immobility time in the tail suspension test A and in the forced swim test B whereas the stress group with prebiotics presented lower increment in immobility time compared with the stress-only group.Stress-induced defecation in the forced swim test was increased only in the stress group.

FOS1GOS administration signifi- cantly increased time in the center of the open field test and a tendency to make more entries into the center of the open field test but there was no effect of prebiotic administration on latency to the center zone .There was no effect of prebiotic administration on percent- age time spent in open arms in the elevate plus maze test  but a significant effect of prebiotic administration on percentage entries into open arms in the elevated plus maze was observed .There was a tendency of prebiotic administration to reduce the number of buried marbles in the defensive marble burying test .Figure 4.

E F FOS administration increased whereas FOS1GOS administration decreased mRNA levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate NMDA receptor 2A subunit E but there were no changes of mRNA for NMDA receptor 2B subunit F. p  .05 p  .01 p  .001 one-way analysis of variance followed by least significant difference post hoc test n 5 8-10 data represent mean 6 SEM.A stimulation and in animals with prebiotics this had normal- ized to control levels .

Reduced concentrations of isobutyrate after prebiotic administration had signifi- cantly positive association with reduced immobility time in the forced swim test latency to enter into the center of the open field test corticos- terone levels 45 minutes after stress and messenger RNA levels of miner- alocorticoid receptor in the hypotha- lamus.
