However the observed clear phylogenetic delineation of heavy fractions from the medium majority of the metabolically active RNA species Figure clearly showed that a distinct subset of the bacterial population was able to use the glucose more rapidly while the remaining bacteriaincubations Figure This finding is further corrobo- rated by a significant lower diversity found in the heavy RNA-SIP fractions compared to the diversity represented by the medium majority of the community Figure Moreover the increasing diversity in the heavy fractions after 4 h of incubation Figure suggests that more species were able to use the isotope-labeled glucose andor its metabolites over time.The microbial community composition before the incu- bation with glucose 0 h control was analyzed from three light RNA fractions where most RNA accumulated.

Therefore we are confident that the significant enrichment of Allobaculum RNA in heavy fractions can be attributed to an isotopic enriched RNA ratherwas low 1.13The genus Akkermansia was significantly less representedthe diversity of bacteria relatively enriched in the heavy fraction was increased compared with the diversity after 2 h of incubation.
