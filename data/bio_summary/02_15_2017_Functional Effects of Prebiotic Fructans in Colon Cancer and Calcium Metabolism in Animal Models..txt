Chicory inulin has been identified as an effective prebiotic to promote active fermentation and lactobacilli proliferation in the large intestine and to enhanceTable 1 Experimental design of colon cancer model.1Synergy 1-preinduction1 month with inulin treatmentAOMDSS8 months without inulin treatmentMetlin-pre- and postinductionDSS8 months with inulin treatmentSynergy 1-postinductionAOMDSS9 months with inulins treatmentcalcium digestive absorption and deposition in bones The Mexican agave plant is an important source of fructans which had demonstrated bifidogenic effects in animal models however ITF of Agave genus have been poorly studied for their possible protective effects in others diseases for example cancer and osteoporosis.

The mechanism of action in increasing absorption is unknown but may be related to increased colonic calcium bioavailability.ConclusionsThe data suggest that fructans from Chicory Synergy 1 and from Mexican agave Metlin may contribute to a reduction in the risk of colon cancer.

ITF can be consideredas prebiotics and their consumption has been associated with beneficial health effects for example to improve lipid profile antioxidant function and colon cancer prevention and to improve bioavailability of calcium and magnesium In our results about AOMDSS-induced colon cancer in BALBcAnNhsd mice model there were several histopatho- logical changes in intestinal mucosa such as villous atrophy polyp formation intestinal cell dysplasia and lymphoid hyperplasia.
