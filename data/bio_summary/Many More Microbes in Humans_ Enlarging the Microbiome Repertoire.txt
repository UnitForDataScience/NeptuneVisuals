Our most recent developments using extended panels of protozoa asso- ciated with flow cell cytometry should increase the rate with which known and new giant viruses are isolated 14.Using co-culture amoeba we isolated 22 bacterial species including 21 new bacterial species from water or air-condi- tioning samples including water from hospital networks com- prising 6 new Legionella species and a new phylum Babela massiliensis Table 1 Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Overall culturomics has enabled us to identify 247 new bacterial species from the human gut 269 species isolated for the first time from humans and 250 species isolated for the first time from the human gut Figure 2.

Another Marseillevirus known as Giant Blood Marseillevirus was then transiently grown by inoculating the Marseillevirus DNA-pos- itive serum of a blood donor on Jurkat cells an immortalized line of human T-lymphocyte cells 48 Table 2.EukaryotesAlthough fungi represent an important part of the eukary- otic microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract fewS24  CID 201765 Suppl 1  Lagier et alstudies focused on the fungal repertoire of the human gut using culture 49 50.

Further work is required to develop new and well-adapted media to isolate fungi especially for Basidiomycota and Zygomycota and to standardize the fungal culturomics procedure as it has been applied for bacterial culturomics.PATHOGENS IN HUMANSBacteriaTwenty-five bacterial species including 23 new species and subspecies were isolated from the environment and were also considered as human pathogens.

To make the new species available as quickly as possible to the international scientific community we then used the model of the genome announcement made to address the growing number of sequenced genomes 41 to create a format known as the new species announcement including brief phenotypic data 16S rRNA GenBank accession number and deposition number in our international collection of strains 42.ArchaeaOur protocol for culturing methanogens yielded a previously unknown methanogen Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis 43 the largest methanogen harboring the largest genome ever isolated in humans 44 and the representative of a com- pletely new seventh order of methanogens 45.

Although some giant viruses have been isolated with their protozoal hosts such as the Cafeteria roenbergensis virus we isolated an amoeba from a human sample suspected of harboring a giant virus superinfected by a virophage 15.PlantsWe cultured Pepper mild mottle virus PMMoV by inoculat- ing 3 pepper-derived food items spicy powder pepper and Tabasco on Nicotiana tabacum plants as demonstrated by the development of typical symptoms on tobacco leaves and viral detection in lesions 16.

In terms of MALDI-TOF identifications in routine laboratory work from 2011 to 2016 12 different species primarily isolated by culturomics were sub- sequently isolated in pathological circumstances enabling the microbiological documentation of 57 cases 32.ArchaeaLikewise a culture-based comparison of the microbiota in patients with severe periodontitis and controls yielded M. ora- lis in both groups M. smithii in 2 patients and a new species known as Methanobrevibacter species strain N13 in patients with periodontitis 56 Table 4.
