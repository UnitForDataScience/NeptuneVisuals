More studies on gene expression in specific localization of each species in the biofilm are needed to further investigate the molecular mechanisms behind these observations.In conclusion this study clearly shows that increasing species numbers in biofilms makes the spatial structure more dynamic and complex hinting the distinct interspe- cies interactions crucially dependent on the surrounding species which might help to explain the increasedresistance of multispecies biofilm to antimicrobial agents and enhanced virulence to host in some chronic infections compared with single-species biofilms Simoes et al.

Single streak 4-6 mm diameter of one species was streaked on the surface of a Congo red agar plate and the other three species were streaked on the same plate separately at perpendicular direction and incubated at room temperature for 48 h. Triplicates were maintained for each species to assess the interspecies inhibition activity.Continuous-culture drip-flow biofilm reactor systemDrip-flow biofilm reactors DFR incubated at room tempera- ture were used to cultivate biofilms Goeres et al.

Spe- cifically we show that the presence of M. oxydans affects the spatial localization of X. retroflexus in this community presumably enhancing its competitive capability because increasing numbers of studies have suggested that the spatial positioning of cells in the biofilm fronttop layer strongly enhances their reproductive fitness Nadell and Foster 2010 Dyken et al.

Residing in biofilms can enhance the fitness of bacteria in hostile environments such as the human body compared with when grown in planktonic conditions or mono-species biofilm Hoiby et al.

The data revealed that the local aggregation of M. oxydans was functioning as a driving factor affecting its own growth fitness in the devel- opment of the four-species biofilm.Microbacterium oxydans did not establish itself in the biofilm unless all other species were also presentTo study the establishment of the low-abundant M. oxy- dans and its interactions and dependence on the other species triple-species biofilms were run and sampled at different time points followed by FISH for CLSM observa- tion Fig.

The data showed that the four- species community provided favourable microenviron- ments for the existence of M. oxydans and P. amylolyticus.Local spatial organization of M. oxydans was important for its existence in the four-species biofilmTo test whether the increased bio-volume of M. oxydans and P. amylolyticus was associated with their spatial orga- nization four-species biofilms were run and sampled at different time points followed by FISH for CLSM analysis Fig.

It is worth mentioning that the spatial structure of biofilms we show here is condensed and the spatial positioning of species is relative because most of the water in biofilms is dehydrated before the hybridization however the accuracy of the results is not affected Narisawa et al.

The other three species were crucially needed for the successful inclusion of M. oxydans in the four-species biofilm where X. retroflexus was consistently positioned in the top layer of the mature four-species biofilm.
