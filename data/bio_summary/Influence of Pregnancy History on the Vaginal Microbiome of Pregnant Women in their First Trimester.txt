It appears that alterations in the vaginal microenvironment in women with a prior conception or delivery favor the proliferation of Gardnerella L. iners and L. gasseri at the expense of L. crispatus.What are the implications of our observation that the vaginal microbiota differs depending on prior pregnancy history First of all it suggests that future studies designed to address the influence of the vaginal microbiome on pregnancy outcome must invariably take into account the pregnancy history of the women being evaluated.

Despite these properties the decrease in L. crispatus abundance in women with a prior conception suggest that its influence on pregnancy outcome is reduced in multiparous pregnancies.The expression of genes that inhibit pro-inflammatory immune system activation are up-regulated during pregnancy to minimize interference with proper fetal and maternal cell differentiation fetal organ development and pregnancy progression.

This time period was studied because successful implantation of the embryo into the uterine wall and initiation of vascular changes leading to development of the placenta during the first trimester may be the stages most susceptible to pregnancy disruption.ResultsCharacteristics of the study population - women with their first known conception women with no deliveries who had either a prior pregnancy termination or a spontaneous abortion women with a prior delivery - are1Division of Immunology and Infectious Disease Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Weill Cornell Medicine New York New York USA.

Each woman's prior pregnancy history - first conception prior spontaneous pregnancy loss previous delivery - was not known at the time of sample collection.

The composition of the vaginal microbiome and its influence on pregnancy outcome varies with pregnancy history.Lactobacillus species tend to dominate the vaginal microbiome to a greater extent during pregnancy than when women are not pregnant .

It is also possible that an unknown num- ber of women in the first conception group had a prior pregnancy that ended in an early stage abortion without the woman's awareness and that their designation as having no prior exposure to the products of conception is incorrect.

These differences in L. crispatus abundance between women with their first concep- tion and those with a prior birth p  0.0001 and between women with a prior abortion only and those with a prior birth p  0.0116 were significant.

Thus the contribution of specific vaginal bacteria or groups of bacteria to pregnancy outcome needs to be reevaluated and may differ depending on pregnancy history.

In addition it remains unknown whether previous pregnancy history influences the composition of the vaginal microbiota in later pregnancy stages or postpartum.
