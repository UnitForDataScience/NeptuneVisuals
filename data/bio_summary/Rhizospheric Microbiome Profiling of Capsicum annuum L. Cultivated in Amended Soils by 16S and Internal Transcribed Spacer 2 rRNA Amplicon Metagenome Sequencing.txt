to identify operational taxonomic units otus from 84259 to 141161 filtered reads from 16s libraries and 829 to 17235 reads from its2 ones were clustered using the reference databases silva 16s version 123  and unite version 7.1  with 97 identity as the clustering criterion.

higher crop yields are achievable if beneficial microbiota are used to enrich the plant rhizosphere  .

here rhizosphere and rhizoplane mi- crobiomes from capsicum annuum l. cultivated by conventional farming soil amended with a synthetic microbial consortium biofit rtu innovak global mexico and a phenolics-based root exudate inductor exuroot innovak global were investigated by16s and internal transcribed spacer 2 its2 rrna amplicon metagenome analysis.c.

16s v3-v4 and its2 rrna genes were amplified with primers 337f805r  and its3fits4r  respectively.amplicon metagenomic libraries were paired-end sequenced on an illumina miseq platform.

a total of 10511842 raw reads were obtained for the 16s libraries andvolume 5 issue 30 e00626-17 1asaff-torres et al.11667652 raw reads were obtained for its2 ones.

a total of 9644 otu were predicted for 16s libraries and 43 otu were predicted for its2 libraries.the most abundant bacterial classes in both bulk soil and rhizosphererhizoplane samples from all three farming conditions were gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobac- teria actinobacteria bacilli and planctomycetacia.

rhizoplanes from each planttreatment were obtained by sonication 160 w 30 s for 10 cycles of roots after rhizosphere extraction and pooled.

rhizosphere and rhizoplane metagenomic dna was extracted with the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio inc. carlsbad ca and its integrity and concentration were assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and uv spectroscopy.

gammaproteobacteria and bacilli were enriched in rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples under all farming conditions compared to bulk soil ones.

compared to bulk soil agaromycetes were reduced in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane from conventionally farmed and exuroot-amended plants whereas mortierellomycotina abundances were reduced only in biofit-amended plants.accession numbers.
