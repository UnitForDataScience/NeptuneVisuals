Hermosillo Sonora MexicodABSTRACT Rhizospheric microbiomes of Capsicum annuum L. cultivated either con- ventionally or amended with a synthetic microbial consortium or a root exudate in- ductor were characterized by 16Sinternal transcribed spacer 2 ITS2 rRNA amplicon metagenome sequencing.

To identify operational taxonomic units OTUs from 84259 to 141161 filtered reads from 16S libraries and 829 to 17235 reads from ITS2 ones were clustered using the reference databases SILVA 16S version 123  and UNITE version 7.1  with 97 identity as the clustering criterion.

Here rhizosphere and rhizoplane mi- crobiomes from Capsicum annuum L. cultivated by conventional farming soil amended with a synthetic microbial consortium BioFit RTU Innovak Global Mexico and a phenolics-based root exudate inductor ExuRoot Innovak Global were investigated by16S and internal transcribed spacer 2 ITS2 rRNA amplicon metagenome analysis.C.

Alternatively the application of root exudate inductors aims to stimulate root natural microbiota-recruiting mechanisms .

Amendment of soils with synthetic microbial consortia allows the introduction of specific beneficial microbiota into the root rhizo- sphere.

16S V3-V4 and ITS2 rRNA genes were amplified with primers 337F805R  and ITS3FITS4R  respectively.Amplicon metagenomic libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform.

A total of 10511842 raw reads were obtained for the 16S libraries andVolume 5 Issue 30 e00626-17 1Asaff-Torres et al.11667652 raw reads were obtained for ITS2 ones.

A total of 9644 OTU were predicted for 16S libraries and 43 OTU were predicted for ITS2 libraries.The most abundant bacterial classes in both bulk soil and rhizosphererhizoplane samples from all three farming conditions were Gammaproteobacteria Alphaproteobac- teria Actinobacteria Bacilli and Planctomycetacia.

The most abundant taxa found although differently rep- resented in each treatment were Gammaproteobacteria Alphaproteobacteria Actino- bacteria and Bacilli as well as Chytridiomycetes and Mortierellomycotina.hizospheric microbial communities influence plant development growth and health .
