Overall the analyses of the collective data set revealed that diverse T3SSs have assumed diverse roles in the interactions of bacteria with host fungi as driven by ecological and evolutionary niche requirements.Keywords bacteria fungi interactions microbial ecology soil type three secretion system mycorrhizaINTRODUCTIONBacteria can interact closely with eukaryotic hosts as recently illustrated in studies on the core microbiomes that are associated with plants and supported by the proposal that plants and their associated microorganisms may be considered as superorganisms denoted holobionts .

summarized the interactions of soil fungi and bacteria including the binding of soil bacteria to fungal spores followed by molecule injection volatile compound production and degradation of fungal cell walls.

In this review we critically examine the literature on this topic with the following specific objectivesConsideration of the evolution of the T3SS and its connection with interactions with particular hostsEvaluation of the potential role of the T3SS in BFI in soil and soil-related habitatsOutlook and identification of future research directions.T3SSs - ORIGIN EVOLUTION AND DIVERGENCEType III secretion systems are intricate proteinaceous systems which span two membranes in Gram-negative bacteria thus offering an outlet from the cytoplasm to the outside milieu.The T3SS machinery is composed of 20-odd conserved proteins up to 30 in some bacteria forming a structure containing an elaborate base an inner rod and a needle  .

Grosso modo obligatorily intracellular bacteria that live in animals insects and protozoa harbor the ChL-type T3SS whereas the SPI-1 SPI-2 and Ysc systems are mostly present in animal- and protozoan-associated bacteria.

Overall Hrp-positive bacteria can be enriched in the rhizosphere   andmycorrhizosphere of different plant species      and so we surmised that T3SSs are often involved in BFI which may include plants BF-plant interactions - BFPI.WHAT DID WE LEARN - CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVESWe here provide evidence for the contention that bacterial T3SSs particularly of the Hrp1 and Hrp2 families are often involved in interaction processes of bacteria with fungi in soil and plant habitats as well as with other eukaryotic organisms.

Ecological theory postulates that bacteria capable of receiving benefits from host fungi are likely to evolve efficient association strategies.

Different fungal-interactive bacteria in positive or negative associations with partner fungi harbor and express T3SSs with different ecological outcomes.

This field of research is important since bacteria and fungi are essential contributors to biogeochemical cycles in soil.

In soil a suite of bacteria is known to interact nutritionally with fungal counterparts.

The fungi often perform key steps in the breakdown of complex organic materials yielding small molecules which are then further decomposed by bacteria that occur in the same habitat.
