Several strategies have been outlined recentlyto decrease the CRC disparity among blacks including improve patient education to reduce patient-level barriers to screening improve provider education for increasing recommendations for screening in blacks implement patient navigation which is cost-effective in increasing colonoscopic screening among blacks increase the overall CRC screening rates among blacks to be on par with screening rates for NHWs and modify the age of screening in blacks due to the differences in observed biology and which have been recommended by several organiza- tions and most recently by the 2017 US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommen- dations.The US Preventive Services Task Force recom- mends screening average-risk persons at age 50 years but recognizes CRC disparities and endorses efforts to ensure that specific populations at risk receive recommended screening and follow-up.Based on the higher incidence of proximal CRCs among blacks colonoscopy is preferred per American College of Gastroenterology recommenda- tions.There is growing evidence that fully implemented CRC screening would greatly reduce or abolish the observed CRC disparity.Additionally CRC screening should be high quality by providers with adenoma detec- tion rates.

Blacks tend to present 5 8 years younger on average with CRC eg mean age of 62 years vs mean age of 69 years for NHWs and have a higher proportion of CRCs under the age of 50 years 10.6 compared with NHWs 5.5.As with those older than 50 years of age blacks showed the highest incidence for CRC in the 20 to 44-year- old age group suggesting that early triggers for neoplasia are present more than in any other racial group.High- risk adenomas 9 mm the precursor to most CRCs appear to be more prevalent among blacks beginning at age 50 years.Additionally blacks show a higher proportion of both high-risk adenomas and CRC in the proximal colon a 7 15 more right colon distribution than NHWs.

Of the more than 50 CRC risk loci identified to datenone show risk loci specific for blacks because only a few patients of African descent have been included in such studies.One study demonstrated that among 10 CRC risk alleles examined between blacks and NHW CRC patients there was signifi- cant heterogeneity with variation of risk between the pop- ulations at different chromosome loci.Immunologic factors could also play a role in biologic causes of CRC disparities.

Analysis suggested that variations in polyp detection rate could not explain the differences between blacks and NHWs but that the disparity in risk for intervalcancer was more pronounced for distal CRC than for prox- imal colon cancer.The disparity for CRC in the United States particularly between blacks and NHWs is likely multifactorial .

Regarding raceethnicity NHW men have the highest risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and represent a group in which the American Gastroenterological Association rec- ommends consideration for endoscopic screening for Bar- rett's esophagus on an individual basis if multiple risk factors are present.Reasons for increased risk in NHWs compared with blacks could be due to higher rates of erosive esophagitisand Barrett's esophagusin NHWs andor increase rates of H pylori infection in blacks.GWAS for Barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in individuals of European descent have identified a number of genetic variants in CRTC1 BARX1 FOXP1 GDF7 TBX5i and HL.-The risk variant in CRTC1has a 30 higher allele frequency in European Americans compared with blacks however the other GWAS variants do not have large allele frequency differences or have higher frequency of the risk allele in blacks and would not explain differences in risk between populations.

Increased ade- noma detection rate through proposective performance feedback has been shown to reduce interval CRCs adjusted hazard ratio 0.63 95 CI 0.45 0.68 and cancer deathadjusted hazard ratio 0.50 95 CI 0.27 0.95 in patients undergoing screening colonscopy.In a population-based cohort study examining Medicare patients aged 66 75 years who received screening colonoscopy 52.8 of blacks compared with 46.2 of NHWs received colonoscopy from physicians with lower polyp detection rates despite no difference in the proportions of persons in either race receiving screening colonosocpy blacks 79.5 vs NHWs 80.7 or polypectomy blacks 23.4 vs NHWs 24.7.

For instance dietary swaps between US blacks high fat low fiber and South Africans low fat high fiber demonstrated marked reciprocal changes in mucosal bio- markers of cancer risk changes in microbiota and metab- olites known to affect cancer risk including increased butyurogenesis and suppressed secondary bile acid gen- eration in US blacks on the South African diet.Heritable factors contribute 25 30 of CRC risk.

Black males and females who showed nearly identical rates to whites around 1980 did not begin a decline in CRC deaths until the mid-1990s about 15 years later than NHWs with a slow rate of decline that allowed generation of a growing disparity over time.Interestingly CRC death rates were slightly lower for blacks than NHWs in the 1970s markedly different than current data.

In the United States blacks have the highest incidence of small bowel cancers with an incidence of 3.4 and 4.3 100000 for black women and men respectively.The most common sub-types in blacks are carcinoids and adenocar- cinoma.

Microsatellite instability MSI a good prognostic biomarker caused by the hypermethylation of the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1 shows a lower frequencyamong blacks although a meta-analysis did not reach statistical significance to show a difference.Elevated mi- crosatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats a poor prognostic biomarker generated by inflammation- initiated nuclear-to-cytosolic transfer of the DNA mismatch repair protein MSH3 shows a higher frequency among blacks.MSH3 was also frequently somatically mutated among a cohort of blacks using whole exome sequencing.
