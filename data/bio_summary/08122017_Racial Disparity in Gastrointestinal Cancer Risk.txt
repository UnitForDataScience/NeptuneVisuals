regarding raceethnicity nhw men have the highest risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and represent a group in which the american gastroenterological association rec- ommends consideration for endoscopic screening for bar- rett's esophagus on an individual basis if multiple risk factors are present.reasons for increased risk in nhws compared with blacks could be due to higher rates of erosive esophagitisand barrett's esophagusin nhws andor increase rates of h pylori infection in blacks.gwas for barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma in individuals of european descent have identified a number of genetic variants in crtc1 barx1 foxp1 gdf7 tbx5i and hl.-the risk variant in crtc1has a 30 higher allele frequency in european americans compared with blacks however the other gwas variants do not have large allele frequency differences or have higher frequency of the risk allele in blacks and would not explain differences in risk between populations.

several strategies have been outlined recentlyto decrease the crc disparity among blacks including improve patient education to reduce patient-level barriers to screening improve provider education for increasing recommendations for screening in blacks implement patient navigation which is cost-effective in increasing colonoscopic screening among blacks increase the overall crc screening rates among blacks to be on par with screening rates for nhws and modify the age of screening in blacks due to the differences in observed biology and which have been recommended by several organiza- tions and most recently by the 2017 us multi-society task force on colorectal cancer recommen- dations.the us preventive services task force recom- mends screening average-risk persons at age 50 years but recognizes crc disparities and endorses efforts to ensure that specific populations at risk receive recommended screening and follow-up.based on the higher incidence of proximal crcs among blacks colonoscopy is preferred per american college of gastroenterology recommenda- tions.there is growing evidence that fully implemented crc screening would greatly reduce or abolish the observed crc disparity.additionally crc screening should be high quality by providers with adenoma detec- tion rates.

of the more than 50 crc risk loci identified to datenone show risk loci specific for blacks because only a few patients of african descent have been included in such studies.one study demonstrated that among 10 crc risk alleles examined between blacks and nhw crc patients there was signifi- cant heterogeneity with variation of risk between the pop- ulations at different chromosome loci.immunologic factors could also play a role in biologic causes of crc disparities.

for instance dietary swaps between us blacks high fat low fiber and south africans low fat high fiber demonstrated marked reciprocal changes in mucosal bio- markers of cancer risk changes in microbiota and metab- olites known to affect cancer risk including increased butyurogenesis and suppressed secondary bile acid gen- eration in us blacks on the south african diet.heritable factors contribute 25 30 of crc risk.

blacks tend to present 5 8 years younger on average with crc eg mean age of 62 years vs mean age of 69 years for nhws and have a higher proportion of crcs under the age of 50 years 10.6 compared with nhws 5.5.as with those older than 50 years of age blacks showed the highest incidence for crc in the 20 to 44-year- old age group suggesting that early triggers for neoplasia are present more than in any other racial group.high- risk adenomas 9 mm the precursor to most crcs appear to be more prevalent among blacks beginning at age 50 years.additionally blacks show a higher proportion of both high-risk adenomas and crc in the proximal colon a 7 15 more right colon distribution than nhws.

these studies have included only a modest number of blackslimiting evaluation of associations in this high- risk population.non-genetic risk factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma include tobacco use diabetes obesity and chronic pancre- atitis.a case-control studyfound that tobacco use diabetes and family history accounted for 46 of pancre- atic cancer risk in black men compared with 37 risk in white men.

increased ade- noma detection rate through proposective performance feedback has been shown to reduce interval crcs adjusted hazard ratio 0.63 95 ci 0.45 0.68 and cancer deathadjusted hazard ratio 0.50 95 ci 0.27 0.95 in patients undergoing screening colonscopy.in a population-based cohort study examining medicare patients aged 66 75 years who received screening colonoscopy 52.8 of blacks compared with 46.2 of nhws received colonoscopy from physicians with lower polyp detection rates despite no difference in the proportions of persons in either race receiving screening colonosocpy blacks 79.5 vs nhws 80.7 or polypectomy blacks 23.4 vs nhws 24.7. furthermore the probability of interval cancer was 7.1 in blacks adjusted hazard ratio 1.32 95 ci 1.15 1.51 compared with 5.8 in nhws 4.4 in hispanics and 3.8 in asians.

cognizance of these disparities in gastrointestinal cancer risk as well as approaches that apply precision medicine methods to populations with the increased risk may reduce the observed disparities for digestive cancers.keywords cancer disparity racial disparity cancer epidemi- ology cancer risk african american esophageal cancer smallgeographic location.another example is colorectal cancer crc while native africans have a very low incidence of this disease african americans have a much higher incidence--the highest among us racialethnic groups.

data are derived from national cancer institute.seer.cancer.gov.-- number of cases too small to estimate ratios.aa ratio of 1 means that the black rate and nhw rates are equal and rates 1.0 mean that blacks have higher rates than nhws and rates 1.0 mean nhws have higher rates than blacks.bincludes adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.study found that tobacco and alcohol use accounted for 94 of the difference in esophageal cancer annual incidence rates.an epidemiologic study suggested that population-specific screening and prevention programs are warranted for esophageal scc in black men exposed to alcohol and tobacco given that rates of scc approached those foresophageal adenocarcinoma in nhw men with reflux dis- ease a group in whom screening is advocated.a number of genome-wide association studies gwas of esophageal sccs have been performed in asian populations and iden- tified functional variants in alcohol-metabolizing genes aldh2 and adh1b that when combined with lifestyle fac- tors significantly increase risk for scc.these genetic risk variants are only found in east asian populations.

notably small bowel gi stromal tumors show the highest incidence among asian pacific islanders.however when considering gi stromal tumors in any part of the gi tract blacks have the highestincidence of all populations.there are several known risk factors for small bowel adenocarcinoma including familial adenomatous polyposis especially in the duodenum lynch syndrome peutz- jeghers syndrome juvenile polyposis syndrome crohn's disease and celiac disease.given the rarity of small bowel adenocarcinoma in general it is not known the extent to which these risk factors impact differences among races.

it is unlikely however that celiac disease is a significant risk factor in blacks given its low incidence in this popula- tion.for small bowel neuroendocrine tumors gwas evaluations have identified risk variants upstream of elk3 though the impact of these variants by race is not known.

analysis suggested that variations in polyp detection rate could not explain the differences between blacks and nhws but that the disparity in risk for intervalcancer was more pronounced for distal crc than for prox- imal colon cancer.the disparity for crc in the united states particularly between blacks and nhws is likely multifactorial .

many gi cancers present with higher risk within westernized countries and the observed risk is suggested to originate from the more abundant availability of calories red meat and fat and subsequent interaction with the gut microbiome.

primary risk factors for scc are alcohol and tobacco use.among asians variants in genes involved in alcohol metabolism confer increased risk of scc.a case-controltable 2.stage distribution and 5-year survival rates of selected gastrointestinal cancers by race for 2006-2012stage distribution 5-y survival rate note.

us population studies confirm that racialethnic minorities have a 40 50 increase in risk of gastric cancer over nhws with race as an independent risk factor.
