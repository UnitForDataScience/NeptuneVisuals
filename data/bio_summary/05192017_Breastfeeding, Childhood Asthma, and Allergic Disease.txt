confir- mation of these findings may result in strong changes to infant feeding guidelines which currently recommenddelaying the introduction of allergenic foods until at least12 months.the prevalence of peanut allergy among children in western countries has doubled in the past 10 years and therefore a study to evaluate strategies in preventing the development of peanut allergy in infants at high risk for the allergy was conducted 33. the early introduction of peanut significantly decreased peanut allergy develop- ment among high-risk children and modulated immune responses to peanuts.

for example different studies have used allergen sensitization self-report or doctor di- agnosis to define presence of food allergy with the first two definitions correlating poorly with food challenge for diagnosis of food allergy the gold standard.

solu- ble cd-14 may protect against allergy development due to its high concentrations in breast milk and importance in the th1 induction response to bacteria 42.transforming growth factor-btransforming growth factor-b tgf-b is a cytokine identified in human milk 43 containing tgf-b1 tgf-b2 and other isoforms at mrna and protein levels with tgf-b2 being the major isoform 95 44. the immunoactive factors in breast milk may influence the development and maturation of the mucosal immune system of the infant 45-50 and mounting evidence sug- gests that tgf-b a multifunctional polypeptide may be a key immunoregulatory factor for the establishment of this response by promoting iga production as well as in- duction of oral tolerance 44 49 51-54. tgf-b increas- es the infant's ability to produce iga against b-lactoglobu- lin casein gliadin and ovalbumin 44. in an infantprone to cow's milk allergy an increased tgf-b content of mother's milk may be beneficial by promoting igg-iga antibody production and inhibiting ige- and cell-medi- ated reactions to cow's milk 39 54.original work 55 56 showed that tgf-b1 was a growth factor exhibiting pleiotropic regulatory effects on developmental and physiological pathways.

limitations were overcome by performing meta-analyses in stan-ed to assess the association of breastfeeding over the spectrum of allergic conditions asthma eczema allergic rhinitis and food allergy which is important because of the substantial overlap in allergic diseases with shared phenotypes.

generalized esti-mating equation modelling was applied to test for asso- ciations between breastfeeding and repeated respiratory outcomes until 8 years adjusting for gender maternal edu- cation smoking during pregnancy and current smoking and stratified by parental allergy.

conflict exists be- tween some allergy prevention guidelines that currently recommend delaying the introduction of allergenic foods until at least 12 months whereas the new recommenda- tions are for the introduction of allergenic foods between 4 and 6 months 30 and not before 6 months 9. prescott et al.
