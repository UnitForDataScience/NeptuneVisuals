Chronic asthma was defined as asthma diagnosis at 8 years with asthma diagnosis in at least 2 other years.

For this reason it is important to establish whether breastfeeding modi- fies the risk of childhood asthma even if the effect is small.Against this background of breast milk significance there is evidence that breastfeeding may protect against the development of asthma and allergic disease in chil- dren although this has been controversial since it was first observed more than eight decades ago 6 7.Definition of Infant FeedingThe World Health Organization 8 defines exclusive breastfeeding as feeding with breast milk only with no other liquid solids or vitamin drops.

The birth cohort design with longitudinal analysis allowed demonstration that breast- feeding protects against asthma throughout childhood both with and without a family history and contributing significantly to the breastfeeding and childhood asthma debate.Fig.

Oddy Key insightsBreastfeeding may protect against childhood asthma and al- lergic disease but this is controversial.

Breastfeeding has been associated with protection against ear- ly respiratory infections and the observed association between breastfeeding and asthma at early ages may be mediated by the protection of breastfeeding on infections.

Practical implicationsExclusive or predominant breastfeeding to at least 6 months of age with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years is advised to protect against early infections and strengthen the immuneThe protective effects of breastfeeding may extend against the devel- opment of asthma and allergic diseases.system.
