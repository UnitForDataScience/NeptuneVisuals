we conclude that addition of bmo to the hf diet com- pletely prevented increases in intestinal permeability and microbial dysbiosis and was partially effective to prevent weight gain in dio.new  noteworthy this study provides the first report of the effects of prebiotic bovine milk oligosaccharides on the host pheno- type of high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice.prebiotic epithelial permeability obesity adipositythe gastrointestinal tract gi is the first site of diet mi- crobe and host interaction 42 thus targeting the microbiota and preventing the dysbiosis that occurs in response to a high-fat hf diet may prevent the alteration in gut function and regulation of food intake and body weight.

furthermore the maintenance of intestinal permea- bility alone is not sufficient to prevent the deleterious effects in host metabolism in response to ingestion of a hf diet.there is considerable evidence to show altered intestinal permeability in hf-fed rodents and some evidence that this also occurs in obese humans 16 26 55. we were the first to show that a hf diet differentially influences gut permeability in the small and large intestine and that these changes are depen- dent on length of time on the hf diet 26. however whether the permeability changes in either the small or large intestinetable 7. relative abundances of bacterial genera that significant changed due to diet in the colonweek 1week 3week 5chf hf  bmo hf  i chf hf  bmo hf  i chf hf  bmo hf  imilk oligosaccharides and obesitytable 8. gene expression analysis in the ileum at weeks 1 and 3g483week 1week 3controlhfhf  bmohf  icontrolhfhf  bmohf  itwo-tailed t-testmuc21 - 0.21ab 1.65 - 0.20a 1.56 - 0.27a 0.82 - 0.08b 1 - 0.22 1.19 - 0.16 1.02 - 0.13 1.12 - 0.09proglucagon 1 - 0.973.11 - 1.14 2.52 - 1.06 0.81 - 0.31 1 - 0.66 1.32 - 0.28 1.28 - 0.303.5 - 1.8tnf1 - 0.75 0.39 - 0.30.43 - 0.18 1.13 - 0.88zo11 - 0.150.73 - 0.16 1.28 - 0.26 0.52 - 0.21 1 - 0.05a 0.60 - 0.05b 0.74 - 0.06b 0.66 - 0.05babsignificance after one-way anova tukey's post hoc test.p  0.1play a role in the onset or maintenance of weight gain is not known.

specifically small intestinal paracellular permea- bility increases early after 1-3 wk on the diet large intes- tinal permeability is increased after 6 wk and moreover large intestinal transcellular transport significantly corre- lates with the obese phenotype 26. it is not known whether the beneficial effects of prebiotics are due to targeting the microbial dysbiosis or increased intestinal permeability and whether the target is the small or large intestine or both.inulin-type fructans are commonly used prebiotics and havebeen shown to increase the levels of the beneficial microbes bifidobacterium and lactobacillus 24 40 43 improve glu- cose homeostasis and reduce body weight and caloric intake 2 18. supplementation of a hf diet with inulin in mice resulted in reduced weight gain and food intake 2. however human studies have indicated that consumption of inulin may not be sufficient to reduce weight in obese women 20 even though it decreased intestinal permeability in healthy subjects 49. furthermore high amounts of inulin are associated with increased flatulence abdominal pain and bloating which may limit its usefulness as a therapeutic 13 31 48. thus there is a need to identify prebiotic treatments that are effective in producing weight loss decreasing food intake and minimizing the unwanted effects of inulin.specific beneficial microbes such as bifidobacterium infan- tis and bacteroides fragilis 38 59 have enhanced growth and binding to epithelial cells when grown on complex milk oli-g4740193-185717 copyright c 2017 the american physiological societytable 1. dietary nutritional profilemilk oligosaccharides and obesityg475numbers in parentheses are testdiet numbers.

we hypoth- esized that supplementation with bovine mo would prevent the deleterious effect of hf diet on the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability and attenuate development of the obese phenotype.

addition of bmo to the hf diet significantly attenuated weight gain decreased adiposity and decreased caloric intake inulin supplementation also lowered weight gain and adiposity but this did not reach significance.

manipulating the microbiota via probiotics or prebiotics in the presence of a hf diet increases beneficial bacteria abundance improves intestinal barrier integrity and decreases gut inflammation these improvements are associated with weight loss 18 23. however it is unclear how prebiotics and the microbiota interact with the host to alter intestinal permeability in different regions of the gut and how this contributes to weight gain and adiposity.

we have recently shown in rats ingesting a hf diet that the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability are altered differently in the small and large intestine.
