moreover translational studies building on the exciting data generated from animal studies are needed.clinical studies on visceral pain and the gut microbiotawhile most studies on visceral pain and the gut microbiota in patients are centred around pain from the gi tract as in ibs there are now other disorders that have been recently identified as being associated with the gut microbiota see table 2 for a list of visceral pain disorders with an altered gut microbiota.irritable bowel syndrome and microbiotairritable bowel syndrome is the prototypical brain-gut axis syndrome and is the most common functional gi disorder affecting about 20 of people worldwide.75 it is diagnosed based on symptoms outlined by the rome iv criteria113 which includeanimal models of gastrointestinal visceral pain.animal modelinductionreferences22s.m.

the gut microbiota as a key regulator of visceral painsiobhain m. o' mahonyab timothy g. dinanbc john f. cryanabvisceral painvisceral pain can range from the discomfort of indigestion to the excruciating pain of renal colic.19 irritable bowel syndrome ibs is a complex and heterogeneous disorder with exaggerated visceral pain as a major distinguishing feature.44 other visceral pain-related disorders include functional dyspepsia functional abdominal pain syndrome infantile colic and interstitial cystitis.

microbiota within the gut also produce active mediators such as short chain fatty acids37105 which inhibit histone deacetylases and result in epigenetic changes.151166 the local release of these substances can also signal the brain through the vagus nerve enabling a direct communication through a neurochem- ical pathway from the gut to the brain.14 both the stress and immune systems also provide communication pathways from the microbiota within the gut to the brain48 with studies showing that modulation of the microbiota can impact on the development of the stress system152 as well as reducing stress levels.131 furthermore the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the frontal cortex hippocampus and striatum is believed to be influenced by gut microbiota.12evidence from preclinical studies on the role of the microbiota in visceral painin recent years various animal models of visceral hypersensitivity have been exploited to determine the involvement of gutmicrobiota on visceral pain pathways6998 see table 1 for specific models.

assessing visceral sensitivity most often occurs with the use of a balloon inflated to specific pressures using a barostat.101109 many of the preclinical models of increased visceral pain are induced by applying a psychological or physical stressor that relates to factors known to predispose to ibs.84the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota is capable of inducing or reducing visceral hypersensitivity are slowly being uncovered.
