Moreover translational studies building on the exciting data generated from animal studies are needed.Clinical studies on visceral pain and the gut microbiotaWhile most studies on visceral pain and the gut microbiota in patients are centred around pain from the GI tract as in IBS there are now other disorders that have been recently identified as being associated with the gut microbiota see Table 2 for a list of visceral pain disorders with an altered gut microbiota.Irritable bowel syndrome and microbiotaIrritable bowel syndrome is the prototypical brain-gut axis syndrome and is the most common functional GI disorder affecting about 20 of people worldwide.75 It is diagnosed based on symptoms outlined by the Rome IV criteria113 which includeAnimal models of gastrointestinal visceral pain.Animal modelInductionReferenceS22S.M.

Delbrueckii DSM 20074 and L. plantarum MB 456 reduced gas-producing coliforms in colicky babies and improved symptoms.134 While some studies have shown L. reuteri to be successful in reducing crying in breastfed colicky infants136 others have shown that these bacteria lead to increased crying and fussing.154 Clearly the role of gut microbiota and treatment of infantile colic using probiotics are unresolved and require more studies to confirm which colicky babies are amenable to microbiota management and why see Table 2 for further studies on probiotic intervention and microbiota changes in colic.Visceral pain and stress-related comorbidities and microbiotaThe high comorbidity observed between visceral pain and psychiatric disorders suggests potential common neurobiological pathways involved in the aetiology of these disorders.45 Stress is associated with exacerbation of pain in many different disorders with early life stress increasing the likelihood of developing pain- related disease.15 Both physical and psychological stressors have also been shown to enhance the perception of visceral pain visceral hypersensitivity.1061111156 Furthermore psychological and pharmacological interventions that reduce stress have been demonstrated to improve visceral pain symptoms.128145 Despite the comorbidity of stress-related disease and visceral pain the reason and causality for this relationship are still unclear it is not fully understood whether stress-related disorders predispose to the development of visceral hypersensitivity or whether altered emotional states arise in response to visceral hypersensitivity.In addition to a very promising clinical and animal literature see Cryan and Dinan 2012 Sherwin et al.

Microbiota within the gut also produce active mediators such as short chain fatty acids37105 which inhibit histone deacetylases and result in epigenetic changes.151166 The local release of these substances can also signal the brain through the vagus nerve enabling a direct communication through a neurochem- ical pathway from the gut to the brain.14 Both the stress and immune systems also provide communication pathways from the microbiota within the gut to the brain48 with studies showing that modulation of the microbiota can impact on the development of the stress system152 as well as reducing stress levels.131 Furthermore the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the frontal cortex hippocampus and striatum is believed to be influenced by gut microbiota.12Evidence from preclinical studies on the role of the microbiota in visceral painIn recent years various animal models of visceral hypersensitivity have been exploited to determine the involvement of gutmicrobiota on visceral pain pathways6998 see Table 1 for specific models.

1.Studies aiming to manipulate the gut microbiota often use probiotics which are defined as microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed in adequate amounts.132 Furthermore prebiotics indigestible plant fibres are also being used to beneficially nourish the probiotic bacteria already in the gut or being introduced.146Microbiota to central nervous system signallingThe communication from the gut microbiota to the CNS occurs in a bidirectional manner and is commonly referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis8283339 and includes immune neural endocrine and metabolic pathways.426682147 A growing body of literature predominantly still at the preclinical stage is showing that perturbation of this axis results in alterations in the stress-response and behaviour and has been proposed to be involved in several CNS diseases such as anxiety31118 depression3064 autism57108 Alzheimer disease119 stroke or brain injury165 and Parkinson's disease.38137 There are several mechanisms by which the microbiota influences brain function and they more than likely work in concert with reciprocal signalling from the brain.83 Commensal gut microbiota have been shown to regulate central neurotransmitters by altering levels of precursors for example Bifidobacterium infantis has been shown to elevate plasma tryptophan levels and thus influence central serotonin 5-HT transmission.36 Also studies indicate that bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are capable of synthesising and releasing gamma-aminobutyric acid while Bacillus and Saccharomyces spp.

It is clear that stress either chronic or in early life is a key factor in potentiating visceral pain responses and its associated comorbidities.97 Antibiotics administered early in life have been shown to induce long-lasting effects on visceral pain responses coupled with alterations in receptors such as decreases in the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor and cholecystokinin B receptor in the spinal cord.106 Moreover disturbance of the gut microbiota in adult mice was shown to induce changes in local immune response in association with enhanced pain signalling.159 Studies using germ-free mice mice devoid of bacteria indicate that commensal intestinal microbiota are necessary for normal excitability of gut sensory neurons and recolonization returns the excitability of the neurons to normalApril 2017Volume 158Number 4Supplement 1S21Figure 2.

The gut microbiota as a key regulator of visceral painSiobhain M. O' Mahonyab Timothy G. Dinanbc John F. CryanabVisceral painVisceral pain can range from the discomfort of indigestion to the excruciating pain of renal colic.19 Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a complex and heterogeneous disorder with exaggerated visceral pain as a major distinguishing feature.44 Other visceral pain-related disorders include functional dyspepsia functional abdominal pain syndrome infantile colic and interstitial cystitis.

Assessing visceral sensitivity most often occurs with the use of a balloon inflated to specific pressures using a barostat.101109 Many of the preclinical models of increased visceral pain are induced by applying a psychological or physical stressor that relates to factors known to predispose to IBS.84The mechanisms by which the gut microbiota is capable of inducing or reducing visceral hypersensitivity are slowly being uncovered.

43.state.89 Furthermore live luminal Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 reduced jejunal spinal nerve firing evoked by distension or capsaicin.115 It has also recently been shown that visceral hypersensitivity can be transferred to rats by the fecal microbiota transplantation from constipation-predominant IBS patients.27 Moreover germ-free rats inoculated with microbiota from patients with IBS developed abnormal gut fermentation mostly characterised by increased H2 excretion and sulfide production27 which have been described in IBS.65 Furthermore colorectal infusion of hydrogen sulfide directly triggers visceral nociceptive behavior in mice through sensitization andor activation of T-type channels probably in the primary afferents81 see Table 2 for preclinical studies supporting the involvement of microbiota in visceral pain.

2016 the involvement of the gut microbiota in stress-related disorders is supported by a growing number of studies showing that probiotics andprebiotics can have antianxiety and anti-stress-like effects in humans.9194138 Indeed a recent systematic review of the literature assessing the potential benefit of probiotics in depression and anxiety suggests that there are apparent psychological benefits from probiotic supplementation.118 Moreover causal links between microbiota and stress-related disorders were recently shown whereby the depressed phenotype of a patient was shown to be transferred to a rodent via faecal microbial transplantation.64 Also a study has shown that a supplement containing a combina- tion of fermented dairy product made from 4 probiotics consumed for 4 weeks by healthy women significantly altered functional brain responses to emotional face recognition task.158 The areas affected include both sensory and emotional regions of the brain indicating the potential impact of manipulating the microbiota on both pain and stress brain responses.One of the seminal preclinical studies showing that gut bacteria are necessary for appropriate development of the stress re- sponse also highlighted specific bacteria and specific time points that are crucial to stress system development.152 Preclinical work carried out in germ-free animals has revealed a relationship between gut microbiota and stress- and anxiety-related behav- iours.24102 Bifidobacterium infantis increases the levels of tryptophan in animals following an early life stress as well as reversing the depressive-like phenotype seen in these animals.36 Furthermore ingestion of L. actobacillus rhamnosus JB-1 reduced anxious behaviour and stress-related changes in receptors in the CNS both of which were reversed following vagotomy.14 Interestingly altered brain levels of serotonin and noradrenaline have been demonstrated following probiotic treatment suggesting a mechanism by which microbiota may influence mood and pain perception.63 Hence the dual action of microbiota therapy on both pain and stress responses may have a synergistic effect on symptom reduction.

Disorders or visceral pain significantly impact the quality of life and are associated with psychological disturbances45 as well as sleep and55The metabolic activity of the gut microbiota produces a largerange of key metabolites such as endogenous vitamins short chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gamma- aminobutyric acid.76141151 Production of such substance providessexual dysfunction.Furthermore treatment options for visceralpain are often unsatisfactory potentially due to the multiple factors that affect the perception and maintenance of this type of pain.The gut microbiotaIt is becoming clear that we are actually living in a microbial world.
