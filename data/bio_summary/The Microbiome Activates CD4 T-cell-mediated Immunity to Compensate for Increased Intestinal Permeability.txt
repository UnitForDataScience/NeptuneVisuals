To determine whether these cells were sufficient to confer protection WT CD4th T cells were adoptively transferred into Rag1 KO or Rag1 KO CA-MLCK recipients D. Within 2 weeks CD4th T cells were effectively reconstituted in the LP of both CA-MLCK and WT mice E. Notably 73 more LP CD4th T cells were present in the LP of Rag1 KO CA-MLCK relative to Rag1 KO recipients E. Whereas CD4th T-cell transfer into Rag1 KO mice had no effect on bacterial invasion CD4th T-cell transfer into Rag1 KO CA-MLCK mice reduced invasion by 43 F. These data demonstrate that CD4th T cells are sufficient to limit early S typhimurium invasion.

CA-MLCK mice were crossed to TcrdH2BeGFP TcrdEGFPIL17A KOor IghA KOmice provided by Dennis Metzger Albany Medical College Albany NY.Germ-free GF transgenic CA-MLCK mice were pro- duced by rederivation of SPF C57BL6J females mated with SPF CA-MLCK males.

Mean - SEM are shown.However CA-MLCK expression within Tcrd KO mice markedly reduced bacterial invasion indicating that although important to overall host defense gd T cells did not account for the observed effects of CA-MLCK expression E and F. Consistent with this gd T-cell numbers were similar in CA-MLCK and WT mice G. Taken together these data demonstrate that increased epithelial permeability promotes immune activation to markedly reduce early invasion of parasites and bacterial pathogens during the initial stages of infection.

This protection requires adaptive immunity but is gd T-cell-independent.CD4th T Cells Are Required for Constitutively Active Myosin Light Chain Kinase-induced Protection Against Bacterial InvasionTo better elucidate the immune cell populations contributing to the invasion-resistant phenotype of CA-MLCK mice we depleted CD4th T cells and challenged mice with luminal S typhimurium A and B. CD4th T-cell depletion had no effect on early bacterial trans- location in WT mice but increased bacterial invasion more than 5-fold in CA-MLCK mice relative to mice receivingcontrol IgG C. The disparity between CA-MLCK and WT mice suggests that our initial hypothesis that increased tight junction permeability would enhance path- ogen invasion was correct.

CD4th T-cell depletion did not affect IgA-producing plasma cell number in the LP of CA-MLCK or WT mice F. Because of the requirement for CD4th T cells in the enhanced immunity of CA-MLCK mice these data lend further support to the conclusion that IgA is not required for the protection observed in CA-MLCK mice.Interleukin 17A Expression PromotesNeutrophil Recruitment to Prevent Early Bacterial Invasion in Constitutively Active Myosin Light Chain Kinase MiceCertain strains of commensal bacteria modulate specific immune responses.

The protective mucosal immune activation in CA-MLCK mice depended on segmented fila- mentous bacteria SFB because protection against early S typhimurium invasion was lost in germ-free CA-MLCK mice but could be restored by conventionalization with SFB- containing not SFB-deficient microbiota.

In addition to the epithelial barrier several mechanisms have evolved to limit pathogen inva- sion including the synthesis of antimicrobial immuno- globulin Ig A and IgG by plasma cells in the lamina propriaage.We hypothesized that the barrier defects resulting from CA-MLCK expression would render these mice more susceptible to enteric infection.Surprisingly our data show that CA-MLCK mice are pro- tected against early pathogen invasion.

To investigate how tight junction barrier loss and the associated LP immune expansion affect susceptibility to enteric pathogens CA-MLCK and WT mice were infected orally with the intracellular protozoan parasite T gondii C. Within1 hour the number of parasites that had transmigrated across the epithelium and into the LP was reduced by 50- 8 in CA-MLCK mice relative to WT D. Para- doxically this indicates that increased intestinal perme- ability limits parasite invasion.

As with the protozoanbacterialtranslocationwasreducedby 76 - 6 in CA-MLCK relative to WT mice E and F. To determine whether the increased LP infiltration of adaptive immune cells was required for CA-MLCK-mediated protection against bacterial invasion Rag1 knockout KO CA-MLCK mice lacking both B and T cells were challenged with S typhimurium.

Bacterial translocation in Rag1 KO CA-MLCK mice was similar to that in Rag1 KO mice alone E and F indicating that adaptive immunity is required for the protective effect of CA-MLCK expression.
