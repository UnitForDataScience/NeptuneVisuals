In particular severe edema led to drastic separation between the muscle and submucosal layers in the colon of mice colo- nized with human SRB C hash.We estimated the differences in histological architecture between the samples by using a combined score for cellular infiltration hyper- plasia and ulceration D. Overall germ-free mice colonized with SRB had higher histological scores than those inoculated with PBS only indicative of histological alterations.SRB-colonized mice have increased numbers of CD11b B CD8 T and Treg cells in the mesenteric lymph nodesWe quantified different immune cell subpopulations from mesen- teric lymph nodes of germ-free mice at day 7 post-inoculation with SRB to evaluate the effect of SRB colonization on the immune system.

Although the total number of activated T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes did not change after SRB colonization A mice colonized with SRB had significantly higher numbers of mesenteric Treg cells than those inoculated with PBS only B. Additionally the ratio between Treg FoxP3 and non-Treg FoxP3- activated CD25CD4 T cells was also higher in the mesenteric lymph nodes from mice colonized with D. indonesiensis or human SRB C.SRB colonization induces Th17 and Treg immune responses in mesenteric lymph nodes from germ-free miceTo determine the inflammatory profile of mesenteric T cells from germ-free mice after colonization with SRB we evaluated the ability of these cells to produce Th1 Th2 and Th17 cytokine profiles after acti- vation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies.Initially we measured the levels of the cytokine IL-10 which drives Treg cell generation in addition to T cell stimulation  to evaluate the function of mesenteric Treg cells from germ-free mice after colo- nization with SRB.

In line with the patient data we detected SRB colonization by incubation in VM medium I for 3 days in 2020 colon samples from C57BL6 mice n  10 animals each for TNBS- and oxazolone-treated groups subjected to chemically- induced colitis while only 210 samples from vehicle-treated mice n  10 animals EtOH group yielded SRB growth in the same condi- tions data not shown.To evaluate whether SRB could contribute to inflammation in C57BL6 mice with colitis mice were subjected to successive in- tragrastric inoculations with D. indonesiensis 5 24 48 and 72 h after colitis induction with TNBS.

Studies with germ-free mice also support this notion although these immune-im- paired mice are totally resistant to colitis induction even upon inter- leukin-10 deficiency which leads to spontaneous colitis in non-germ free strains  the administration of a human bacterial consortium restores colitis development in germ-freeIL-10 deficient mice .Sulfate-reducing bacteria SRB - a diverse anaerobic group of or-ganisms with a variety of nutritional and morphological peculiarities- represent a component of the microbiota of particular interest in the context of colitis.

Interestingly SRB adhered to colonic frag- ments from mice colonized with D. indonesiensis produced higher con- centrations of H2S 50 mgg of tissue when compared to those asso- ciated to the colon of germ-free mice colonized with human SRB 2 mg g of tissue F.SRB colonization alters the colonic architecture of germ-free miceTo evaluate if intestinal colonization by SRB affected the colonic architecture of germ-free mice we performed histological analysis of fragments of distal colon removed at day 7 post-inoculation with SRB focusing on the presence of infiltration hyperplasia and ulcers .

It is worth mentioning that the ad- ministration of D. indonesiensis to control mice that received vehicle EtOH only also led to weight loss up to day 2 after colitis induction but this effect had been reversed by day 4 A.Histological analysis of colonic tissue collected at the day 4 showed a preserved colonic architecture in mice that received EtOH only C. On the other hand administration of D. indonesiensis to EtOH- treated mice caused alterations in the colon wall D including the formation of cell infiltrates and severe edema in the muscular layer D arrows.

Importantly the colon of C57BL6 mice with colitis induced by TNBS or oxazolone had increased SRB colonization and the administration of D. indonesiensis to mice with TNBS-induced colitis clearly exacerbated the alterations in colonic architecture observed in the established disease and also increased mouse weight loss.

Germ-free mice are therefore more susceptible to infections by certain pathogens  even when compared with specific pathogen-free SPF mice .Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota can contribute to the development of different pathological conditions including obesity autoimmune diseases and colitis .

SRB activity and growth were detected by a medium color change to black due to the production of iron sulfide from H2S released by active bacteria.Colonization of germ-free mice with SRBHuman SRB consortium cultures or cultures of Desulfovibrio in- donesiensis isolated from a biofilm on a corroded ship off the Indonesian coast were centrifuged at 2000g at 4 degC resuspended in PBS at a density of 5 x 108 bacteriamL and 200 mL of this suspen- sion was inoculated intragastrically into germ-free mice 108 bacteria animal.

The mass of H2S mg per g of tissue was determined by a standard curve using a H2S donor agent.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA coupled to Tukey's post-hoc test using the GraphPad Prism Software version 4 with p values  0.05 considered statistically significant.ResultsSulfate-reducing bacteria effectively colonize the intestines of germ-free mice producing H2STo analyze in a more controlled environment the effect of SRB co- lonization on intestinal homeostasis and on the function of intestinal immune cells we inoculated germ-free mice intragastrically with SRB and examined different aspects of tissue damage and inflammation.
