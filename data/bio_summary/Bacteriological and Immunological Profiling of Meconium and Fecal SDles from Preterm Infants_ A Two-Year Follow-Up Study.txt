previous studies monitoring the bacterial communities using culture-dependent and independent techniques in term and preterm infants have detected a reduced number of bacterial species in the fecal microbiota of preterm infants compared with term infants -.

in preterm infants the establishment of obligate anaerobes especially bifidobacteria are delayed compared with full-term infants and facultative anaerobes such as enterobacteria enterococci and staphylococci seem to persist for several weeks at high levels in the preterm infant's fecal microbiota -.

several studies have assessed immune compounds in saliva umbilical cord blood or peripheral blood of infants - but few have described the presence of cytokines chemokines growth factors or immunoglobulins in fecal samples of preterm babies -.in this context the objectives of this study were firstly to study if the abnormal initial colonization of preterm babies previously studied  may affect their fecal bacterial composition when they are 2 years old by using a phylogenetic microarray  and secondly to characterize and compare the immune profiles of the meconium and infant feces obtained from such infants in the first weeks after birth and also at the age of 2.materials and methodspatients and samplingthis prospective study included sixteen 2-year-old infants who were born prematurely at the hospital universitario 12 de octubre madrid spain table .table 1. demographic data for the infant cohort.written informed parental consent was obtained for each infant before inclusion in the study which was approved by the ethical committee on clinical research of the hospital clinico san carlos of madrid 10017-e. this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.

the results of this study indicate that the diversity of the gut microbiota of 2-year-old infants who were born preterm has not yet reached the attributes of the adult microbiome.colonization of the infant gut by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is often delayed or even absent in the case of antibiotic-treated infants  including preterm neonates .

received 28 september 2017 accepted 22 november 2017 published 27 november 2017abstract an abnormal colonization pattern of the preterm gut may affect immune maturation and exert a long-term influence on the intestinal bacterial composition and host health.

however follow-up studies assessing the evolution of the fecal microbiota of infants that were born preterm are very scarce.

from an initial low diversity andnutrients 2017 9 1293 doilow complexity the intestinal bacterial community of the infant will gradually develop and mature reaching an enduring adult state after 2-3 years of age .however the establishment and development of the intestinal microbiota differ between preterm and healthy term infants .

the abnormal gut colonization in preterm infants during their first weeks of life  may affect the maturation of the gut barrier as well as its nutritional and immunological functions at that time and later .there is circumstantial evidence that initial microbial gut colonization and the resulting immune and metabolic programming could have a long-lasting influence on the risk for future diseases .

however little is known about the possible influence of gut microbiota on the human immune system and how early bacterial colonization affects immune maturation  particularly among preterm infants .

all infants were fed with human milk donor milk andor their own mother's milk and occasionally with preterm formula.the medical staff from the department of neonatology of the hospital had collected first spontaneously evacuated meconium and fecal samples during the infants' stays at the nicu .
