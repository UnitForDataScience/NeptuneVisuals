BMC Microbiology 2017 1770DOI 10.1186s12866-017-0978-6The nasopharyngeal microbiota of beef cattle before and after transport to a feedlotDevin B. Holman1 Edouard Timsit2 Samat Amat3 D. Wade Abbott3 Andre G. Buret4 and Trevor W. Alexander3BackgroundThe nasopharyngeal NP microbiota of cattle is com- prised of a wide range of bacteria the proportions of which may vary between individual animals and throughout placement in feedlots -Colonization of the nasopharynx begins shortly after birth and the microbiota continues to change as cattle age al- though it is typically dominated by members of the Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Tenericutes phyla - The relatively abundant genera in the NP microbiota include Corynebacterium Moraxella MycoplasmaPasteurella Psychrobacter and Staphylococcus   .

As expected this core microbiota consisted of many of the most relatively abundant OTUs such as those classified as Mycoplasma Psychrobacter Amnibacterium and Acinetobacter.Temporal changes in the bovine nasopharyngeal microbiota A number of changes were noted in the NP microbiota of the cattle from the time they were sampled at the disease-free ranch d 0 and then after transportation and holding at the feedlot over 14 d. With regard to BRD-associated bacteria the relative abundance of Mannheimia did not change significantly over time P  0.05 although the NP microbiota of one heifer at d 7 was comprised of 30 Mannheimia Fig.

Chimeric sequences were removed using the UCHIME algorithm implemented in USEARCH v. 6.1544 Sequences were then assigned to operational taxonomic units OTUs at 97 similarity using an open-reference OTU picking method and the SILVA database v. 123 In this method sequences that were less than 97 similar to those in the SILVA database were clustered into OTUs using the de novo approach and USEARCH.

The bacter- ial and archaeal community structure beta-diversity of each group and sampling time was evaluated using the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances and vi- sualized as principal coordinate analysis PCoA plots using Emperor Functional analysis of the NP microbiomeThe predicted functional analysis of the NP microbiome was performed using PICRUSt Phylogenetic Investiga- tion of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States v. 1.0.0.

Taxonomy was assigned using the UCLUST consensus taxonomy assigner with a minimum similarity of 0.8 and max accepts of three Sequences were then aligned using PyNAST and a phylogenetic tree was created using FastTree  OTUs containing fewer than tensequences were removed prior to analysis as were se- quences classified as mitochondria or chloroplasts.To account for uneven sequencing depth across sam- ples each sample was randomly subsampled to 24500 sequences with the loss of one sample in the day 0 group.

The evenness equitability and diversity Shannon's index of the sam- ples also varied over time with greater evenness and Shannon diversity at d 2 compared to d 14.The NP microbiota structure also shifted significantly based on sampling time as assessed using unweighted UniFrac distances R-value  0.50 P  0.001 Fig.

The swabs were placed in the remaining swab suspension and stored at -80 degC until DNA extraction.DNA extraction PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA geneTotal DNA was extracted from NP swabs using a Qiagen DNeasy Tissue kit Qiagen Inc. Mississauga ON Canada as previously described 16S rRNA gene se- quence libraries were generated using a two-step PCR protocol.

PICRUSt uses the phylogenetic compos- ition of a sample based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing to infer the functional content of the microbiota For this analysis sequences were clustered into OTUs in QIIME using the closed reference OTU picking algo- rithm and the Greengenes 135 database and all samples were randomly subsampled to 17700 sequences.

The NP microbiota did appear to become more homogenous over the 14-d study period as the number of OTUs shared by all animals at each sample time increased from only 76 at day 0 to an average of 313 at the days 2 7 and 14.In terms of membership most striking was the enrich- ment of Mycoplasma in day 14 samples Figs.

However with an increasing number of studies showing the import- ance of the host's microbiota in relation to health  it is important to also evaluate the impact of production prac- tices on the microbiota of livestock.
