In particular the analysis of mothers receiving antibiotics the year after pregnancy but not in pregnancy with no such associations suggest a pregnancy effect of antibiotics and that these factors are not confounding the association between mothers' antibiotic use in pregnancy and OM or VT in the young child.The study is observational and we cannot claim causality of the antibiotics however the stratification in pregnancy tri- mesters and in the dose-response relation from antibiotics as well as mode of delivery allows us to speculate in possible mechanisms.The risk of OM was increased in children born to mothers who had been exposed to antibiotics in pregnancy however this effect was not present after treatment in the first trimester and with no effects of treatment after birth.

We found that the risk of OM was associated primarily with the use of RTI antibiotics but not significantly with UTI an- tibiotics although the estimate was increased and that the risk of VT was associated with UTI antibiotics and not signifi- cantly with RTI antibiotics.

We also analyzed the effect of being born preterm and of breastfeeding duration but we found no association between these factors and the risk of OM or VT in our cohort.Maternal Antibiotic Use and Risk of Acute OM Maternal antibiotics use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of OM in the child during the first 3 yearsof life adjusted hazard ratio aHR 1.30 95 CI 1.04-1.63 P  .02.

Dose-response relationship between the number of maternal antibiotic treatments in pregnancy and the risk of VTs in childhood.StratificationStratification for mode of delivery resulted in higher risk of both OM and VT after pregnancy antibiotics in children with vaginal delivery although the difference was not significant OM cesarean delivery aHR 1.23 95 CI 0.95-1.59 P  .11vaginal delivery aHR 1.70 95 CI 1.01-2.89 P  .05 and VTcesarean delivery aHR 0.96 95 CI 0.67-1.38 P  .81 vaginaldelivery aHR 1.97 95 CI 0.97-3.98 P  .06.

We previously reported associations between maternal antibiotic intake during pregnancy and risk of childhood asthma.However in a follow-up study of national registry data it seemed that antibiotics before during and after preg- nancy were associated equally with the child's asthma risk there- fore maternal antibiotic use was interpreted as a marker of disease propensity which was inherited by the child rather than a causal agent for asthma itself.In the present study we found no association between maternal antibiotic intake the year after pregnancy and the child's risk of neither OM nor VT espe- cially when looking at the association between treatment the year after and not having received any antibiotics during preg- nancy.

This corresponds with 34 of children n  87 having VT if mothers had been treated with antibiotics and 27 N  118 having VT if the mother had not been treated with antibiotics.

In children born to mothers treated with RTI antibiotics in pregnancy 81 n  83 had OM compared with 64 n  263 if the mother had not been treated aHR 1.45 95 CI 1.11-1.89 P  .006.

It could weaken our OM endpoint that not all children had fullfollow-up however we had full data on VT.High intake of antibiotics could be caused by a disease pro- pensity in the mother which the child would likely inherit or it could be due to maternal doctor-seeking behavior which would also be conferred to the child.

A total of 73 of the children n  514 had full follow-up and 90 valid diary information in the first 3 years of life and was included in the analyses of OM 67 n  346 had 1 episode of OM in this period.

We furthermore observed a dose-response relationship with an increased risk of OM with an increasing number of treatments.The COPSAC2010 birth cohort has been followed prospec- tively from birth and the collected data on the 700 children has been linked to the registry data for information on all ma- ternal antibiotic prescriptions and the children's VT proce- dures.
