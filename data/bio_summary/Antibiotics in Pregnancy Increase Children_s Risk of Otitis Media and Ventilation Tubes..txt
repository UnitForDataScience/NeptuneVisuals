we also analyzed the effect of being born preterm and of breastfeeding duration but we found no association between these factors and the risk of om or vt in our cohort.maternal antibiotic use and risk of acute om maternal antibiotics use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of om in the child during the first 3 yearsof life adjusted hazard ratio ahr 1.30 95 ci 1.04-1.63 p  .02. overall 74 n  138 had om before 3 years of age if the mother had received antibiotics in pregnancy com- pared with 64 n  208 if the mother had not been treated.

in children born to mothers treated in the third pregnancy tri- mester 77 n  56 had om compared with 66 n  290 if the mother had not been treated this finding was nonsig- nificant after adjustment ahr 1.34 95 ci 0.98-1.83 p  .06. in children born to mothers treated in the second pregnancy trimester 78 n  67 had om compared with 65 n  279 if the mother had not been treated ahr 1.40 95 ci 1.06- 1.85 p  .02. we found no association between treatment in first trimester and risk of om.

antibiotics may perturb maternal bacte- rial colonizationand a subsequent unfavorable maternal bacterial ecology may trigger lasting disease processes in perinatal life in susceptible offspring or affect the earliest colonization of the child by vertical transmission.otitis media om is one of the most common infections in early childhood.middle ear effusion and recurrent acute om are often treated with ventilation tubes vt. some aspects of the pathogenesis of om are well-described including the anatomic genetic and infectious microbiological componentswhereas others remain obscure including environmental trig- gers of disease susceptibility.the objective of this study was to analyze the effect of maternal antibiotic intake during pregnancy on the risk of om and vts in early childhood.

in children born to mothers treated with rti antibiotics in pregnancy 81 n  83 had om compared with 64 n  263 if the mother had not been treated ahr 1.45 95 ci 1.11-1.89 p  .006. there was no effect of uti antibiotics on the risk of om.

in particular the analysis of mothers receiving antibiotics the year after pregnancy but not in pregnancy with no such associations suggest a pregnancy effect of antibiotics and that these factors are not confounding the association between mothers' antibiotic use in pregnancy and om or vt in the young child.the study is observational and we cannot claim causality of the antibiotics however the stratification in pregnancy tri- mesters and in the dose-response relation from antibiotics as well as mode of delivery allows us to speculate in possible mechanisms.the risk of om was increased in children born to mothers who had been exposed to antibiotics in pregnancy however this effect was not present after treatment in the first trimester and with no effects of treatment after birth.

we furthermore observed a dose-response relationship with an increased risk of om with an increasing number of treatments.the copsac2010 birth cohort has been followed prospec- tively from birth and the collected data on the 700 children has been linked to the registry data for information on all ma- ternal antibiotic prescriptions and the children's vt proce- dures.

we observed no effect of antibiotic treatment in the year after pregnancy nor when restricting the analysis to those mothers who did not receive any antibiotics in pregnancy .maternal antibiotic use and risk of vtsmaternal antibiotic use in pregnancy was likewise associated with an increased risk of vt in the children during the first 3 years of life although not significant in the overall analysis ahr 1.14 95 ci 0.83-1.56 p  .42. this corresponds with 34 of children n  87 having vt if mothers had been treated with antibiotics and 27 n  118 having vt if the mother had not been treated with antibiotics.

we previously reported associations between maternal antibiotic intake during pregnancy and risk of childhood asthma.however in a follow-up study of national registry data it seemed that antibiotics before during and after preg- nancy were associated equally with the child's asthma risk there- fore maternal antibiotic use was interpreted as a marker of disease propensity which was inherited by the child rather than a causal agent for asthma itself.in the present study we found no association between maternal antibiotic intake the year after pregnancy and the child's risk of neither om nor vt espe- cially when looking at the association between treatment the year after and not having received any antibiotics during preg- nancy.

thirty-seven percent of the mothers received an- tibiotics during pregnancy and this was associated with increased risk of otitis media adjusted hazard ratio 1.30 95 ci 1.04-1.63 p  .02. the risk of receiving vts was especially associated with third trimester antibiotics ad- justed hazard ratio 1.60 95 ci 1.08-2.36 p  .02. the risk of otitis media increased with increasing number of treatments per-level adjusted hazard ratio 1.20 95 ci 1.04-1.40 p  .02 but for vts this association was not significant after adjustment.conclusion maternal use of antibiotics during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of otitis media and vt insertions in the offspring.

the incidence of vt insertions before 3 years of age was 29 n  205. a total of 73 of the children n  514 had full follow-up and 90 valid diary information in the first 3 years of life and was included in the analyses of om 67 n  346 had 1 episode of om in this period.

we found that the risk of om was associated primarily with the use of rti antibiotics but not significantly with uti an- tibiotics although the estimate was increased and that the risk of vt was associated with uti antibiotics and not signifi- cantly with rti antibiotics.

we com- pared the children with adequate diary information with those who did not participate in the om analysis and found that only maternal smoking during pregnancy was different signifi- cantly between these groups.

some parents did not manage to fill out the diary every day for 3 years which caused 186 children to be excluded from the om analysis.
