alveolar macrophages from the abt mice had higher protein and gene levels of arg1 ccl24 il-13 il-10 il-6 and il-1b which could be recovered to normal levels by reconstructing commensal bacteria in the upper respiratory of abt mice.

of these 310 degs 249 genes in both abt micefigure 2. altered gene expression in alveolar macrophages isolated from abt mice.

here by using an antibiotic-treated abt mouse model we found commensal bacteria depletion induced lower frequencies and numbers of alveolar macrophages.

moreover alveolar macrophages performed significant enhancement of m2 functions especially ccl24 secretion in the abt mice challenged with b16f10 melanoma.

adoptive transfer of normal alveolar macrophages or antibody neutralization of ccl24 significantly recovered the decrease of gdt17 cells and rescued the defect anti-tumor response of abt mice indicating the elevated amount of alveolar macrophage- derived ccl24 inhibited gdt cell mediated anti-tumor response.

in this study we used an antibiotic-treated abt mouse model and firstly demonstrated that commensal microbiota maintained alveolar macrophages with a low level of ccl24production which was necessary for them to generate anti-tumor activity.materials and methodsmice and antibiotics treatment.

the abt experimental groups were assigned as previously described.

il-6 558301 il-1b 560232 il-10 558300 and il-13 558349 were detected by flow cba kit bd pharmingen san diego ca usa.figure 1. decreased numbers of alveolar macrophages in abt mice.

c57bl6 mice in the abt group were given 1 gl ampicillin 0.5 gl vancomycin 1 gl neomycin sulfate and 1 gl metronidazole in their drinking water for five weeks.

into the abt mice one day before the b16f10 challenge and additional transfers were performed every week.

into the abt mice 100 mgmouse in 250 ml of pbs one day before b16f10 challenge and additional injections were performed every week.

a p-value  0.05 was considered statistically significant.resultsalveolar macrophage number and gene expression are altered in abt mice.

after five weeks of antibiotics treatment the frequency and number of macrophages were significantly lower in the lungs of the abt mice than in the lungs of the controls fig.

a total of 39430 genes were analyzed in alveolar macrophages to compare the abt mice and the controls.

among 37401 positive signal values 37091 were not altered in the abt mice compared with the controls whereas a greater than 2-fold change was detected for 310 expressed genes.
