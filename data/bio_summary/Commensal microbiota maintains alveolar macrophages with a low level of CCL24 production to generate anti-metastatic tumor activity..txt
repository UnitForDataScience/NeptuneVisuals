b The list of DEGs was converted into Entrez-IDs for GO analysis with R 3.2.3 using the library GOstats 2.34.0 and the R Bioconductor genomewide mouse annotations from the package org.Mm.eg.db version 3.3.0. c The list of DEGs was convertedinto Entrez-IDs for KEGG analysis with R 3.2.3 using the library GOstats 2.34.0 and the R Bioconductor genomewide mouse annotations from the package org.Mm.eg.db version 3.3.0.and the controls gave signal values that were distinguished from the background.

The information from the gene microarray analysis in this study will help us to further explore the mechanisms by which microbiota regulates the expression of CCL24 in alveolar macrophages.ReferencesThaiss C. A. Zmora N. Levy M.  Elinav E. The microbiome and innate immunity.

The Abt experimental groups were assigned as previously described.

The mice in Abt group were given antibiotics for five weeks.

b The heatmap showed the differential expression of the indicated genes between the Abt group and the control group.

The mice in Abt group were given antibiotics for five weeks.

The immune characteristics of alveolar macrophages isolated from the Abt mice and the controls were compared and there were no significant differences in the expression of functional molecules MHC-II CD86 CD127 CD69 CD1632 and CCR7 Supplemental Fig.

The mice in Abt group were given antibiotics for five weeks.

The pie chartshowed the distribution of DEGs in Abt group compared with the control.

The frequencies and numbers of macrophages remained much lower in the lungs of the Abt mice 17 days after challenged with B16F10 melanoma Fig.
