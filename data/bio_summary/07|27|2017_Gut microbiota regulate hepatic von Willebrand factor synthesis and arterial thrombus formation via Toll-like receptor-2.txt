tlr2 deficiency had no effect on platelet counts tail bleeding time platelet volume granularity shape or white blood cell counts supplemental figure 6f-k. a platelet autonomous signaling defect was also unlikely because of unaltered platelet agonist responses of tlr222 platelets compared with wt control platelets supplemental figure 7a-h.to further exclude that the reduced platelet thrombus growth observed in tlr222 mice was caused by platelet tlr2 signaling we reconstituted platelet-depleted wt mice with tlr222 platelets.

in the absence of microbiota reduced vwf plasma levels result in impaired vwf-integrin binding and reduced platelet deposi- tion to the subendothelial matrix at the arterial injury site.metabolite trimethylamine n-oxide or microbiota-triggered seroto- nin synthesis by colonic enterochromaffin cells were recently identified as regulators of platelet function.6162 carboxyalkylpyrrole- phosphadidylethanolamine derivatives in hyperlipidemic atheroscle- rotic mice enhance platelet tlr2-induced thrombus formation21 and trimethylamine n-oxide a commensal metabolite with increased synthesis under a choline-enriched diet promotes ferric chloride- induced occlusive thrombus formation.61 because diets were strictly controlled in our experimental settings the demonstrated role of com- mensal microbiota on platelet deposition to the carotid artery is notably independent of dietary intervention.under noninfectious conditions intestinal gut microbes typi- cally do not access the liver but it has been demonstrated that fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran of 4 kda freely diffuses through the intestinal endothelial barrier63 and that the hepatic endothelium is exposed to products of the commensal gut microbiota triggering innate immune receptor signaling.1-3 because tlr2 agonists can induce canonical tlr signaling responses in platelets we initially attributed the platelet adhesion defect of tlr222 platelets to platelet autonomous signaling.

therefore and solely to indicate this fact this article is hereby marked advertisement in accordance with 18 usc section 1734.c 2017 by the american society of hematology542blood 27 july 2017 x volume 130 number 4released into blood and the subendothelium26 by endothelial cells27 and packaged into platelet a-granules28 by megakaryocytes.29 at sites of vascular injury plasma vwf promotes platelet adhesion to the ex- tracellular matrix and platelet aggregation30 in particular as wall shear rates increase.31 subendothelial vwf supports platelet adhesion32 whereas platelet-released vwf is not essential for hemostasis.3334 vwf multimers vary in size from 5 3 105 to .5 3 107 da but are released on the endothelial cell surface as larger fibrils35 that are rapidly cleaved by the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 13 metalloproteinase adamts13.36 plasma vwf can self-associate into multimers by shear-dependent37 or -independent processes38 and contains binding sites for adhesion receptors and extracellular matrix components.

platelet counts and collagen-induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma were not different between gf mice and conv-r controls supplemental figure 1a-b.plasma vwf is required for normal platelet adhesionaggregation on extracellular matrix components under arterial flow conditions.31 as a possible explanation for reduced thrombus growth we found lower levels of vwf in the plasma of gf mice compared with conv-r wild- type wt mice figure 1b.

control experiments excluded that platelet tlr2 regulated the laminin-binding integrin a6 supplemental figure 4b.54 thus vwf synthesis in the liver and plasma levels are regulated by tlr2 and are a critical determinant for platelet deposition in this static assay.moderate changes in vwf influence platelet deposition on the extracellular matrixwe further characterized the effects of varying vwf levels on tlr222 platelets in vitro.

conversely the incubation of vwf12 platelets with tlr222 plasma also did not promote increased platelet deposition data not shown demonstrating that vwf12 and tlr222 mice are defective in a common factor in their plasma.incubation of tlr222 platelets with purified vwf to achieve an estimated 30 increase in total vwf levels increased platelet deposition on laminin that was prevented by the monoclonal antibody lj-152b6 blocking the rgd integrin binding site of human vwf figure 3c demonstrating rescue of matrix interaction by vwf in- teracting with platelet integrins.

altogether our experiments demonstrate that decreased vwf plasma levels in tlr222 mice are caused by decreased hepatic synthesis.the synergistic engagement of redundant adhesion receptors for vwf mediated platelet deposition to the extracellular matrix is shear stress dependent.31 our results position the microbiota- and tlr2-dependent increase in plasma vwf and the effects on vwf binding to platelet integrins as central prothrombotic mechanisms that foster platelet thrombus growth after ligation injury of the carotid artery.

host-microbial symbiosis changes cellular immune function in the gut but also systemically.45 however tlr signaling is not restricted to the innate immune system6 but also involves cellular pathways relevant to hemostasis and thrombosis in endothelial cells tlr2 4 and 97-9 and platelets tlr1 2 4 6 and 9.10-13 in addition the fecal metagenome of symptomatic atheroscle- rosis patients is characterized by enrichment of genes encoding pg biosynthesis thus triggering tlrs.14innate immune defense mechanisms prevent dissemination of microbes and localize bacterial infection through the extrinsic tissuefactor coagulation pathway.15 platelets also act as a central evolutionary link between innate immune responses and hemostatic functions and respond to tlr ligands.16 tlr2 and tlr4 are linked to platelet activation and contribute to innate defense mechanisms by promoting the generation of prothrombotic extracellular nucleosomes and histones associated with neutrophil extracellular traps.17 tlr2 stimulation directly evokes platelet responses17-21 mediates endothelial responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns and can promote coagula- tion by endothelial cells.22 however it is not fully understood how tlrs contribute to thrombosis in vivo131821 and whether tlr sensing by the endothelium regulates thrombogenesis under steady-state or challenge conditions.22endothelial cell von willebrand factor vwf release and p-selectin externalization are triggered by tlr26.23 the multimeric protein vwf plays a key role in hemostasis and thrombosis.2425 vwf issubmitted 29 november 2016 accepted 22 may 2017. prepublished online asblood first edition paper 1 june 2017 doi 10.1182blood-2016-11-754416.

platelet adhesion and aggregation are mediated by coordinated shear- and activation-dependent binding of platelet gpiba to the vwf a1 domain39 and integrin aiibb3 to the arg-gly- asp rgd sequence40 in the vwf c4 domain respectively.41-44 in this article we identify an unexpected link by which gut microbiota promote arterial thrombus formation through tlr2- dependent regulation of endothelial vwf synthesis in the liverendothelium.30 minutes and coated with human vwf wilfactin 12 iuml or fibrinogen 200 mgml overnight at 4degc and blocked with 1 bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at room temperature rt.

thus reduced plasma vwf levels in gf and tlr222 mice diminish platelet integrin reactivity with vwf.thrombus growth in tlr2-deficient mice is dependent on the plasma milieuconsistent with the reduced vwf levels conv-r tlr222 mice showed decreased platelet thrombus growth in the carotid artery ligation model figure 4a supplemental videos 1 and 2. importantly546ja ckel et alblood 27 july 2017 x volume 130 number 4a2.0liver1.5lungb250cplasmaplasma1.51.00.51.00.5n.s.200150100500wttlr2 --0wttlr2 --0wttlr2 --wttlr2 --2.01.51.00.5livern.s.1.51.00.5lungn.s.d2.01.51.00.5liver ecsn.s.e2.01.51.00.5liver ecs0.0wttlr4 --0.0wttlr4 --0wttlr2 --0wttlr2 --fwt plateletslaminin coated slidesn.s.6050403020tlr2 -- platelets10preincubated in wt plasmapreincubated in tlr2 -- plasma0wt plasma tlr2 -- plasma ---wtplatelets-tlr2 --figure 2. impaired deposition of tlr2-deficient platelets to laminin coatings is dependent on reduced plasma vwf levels and hepatic vwf synthesis in tlr222 c57bl6 mice.

consistent with the normalization of defective adhesion by wt548ja ckel et alblood 27 july 2017 x volume 130 number 4figure 4. reduced platelet deposition to the ligation injured carotid artery in tlr2-deficient mice is independent of the platelet genotype and the adhesion defect is rescued by vwf supplementation.

accordingly vwf multimers and vwf mrna levels in liver and lung tissue were indistinguishable between wt and tlr222 mice under gf conditions figure 5b-c. importantly the marked difference in platelet deposition at the carotid artery ligation injury site observed between wt and tlr222 mice under conv-r conditions was no longer seen in littermates of gf wt and gf tlr222 mice figure 5d supplemental videos 3 and 4.colonization of gf wt and gf tlr222 mice restores differences in platelet depositionnext we recolonized strain-matched gf tlr222 and gf tlr211 mice with cecal microbiota from conv-r donor mice and analyzed lit- ters from recolonized mice in the carotid artery ligation injury model.
