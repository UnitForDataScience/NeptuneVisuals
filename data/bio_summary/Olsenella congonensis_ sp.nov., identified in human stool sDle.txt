Hence we propose that strain Marseille-P3359 is a new species of the genus Olsenella.Description of the new species 'Olsenella congonensis'Colonies of the strain Marseille-P3359T were smooth with a mean diameter of 0.8-1 mm.

We propose the discovery of the new species 'Olsenella congonensis' co.ng.on.en'sis.

'Olsenella congonensis' sp.nov.

At day 15 a 'Olsenella congonensis' colony was purely isolated on 5 blood-enriched Columbia agar bioMerieux Marcy l'Etoile France.

StrainMarseille-P3359 exhibited a 95 sequence identity with Olse- nella scatoligenes the phylogenetically closest species with standing nomenclature .

Hence it can be classified as a new species within the genus Olsenella .

When comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the different closely related species of Olsenella we found a range of similarity between 93 and 97.

congonensis to refer to Congo from where the stool's donor came.
