A-FMT - patients received autologous FMT H-FMT - patients received heterologous FMT with donor material.yND not determined.Community a diversity characterized using the Shan- non index  tended to be higher among samples sequenced using PacBio technology but differences between platform were not significant ANOVA P D 0.082.

However post-heterologous-FMT samples analyzed using Pac- Bio were considerably more alike than when analyzed using Illumina similar to taxonomic characterization.Figure 2.

Both pre- and post-FMT samples were examined using the RSII platform and Sequel results were compared against Illumina sequencing data from samples collected at 2 and 8 weeks after FMT was administered.

Notably very low abundances of genera within the Firmicutes a phylum typically prevalent in fecal communities were observed when samples were characterized by PacBio.Ordination of samples by principal coordinate analysis revealed similar separation of autologous FMT and heterologous FMT samples between plat- forms  in agreement with results described previously for the larger study cohort.

A-FMT patients received autologous FMT H-FMT patients received heterologous FMT.Resolution of communities at the species level revealed a greater shift in community composition among autologous FMT samples than was observed in heter- ologous FMT samples  where autologous FMT samples were characterized by fluctuations in abun- dance of species predominantly within the genus Bac- teroides.

This bacterium pro- duces a devastating and often fatal colitis that affects nearly 500000 people per year in the US.Traditional antibiotic treatment using antibiotic therapies may be effective but recurrence is seen in approximately 20- 30 of cases due to the disruption of the native micro- biota which may lead to continual infection.We have pioneered the use of FMT to treat this disease with success rates of 96.We now understand that restoration of normal intestinal function after FMT is due to replacement of healthful gut microbiota primarily those species within the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes that fill all available niches as well as an increase in secondary bile acids that limit C. difficile spore germination and vegetative growth.Despite these advances however specific species that may be important for this functional restoration are unknown in large part due to the limited taxonomic resolution of the Illumina-based sequencing technologies we have used to examine gut recolonization.Such limitation has led to the generation of often limited correlations and a lack of functionally based hypothe- ses aside from those based on data obtained using predictive software such as PICRUSt.To overcome these limitations we examined the potential use of third-generation PacBio RSII- and Sequel-based sequence analyses of the microbiota from feces of patients receiving FMT to cure CDI.

CCS Circular Consensus reads were generated using default parameters in the SMRT Link 3.1.1 application Pacific Biosciences Menlo Park CA and reads were aligned against the RefSeq genomic database using blastn.

Post-FMT samples were sequenced on the RSII system using 45 SMRT cells and generated 905267 reads comprising 662421070 bases and at N50 CCS read length of 739.
