This then led to the renaming of it as BV in 1983 Spiegel et al.

However early culture findings Holst et al.

vaginalis is not the sole cause of BV and many healthy women carry this organism even though different clades are present Paramel Jayaprakash et al.

The association of BV with cervicitis Schwebke and Weiss  and increased inflammatory markers Sturm-Ramirez et al.

including IL-8 and an- tibody against G. vaginalis hemolysin Cauci et al.

has been reported but a causal relationship between BV and PID has not been established Taylor et al.

and others have concluded BV is not inflammatory Weissenbacher et al.

However more recent reviews of studies on cytokines chemokines antimicrobial factors and cellular immune pa- rameters suggested that inflammation may occur in some BV patients Mitchell and Marrazzo  Borgdorff et al.

Indeed the 2014 review Mitchell and Marrazzo  also had a subheading of BBV is not the same microbiologic syndrome in all women which adds another definition to the discus- sion namely that BV is a Bsyndrome.The third statement that BV is Ba condition noted for dysbiosis CDC  or increased bacterial diversity has been supported by our microbiome and metabolomic studies McMillan et al.

The presence of amines that cause odor would appear to be other markers of BV but none were statistically significant and predictive in our study McMillan et al.
