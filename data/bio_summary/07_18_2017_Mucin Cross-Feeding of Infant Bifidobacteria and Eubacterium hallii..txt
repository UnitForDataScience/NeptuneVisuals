Similarly E. hallii released acetate while forming butyrate and formate from the glucose moiety.In mucin-grown B. bifidum co-cultures E. hallii used lac- tate and acetate to produce butyrate but E. hallii could also have used galactose or GlcNAc released from the mucin glycans.

To investigate whether co-cultures of infant bifidobacteria and E. hallii would yield propionate during mucin degrada- tion we then conducted three-strain fermentations B. bifidum and E. hallii were inoculated together with B. infantis or withB.

infantis or B. breve overnight culture grown liquid WCSP was added to 10 mL mYCFAglc while B. bifidum was subcultured in mYCFAmuc and the cultures were incubated at 37 degC for 24 h. To initiate co-culture experiments Hungate tubes containing 10 mL mYCFAmuc were inoculated with approximately log 7.7 cells mL-1 of E. hallii or B. infantis approximately log 6.8 cells mL-1 of B. breve or log 8.0 cells mL-1 of B. bifidum.

We confirmed here that growth on mucin is an intrinsic trait of the species B. bifidum   and that among the infant Bifidobacterium species tested only the presence of B. bifidum enabled growth of other bifidobacteria or of E. hallii due to the release of monosaccharides andorFig.

Growth was investigated in independent triplicates or quadruplicates.Growth of E. hallii in mYCFA Supplied with Mucin MonosaccharidesHungate tubes containing 10 mL mYCFAglc mYCFAgal mYCFAlac mYCFAglcnac or mYCFAnana were inocu- lated with 100-mL overnight cultures of E. hallii.

For selected samples representing at least one isolate of the investigated species metabolite formation was determined after 48-h growth in API medium with mucin120100806040200Retention time minGenetic Capacity of E. hallii for Mucin Monosaccharide Utilization210 6105Molecular weight Da104To identify mucin monosaccharide utilization pathways the genome of E. hallii DSM SAMN02415618 was obtained from the NCBI database and functional assignment was auto- matically performed using the RAST .Fig.

infantis DSM 20088 B. breve DSM 20213 and E. halliiDSM 3353.In single culture B. infantis B. breve and E. hallii did not grow and no metabolites were detected after 24-h incubation.

E. hallii was incubated in mYCFA supplied with glu- cose galactose lactose GlcNAc and NANA and growth was monitored by OD measurement for 24 h. As predicted by ge- nome analysis E. hallii grew in the presence of glucose galac- tose lactose and GlcNAc and growth was fastest with glucose Fig.

E. hallii and bifidobacteria cross- feeding improves environmental conditions for microbes such as Faecalibacterium Coprococcus and Roseburia which re- ly on the presence of SCFAs for growth .We also identified lactose galactose and GlcNAc as addi- tional carbon sources of E. hallii.

In the pres- ence of starch E. hallii formed butyrate from lactate and ac- etate produced by Bifidobacterium adolescentis while with fructo-oligosaccharides or inulin E. hallii also used mono- or disaccharides released by the bifidobacteria  .E.
