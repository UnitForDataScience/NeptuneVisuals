A single bac- terial genus can make up more than 50 of the gut microbiota in a significant part of ICU patients Enterococci Staphylococci and Clostridia are examples of dominating genera that can overrun the gut microbiome Other samples taken from patients on the ICU are described to be comparable with those obtained from decomposing corpses It should be noted however that - in these relatively small cohorts of patients - no associations could be found between microbiota diversity FirmicutesBac- teroides-ratio or Gram-positiveGram-negative ratio and outcome measurements such as complications and survival The considerable variation in the composition of the gut microbiome between critically ill patients comes as no surprise.

Experimental studies have shown that critical illness induces increased gut epithelial apoptosis andaCenter for Experimental and Molecular Medicine and bDivision of Infectious Diseases Department of Medicine Academic Medical Center University of Amsterdam Amsterdam The NetherlandsCorrespondence to W.

What will be the safety profile of FMT on the ICU on the short and long term Does a disturbed microbiota truly play a causative role in sepsis and or MODS or is this just an epiphenomenon Will restoration toward a normal microbiome restore MODS As earlier outlined by Klingensmith and Coopersmith  one could envision a first clinical trial of FMT for patients with MODS and dysbiosis- induced noninfectious diarrhea who do not requireantibiotics.

In this issue of Current Opinion in Critical Care researchers review current knowledge on the microbiome's effects on multiorgandysfunction syndromeMODS and give a perspective on how microbiota-targeted therapies could potentially be utilized on the ICU .Two recent studies that made use of in-depth sequencing techniques have highlighted the extreme dysbiosis of the fecal microbiome in patients treated on the ICU On the phylum level the 'ICU patient microbiome' is characterized by decreases in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes which are considered vital members of a healthy micro- biota with increases in potential pathogenic bac- teria such as the Proteobacteria Extreme interindividual differences are seen.

Current decolonization strategies aimed at preventing bacterial overgrowth have shown to decrease ICU mortality and future trials are on their way to provide more insights into their safety and potential effect on the induction of microbial resist- ance Thousands of patients on the ICU have already been treated with probiotics with strongest evidence on their potential to decrease the inci- dence of ventilator-associated pneumonia .

It will be of importance to better understand the effect of nutrient delivery on the intestinal microbiome to ultimately enhance the safety and quality of life for critically ill patients requiring nutritional support.The clinical relevance of the disturbed intestinal microbiota in the critically ill remains ill defined.

Critically ill patients demonstrate large interpersonal variation in intestinal microbiota dysregulation a pilot study.

Successful treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and diarrhea following severe sepsis.

Virtually all patients on the ICU are continuously exposed to a wide range of endogenous modulators e.g.

First reports highlight the successful and safe adminis- tration of FMT for severe C. difficile infection on the ICU In addition FMT has been reported to be suc- cessful in the treatment of critically ill patients with MODS and diarrhea following sepsis One should be cautious however to overinterpret these early results.
