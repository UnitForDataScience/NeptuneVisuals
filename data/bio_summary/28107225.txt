a single bac- terial genus can make up more than 50 of the gut microbiota in a significant part of icu patients enterococci staphylococci and clostridia are examples of dominating genera that can overrun the gut microbiome other samples taken from patients on the icu are described to be comparable with those obtained from decomposing corpses it should be noted however that - in these relatively small cohorts of patients - no associations could be found between microbiota diversity firmicutesbac- teroides-ratio or gram-positivegram-negative ratio and outcome measurements such as complications and survival the considerable variation in the composition of the gut microbiome between critically ill patients comes as no surprise.

in this issue of current opinion in critical care researchers review current knowledge on the microbiome's effects on multiorgandysfunction syndromemods and give a perspective on how microbiota-targeted therapies could potentially be utilized on the icu .two recent studies that made use of in-depth sequencing techniques have highlighted the extreme dysbiosis of the fecal microbiome in patients treated on the icu on the phylum level the 'icu patient microbiome' is characterized by decreases in firmicutes and bacteroidetes which are considered vital members of a healthy micro- biota with increases in potential pathogenic bac- teria such as the proteobacteria extreme interindividual differences are seen.

what will be the safety profile of fmt on the icu on the short and long term does a disturbed microbiota truly play a causative role in sepsis and or mods or is this just an epiphenomenon will restoration toward a normal microbiome restore mods as earlier outlined by klingensmith and coopersmith  one could envision a first clinical trial of fmt for patients with mods and dysbiosis- induced noninfectious diarrhea who do not requireantibiotics.

current decolonization strategies aimed at preventing bacterial overgrowth have shown to decrease icu mortality and future trials are on their way to provide more insights into their safety and potential effect on the induction of microbial resist- ance thousands of patients on the icu have already been treated with probiotics with strongest evidence on their potential to decrease the inci- dence of ventilator-associated pneumonia .

it will be of importance to better understand the effect of nutrient delivery on the intestinal microbiome to ultimately enhance the safety and quality of life for critically ill patients requiring nutritional support.the clinical relevance of the disturbed intestinal microbiota in the critically ill remains ill defined.

joost wiersingaabhow does the microbiome change in critically ill patients and how might this be leveraged thera- peutically research questions like these take center stage in the intensive care research arena .

virtually all patients on the icu are continuously exposed to a wide range of endogenous modulators e.g.

although more in-depth knowledge on the short-term and long-term health con- sequences of the observed shifts in the gut micro- biota composition in the critically ill is needed numerous microbiota-targeted tools are already being evaluated that could help improve the man- agement of these patients.the following treatment strategies are utilized to restore a 'healthy' microbiome during critical ill- ness selective decontamination of the digestive tract supplementation with probiotics or their products and fecal microbiota transplantation fmt.

first reports highlight the successful and safe adminis- tration of fmt for severe c. difficile infection on the icu in addition fmt has been reported to be suc- cessful in the treatment of critically ill patients with mods and diarrhea following sepsis one should be cautious however to overinterpret these early results.

that knowledge could pave the way to a more targeted and precise reconstitution of the gut microbiota down to a single or a small cocktail of bacterial species.

for instance the finding that clostridium scindens a bile acid 7a-dehydroxylating intestinal bacterium is associated with resistance to c. difficile infection and upon administration enhances resistance to c. difficile makes it a promising probiotic that could be used in the treatment and prevention ofdifficile infection .intriguing and promising as these new insights may be it remains to be seen whether the current microbiome research trend will have real medical implications for patients on the icu.

the gut microbiota plays a protective role in the host defence against pneumococcal pneumonia.
