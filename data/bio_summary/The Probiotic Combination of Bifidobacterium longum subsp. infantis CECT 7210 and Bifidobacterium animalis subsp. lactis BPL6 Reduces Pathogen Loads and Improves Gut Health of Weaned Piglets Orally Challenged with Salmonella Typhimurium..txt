none of the animals seeded salmonella in feces on arrival and serological analysis confirmed that animals had not been exposed to salmonella previous to the day of inoculation all animals being analyzed as seronegative along the whole trial.

in those animals it is interesting to point out that although all nn animals were positive in 2 days pi the maximum percentage of positive animals for np was 50 during all of the pi week.

improvements registered in the challenged animals due to the probiotic were increased voluntary feed-intake p probiotic x challenge  0.078 reduced fecal excretion of salmonella p  0.028 at day 1 pi and p  0.10 at days 3 and 5 pi decreased rectal temperature p probiotic x day  0.048 and improvements in the villouscrypt ratio p probiotic x challenge  0.001. moreover general probiotic benefits were observed in both challenged and non-challenged groups decreased diarrhea scores of the pi period p  0.014 improved fermentation profiles on day 8 pi increased ileal acetic acid p  0.008 and a tendency to lower colonic ammonia concentrations p  0.078 stimulation of intestinal immune response by increasing villous intraepithelial lymphocytes p  0.015 on day 8 pi and an improved villouscryptratio p  0.011. in conclusion the multi-strain probiotic had a positive effect on reducing pathogen loads and alleviating animals in a salmonella challenge.

animals were weaned at28  3 days of age 7.7  0.28 kg body-weight bw on average and were transported to the uab facilities where they were placed in three rooms of eight pens each 24 pens three animals per pen taking initial bw into account for a similar average bw within pens.

after 1 week of adaptation to the diets day 8 a single 2 ml dose 5 108 cfu of salmonella typhimurium was administered to the challenged animals by oral gavage and a single 2 ml dose of sterile bpw to the non- challenged animals challenge control group.body weight was recorded on days 1 8 12 and 16 while feed consumption was recorded on days 1 and 7 and on a daily basis of the post-inoculation pi period days 8-16. the average daily gain adg average daily feed intake adfi and gainfeed ratio gf were calculated by pen.

the mortality rate was also recorded and no antibiotic treatment was administered to any of the animals of the experiment.for microbiological analysis on day 1 fecal samples were taken aseptically from 24 animals that were randomly selected from the total before distribution.

n 8 for groups cn and cp n 4 for groups nn and np.on day 1 pi the challenged animals presented significantly higher rectal temperatures than did the non-challenged animals 40.0c vs. 39.3c p  0.001 despite the administration of the probiotic.

however on day 2 pi only the challenged animals not receiving the probiotic presented higher temperatures 39.9c vs. 39.2c 39.1c and 38.9c for cn cp nn and np respectively p interaction probiotic x day  0.048.salmonella analysisnone of the analyzed animals seeded salmonella on arrival.

unexpectedly three animals were positive for salmonella before inoculation day 0 pi and some additional animals of the non-challenged group also became positive for salmonella on days 1 3 4 7 and 8 pi.

however from all samples analyzed in the pi period 98.7 ofthe samples of challenged animals were found to be positive 1- 102 cfug during the pi period while only 45 of the samples of non-challenged animals were positive.

the probiotic administration significantly lowered the number of animals with high salmonella excretion levels on day 1 p 0.028 and also tended to lower them on days 3 p 0.078 and 4 p 0.056 with an increase in the frequency of the animals with less than 103 cfug.changes in fermentative activity shows the changes promoted by the experimental treatments on the main ileal and colonic fermentation products.in the ileum the salmonella challenge caused a mild affection with a tendency to decrease ileal lactic acid concentrations on day 4 pi p 0.096 and to increase ph on day 8 pi p 0.099. the colon was more severely affected with a significant p  0.001 decrease in lactic acid concentrations on day 8 pi and numerical decreases on day 4 pi p 0.141. significant decreases of colonic scfa were also observed on day 4 pi p 0.030 together with a tendency to increase ammonia concentrations p 0.104 on day 8 pi.some beneficial changes were observed in the fermentation profile with the probiotic treatment.

moreover in the non-challenged animals the probiotic also promoted an increase in crypt depths up to similar values of the challenged animals.

improvements registered in challenged animals were a reduction of the fecal excretion of salmonella typhimurium a decrease in rectal temperature to similar levels to that in non-challenged animals and improvements in the villouscrypt ratio.

animals were orally challenged after an adaptation period day 8 with a single dose 5 x 108 cfu of salmonella typhimurium.

in addition enhanced gut health and immunity was recorded in all animals receiving the probiotic indicating an improvement in the post-weaning outcome.keywords multi-strain probiotic bifidobacterium sp.
