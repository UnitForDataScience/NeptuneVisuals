None of the animals seeded Salmonella in feces on arrival and serological analysis confirmed that animals had not been exposed to Salmonella previous to the day of inoculation all animals being analyzed as seronegative along the whole trial.

In those animals it is interesting to point out that although all NN animals were positive in 2 days PI the maximum percentage of positive animals for NP was 50 during all of the PI week.

After 1 week of adaptation to the diets Day 8 a single 2 mL dose 5 108 cfu of Salmonella Typhimurium was administered to the challenged animals by oral gavage and a single 2 mL dose of sterile BPW to the non- challenged animals challenge control group.Body weight was recorded on Days 1 8 12 and 16 while feed consumption was recorded on Days 1 and 7 and on a daily basis of the post-inoculation PI period Days 8-16.

The mortality rate was also recorded and no antibiotic treatment was administered to any of the animals of the experiment.For microbiological analysis on Day 1 fecal samples were taken aseptically from 24 animals that were randomly selected from the total before distribution.

n 8 for groups CN and CP n 4 for groups NN and NP.On Day 1 PI the challenged animals presented significantly higher rectal temperatures than did the non-challenged animals 40.0C vs. 39.3C P  0.001 despite the administration of the probiotic.

However on Day 2 PI only the challenged animals not receiving the probiotic presented higher temperatures 39.9C vs. 39.2C 39.1C and 38.9C for CN CP NN and NP respectively P interaction probiotic x day  0.048.Salmonella AnalysisNone of the analyzed animals seeded Salmonella on arrival.

Unexpectedly three animals were positive for Salmonella before inoculation Day 0 PI and some additional animals of the non-challenged group also became positive for Salmonella on Days 1 3 4 7 and 8 PI.

However from all samples analyzed in the PI period 98.7 ofthe samples of challenged animals were found to be positive 1- 102 cfug during the PI period while only 45 of the samples of non-challenged animals were positive.

The probiotic administration significantly lowered the number of animals with high Salmonella excretion levels on Day 1 P 0.028 and also tended to lower them on Days 3 P 0.078 and 4 P 0.056 with an increase in the frequency of the animals with less than 103 cfug.Changes in Fermentative Activity shows the changes promoted by the experimental treatments on the main ileal and colonic fermentation products.In the ileum the Salmonella challenge caused a mild affection with a tendency to decrease ileal lactic acid concentrations on Day 4 PI P 0.096 and to increase pH on Day 8 PI P 0.099.

Moreover in the non-challenged animals the probiotic also promoted an increase in crypt depths up to similar values of the challenged animals.
