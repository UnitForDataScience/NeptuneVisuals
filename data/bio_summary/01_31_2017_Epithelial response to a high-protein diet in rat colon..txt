a trend towards lower DNA damage in colonocytes isolated from HPD-fed rats was observed when compared to NPD- fed rats p  0.06.Effects of the high-protein diet on NF-kB related path- ways in colonocytesAn important finding of the present study was the pre- dicted downregulation of NF-kB Signaling canonicalpathway in colonocytes of HPD-fed rats Z-score -3.13 Fig.

The functional analysis revealed that thefunction Repair of DNA was significantly enriched inTable 3 Significantly enriched functions related to cellular metabolism in the set of genes differentially expressed in colonocytes isolated from rats fed a high-protein diet compared to rats fed a normal-protein diet.

Although visually Ki67-labelling seemed generally more intense in the crypts of rats fed an HPD there was no significant difference with NPD-fed rats Fig.

After 15 min distal colon transmural resistance tended p  0.07 to be higher in rats fed an HPD when compared to rats fed an NPD Fig.

The HPD also induced a downregulation of genes encoding proteins involved in several DNA-repair pathways namely base excision repair Ogg1 Ung non-homologous end joining Nhej1 and nucleotide excision repair Ddb1  but this was not associated with significant changes in DNA dam- ages in colonocytes of rats fed an HPD when compared to rats fed an NPD.

These results are consistent with ourprevious electronic microscopy observation showing that there was no alteration of tight junction structure in colonic epithelium of rats fed an HPD 10 and with another study showing that colonic barrier function is preserved in HPD- fed piglets A very striking result of the present study was the inhib- ition of the NF-kB pathway in colonocytes of rats fed an HPD.

Indeed five mucin genes including Muc2 the major gel- forming mucin were upregulated in epithelial cells of HPD-fed rats in agreement with previous studies in rats and pigs  .

In rats fed an HPD the height of colonocyte brush border a key functional feature of absorptive cells is markedly reduced probably in relation with the observed perturbation of mitochon- drial metabolism An HPD also modifies goblet cell distribution in rat colonic epithelium together with anc The Authors.
