A total of 101 bats including 12 species were sampled and identified pallid bat Antrozous pallidus Townsend's big-eared bat Corynorhinus townsendii big brown bat Eptesicus fuscus silver-haired bat Lasionycteris noctiva- gans California myotis Myotis californicus Western small-footed myotis Myotis ciliolabrum long-eared myotis Myotis evotis fringed myotis Myotis thysanodes cave myotis Myotis velifer long-legged bat Myotis volans western canyon bat Parastrellus hesperus and Brazilian free-tailed bat Tadarida brasil- iensis.Isolation of actinobacteria.

The high abundance of novel species previously described from caves    and the present report of 15 putative novel species with antifungal activity from bats caught in western U.S. caves illustrate the potential of caves as a valuable resource for the discovery of novel antimicrobials.

DNA from pure cultures was extracted using the MoBio UltraClean microbial DNA isolation kit MoBio Carlsbad CA according to the manufacturer's protocol with the exception of using colonies from solid media and substituting 1.5 min of bead beating atTABLE 2 Description of Actinobacteria inhibiting Pseudogymnoascus destructansaBased on MLSA distance analysis .bPARA Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument ELMA El Malpais National Monument BLM Bureau of Land Management caves 45 and 55 FS Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area CAVE Carlsbad Cavern National Park.cInhibition activity was scored as low 1 to 15 mm medium 16 to 30 mm or high 31 to 45 mm.medium speed for a vortexing step.

This study confirms that caves and bats are a rich reservoir of novel species with the potential for the discovery of novel antifungal compounds but additional work is necessary to determine the nature of these bacterial associations with bats.Antagonists of P. destructans.

This study represents an additional effort to characterize culturable novel actinobacteria with antifungal properties that may serveTABLE 1 Number of bacterial isolates for each cave systemaCAVE Carlsbad Cavern National Park PARA Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument FS Fort Stanton- Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area ELMA El Malpais National Monument BLM Bureau of Land Management caves 45 and 55.as an alternative preventative measures or treatment for bats infected with WNS and other mycotic diseases.MATERIALS AND METHODSBat sampling.

Caves in the West are at high risk and are vulnerable to WNS due to their extraordinary bat diversity  appropriate temperatures and relative humidity that supports the growth of P. destructans  .In previous studies bacteria have shown the capacity to inhibit P. destructans in vitro .

We sampled bats on the surface and from caves posthibernation at the El Malpais Conservation Area Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument Bureau of Land Management BLM caves 45 and 55 Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area and Carlsbad Caverns National Park across New Mexico and Arizona Fig.

Our results suggest that bats in western North America caves possess novel bacterial microbiota with the potential to inhibit P. destructans.IMPORTANCE This study reports the largest collection of actinobacteria from bats with activity against Pseudogymnoascus destructans the fungal causative agent of white-nose syndrome.

One of the more phylogenetically distinct clades novel clade 9 is composed of five strains isolated from two bat species M. velifer and T. brasiliensis in Carlsbad Cavern National Park .

The 13 Pseudomonas cultures isolated from four species of western bats in this study did not exhibit inhibition of P. destruc- tans using the bilayer assay.
