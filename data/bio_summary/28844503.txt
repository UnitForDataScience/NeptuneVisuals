There was a significant decrease in the number of DCX-positive cells in Nr2e1-- mice F 29  22.65 p  0.001 compared to both wildtype and Nr2e1- animals A. DCX-positive cells which extended processes through the GCL were evident in wildtype and Nr2e1- but not in Nr2e1-- mice B-D. Morphological analysis of DCX-positive cells revealed that Nr2e1-- mice exhibited a significant decrease in dendritic length F 2 27  8.525 p  0.01 E a reduced number of dendrites F 2 27  4.219 p  0.05 F and a diminished number of branching points of the dendritic tree F 2 27  4.643 p  0.05 G-H compared to wildtype control mice.Microglia quantification and phenotype characterizationThere was a significant increase in number of microglia in the DG and GCL of Nr2e1-- mice compared to either their wildtype or Nr2e1- littermates DG F 2 9  16.43 p  0.001 GCL F 2 9 30.51 p  0.001.

All data are presented as mean - SEM.ResultsImpaired hippocampal architecture and reduced neurogenesis and survival of adult-born cells in Nr2e1-- but not Nr2e1- miceHistological examination of coronal sections through the hippo- campus of Nr2e1-- mice identified distortion of the hippocampal structure compared with wildtype and Nr2e1- littermate controls Suppl.

Lack of TLX causes a reduction in cell survival in the DG of Nr2e1-- but not Nr2e1- mice.Mean density cellsmm2 of adult-born surviving cells BrdU A and adult-born surviving neurons BrdU  NeuN B in the DG SGZ GCL and hilus of wildtype Nr2e1- and Nr2e1-- mice.

These results were coupled with deficits in neuronal mor- phology and neurogenesis in Nr2e1-- but not Nr2e1- mice as shown by a reduction in the density dendritic length and nodes of newborn neurons as well as the density of surviving new neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the DG.The current results support previous work by who showed alteration in the size and architecture of the hip- pocampus of Nr2e1-- in which the gene was functionally knocked down through homologous recombination compared to wildtype mice .

Lack of TLX is associated with reduction in neurogenesis and impaired morphology of newly born neurons in the DG of Nr2e1-- but not Nr2e1- mice.Mean number of DCX cells per mm3 in wildtype WT Nr2e1- and Nr2e1-- animals A.

We thus characterized the activation status of the microglia in the DG of Nr2e1-- mice by firstly assessing the morphology of the cells and observed that there was a significant increase in the proportion of activated microglia in the whole DG including the GCL and hilus of Nr2e1-- mice.

Upon examination of GFAP staining astrocytes appeared tohave adopted a reactive or activated phenotype in the hippocampus of Nr2e1-- mice when compared to Nr2e1- and wildtype mice as evidenced by increased fluorescence intensity and hypertrophy of processes B-D.DiscussionIn the present study we demonstrated a pro-inflammatory pheno- type in the DG of Nr2e1-- mice.

In addition the Nr2e1-- mice exhibited thin and frail rostral commissure the cerebrum and olfactory lobes were underdeveloped and the retina suffered diminished vascularization and displacement of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerves .Microglial cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the micro- environment of the subgranular neurogenic niche have also been shown to impact upon neurogenesis  .

Specifically the dendritic length number of dendrites and number of nodes for 10 randomly se- lected cells through the DG from each of five animals per group were compared across all three groups.Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of hippocampal tissueFresh brains from wildtype Nr2e1- and Nr2e1-- were snap frozen and stored at -80 degC.

We observed a significant decrease in the number of surviving adult-born cells BrdU-positive in the DG of Nr2e1-- mice compared to either wildtype or Nr2e1- mice F 2 10  6.354 p  0.001.
