we observed a significant decrease in the number of surviving adult-born cells brdu-positive in the dg of nr2e1-- mice compared to either wildtype or nr2e1- mice f 2 10  6.354 p  0.001. this difference was driven by a reduction of brdu-positive cells in the sgz of nr2e1-- mice f 2 10  5.115 p  0.05 compared to their wildtype and heterozygous littermates no significant change was observed across the three genotypes in the gcl f 2 10  0.159 p  0.05 or the hilus f 2 10  1.285 p  0.05 a. there was a significant decrease in the mean number of surviving new neu- rons in the dg of nr2e1-- compared to wildtype mice h 2  6.12 p  0.05. additionally the number of surviving new neurons in the sgz was significantly lower in nr2e1-- compared to wildtype and heterozygous littermates h 2  7.71 p  0.05. there was no sig- nificant effect of genotype in either the gcl h 2  1.19 p  0.55 or the hilus h 2  0.08 p  0.96 b c-e. there was a significant decrease in the number of dcx-positive cells in nr2e1-- mice f 29  22.65 p  0.001 compared to both wildtype and nr2e1- animals a. dcx-positive cells which extended processes through the gcl were evident in wildtype and nr2e1- but not in nr2e1-- mice b-d. morphological analysis of dcx-positive cells revealed that nr2e1-- mice exhibited a significant decrease in dendritic length f 2 27  8.525 p  0.01 e a reduced number of dendrites f 2 27  4.219 p  0.05 f and a diminished number of branching points of the dendritic tree f 2 27  4.643 p  0.05 g-h compared to wildtype control mice.microglia quantification and phenotype characterizationthere was a significant increase in number of microglia in the dg and gcl of nr2e1-- mice compared to either their wildtype or nr2e1- littermates dg f 2 9  16.43 p  0.001 gcl f 2 9 30.51 p  0.001. there was no difference in microglia density in the hilus f 2 9  1.435 p  0.28 across the three genotypesfig.

mice lacking tlx displayed microglia with greater cell somal area in the dg and gcl compared to wildtype or nr2e1- mice dg f 2 9  5.387 p  0.05 gcl f 2 9  7.665 p  0.01 b.within the hilus we did not observe any differences in microglia size across the three groups f 2 9  2.634 p  0.13 b. the proportion of resting or ramified microglia in the dg of mice with complete deletion of the tlx gene was significantly smaller than the proportion of ramified microglia in the wildtype controls f 2 9 5.683 p  0.05. the same pattern was observed in the gcl but not the hilus gcl f 2 9  5.480 p  0.05 hilus f 2 9  3.245p  0.09 c. finally when we compared the proportion of acti- vated microglia having enlarged soma across the three genotypes we found a significant increase of activated microglia in nr2e1-- mice compared to their wildtype and nr2e1- littermates across all areas examined dg f 2 9  6.531 p  0.01 gcl f 2 9  5.711p  0.05 hilus f 2 9  4.119 p  0.05 d-f. there was a significant increase in the relative mrna expression of the pro-in- flammatory cytokine il-1b in the hippocampus of mice lacking the tlx gene f 2 15  17.79 p  0.001 a. there was no difference in relative mrna expression of tnfa across the groups f 2 17 0.295 p  0.75 b. lastly when we compared the relative mrna expression of the alternatively activated markers arg1 and cd206 we observed no difference across the three genotypes arg1 f 2 21  0.174 p  0.05 d cd206 f 2 21  0.252 p  0.05 c.we previously confirmed the expression of tlx in astrocytes derived from cultures of hippocampal neural stem cells  .

2. lack of tlx is associated with reduction in neurogenesis and impaired morphology of newly born neurons in the dg of nr2e1-- but not nr2e1- mice.mean number of dcx cells per mm3 in wildtype wt nr2e1- and nr2e1-- animals a. representative confocal images through the dg of dcx green cells in wildtype b nr2e1- c and nr2e1-- d mice.

we thus characterized the activation status of the microglia in the dg of nr2e1-- mice by firstly assessing the morphology of the cells and observed that there was a significant increase in the proportion of activated microglia in the whole dg including the gcl and hilus of nr2e1-- mice.

all data are presented as mean - sem.resultsimpaired hippocampal architecture and reduced neurogenesis and survival of adult-born cells in nr2e1-- but not nr2e1- micehistological examination of coronal sections through the hippo- campus of nr2e1-- mice identified distortion of the hippocampal structure compared with wildtype and nr2e1- littermate controls suppl.

these results were coupled with deficits in neuronal mor- phology and neurogenesis in nr2e1-- but not nr2e1- mice as shown by a reduction in the density dendritic length and nodes of newborn neurons as well as the density of surviving new neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the dg.the current results support previous work by who showed alteration in the size and architecture of the hip- pocampus of nr2e1-- in which the gene was functionally knocked down through homologous recombination compared to wildtype mice .

here we show that immunostaining of hippocampal tissue from wildtype mice revealed no overlap between tlx and iba-1 expression a. upon examination of gfap staining astrocytes appeared tohave adopted a reactive or activated phenotype in the hippocampus of nr2e1-- mice when compared to nr2e1- and wildtype mice as evidenced by increased fluorescence intensity and hypertrophy of processes b-d.discussionin the present study we demonstrated a pro-inflammatory pheno- type in the dg of nr2e1-- mice.

in addition the nr2e1-- mice exhibited thin and frail rostral commissure the cerebrum and olfactory lobes were underdeveloped and the retina suffered diminished vascularization and displacement of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerves .microglial cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the micro- environment of the subgranular neurogenic niche have also been shown to impact upon neurogenesis  .

specifically we observed a sig- nificant increase in density of endogenous microglia in the dentate area of nr2e1-- mice while nr2e1- and wildtype mice displayed si- milar and lower densities of iba1-positive cells.

whether the spontaneous deletion of tlx in our model causes direct activation of astrocytes which thereby activate microglia or whether a lack of tlx results in activation of microglia which cause astrocytes to adopt reactive phenotype remains to be investigated.in order to determine whether the increased number of activatedmicroglia in nr2e1-- mice display a pro-inflammatory or neuropro- tective phenotype we examined the relative mrna expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines il-1b and tnfa as well as the expression of alternatively activated markers arg1 and cd206 in the hippocampus offig.

in the absence of inflammation ramified microglia are involved in pruning newborn cells in providing trophic support for newly forming cells and in apoptosis of newborn cells that fail to integrate into the existing cir- cuitry .

specifically the dendritic length number of dendrites and number of nodes for 10 randomly se- lected cells through the dg from each of five animals per group were compared across all three groups.quantitative rt-pcr analysis of hippocampal tissuefresh brains from wildtype nr2e1- and nr2e1-- were snap frozen and stored at -80 degc.
