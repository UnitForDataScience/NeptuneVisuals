relatively simplified biomarkers for selected diseases may be looked for and calculated by complex computa- tional methods based on parameters such as microbial diversity of the microbiota predominance or absence of specific species of bacteria levels of defined metabolites and other.words have an extraordinary power  some like pathogen or pathogenicity may obscure the right inter- pretation of biological processes and other words may facilitate the clarification of complex developments  we claim that the introduction of certain terms to the world of medicine may greatly improve our understand- ing of both health and disease.
