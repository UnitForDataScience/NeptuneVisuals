Despite the introduction of new antidepressant drugs many obese patients treated for depres- sion respond poorly to therapy suggesting that obesity may reduce the efficacy of anti-depression treatment .While depression is a multifactorial disease associated with fac- tors such as stress genetic predisposition and traumatic life events recent studies indicate that chronic inflammation caused by a high-fat diet HFD may play a major role in inducing neuro- inflammation and depression.

Accord- ingly elevated numbers of macrophages have been observed in various brain areas including the PFC AMG HYP and HPC.HFD brain inflammation and depressionLong-term HFD feeding is known to produce systemic chronic inflammation in animals and humans  .

Consumption of a high-fat diet leads to obesity and chronic systemic inflammation.

We review here recent studies suggesting the existence of a link between obe- sity the gut microbiota and depression focusing on the mechanisms underlying the effects of a high-fat diet on chronic inflammation and brain physiology.

This body of research suggests that modulating the composition of the gut microbiota using prebiotics and probiotics may produce beneficial effects on anx- iety and depression.c 2017 Elsevier Inc.

While the role played by neurological and hormonal systems has been described in previous reviews  we focus here on the mechanisms underlying the effects of HFD on the immune sys- tem and brain physiology.Obesity and inflammationObesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in peripheral tissues and blood circulation  .

In contrast the adipocytes of lean individuals secrete higheramounts of anti-inflammatory adipokines such as adiponectin which increases insulin sensitivity and protects against type 2 dia- betes mellitus and cardiovascular disease .Immune cells found in adipose tissue play a large role at the early stage of HFD-induced inflammation.

Macrophages that accumulate in adipose tissues of obese mice belong to the M1 macrophage phenotype or ''classical activation which is involved in inflammation and tissue damage.

In contrast macrophages iso- lated from adipose tissues of lean mice mainly express genes asso- ciated with the M2 macrophage phenotype or ''alternative activation which is involved in resolution of inflammation and tissue repair .
