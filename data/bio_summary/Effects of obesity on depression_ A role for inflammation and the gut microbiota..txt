Despite the introduction of new antidepressant drugs many obese patients treated for depres- sion respond poorly to therapy suggesting that obesity may reduce the efficacy of anti-depression treatment .While depression is a multifactorial disease associated with fac- tors such as stress genetic predisposition and traumatic life events recent studies indicate that chronic inflammation caused by a high-fat diet HFD may play a major role in inducing neuro- inflammation and depression.

On the other hand a study showed that overfeeding for eight weeks 760 kcal- day increases LPS endotoxemia in healthy non-obese individuals but blood IL-6 levels increase only in a few individuals possiblydue to LPS-binding proteins or other mechanisms which may pro- tect against systemic inflammation .Mice fed a HFD show reduced expression of zonula occludens-1 a tight-junction protein that maintains intestinal integrity   suggesting that bacterial LPS may cross the gut barrier via the paracellular pathway.

Psychobiotics consisting of prebiotics and probiotics reduce inflammation and may produce beneficial effects in depressed individuals.show higher HPC levels of BDNF and an increased amount of Bifi- dobacterium in feces compared with controls suggesting that pre- biotics may modulate the gut microbiota and affect brain function .

Yet it is important to note that the chronic inflammation observed in adipose tissues of obese individuals is non-resolving and occurs over a long period of time months to years indicating that the macrophage population may continuously evolve based on the signals that modulate the activ- ity of these cells and factors that induce macrophage deathsur- vival or replenishment from the pool of monocytes .

Bacterial LPS originating from the gut microbiota may thus represent an early factor that triggers chronic inflammation in obese individuals.

In addi- tion IL-1b and TNF-a stimulate 5-HT uptake by neuronal cells   while IFN-a decreases the expression of 5-HT receptor 1A .Systemic inflammation may induce accumulation of peripheral monocytes into the brain a process implicated in the development of mood disorders .

Long-term consump- tion of a Western-style HFD which is low in fiber may possibly result in reduced production of SCFAs by the gut microbiota and lead to systemic inflammation including in the brain.

These plants and mushrooms which produce relatively few or no side effects  represent poten- tial candidates to treat HFD-induced inflammation and depression.Perspectives and concluding remarksThe studies presented here suggest that reducing obesity- induced neuro-inflammation may lead to beneficial effects on depression see for a summary of the pathways linking HFD the gut microbiota neuro-inflammation and depression.

Accord- ingly elevated numbers of macrophages have been observed in various brain areas including the PFC AMG HYP and HPC.HFD brain inflammation and depressionLong-term HFD feeding is known to produce systemic chronic inflammation in animals and humans  .
