Remarkably most of the studies performed until now in order to decipher the etiol- ogy of ADHD have focused on the study of the influence of the human genome in the risk of developing ADHD and or their phenotypes overlooking the fact that our second genome the genome of our microbiota is also involved in brain development and function and may play a crucial role in neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity at least according to experimental evidence from animal models .It is well established that the gut microbiome the entiregenome of the gut microbiota influences host development and physiology playing a key role in the balance between health and disease.

In particular genomic studies in ADHD including analysis of the gut microbiome are needed especially at early stages in life and during fur- ther neurodevelopmental periods childhood and adoles- cence where many psychiatric disorders first become evi- dent and when the role of the microbiota and its functions could be amenable .In this review we discuss the potential mechanisms bywhich the gut microbiota may influence the brain-gut axis and consequently behavior and neurodevelopmental disor- ders such as ADHD.

There- fore further studies would be desired to explore whether gut microbiota could be manipulated to favorably modulate BDNF levels in the context of ADHD.Environmental factors influencing gut microbiome composition and risk of developing ADHDThe etiology and reasons for the increasing ADHD preva- lence are not fully understood although recent evidence suggests that environmental factors might be playing a key role .

In addition significant divergences in gut microbial composition of the neonate have been found depending on the duration of pregnancy being gestational age at birth a major driver of gut microbiota assembly in preterm neonates.

The development of the HPA stress axis overlaps with the early postnatal microbial colonization of the neonatal gut and the establishment of the microbiota and has been demonstrated to be sensitive to gut microbial disruption in animal models.

In particular Sudo and colleagues pub- lished that gut microbes were able to affect the postnatal development of the HPA stress response in mice being the gut commensal microbiota required at a specific developmental stage for the HPA system to become com- pletely susceptible to inhibitory neural regulation .

A preclinical study assessing the effect of maternal infec- tion on mental health in the offspring determined that maternal immune activation could lead to a disrupted gut microbiota as well as to gut barrier dysfunction and behav- ioral alterations in the offspring .

Remarkably the signifi- cant impact of the prenatal immune activation on the gut- brain axis has been shown to be reversible by the adminis- tration of Bacteroides fragilis a common inhabitant of gut microbiota to the offspring .It has been demonstrated that maternal obesity and met-abolic disease including diabetes and hypertension and unhealthy maternal diets have a long-term impact on off- spring behavior and physiology  which may also be related to changes in gut microbiota composition induced by these conditions and the diet reported elsewhere.

Overall data from GF mice studies antibiotic treatment studies and probiotic interventions suggest that alterations in gut microbiota that reduce the inflammatory state also reduce stress-related behaviors supporting the role of the gut microbiota as a mediator between inflammation and behavioral alterations.
