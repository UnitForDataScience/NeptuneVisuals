while the definition and other considerations discussed in this commentary do not lead to a bright line rule cutting across the spectrum of stool-based products delineated in  they do highlight potential dividing lines where to the left are productsproce- dures that would be considered fmts and to the right are products that would be other types of live biother- apeutic products.

the consensus was that anything more than minimal manipulation of the human material that is transferred from one person to another would not constitute mt but would be considered a probiotic or other product that fda would likely regulate as a drug.

the working group included microbiome experts and microbiota transplantation researchers physicians performing fmt food and drug law attorneys patient advocates bioethicists industry representatives legal academics with expertise in health andor food and drug law and experts in the regulation of blood and human tissues and cells.at a meeting in december 2015 the co-investigators of the study asked working group members to con- sider the following definition of microbiota transplan- tation microorganisms transplanted from one human to another.

in addition because stool differs from person to per- son the chemical and biologic components of the stool product would vary from batch to batch and would violate the regulatory requirement for consistency in product composition.the use of stool from a single donor whose stool is given to a single or small number of recipients may also be an important characteristic to consider in the definition of fmt.

in the us the fda has modified its position on regulating fmt several times and has asked for comments on its most recent draft industry guidance.while fda has at least for now classified fmt as a drug a live biotherapeutic prod- uct it is currently exercising enforcement discretioni.e.

as a result it is not clear where one would draw the line on the spectrum of products currently in use or now in development as to which constitute an mt and which do not.one might also ask whether mt is distinguishable from probiotic products on the market or being devel- oped for the market.

for example petrof and khoruts argue that although the fda considers the fecal microbiota to be a drug like any agent used to treat mitigate or prevent dis- ease it is certainly not like any other drug.

while none have yet been approved several probiotics are going through the clinical trial phase for drug approval.mts as currently conceived would not be consid- ered foods.

some argued that implying a health ben- efit a claim that the transplanted material would treat mitigate cure or prevent disease thus rendering the material a drug having to go through the ind pro- cesswould require clinical studies to demonstrate the health benefit thus limiting the use of the defini- tion to mts with established clinical effectiveness.

the approach enables greater specificity and quality control.for example massachusetts-based seres therapeutics has several products in various stages of development and clinical testing including a drug product to treat recurrent cdi called ser-109.

draft guidance for industry and food and drug administra- tion staff minimal manipulation of human cells tissues and cellular and tissue-based products.

those characterization requirements would be extremely difficult to meet for fecal material used in fmt.

in fact in its most recent draft industry guidance document on regulating fmt fda seems to be making this distinc- tion stating that it will exercise enforcement discretion when the stool donor and stool are qualified by screening and testing performed under the direction of the licensed health care provider for the purpose of providing the fmt product for treatment of the patient.

not requiring an investigational new drug appli- cation ind for physicians performing the procedure and stool banks providing fecal matter for individuals with clostridium difficile infection cdi not respond- ing to standard therapies.

moving closer to the typical biologic drug development process vedanta biosciences is identifying and cultur- ing bacterial strains that have been shown to suppress inflammation and are decreased or missing in patients with chronic gut inflammation.similarly researchers in canada have developed a microbial assemblage derived from stool and grown in culture called repoopulate to treat recurrent cdi made from puri- fied intestinal bacterial cultures derived from a single healthy donor and grown in a laboratory.the different formulations and processing levels of these materials arguably could have implications for their regulation.
