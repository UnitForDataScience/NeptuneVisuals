All p val-ues were between .18 and .69.Qualitative analysis of the slides coupled with cell content data suggested that each participant's milk samples could be collectively categorized into one of four classificationsM SEMAbsolutea MSE--cells predominantly and consistently identi- fied as macrophages or secretory epithelial cells MSEneutrophil--cells consistently constituted ofVariableRelative 103 cellsmlbmostly MSE and neutrophils in approximately equalSomatic cell count54.1 6.3amountsMacrophagesecretory47.1 2.422.3 2.9 neutrophil--cells predominantly and consistently neutrophils or unique--a unique distribution of cells that changed over time.Note.

Complex relationships between milk nutrients and bacterial community profile maternal cells and milk oligosaccharides were also apparent.Conclusion These data support the possibility that profiles of maternally derived cells nutrient concentrations and the microbiome of human milk might be interrelated.Keywordsbreastfeeding human milk lactation microbiome human milk oligosaccharides immune cellsBackgroundResearchers have long known that human milk contains immune cells presumably involved in protecting the mam- mary gland and infant from infection.

Using light microscopy 200 cells were counted on each slide and classified as macrophageepithelial cells excluding squamous epithelial cells neutrophils lympho- cytes eosinophils basophils or other e.g.

333 540-551c The Authors 2017 Reprints and permissions DOI 10.11770890334417709433AbstractBackground Human milk provides all essential nutrients necessary for early life and is rich in nonnutrients maternally derived host cells and bacteria but almost nothing is known about the interplay among these components.Research aim The primary objective of this research was to characterize relationships among macronutrients maternal cells and bacteria in milk.Methods Milk samples were collected from 16 women and analyzed for protein lipid fatty acid lactose and human milk oligosaccharide concentrations.

First described in 1837 by Donne the majority of cells in milk have historically been identified as leukocytes Brooker 1980 Ho Wong  Lawton 1979 Smith  Goldman 1968 although recent reports suggest that they may be of mesenchymal origin pro- viding a rich source of multipotent stem cells Cregan et al.

However aside from maternal and infant infection very lit- tle is known about factors related to variation in cell count and distribution found in mature human milk.Moreover cells of human origin do not constitute the only cells in milk.

Some squamous epithelial cells were also observed as were several binucle- ated cells see 1.
