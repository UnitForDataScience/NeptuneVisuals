for instance relative abundance of serratia was negatively associated with somatic cell counts r  -.47 p  .0001 and neutrophil concentration r  -.38 p  .0006. concentrations of several oligosaccharides were correlated with maternally derived cell types as well as somatic cell counts for example lacto-n-tetraose and lacto-n-neotetraose were inversely correlated with somatic cell counts r  -.64 p  .0082 r  -.52 p  .0387 respectively and relative abundance of staphylococcus was positively associated with total oligosaccharide concentration r  .69 p  .0034. complex relationships between milk nutrients and bacterial community profile maternal cells and milk oligosaccharides were also apparent.conclusion these data support the possibility that profiles of maternally derived cells nutrient concentrations and the microbiome of human milk might be interrelated.keywordsbreastfeeding human milk lactation microbiome human milk oligosaccharides immune cellsbackgroundresearchers have long known that human milk contains immune cells presumably involved in protecting the mam- mary gland and infant from infection.

first described in 1837 by donne the majority of cells in milk have historically been identified as leukocytes brooker 1980 ho wong  lawton 1979 smith  goldman 1968 although recent reports suggest that they may be of mesenchymal origin pro- viding a rich source of multipotent stem cells cregan et al.

some squamous epithelial cells were also observed as were several binucle- ated cells see 1. relative cellular composition data were also analyzed using hierarchical clus- ter analysis based on bray-curtis dissimilarities and the average linkage algorithm see 2. this analysis suggests quantitatively that complex cellular profiles are somewhat similar within a woman over time although the clustering was not entirely consistent in this regard.milk macronutrients and microbesmean milk protein lipid lactose and fatty acid concentra- tions are provided in table 3. values were well within what would be expected for milk produced by healthy women jensen hagerty  mcmahon 1978 mitoulas gurrin doherty sherriff  hartmann 2003 nommsen lovelady heinig lonnerdal  dewey 1991 and were stable over the study.

for example looking at maternally derived cells relative abundances of mse neutrophils lymphocytes and eosinophils and the six most abundant bacterial genera streptococcus staphylococcus corynebacterium serratia pseudomonas and propionibacterium one relationship with a canonical correlation of .63 p  .0002 was notable and accounted for 69 of the variability see supplementary figure 3. this complex relationship however involved mainly neutrophils from the maternal cells and staphylococcus and streptococcus from the bacterial genera as indicated by the greater canonical correlation coefficients in table6.

examining the relationships in the correlations and cross-correlations of the canonical axes host cell types and bacterial canonical axes identified four primary con- tributors mainly the mse and neutrophil cell types and staphylococcus and streptococcus bacterial genera.in looking at the relationship between bacteria classified by gram status and maternally derived cells one moderate canonical correlation was noted r  .45 p  .0166 and accounted for 91 of the variability see 3. gram-positive bacteria seemed to dominate thisrelationship along with mse and neutrophil cell types see table 7.discussionour findings provide supporting evidence that complex bac- terial communities in milk are associated with variation in maternally derived cells nutrients and hmo profiles.

further research is needed to investigate these potential actions of the immune cells on proliferating mammary cells.researchers have long posited that the mammary gland has several complex mechanisms that work in concert to pro- tect it from microbial infection rainard  riollet 2006 sordillo shafer-weaver  derosa 1997. presence of immune cells provides one such mechanism but perhaps commensal bacteria may also be involved.
