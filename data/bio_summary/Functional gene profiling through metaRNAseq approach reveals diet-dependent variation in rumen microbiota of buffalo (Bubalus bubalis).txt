Principle Component Analysis between three treatments among a. liquid fraction samples at phylum level b. liquid samples at genus level c. solid fraction samples at phylum level and d. solid fraction samples at genus level.

Families like GH13 GH43 GH133 GH77- CBM20 GH94 GH97 were observed to be greater in liquid frac- tion than solid fraction while families like GH3 GH57 GH94 GH19 were observed to be greater in solid fraction as compared to liquid fraction.
