women without bv at either visit served as the referent group and were com- pared with 3 groups of women 1 no bv at the prior visit but bv at the visit with m. genitalium testing 2 bv at the priorvisit but no bv at the visit with m. genitalium testing and3 bv at both the visit prior to and the visit with m. genitalium testing.

following adjustment for age human immunodeficiency virus status and time prior bv was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in odds of incident m. genitalium adjusted odds ratio  3.49 95 confidence interval 1.86 6.56. this strong association suggests that bv may enhance suscepti- bility to m. genitalium infection.bacterial vaginosis mycoplasma genitalium nugent score vaginal microbiotaabbreviations aor adjusted odds ratio bv bacterial vaginosis ci confidence interval fsw female sex worker hiv human immunodeficiency virus hsv-2 herpes simplex virus type 2 iqr interquartile range sti sexually transmitted infection.mycoplasma genitalium a sexually transmitted bacte- rium has been associated with increased risk of adverse female reproductive health outcomes including mucopuru- lent cervicitis pelvic inflammatory disease infertility and preterm birth  as well as increased risk of human immu- nodeficiency virus hiv infection -.

prior studies categorized vaginal microbiota disrup- tion in a binary manner bv vs. no bv whether diagnosing bv clinically    or by scoring gram stains of vaginal secretions    .

most studies have compared women with bv score7 to women without bv score 0-6 which combines the normal and intermediate categories.

therefore this categorization may miss the contribution of milder disruptions of the microbiota to adverse outcomes such as sti acquisition attenuating estimates of an underly- ing association.given the high prevalence of bv and adverse outcomes associated with m. genitalium it is critical to determine whether bv enhances a woman's susceptibility to m. genita- lium.

bv was considered persistent if it was de- tected at more than 1 sequential visit and recurrent if there196 lokken et al.was at least 1 visit with normal or intermediate microbiota between visits with bv.statistical methodsbaseline demographic clinical and sexual behavior char- acteristics of women with and without prevalent bv nugent scores of 7 and 7 respectively and prevalent m. genita- lium were compared using fisher's exact test for categorical variables and wilcoxon's rank-sum test for continuous vari- ables to assess statistical significance.

statistical signifi-cance was defined as p  0.05 2-sided for all analyses.to further investigate the timing of bv episodes we con- ducted a secondary analysis using the same discrete failure time analysis approach and categorized women on the basis of their bv status at both the visit with m. genitalium testing and the visit prior to m. genitalium testing.

women with bv nu- gent score 7 were more likely to be hiv-positive than women without bv nugent score 0-6 63.7 vs. 47.9 p  0.01. similarly women with m. genitalium were more likely to be hiv-positive 68.9 vs. 51.5 p  0.04 and younger median age 33.5 years vs. 35.5 years p  0.003 than those without m. genitalium.

only 8.4 79940 of visits with bv were accompanied by symp- toms vaginal discharge andor itching and metronidazole was prescribed at only 2.6 24940 of visits with bv.

among women with bv 55.1 114207 had at least 1 recurrence of bv with a maximum of 4 recurrences.during a median follow-up time of 318.5 days 50 women experienced an incident m. genitalium infection and 9 women experienced 2 episodes for a total of 59 incident infections and an incidence rate of 34.6 per 100 person-years 95 confidence interval ci 26.0 42.0. in sensitivity analy- ses excluding women with prevalent m. genitalium infections and censoring women after their first incident infection the incidence rate was 25.0 per 100 person-years 95 ci 18.2 34.4. of the 104 m. genitalium infections prevalent or inci- dent 45 43.3 were persistent and the maximum duration of infection was 332.5 days.

in contrast there was no significant increase in the odds of m. genitalium when bv was identified only at the visit with m. genitalium testing.discussionin this cohort of high-risk kenyan women the prevalences of m. genitalium 16.1 and bv 40.4 at baseline were high.

this may partially explain our higher observed incidence rate.the median time to clearance of m. genitalium infection in these women 85.5 days or 2.8 months was also higher thantalium that we observed when women with bv were com- pared with women with normal microbiota nugent score 7 vs. 0-3 as well as the modest association between interme- diate microbiota nugent score 4-6 and incident m. genita- lium suggests that some of the inconsistencies between prior studies may have been due to differences in bv measure- ment.

in addition studies in which bv was defined by clinical diagnosis    may have misclassified women with disrupted vaginal microbiota unaccompanied by clinical signs again obscuring a relation- ship with m. genitalium.two other prospective studies have assessed the relation-ship between bv and incident m. genitalium   and conflicting results were reported.

this finding paired with the results from our secondary analysis assessing bv status at the visit prior to and the visit with m. genitalium testing provide additional evidence that recent bv is a more significant driver of m. genitalium acquisition than concur- rent bv.the changes in the vaginal microbiota associated with bvoffer biological plausibility for an increased risk of acquiringam j epidemiol.
