Women without BV at either visit served as the referent group and were com- pared with 3 groups of women 1 no BV at the prior visit but BV at the visit with M. genitalium testing 2 BV at the priorvisit but no BV at the visit with M. genitalium testing and3 BV at both the visit prior to and the visit with M. genitalium testing.

This may partially explain our higher observed incidence rate.The median time to clearance of M. genitalium infection in these women 85.5 days or 2.8 months was also higher thantalium that we observed when women with BV were com- pared with women with normal microbiota Nugent score 7 vs. 0-3 as well as the modest association between interme- diate microbiota Nugent score 4-6 and incident M. genita- lium suggests that some of the inconsistencies between prior studies may have been due to differences in BV measure- ment.

Among women with BV 55.1 114207 had at least 1 recurrence of BV with a maximum of 4 recurrences.During a median follow-up time of 318.5 days 50 women experienced an incident M. genitalium infection and 9 women experienced 2 episodes for a total of 59 incident infections and an incidence rate of 34.6 per 100 person-years 95 confidence interval CI 26.0 42.0.

Most studies have compared women with BV score7 to women without BV score 0-6 which combines the normal and intermediate categories.

In sensitivity analyses we also calculated M. genitalium incidence after excluding women with prevalent infections and censoring women after their first incident infection.To evaluate the relationship between BV either new orrecurrent at the visit prior to M. genitalium testing and inci- dent M. genitalium we employed a discrete failure time anal- ysis for multiple events using logistic regression clustering by woman .

After excluding time in which women had M. genitalium infections there were 170.5 person-years at risk for acquiring M. genitalium.BV was detected at least once in 73.9 207280 of women at 38.4 9402448 of visits with BV data.

BV was considered persistent if it was de- tected at more than 1 sequential visit and recurrent if there196 Lokken et al.was at least 1 visit with normal or intermediate microbiota between visits with BV.Statistical methodsBaseline demographic clinical and sexual behavior char- acteristics of women with and without prevalent BV Nugent scores of 7 and 7 respectively and prevalent M. genita- lium were compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test for continuous vari- ables to assess statistical significance.

Statistical signifi-cance was defined as P  0.05 2-sided for all analyses.To further investigate the timing of BV episodes we con- ducted a secondary analysis using the same discrete failure time analysis approach and categorized women on the basis of their BV status at both the visit with M. genitalium testing and the visit prior to M. genitalium testing.

Women with BV Nu- gent score 7 were more likely to be HIV-positive than women without BV Nugent score 0-6 63.7 vs. 47.9 P  0.01.
