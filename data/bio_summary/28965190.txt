Altered GM-host interaction has been indicated as a possible cause of immune deregulation and increased inflammation associated with several NCDs .This review summarizes the evidences on the influence of GM on immune system and on bone turnover and density and how GM manipulation may influence bone health.GM Influences Immune SystemThe interaction between immune system and GM has a central role in the maturation of immune system during the early post-natal period  and a role in the modulation of immune system and response to self-antigens during the whole life   thus it has been suggested that dysbiosis may play a role in the development of diseases character- ized by immune deregulation such as allergies autoim- mune and inflammatory disorders.The role of GM in the development and maturation of host immune system in the early post-natal life has been demonstrated in germ-free GF mice i.e.

This review summarizes evidences on the influence of GM on immune system and on bone turnover and density and how GM manipulation may influence bone health.Keywords Osteoporosis  Gut microbiota  Bone  Immune system  Probiotics  InflammationIntroductionThe whole of the commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms living in our intestine has been defined as gut microbiota GM.

Recently Wang and colleagues  in a very limited cohort suggest that GM component structure and diversity are altered in osteoporosis and osteopenia patients as compared with normal controls however they do not correlate with different GM components with inflammation and immune system nor with bone turnover.Relationships between immune system estrogen defi- ciency bone loss and GM are summarized in Fig.

On the other hand the relation between GM and vitamin D may also be inverse as it has been proposed that decreased vitamin D intake is associated with different GM profiles  .Another possible mechanism through which GM bene- fits bone health is the increase in calcium absorption.

.A recent study by Kim and colleagues suggests that GM may also affect B cells antibody production through SCFAs inhibition of HDAC and modulation of gene expression  however further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.Taken together these evidences suggest that GM influ- ences T cells differentiation through the production of bacterial metabolites such as SCFAs and polysaccharide Aat least at the intestinal mucosa level and T cells differ- entiation through cognate bacterial antigens  Fig.

GM may be involved in the mechanism of PMO.Some papers suggest that the absence of GM influences bone mass.

The study demonstrated an acute effect of GF colonization with GM obtained from conventionally raised mice on reduction of bone mass due to increased bone resorption whereas the long-term colonization resulted in a net skeletal growth in young animals .Even the studies on mice treated with broad spectrum antibiotics to alter GM bring to different conclusions regarding the effect on bone density.

These features are normalized by colonization with GM from conventionally raised mice .Recently elegant studies demonstrated the role of innate immunity in mediating the effect of GM on inflammation and on bone metabolism.

To investigate the role of GM in bone loss induced by sex steroid deficiency this condition was induced phar- macologically in GF mice with the GnRH agonists leuprolide by Li and colleagues .These authors demonstrated that GM plays an important role in sex steroid deficiency-induced osteoporosis GF mice are pro- tected against osteoporosis and the increase in boneturnover induced by sex steroid deprivation thanks to the lack of increase in TNF RANKL and IL-17.

Manipulation of GM may become a future adjuvant treatment in preventing osteoporosis osteopenia and other diseases characterized by focal bone loss such as periodontitis.In the last years several data obtained in animal models strongly supported the role of GM in the control of bone turnover whereas less data have been published in humans field in which confirmatory studies are needed.
