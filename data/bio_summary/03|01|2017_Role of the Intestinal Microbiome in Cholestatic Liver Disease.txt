The data that we recently report- ed demonstrated the following major results 1 the GF MDR2-- mice demonstrated significantly more severe serum biochemical abnormalities than the CH mice 2 the GF MDR2-- mice exhibited significantly more he- patic fibrosis ductular reaction and ductopenia com- pared to the CH MDR2-- mice 3 the cholangiocyte mi- croenvironment in the GF MDR2-- mouse was charac- terized by increased numbers of neutrophils and macrophages compared to the CH MDR2-- mouse and4 cholangiocyte senescence was increased in the GF MDR2-- mice relative to the CH mice.

Our approach involved assessing the MDR2-- phenotype in two subgroups of mice that is conventionally housed CH MDR2-- mice and GF MDR2-- mice.

Indeed several lines of data suggesting the importance of the intestinal microbiota in PSC were already pub- lished and addressed as mentioned above.With this in mind we began a series of experiments to directly test the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiome could influence disease progression in an animal model of PSC the MDR2-- mouse 7.

However exciting insights are continually being made that support both a central role of the microbiome and a need for further interrogation of the microbes or microbe- associated molecules involved in the initiation and progres- sion of select liver diseases.c 2017 S. Karger AG BaselIntroductionHarboring roughly 2-5 x 1011 bacteria per gram of fe- ces in humans the intestinal tract embodies an incredibly complex biological ecosystem.

Receiving approximately 75 of its blood supply from the intestine via the portal circula- tion the liver is thus continuously exposed to a wide rep- ertoire of molecules be they beneficial or noxious fromthe intestinal microbiome.

In con- trast liver injury may be the result of in- creased production of cytodestructive molecules or loss of cytoprotective mole- cules.All of these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the intestinal microbiome and cholangiocyte senescence are both likely important in the pathogenesis of PSC.

An increasing body of litera- ture has begun to shed light on this 'gut liver axis' in the maintenance of health as well as in the pathogenesis of liver disease 1.

Fifth recent studies in germ-free GF MDR2 defi- cient mice an animal model of PSC have suggested a pro- tective influence of the microbiome on disease development 7.

What does seem in- creasingly clear is that the intestinal microbiome and the 'gut liver axis' are important in the maintenance of hepa- tobiliary health and in the pathogenesis of hepatobiliary diseases fig.

More specifically perturbations in the intestinal microbiome may lead to the initiation of se- lected liver diseases andor impact the features and pro- gression of existing hepatic disease.PSC is characterized by a cholestatic biochemical profile and multiple alternating strictures and dilata- tions classically involving the entire biliary tree.
