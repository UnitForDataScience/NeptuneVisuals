Thus the PA image effectively identified and distinguished a live gut microbe labeled with near-infrared dyes ex vivo.In this Letter we applied PAI to identify and quantify the different species of gut microbiota.

To the best of our knowledge PA was applied for the first time for gut bacteria imaging in vitro and ex vivo.The bacterial detection scheme by PAI was illustrated in Fig.

c PA image of mixed bacteria with dyes.d Corresponding PA intensity of mixed bacteria with dyes.where E1 and E2 are the absorption coefficients of 150 mlE.

PA concentration versus UV-vis concentration P  0.05 and the percentage of E. coli-PB was 37.5 versus 35.8 PA concentration versus UV-vis concentration P  0.05.

In this Letter we explored a novel imaging technique to detect the intestinal microbe.Photoacoustic PA imaging PAI has rapidly expanded for extensive biomedical applications 13-17.

The rotating hemisphere can achieve denser PA data at multiple stops in less than 2 min.

The relative ratio of E. coli-PB and Lactobacillus-ICG CColiCLAC was calculated based on the normalized PA spectra.

Figure 4 showed that the PA method was effective to image and identify the gut microbe.

In this Letter we explored the photoacoustic imaging PAI technique to characterize the composition and quantify the propor- tions of the gut microbes after optical probe labeling.
