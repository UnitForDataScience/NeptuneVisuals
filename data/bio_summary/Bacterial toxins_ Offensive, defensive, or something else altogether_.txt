thus ac could have an important role in regulating the mode of growth of b. pertussis during infection in addition to its multiple roles in modify- ing host responses summarised in.therefore it appears that the contribution of ac-affecting toxins to the life cycle of patho- genic bacteria may be considerably more complex and involve behaviours far and beyond the offensive playing defensive immune modulation functions altering the mode of growth and aiding in niche establishment and bacterial dispersal to new sites of colonisation or infection.host cell membrane destruction asymptomatic carriage and niche establishmentthe haemolytic capability of bacteria was one of the first true virulence factors identified for bacteria and the major mechanism through which this occurs is the formation of pores in the host cell membranes causing them to lyse.

however from an evolution- ary perspective as the bacteria rarely transmit from an invasive infection to another person these infections represent a dead end for the bacteria and so the selective advantage the toxins confer to the bacteria during invasive disease is if anything negative .consideration of sstis does provide some explanation for the long-term benefit of produc- ing toxins however it requires us to merge our appreciation of offensive and defensive activi- ties if the cell types killed by the toxins are the cellular components of host immunity then they can be simultaneously offensive and defensive.

the antibacterial functions of resident airway macrophages are also inhibited by pt although the specific signalling mechanisms behind these are unclear .these defensive effects suppress the host's control of b. pertussis growth early in infection aid- ing the establishment and development of the infection .

the inhibition of these activities suppresses innate immunity control of b. pertussis during early infection .

while primarily studied in vitro it is hypothe- sised that b. pertussis biofilms are important for growth and persistence in the nasopharynxduring infection.

in reality the human immune system is about 1000-fold more likely to encounter s. aureus in the context of colonisation than it is to encounter it during a pathogenic infection .
