Stress-induced impairment of placental catecholamine metabolismCompared to postnatal life fetal plasma catecholamine con- centration is low despite a high endogenous fetal catecholamine production  The reason for this is a high placental catecholamine clearance that is largely responsible for maintaining the fetal catecholamine homeostasis  It is conceivable that a stress-induced disturbance in pla- cental catecholamine clearance would increase fetal catecholamine concentrations that in turn affect fetal growth and development as discussed above.

We propose that the effects of psychosocial maternal stress on fetal development and health and disease in later life are not a conse- quence of a single pathway but are mediated by multiple stress-transfer mechanisms acting together in a synergistic manner.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

placentalIn the fetal circulation and in particular the fetal brain maternal cortisol can perturb the development of the fetal HPAA during vul- nerable periods by resetting the set point of the HPAA's negative feedback mechanism resulting in a long-lasting or even permanent change in HPAA activity in postnatal life  This intrauterine determination of the fetal HPAA activity in later life is thought to be one of the essential mechanisms of 'fetal programming'.

It is associated with decreased fetal growth preterm delivery activation of the fetal HPAA and impairment of brain maturation such as development of the fetal hippocampus and other parts of the fetal limbic system  Catecholamines and reduction of utero-placental perfusionThe SAMS and its effector hormones norepinephrine NE and epinephrine EPI comprise fast-responding components of the physiological stress system.

For example in sheep direct fetal infusion of NE and EPI during the third trimester led to asymmetrical fetal growth retardation in the absence of hypoxaemia  whereas in a recent study bilateral adrenal demedulla- tion in growth restricted fetuses delayed fetal growth retardation  In rhesus monkeys if infused directly into the mother excess catecholamines induce fetal hypoxia  However not all studiesreport an unfavourable consequence of elevated catecholamine concentration.

Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews xxx 2017 xxx-xxxSerotonin and fetal development5-HT detectable at as early as seven weeks of human fetal development is crucial for placentation and embryonic fetal and postnatal brain and cardiovascular develop- ment in humans and animals Thus it is plausible that prenatal disturbances in the fetal serotonergic homeostasis may have long-lasting psychologi- cal and physical consequences for later life.

Excessive maternal cortisol or corticosterone in rodents can cross the placenta into the fetal compartment and induce long- lasting if not permanent changes in the postnatal activity of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis HPAA which is associ- ated with behavioural and cognitive alterations in later life  However cortisol alone cannot fully explain all the programming effects of psychosocial stress especially during early gestation as amongst other reasons the mat- uration and vulnerable period of the fetal HPAA do not begin earlier than late pregnancy  and glucocorticoid receptor GR expression is limited dur- ing early gestation  In this review in addition to cortisol we discuss five otherpotential mediators of maternal-fetal stress catecholamines reac- tive oxygen species ROS cytokines serotonintryptophan and maternal microbiota.

In rats chronic maternal infusion of EPI during dif- ferent timeframes of pregnancy did not affect fetal and placental weight or length of pregnancy Other ani- mal studies even demonstrate that catecholamines are necessary for an intact endometrium and fetal survival Catecholamine-mediated reduction of the utero-placental perfusionAlthough there is some uncertainty regarding whether maternal catecholamines can affect the fetus directly NE in particu- lar can influence fetal metabolism indirectly by reducing the utero-placental perfusion UPP.

In sheep short-term physical stress induced by electric shocks or psychological stress induced by isolation immediately reduced the uterine blood flow via ex1- adrenergic receptors in the uterine vasculature  While short-term decreases of uterine blood flow of less than three minutes were not associated with changes in fetal blood gases  isolation stress for two hours and a consecutive uterine blood flow decrease of approximately 20 shifted fetal metabolism towards an anaerobic metabolic condition and increased fetal cat-F.

The NE-induced vasoconstriction of the uter- ine arteries is followed by hypoxia and an anaerobic metabolic condition of the placenta Throughout preg- nancy the ex-adrenergic responsiveness of the uterine arteries is attenuated possibly protecting the near-term fetus from a stress- induced catecholamine-mediated decrease in the UPP  Reduction of UPP and the fetusThe fetus is able to sense even small changes in the reduction of uterine blood flow and reacts to this reduction with an increase in plasma catecholamines In sheep a reduction of uterine blood flow to 70-90 induced by a uterine artery occluder did not change fetal oxygenation heart rate or blood pressure but led to a sustained increase in fetal catecholamines  A possible explanation for the unchanged fetal oxygenation is that a uterine blood flow decrease of one-third - as induced by maternal infusion of EPI - does not change umbilical blood flow  To date it is unclear how the fetus senses small reductions in uterine blood flow in the absence of an altered umbilical blood flow.
