Compared to conventionally raised mice on a chow diet germ-free mice had comparable plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-C and lower serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C concentrations  while germ-free mice on ahigh-fat diet had lower serum HDL-C and total cholesterol TC concentrations .

Vancomycin and amoxicillin treatment did not affect markers for cholesterol metabolismplasma TAG total cholesterol LDL-C or HDL-C concentrations as compared to placebo.

Therefore the present study investigated whether modulating gut microbiota by two different types of antibiotics affects cholesterol metabolism absorption and synthesis bile acid metabolism and circulating cholesterol and oxyphytosterol concentrations in obese men with impaired glucose metabolism.Materials and methodsSubjects and designDetails of this parallel randomized double blind placebo- controlled trial have been described previously  .

Concentrations of these non-cholesterol sterols are considered as markers for intestinal cholesterol absorption cholestanol sitos- terol and campesterol and cholesterol synthesis lathosterol and are expressed as mmolmmolcholesterol.

Finally as compared to placebo treatment plasma FGF19 concen- trations were not changed after amoxicillin or vancomycin treatmentDespite correlations between markers reflecting cholesterol metabolism cholestanol sitosterol and campesterol reflecting intestinal absorption and lathosterol reflecting endogenous synthesis at baseline and bile acids and the change in bile acid concentrations during antibiotic treatment there was no change in cholesterol absorption and synthesis .Serum lipid lipoprotein and oxyphytosterol concentrationsPlasma lipid lipoprotein and oxyphytosterol concentrations before and after vancomycin amoxicillin and placebo treatment are shown in .

Incontrast all oxidized cholesterol concentrations correlated signifi- cantly with plasma non-oxidized cholesterol concentrations 7a- OH-cholesterol r  0.534 P  0.001 7b-OH-cholesterol r  0.324 P  0.05 7keto-cholesterol r  0.560 P  0.001.

Oxycholesterol concentrations correlated strongly with total cholesterol concentrations and there were weak correlations with TAG and LDL-C concentrations but they did not correlate with HDL-C and glucose concentrations or with BMI.DiscussionThe gut microbiota play an important role in human health by maintaining gut physiology and metabolic homeostasis andTable 1Subject characteristics.Placebo n  18Amoxicillin n  18Vancomycin n  19Age years60.9 - 7.455.9 - 6.560.7 - 6.5BMI kgm231.0 - 2.331.1 - 3.231.4 - 2.5Fasting glucose mmolL6.0 - 0.56.1 - 0.66.1 - 0.6OGTT 2-hour glucose mmolL7.7 - 1.77.0 - 1.97.2 - 1.8HOMA-Index4.6 - 1.84.2 - 1.75.0 - 1.8Total cholesterol mmolL5.1 - 0.74.8 - 1.04.5 - 0.9HDL-C mmolL1.1 - 0.21.1 - 0.21.1 - 0.2LDL-C mmolL3.3 - 0.63.4 - 0.92.7 - 0.8TAG mmolL1.6 - 0.81.1 - 0.51.2 - 0.4Data are mean - SD.

At baseline plasma secondary bile acid concentrations correlated negatively with cholesterol absorption cholestanol and positively with cholesterol synthesis lathos- terol.

Based on these significant correlations a reduction in secondary bile acids may result in decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased cholesterol absorption rates.
