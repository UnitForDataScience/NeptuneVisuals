plasma lipid and lipoprotein non-cholesterol sterol bile acid and oxyphytosterol concentrations were determined at baseline and after 1-week intervention.results plasma secondary bile acids correlated negatively with cholestanol marker for cholesterol absorption r  -0.367 p  0.05 and positively with lathosterol concentrations marker for cholesterolsynthesis r  0.430 p  0.05. fasting plasma secondary bile acid concentrations were reduced after vancomycin treatment as compared to placebo treatment -0.24 - 0.22 mmoll vs. -0.08 - 0.29 mmoll p  0.01. vancomycin and amoxicillin treatment did not affect markers for cholesterol metabolismplasma tag total cholesterol ldl-c or hdl-c concentrations as compared to placebo.

compared to conventionally raised mice on a chow diet germ-free mice had comparable plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c and lower serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl-c concentrations  while germ-free mice on ahigh-fat diet had lower serum hdl-c and total cholesterol tc concentrations .

therefore the present study investigated whether modulating gut microbiota by two different types of antibiotics affects cholesterol metabolism absorption and synthesis bile acid metabolism and circulating cholesterol and oxyphytosterol concentrations in obese men with impaired glucose metabolism.materials and methodssubjects and designdetails of this parallel randomized double blind placebo- controlled trial have been described previously  .

concentrations of these non-cholesterol sterols are considered as markers for intestinal cholesterol absorption cholestanol sitos- terol and campesterol and cholesterol synthesis lathosterol and are expressed as mmolmmolcholesterol.

finally as compared to placebo treatment plasma fgf19 concen- trations were not changed after amoxicillin or vancomycin treatmentdespite correlations between markers reflecting cholesterol metabolism cholestanol sitosterol and campesterol reflecting intestinal absorption and lathosterol reflecting endogenous synthesis at baseline and bile acids and the change in bile acid concentrations during antibiotic treatment there was no change in cholesterol absorption and synthesis .serum lipid lipoprotein and oxyphytosterol concentrationsplasma lipid lipoprotein and oxyphytosterol concentrations before and after vancomycin amoxicillin and placebo treatment are shown in .

oxycholesterol concentrations correlated strongly with total cholesterol concentrations and there were weak correlations with tag and ldl-c concentrations but they did not correlate with hdl-c and glucose concentrations or with bmi.discussionthe gut microbiota play an important role in human health by maintaining gut physiology and metabolic homeostasis andtable 1subject characteristics.placebo n  18amoxicillin n  18vancomycin n  19age years60.9 - 7.455.9 - 6.560.7 - 6.5bmi kgm231.0 - 2.331.1 - 3.231.4 - 2.5fasting glucose mmoll6.0 - 0.56.1 - 0.66.1 - 0.6ogtt 2-hour glucose mmoll7.7 - 1.77.0 - 1.97.2 - 1.8homa-index4.6 - 1.84.2 - 1.75.0 - 1.8total cholesterol mmoll5.1 - 0.74.8 - 1.04.5 - 0.9hdl-c mmoll1.1 - 0.21.1 - 0.21.1 - 0.2ldl-c mmoll3.3 - 0.63.4 - 0.92.7 - 0.8tag mmoll1.6 - 0.81.1 - 0.51.2 - 0.4data are mean - sd.

at baseline plasma secondary bile acid concentrations correlated negatively with cholesterol absorption cholestanol and positively with cholesterol synthesis lathos- terol.

cholesterol absorption markers cholestanol campesterol and sitosterol correlated strongly but only a correlation with cholestanol was evident while none of the other cholesterol metabolism markers correlated with primary secondary or total bile acid concentrations.

based on these significant correlations a reduction in secondary bile acids may result in decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased cholesterol absorption rates.

however vancomycin treatment decreased plasma concentrations of secondary bile acids but did not affect campesterol sitosterol and cholestanol cholesterol absorption or lathosterol concentrations cholesterol synthesis.

so despite significant correlations at baseline between bile acids and cholesterol metabolism the antibiotic-induced decrease in secondary bile acid concentrations did not change markers for cholesterol metabolism.

in case of bile acid sequestrants active removal of bile acids from the intestinal lumen the liver increasesits synthesis of bile acids from intracellular cholesterol resulting in an upregulation of cholesterol synthesis rates  .

there are some indications that scfas can reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations by decreasing cholesterol synthesis rates .
