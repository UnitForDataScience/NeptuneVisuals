Female cKO mice n 9 had no sig- nificant difference in weight loss compared with WT n 10 mice C. Daily food intake did not vary significantly between the cKO and WT mice except at day 5 P 14 .033 andday 17 for the males P.009  D and E.A restricted feeding diet results in specific changes to the gut microbiotaTo determine the concomitant changes in the gut microbiota as a result of restricted feeding RF on a normal chow diet fecal samples were collected immediately before the period of restricted feeding and again at the end of the 2 week dietary challenge.

Before the restricted feeding no signifi- cant difference in the gut microbiome betweenmalesandfemaleswas observed but a nonsignificant trend is notable at the end of the restricted feeding with female samples clustering together and distinctly from the majority ofmalesamples B.As shown in A the greatest difference in the gut microbiome appeared to be driven by the restricted feeding diet best seen along the principal coordinate PC-1 axis.

Body weight was significantly reduced from baseline in both the cKO and WT groups regardless of sex and no group recovered their body weight to baseline levels during the restricted feeding study  B and C. The 16 week old cKO males recov- ered significantly more body weight by day 5 through day 9 P .05 cKO n6 compared with WT n 10 B.At the end of the 17 day restricted feeding study cKO male mice lost a significantly lower percentage of their weight compared with the WT mice.

Previous reports have indi- cated that the microbial influence on the circadian rhythms differs between sexes which may potentially explain the sex- specific phenotype seen in our model.Impact of restricted feeding on the gut microbiome and speculations as to why this matters to obstetricians and neonatologists As a result of a restricted feeding diet and irrespective of Npas2 cKO genotype Bacteroides appeared to be the taxa in the gut microbiome that had the most dra- matic impact on it.

Differences in weight loss in the Npas2 cKO mice could be attributed to a change in metabolic homeostasis because the forebrain circadian clock should be intact and able to adapt to a restricted feeding diet.Importance of neonatal hepatic Npas2 expression on the gut microbiome independent of restricted feedingThe interconnectedness of the importanceof circadian rhythms diet and the gut microbiome early in life is becoming increasingly evident.

To determine whether neonatal Npas2 peripheral expression in the liver is necessary for adaptive feeding we exposed Npas2 cKO mice to a restricted feeding regimen which is the only previously published condition toelucidate a unique role for Npas2 in regulating metabolic homeostasis.How circadian interactions and the gut microbiomeWe and others have recently shown that the neonate is not born sterile and that the primate and human gut microbiome is persistently altered with maternal HFD exposure.Emerging evidence has indicated that the host circadian clock is closely intertwined with the gut microbiome.Work in the germ-free mouse has demonstrated that the peripheral circa- dian clock particularly in the liver is potentially regulated by the gut micro- biome because mice devoid of any mi- crobes demonstrate altered patterns of hepatic circadian gene expression.

However mice exposed to the restricted feeding diet had a significant accompa- nying shift to the gut microbiome with a significant difference in the relative abundance of several bacteria taxa when comparing male cKO with WT mice.We have shown that our findings in a novel cKO mouse model differed from the Npas2 whole-body KO restricted feeding study.

However the use of an innovative murine cKO genetic model enabled us to specifically delete Npas2 in the liver from neonatal life onward.Taken together our collective work suggests that disruption of the Npas2 circadian rhythm transcriptional ma- chinery early in fetal or neonatal life whether by a maternal high-fat diet or via liver-specific gene mutations or epigenetic remodeling is associated with risk for metabolic syndrome later in life.In the current study we show a parallel effect on the gut microbiome when challenged by restricted feeding and can specifically ascribe different taxa based on host genotype or alternately dietary restriction.These findings suggest the potential for complex interplay between the circadian clock metabolism and the gut microbiome.

Microbial taxa that significantly differ between groups of interest was determined using Linear Discriminate Analysis Effect Size and randomForrest.ResultsMale Npas2 cKO recover more weight on restricted feeding challengeTo determine whether neonatal Npas2 peripheral expression in the liver is necessary for adaptive feeding Npas2 cKO mice were restricted food access to 4 hours a day 900 AM to 100 PM for 17 days A.

With respect to changes in bac- teria because of restricted feeding per se we found that in all Npas2 cKO mice Bacteroides was consistently elevated in response to an RF challenge .Taken together these novel findings suggest that changes in the expression of a host hepatic circadian gene Npas2 specifically during neonatal life can have a lasting impact on the rate of weight change during restricted feeding in a male sex-specific manner.
