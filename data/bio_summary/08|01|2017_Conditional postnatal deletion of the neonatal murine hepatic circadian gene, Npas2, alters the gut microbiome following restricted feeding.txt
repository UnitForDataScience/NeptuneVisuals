microbial taxa that significantly differ between groups of interest was determined using linear discriminate analysis effect size and randomforrest.resultsmale npas2 cko recover more weight on restricted feeding challengeto determine whether neonatal npas2 peripheral expression in the liver is necessary for adaptive feeding npas2 cko mice were restricted food access to 4 hours a day 900 am to 100 pm for 17 days a. body weight was significantly reduced from baseline in both the cko and wt groups regardless of sex and no group recovered their body weight to baseline levels during the restricted feeding study  b and c. the 16 week old cko males recov- ered significantly more body weight by day 5 through day 9 p .05 cko n6 compared with wt n 10 b.at the end of the 17 day restricted feeding study cko male mice lost a significantly lower percentage of their weight compared with the wt mice.

because the male npas2 cko mice and not the females were protected from rf diete induced weight loss we focused our analysis to only the male mice.first however we compared the composition of the gut microbiome be- tween males n16 and females n 8. the alpha diversity fell during the restricted feeding for both males and females and there was no significant differences between gender or genotype in this regard a. before the restricted feeding no signifi- cant difference in the gut microbiome betweenmalesandfemaleswas observed but a nonsignificant trend is notable at the end of the restricted feeding with female samples clustering together and distinctly from the majority ofmalesamples b.as shown in a the greatest difference in the gut microbiome appeared to be driven by the restricted feeding diet best seen along the principal coordinate pc-1 axis.

female cko mice n 9 had no sig- nificant difference in weight loss compared with wt n 10 mice c. daily food intake did not vary significantly between the cko and wt mice except at day 5 p 14 .033 andday 17 for the males p.009  d and e.a restricted feeding diet results in specific changes to the gut microbiotato determine the concomitant changes in the gut microbiota as a result of restricted feeding rf on a normal chow diet fecal samples were collected immediately before the period of restricted feeding and again at the end of the 2 week dietary challenge.

these differences were apparent by both unweighted p .001 and weighted p .001 unifrac mea- sures  a and b indicating a robust difference in the gut microbial communities related to the presence and relative abundance of the gut microbiota and its proportional relative abundance respectively.at the end of the restricted feeding period mice harbored a significantly increased relative abundance of bacter- oides and other related members of the order bacteroidales p .05. conversely the relative abundances of several un- classified taxa within the lachnospiraceae family were significantly decreased following restricted feeding all p  .05 c. this trend was significant regardless of sex or genotype.male npas2 cko mice have an altered gut microbiome after restricted feedingwe next sought to determine whether there were specific changes to the gut microbiota that were associated with reduced weight loss in the male npas2 cko mice compared with wt.

specifically at the end of the restricted feeding period mice harbored a significantly increased rela- tive abundance of bacteroides and other related members of the order bacter- oidales p .05. conversely the relative abundances of several unclassified taxa within the lachnospiraceae family were significantly decreased following restricted feeding all p  .05 c.given our findings of reduced weight loss during restricted feeding specifically to our male npas2 cko mice we next determined whether there were specific changes to the gut microbiota that were associated with this significantly reduced weight loss.

however mice exposed to the restricted feeding diet had a significant accompa- nying shift to the gut microbiome with a significant difference in the relative abundance of several bacteria taxa when comparing male cko with wt mice.we have shown that our findings in a novel cko mouse model differed from the npas2 whole-body ko restricted feeding study.

previous reports have indi- cated that the microbial influence on the circadian rhythms differs between sexes which may potentially explain the sex- specific phenotype seen in our model.impact of restricted feeding on the gut microbiome and speculations as to why this matters to obstetricians and neonatologists as a result of a restricted feeding diet and irrespective of npas2 cko genotype bacteroides appeared to be the taxa in the gut microbiome that had the most dra- matic impact on it.

the gut microbiome of the mice at the start of the restricted feeding study was significantly different from the gut microbiome at the end of the study weighted p .001 unweighted p .001. c significantly different relative abundance of various taxa between the start and end of the restricted feeding study.

differences in weight loss in the npas2 cko mice could be attributed to a change in metabolic homeostasis because the forebrain circadian clock should be intact and able to adapt to a restricted feeding diet.importance of neonatal hepatic npas2 expression on the gut microbiome independent of restricted feedingthe interconnectedness of the importanceof circadian rhythms diet and the gut microbiome early in life is becoming increasingly evident.

however along the pc2 axis while the wt and npas2 cko mice clustered similarly at the onset of the rf diet they separated signifi- cantly along the pc2 axis at the conclu- sion of the rf challenge a light blue circles vs light red triangles.this difference in the gut microbiome between the wt and npas2 cko mice as a result of the diet can be best appreci- ated when samples from the same mouse were analyzed in a pair-wise regression indicating a difference in the overall rate of change or trajectory of the gut microbiome over time  b and c.specific changes to the gut microbiome of male npas2 cko micecomparing the weight loss percentage from day 0 to day 17 in male mice showed distinct correlations only with the gut microbiota based on genotype .

with respect to changes in bac- teria because of restricted feeding per se we found that in all npas2 cko mice bacteroides was consistently elevated in response to an rf challenge .taken together these novel findings suggest that changes in the expression of a host hepatic circadian gene npas2 specifically during neonatal life can have a lasting impact on the rate of weight change during restricted feeding in a male sex-specific manner.

the difference in the gut microbiome before and after the restricted feeding diet shown along the pc1 axis gray start black end while the difference between the genotypes after a restricted feeding diet is best seen along the pc2 axis.

these alter- ations are accompanied by an overall genotype-associated change in the gut microbiome as well as dietary-specific changes in the bacteroides species.comparison with existing literature and prior studiesimportance of the neonatal hepatic circadian machinery to metabolic function and weight loss with restricted feeding later in lifewe did not anticipate that npas2 ckomice would plateau sooner and recover more percentage body weight during the restricted feeding diet.

however precisely when where and how epi- genomic reprogramming of the offspring liver exerts such broad meta- bolic disarray is poorly understood.when and where generation of neonatal liver-specific npas2 conditional knockout cko mice and overall study designto first separate the impact of the role of immediate neonatal vs circadian gene expression in the liver on the lifelong regulation of metabolic homeostasis we generated a novel cko mouse model in which npas2 is specifically deleted in the neonatal but not the fetal liver.previous studies have characterized the metabolic phenotype of an npas2 knockout ko whole-body knockout mouse model and under normal meta- bolic conditions no phenotype was re- ported.however under a restricted feeding regimen npas2 ko mice lose a greater body weight percentage when food is restricted over a 2 week period suggesting a morbid maladaptation and abnormal satiety signals.in one study the weight loss was so severe that the ko mice wasted resulting in the death of 20 of the mice.

to determine whether neonatal npas2 peripheral expression in the liver is necessary for adaptive feeding we exposed npas2 cko mice to a restricted feeding regimen which is the only previously published condition toelucidate a unique role for npas2 in regulating metabolic homeostasis.how circadian interactions and the gut microbiomewe and others have recently shown that the neonate is not born sterile and that the primate and human gut microbiome is persistently altered with maternal hfd exposure.emerging evidence has indicated that the host circadian clock is closely intertwined with the gut microbiome.work in the germ-free mouse has demonstrated that the peripheral circa- dian clock particularly in the liver is potentially regulated by the gut micro- biome because mice devoid of any mi- crobes demonstrate altered patterns of hepatic circadian gene expression.
