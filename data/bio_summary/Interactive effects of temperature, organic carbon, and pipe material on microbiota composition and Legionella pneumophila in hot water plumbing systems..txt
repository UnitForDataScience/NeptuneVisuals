and Nae- gleria fowleri are also OPs -In considering options for intentionally shaping the microbiota in building plumbing systems temperature and pipe material are practical factors that can be directly controlled at the building level while assimilable organic carbon AOC is influenced by both municipal water treatment and con- ditions in the building plumbing.Elevating the water temperature  60 degC can be highly ef- fective for killing and inhibiting L. pneumophila and other OPs  However the reality is that such hot tempera- tures are difficult to maintain throughout the system result- ing in warm water conditions that are highly conducive to pathogen growth in much of the building plumbing envir- onment Water heaters pose a risk for promoting microbial illness when operated between 30 and 54 degC  or whenever the water coming out of the heaters is below 60 degC or fails to remain consistently above 55 degC throughout the premise plumbing Despite the well-established benefits of elevated temperatures for OP control some guidelines for water heater operation recommend tempera- tures as low as 48 degC 11  because of concerns about scalding scaling and energy conservation with only some recommending higher temperatures -Besides direct effects on pathogens temperature is a fundamental selective force in shaping the broader microbiota of tap water Within a building pipes and plumbing components are made from a vast array of materials all with the potential to influence microbial regrowth .

where numbers significantly increased and peaked at 41 degC followed by a drop at 45 and 49 degC and a further drop to below-detection at 53 degC p  0.05 in all cases relative to the 32 degC control.

Dosing of 700 mgL AOC resulted in a significant effect with a distinct microbiota composition from that of lower AOC levels at each temperature 32-53 degC p  0.05 with the same pipe material Additional file Table S1.The two most dominant phyla switched from Proteo- bacteria 57 and Bacteroidetes 37 at 32 degC to Fir- micutes 54 and Proteobacteria 25 at 53 degC Fig.

However water temperature in realistic water heaters and hot water distribution pipes is typically lower than the set point due to cooling in distal pipes or mixing with cold water In a recent pilot-scale simulation L. pneumophila remained detectable at the tap and in the recirculating line even when the water heater was set at 58 degC Based on OP-containing genera identified by amplicon se- quencing mid-range temperatures 41-49 degC could be more problematic than the assumed worst-case scenario of 32 degC.

Several operational taxonomic units OTUs persisted across all conditions accounting for 50 of the microbiota composition from 32 to 49 degC and 20 at 53 degC.

DNA was extracted using the FastDNAr SPIN Kit MP Biomedicals Solon OH USA according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantitative polymerase chain reactionThe quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR method was applied to quantify the macrophage infectiv- ity potentiator mip gene specific to L. pneumophila the 18S rRNA gene of V. vermiformis the 18S rRNA gene of Acanthamoeba and bacterial 16S rRNA genes using protocols previously optimized for drinking water samples Q-PCR was carried out using a CFX96tm Real Time system Bio-Rad Hercules CA USA including a calibration curve of seven to eight points and negative controls in each run.CulturingCulturing for detection of L. pneumophila was con- ducted by heating 100 mL water samples to 50 degC for 30 min and directly plating onto buffered charcoal yeast extract BCYE agar according to published methods Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencingIllumina amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes was applied to triplicate SWHs corresponding to both pipe materials three levels of dosed AOC 0 30 and 700 mgL and six temperature levels 32 37 41 45 49 and 53 degC along with corresponding constant temperature controls sampled on the same days days 58 141 183 224 267 and 316.
