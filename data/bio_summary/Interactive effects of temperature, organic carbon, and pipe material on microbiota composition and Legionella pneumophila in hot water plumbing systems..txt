and nae- gleria fowleri are also ops -in considering options for intentionally shaping the microbiota in building plumbing systems temperature and pipe material are practical factors that can be directly controlled at the building level while assimilable organic carbon aoc is influenced by both municipal water treatment and con- ditions in the building plumbing.elevating the water temperature  60 degc can be highly ef- fective for killing and inhibiting l. pneumophila and other ops  however the reality is that such hot tempera- tures are difficult to maintain throughout the system result- ing in warm water conditions that are highly conducive to pathogen growth in much of the building plumbing envir- onment water heaters pose a risk for promoting microbial illness when operated between 30 and 54 degc  or whenever the water coming out of the heaters is below 60 degc or fails to remain consistently above 55 degc throughout the premise plumbing despite the well-established benefits of elevated temperatures for op control some guidelines for water heater operation recommend tempera- tures as low as 48 degc 11  because of concerns about scalding scaling and energy conservation with only some recommending higher temperatures -besides direct effects on pathogens temperature is a fundamental selective force in shaping the broader microbiota of tap water within a building pipes and plumbing components are made from a vast array of materials all with the potential to influence microbial regrowth .

where numbers significantly increased and peaked at 41 degc followed by a drop at 45 and 49 degc and a further drop to below-detection at 53 degc p  0.05 in all cases relative to the 32 degc control.

however water temperature in realistic water heaters and hot water distribution pipes is typically lower than the set point due to cooling in distal pipes or mixing with cold water in a recent pilot-scale simulation l. pneumophila remained detectable at the tap and in the recirculating line even when the water heater was set at 58 degc based on op-containing genera identified by amplicon se- quencing mid-range temperatures 41-49 degc could be more problematic than the assumed worst-case scenario of 32 degc.

at 45 and49 degc the composition of the microbial communi- ties converged regardless of the pipe material but at 53 degc the effects of pex and copper were again apparent with greater variation among replicates.

actinobacteria populations were also enriched at higher temperatures 49 and 53 degc.microbial diversityshannon diversity decreased as temperature increased from 41 to 45 degc but then significantly increased 1.2-1.7 times at 49 and 53 degc regardless of pipe material compared to temporal changes observed in the control swhs fig.

c. this supports the concept of temperature as a diagnostic of risk of op colonization it also suggests that 55 degc a temperature considerably lower than the standard set point 60 degc can technically be effective if achieved homogeneously in the system as was the case in these swhs.
