the majority of studies indicate that female gender is a predictor of anxiety and depression in ibd females are also believed to be more susceptible to the impact of ibd on hrqol potentially due to increased symptom perception in women females with ibd are also more likely to have ibs-like symptoms concurrent with ibd greater levels of fatigue and show a higher incidence of mood swings among those with cd all of which may impact on hrqol and psychological health.although diet is not a causative factor in ibd it is thought to be a potential trigger for ibd flares and it is believed that the westernised diet rich in processed foods is a factor in the increased incidence of the disease in these regions a modified diet limiting excess fat carbohydrates fibre and lactose and encouraging intake of pre- and probiotic foods may be helpful as an adjunct therapy in ibd in decreasing symptoms and reducing medication requirements although it is still unclear whether dietary modification would be therapeutic in the psychological aspects of ibd considering the link between diet stress and the influence of gut microbiota on mood it is reasonable to think that this may be beneficial and will be addressed further later in this review.the literature indicates that active ibd is associated with an increase in psychological manifestations with disease severity being an independent predictor of depressive symptoms uc patients with pain have been shown to have significantly higher depression scores than uc patients without pain with higher pain scores being an accurate predictor of depression in both uc and cd as well as pain the nature of other symptoms experienced by ibd patients can be extremely stressful.

ibd is an incurable yet treatable disease typically managed with drugs aminosalicylates systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants and surgery such as bowel resection for cd or colectomy with ileostomy or ileo-anal pouch anastomosis if necessary surgery will generally be required in 70-80 of cd patients and up to 30 of uc patients surgery may be curative for uc whereas inflammation usually recurs following surgery in cd mortality for ibd is slightly higher than the general population with a uk study of over 16 000 ibd patients with age- and sex- matched controls indicating 54 excess mortality associated with ibd diagnosis comorbid anxiety and depression in ibdhistorically there has been a long-standing interest in the comorbidity of psychological well-being psy- chiatric illness and personality differences associated with ibd -in patients of all age groups.

mean rates of anxiety and depression were significantly higher in cd compared with uc but only modestly so.validated questionnaires including the hospital anxiety and depression scales hads beck depression inventory bdi state-trait anxiety inventory stai and hamilton anxiety and depression scales have been used to confirm an increased risk of psychological disturbances in ibd patients -.

results showed that with both cd and uc there is a greater chance of suffering from depression but that in uc the depression is usually diagnosed in the year before onset of the disease symptoms whereas in patients with cd the depres- sion followed the diagnosis of the disease.

depression andor anxiety are consistently reported to be increased in the active phase of ibd -.a detailed summary of reports documenting anxiety and depression symptoms in ibd patients is summarised in 1.anxietydepression in paediatric ibdincreased risk for psychiatric disorders is not unique to adults with ibd adolescents and children with ibd are also reported to have increased risk of anxiety and depression.

as a result they suggested that subgroup- specific interventions may be needed when treating depression in youths with ibd.anxietydepression in active ibd versus remissionin a small case-control study which included healthy controls and cd patients with active disease investiga- tors reported increased anxiety and depression during active ibd .

considering that ibd is a lifelong disorder involving chronic relapsing and remitting inflammation and activation of oxidative and nitrosative pathways 9 it is likely that the depressive behaviour observed in ibd patients is not simply sickness behaviour but a comorbid depression 0. furthermore sickness behaviour is evolutionarily intended as an adaptive response to sickness whereas comorbid depression worsens the original sickness as has been observed in ibd patients - while treatment for depressive symptoms improves ibd course .

these factors may account for some of the variation observed across studies of depression and anxiety in ibd and are noted in where applicable.various studies have observed that lower socioeconomic status and lower educational level are associated with depression and anxiety in ibd patients such patients are also shown to have lower hrqol than the general population however it is difficult to draw conclusions from this link as this may be a result of other non-disease- related factors generally there is little difference in ibd occurrence between men and women however gender does appear to be linked to differences in psychosocial manifestations of the7abautret-daly et al.disease.

these patients display increases in depressive tendencies while receiving interferon or interleukin-2 treatment which subside once treatment finishes 2. furthermore both clinical and preclinical studies have shown that the induction of a pro-inflammatory state in otherwise healthy subjects results in poor mood and 'sickness behaviour' a behavioural phenotype resembling depression with symptoms including lethargy anxiety social withdrawal anhedonia and anorexia 6-. though they share many symptoms and are both thought to have a basis in inflammation sickness behaviour is distinct from clinical depression.

encouraging progress in the area of microbiota- gut-brain axis-based therapies also points to potential treatment options.as no single animal model can fully reflect the true nature of human ibd further research using existing models and the development of novel models for the disease will contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how ibd interacts with the cns.concluding remarksoverall there is a general consensus that ibd is associated with increased vulnerability to depression and anxiety symptoms compared with healthy controls particularly during active disease.

similar to probiotics results show efficacy in reducing inflam- mation and inducing remission in uc - whereas somewhat controversially reducing disease activity and inflammation in cd although no work has explored the potential therapeutic benefit for probiotics or prebiotics in reducing anxiety depression specifically in ibd patients this thera- peutic strategy has been tested in other cohorts.
