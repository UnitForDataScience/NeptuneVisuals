The majority of studies indicate that female gender is a predictor of anxiety and depression in IBD Females are also believed to be more susceptible to the impact of IBD on HRQOL potentially due to increased symptom perception in women Females with IBD are also more likely to have IBS-like symptoms concurrent with IBD greater levels of fatigue and show a higher incidence of mood swings among those with CD all of which may impact on HRQOL and psychological health.Although diet is not a causative factor in IBD it is thought to be a potential trigger for IBD flares and it is believed that the Westernised diet rich in processed foods is a factor in the increased incidence of the disease in these regions A modified diet limiting excess fat carbohydrates fibre and lactose and encouraging intake of pre- and probiotic foods may be helpful as an adjunct therapy in IBD in decreasing symptoms and reducing medication requirements Although it is still unclear whether dietary modification would be therapeutic in the psychological aspects of IBD considering the link between diet stress and the influence of gut microbiota on mood it is reasonable to think that this may be beneficial and will be addressed further later in this review.The literature indicates that active IBD is associated with an increase in psychological manifestations with disease severity being an independent predictor of depressive symptoms UC patients with pain have been shown to have significantly higher depression scores than UC patients without pain with higher pain scores being an accurate predictor of depression in both UC and CD As well as pain the nature of other symptoms experienced by IBD patients can be extremely stressful.

IBD is an incurable yet treatable disease typically managed with drugs aminosalicylates systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants and surgery such as bowel resection for CD or colectomy with ileostomy or ileo-anal pouch anastomosis if necessary Surgery will generally be required in 70-80 of CD patients and up to 30 of UC patients Surgery may be curative for UC whereas inflammation usually recurs following surgery in CD Mortality for IBD is slightly higher than the general population with a UK study of over 16 000 IBD patients with age- and sex- matched controls indicating 54 excess mortality associated with IBD diagnosis Comorbid anxiety and depression in IBDHistorically there has been a long-standing interest in the comorbidity of psychological well-being psy- chiatric illness and personality differences associated with IBD -in patients of all age groups.

Results showed that with both CD and UC there is a greater chance of suffering from depression but that in UC the depression is usually diagnosed in the year before onset of the disease symptoms whereas in patients with CD the depres- sion followed the diagnosis of the disease.

These factors may account for some of the variation observed across studies of depression and anxiety in IBD and are noted in where applicable.Various studies have observed that lower socioeconomic status and lower educational level are associated with depression and anxiety in IBD patients Such patients are also shown to have lower HRQOL than the general population however it is difficult to draw conclusions from this link as this may be a result of other non-disease- related factors Generally there is little difference in IBD occurrence between men and women However gender does appear to be linked to differences in psychosocial manifestations of the7Abautret-Daly et al.disease.

As a result they suggested that subgroup- specific interventions may be needed when treating depression in youths with IBD.Anxietydepression in active IBD versus remissionIn a small case-control study which included healthy controls and CD patients with active disease investiga- tors reported increased anxiety and depression during active IBD .

as only patients naive to steroid treatment and surgical intervention were included and again IBD patients had significantly higher expression of depressive symptoms than controls 41.9 and 50 of CD and UC patients respectively show depressive symptoms compared with 11.1 of controls.

also reported high rates 32 of depressive characteristics in a group of Iranian IBD patients and patients with indeterminate colitis despite all patients being in remission at the time of the study.

Inflammation in UC usually remains in the rectum and colon whereas CD can affect any part of the GI tract however most commonly involves ileocaecal inflammation The disease burden of IBD is challenging for patients and not only includes the physiological manifestations of the disease but also psychological and social burden.
