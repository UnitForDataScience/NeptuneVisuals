However some minor changes were observed in several serum chemistry parameters.In male groups the values of ALT in 5 GM canola group and TP ALB in 10 GM canola group were significantly increased P  0.05 while the values of Ca P TG in 2.5 GM canola group and CREA in 5 10 GM canola group were significantly decreased P  0.05 compared with the corresponding non-GM canola groups.

However there were no significant or- ganic pathologic changes on histopathology of related tissues including heart liver and kidney .In females the values of P Mg in 2.5 GM group canola and TG in10 GM canola group were significantly increased P  0.05 and the values of CREA in 2.5 GM canola group and TP ALB GLU in 5 GM canola group were significantly decreased P  0.05 compared with the corresponding non-GM canola groups.

These differences were not observed in the high-dose GM canola group compared with the control group althoughthe values of HCT MCV MCH and MCHC in 10 GM canola group were significantly different P  0.05 from the 10 non-GM canola group all these values in 10 GM canola groups were similar to those of the control group.

However these values were similar to those of the control group P  0.05.In females the relative weights of liver kidney ovary in 2.5 GM canola group were significantly higher P  0.05 the relative weights of brain in 5 and 10 GM canola group and spleen in 5 GM canola group were significantly lower P  0.05 than those of corresponding non-GM canola groups.

These differences were not considered to be biologically meaningful because no significant differences were observed in high-dose GM canola group compared with the control group.In females the values of HCT MCV and MCH in 5 GM canola group were significantly higher P  0.05 and the value of MCHC in 5 GM canola was significantly lower P  0.05 compared with the 5 non-GM canola group.

However this difference was not considered to be dose-related because no significant difference was observed in the 10 high-dose GM canola group.Organ relative weightsAs shown in  in male groups the relative weight of lung in 5 GM canola group and heart in 10 GM canola group were sig- nificantly higher P  0.05 than those of corresponding non-GM ca- nola groups.

However statistically significant differences were still observed in some parameters.On 91st day shown in  in male groups the value of HCT in 5 GM canola groups was significantly higher P  0.05 than that of 5 non-GM canola group and the control group but no dose re- lationship occurred in 10 GM canola group.

The RBC in 5 GM canola group were significantly decreased P  0.05 compared with the 5 non-GM canola group and the control group but no dose relationship was observed in 10 GM canola group.Serum chemistrySerum chemistry results were shown in .

The LDH in 5 GM canola group was increased P  0.05 when compared with the corresponding non- GM canola group and the control group.

Besides tissues of rats from control group 10 non-GM canola group and 10 GM canola group were prepared for the histopathological analysis.
