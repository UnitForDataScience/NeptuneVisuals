long-term follow up of gut microbiota development has been performed only in one allergy prevention study so far.in that study gut microbiota develop- ment was followed to the age of six years and only minor and short term differences were observed between the probiotic and placebo groups as determined using 16se23s rdna interspace region based profiling.another important aspect that only has been evaluated in one study so faris whether the eczema preventative effects of the probiotic supplementation are dependent on the intrinsic gut microbiota composition in early infancy.

moreover gut microbiota composition at age 3e6 months was recently associated with milk allergy resolution at 8 years of age.new insights into how the gut microbiota influences food al- lergy have been provided by experimental animal models clearly demonstrating that absence of microbiota during a short time in- terval in early life can result in defects in immune regulation.

studies have shown that bacterially produced scfa can regulate both the proportions and functional properties of in- testinal treg cellseand inhibit pro-inflammatory responses by intestinal macrophages.intervention studies elucidating the effect of high-fiber prebiotics in modulating the intestinal human microbiota for prevention or treatment of food allergy is a logical strategy that should be assessed in future research.primary prevention studies using probiotics prebiotics and synbioticsthe first studies targeting the gut microbiota for allergy pre- vention focused on the potential benefits of probiotics with more recent studies examining prebiotics and synbiotics in this context.probiotics and eczemathe preventative effects of probiotics have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials rctse and the majority used eczema or ige-associated eczema as the primary outcome.

long-term effects of pre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota development need to be investigated in further studies.challenges and current recommendationswe recently discussed the challenges when analyzing the re- sults of conducted studies and meta-analyses in this research area and these include large heterogeneity and lack of harmonization in both probiotic and prebiotic studies.many international expert organizations including the american academy of pediatrics national institute of allergy and infectious diseaseseuropeanacademy of allergy and clinical immunologyeuropean society for paediatric gastroenterology hepatology and nutritionand food and agriculture organization of the united nationsworld health organizationdo not advocate the use of probiotics or prebiotics for primary prevention of allergic disease.on the other hand the grade-based guidelines from the world allergy orga- nization wao recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of eczema in pregnancy and during breastfeeding when there is high risk of allergic disease based on a positive family history and in high risk infants.wao also recommends prebiotics in the primary prevention of allergy in non-exclusively breastfed in- fants.in accordance with recent meta-analyses and other expert bodies the wao guideline panel recognized that the recommen- dations on both probiotics and prebiotics are conditional and based on very low quality evidence.

iga as the most abundant mucosal immunoglobulin isotype is important in the establish- ment of composition of intestinal microbiotaand may reinforce oral tolerance by strengthening the mucosal barrier function.in line with this hypothesis aberrant iga responses to the gut microbiota during infancy were recently observed to precede al- lergy development during the first seven years of life.the lack of intestinal microbiota in germ free mice is associated with a th2-skewed immune response with enhanced ige re- sponses to food antigens andor a defect in mounting proper reg- ulatory t-cell responses.thus an early exposure to microbial symbionts occurring during certain time windows of develop- mental plasticity potentially also during the prenatal period either directly or indirectly through maternal immunomodulation might be beneficial in preventing development of th2- mediated allergic disease.

further studies are required to delineate the effects of pre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation on development of systemic and mucosal immunity.effects on gut microbiotapre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation has been hy- pothesized to beneficially affect gut microbiota composition.

asthma and food allergy.for these reasons there is still need for carefully designed and adequately powered rcts to examine the effects of probiotics for prevention of food allergy and respiratory allergies.prebiotics synbiotics and allergic outcomeshuman milk oligosaccharides hmos are the third largest fraction in human milk and they serve as substrates for specific microbes to modulate infant gut microbiota composition.they are sometimes referred to as natural prebiotics and until very recently they have not been commercially available.

when collating the findings from the different randomized dou- ble blind placebo controlled allergy prevention trials it is impor- tant to recognize the impact of varying methodologies used to characterize the gut microbiota composition.findings from traditional culture based methods are difficult to compare to studies based on next generation sequencing.

distur- bances in composition diversity and timing of microbial colonization have been associated with increased allergy risk indicating the importance of strategies to restore a dysbiotic gut microbiota in the primary prevention of allergic diseases including the administration of probiotics prebiotics and syn- biotics.

however even within next generation sequencing studies there is another layer of variability introduced by the choice of sequencing platform dna extraction primer design sequencing depth data processing etc which may also hamper comparability.while there is some evidence for a bifidogenic effect of probiotic supplementation in allergy prevention trials this has not been consistently observed.generally more global gut micro- biota diversity promoting effects have not been observed in the early in life probiotic allergy prevention trials using next genera- tion sequencing methodologies after pre- and postnatal supple- mentation with l. reuteri l. rhamnosus l. acidophilus andb.
