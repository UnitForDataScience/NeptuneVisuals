Long-term follow up of gut microbiota development has been performed only in one allergy prevention study so far.In that study gut microbiota develop- ment was followed to the age of six years and only minor and short term differences were observed between the probiotic and placebo groups as determined using 16Se23S rDNA interspace region based profiling.Another important aspect that only has been evaluated in one study so faris whether the eczema preventative effects of the probiotic supplementation are dependent on the intrinsic gut microbiota composition in early infancy.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license  .The establishment of commensal microbiota in the gastroin- testinal tract is critical to provide the tolerogenic microenviron- ment necessary for optimal development of both innate and adaptive immunity.Adverse influences on early colonization may have long-lasting consequences exemplified by numerous exam- ples of early compositional and functional differences in early life gut microbiota that precede the onset of eczema and asthma.e While it has been logical to explore the role of probioticspre- biotics and combinations of these synbiotics  to favorably modulate gut microbiota it is also important that such interventions are considered in tandem with other strategies that address the perinatal practices and environmental factors that are contributing to dysbiosis in the first place.

Moreover gut microbiota composition at age 3e6 months was recently associated with milk allergy resolution at 8 years of age.New insights into how the gut microbiota influences food al- lergy have been provided by experimental animal models clearly demonstrating that absence of microbiota during a short time in- terval in early life can result in defects in immune regulation.

Studies have shown that bacterially produced SCFA can regulate both the proportions and functional properties of in- testinal Treg cellseand inhibit pro-inflammatory responses by intestinal macrophages.Intervention studies elucidating the effect of high-fiber prebiotics in modulating the intestinal human microbiota for prevention or treatment of food allergy is a logical strategy that should be assessed in future research.Primary prevention studies using probiotics prebiotics and synbioticsThe first studies targeting the gut microbiota for allergy pre- vention focused on the potential benefits of probiotics with more recent studies examining prebiotics and synbiotics in this context.Probiotics and eczemaThe preventative effects of probiotics have been evaluated in randomized controlled trials RCTse and the majority used eczema or IgE-associated eczema as the primary outcome.

Long-term effects of pre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation on gut microbiota development need to be investigated in further studies.Challenges and current recommendationsWe recently discussed the challenges when analyzing the re- sults of conducted studies and meta-analyses in this research area and these include large heterogeneity and lack of harmonization in both probiotic and prebiotic studies.Many international expert organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesEuropeanAcademy of Allergy and Clinical ImmunologyEuropean Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutritionand Food and Agriculture Organization of the United NationsWorld Health Organizationdo not advocate the use of probiotics or prebiotics for primary prevention of allergic disease.On the other hand the GRADE-based guidelines from the World Allergy Orga- nization WAO recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of eczema in pregnancy and during breastfeeding when there is high risk of allergic disease based on a positive family history and in high risk infants.WAO also recommends prebiotics in the primary prevention of allergy in non-exclusively breastfed in- fants.In accordance with recent meta-analyses and other expert bodies the WAO guideline panel recognized that the recommen- dations on both probiotics and prebiotics are conditional and based on very low quality evidence.

IgA as the most abundant mucosal immunoglobulin isotype is important in the establish- ment of composition of intestinal microbiotaand may reinforce oral tolerance by strengthening the mucosal barrier function.In line with this hypothesis aberrant IgA responses to the gut microbiota during infancy were recently observed to precede al- lergy development during the first seven years of life.The lack of intestinal microbiota in germ free mice is associated with a Th2-skewed immune response with enhanced IgE re- sponses to food antigens andor a defect in mounting proper reg- ulatory T-cell responses.Thus an early exposure to microbial symbionts occurring during certain time windows of develop- mental plasticity potentially also during the prenatal period either directly or indirectly through maternal immunomodulation might be beneficial in preventing development of Th2- mediated allergic disease.

Further studies are required to delineate the effects of pre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation on development of systemic and mucosal immunity.Effects on gut microbiotaPre- and postnatal probiotic supplementation has been hy- pothesized to beneficially affect gut microbiota composition.
