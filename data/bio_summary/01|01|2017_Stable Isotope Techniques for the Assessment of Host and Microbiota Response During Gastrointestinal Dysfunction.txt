here we review and discuss the potential of available stable isotope techniques as nonless-invasive and safe tools for advanced diagnosis and research of gastrointestinal dysfunction.the principle of using stable isotopes in gastroenterologythe basic principle of all stable isotope techniques in gastroenterology is to administrate a stable isotope-labeled compound to the body i.e.

the purpose of this review is to assess the state-of-the-art in the use of stable isotope technologies and to provide a perspective on where these technologies can be exploited to further our understanding of gut dysfunction in eed.this is an open access article distributed under the creative commons attribution license 4.0 which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.corresponding author dr douglas morrison stable isotope biochemistry laboratory scottish universities environmental research centre university of glasgow rankine avenue east kilbride glasgow g75 0qf tel 44 01355 270134 fax 44 0135dr douglas morrison coordinated the manuscript.

25multiple isotope labels targeted delivery and additional stable isotope end-points including breath 13co2 will potentially move this strategy forward for understanding gut dysfunction in eed.stable isotopes macronutrient bioavailability and host responseclassical stable isotope dilution techniques which utilize steady-state tracer infusion protocols have become an essential tool for determining metabolite flux in humans.

69 while these single-cell methods were initially developed and applied in animal models stable isotope analysis of individual cells can be readily performed on fecal samples or tissue biopsies obtained from patients that are subject to some of the more routine stable isotope tests mentioned above.

stable isotopes add essential functional measurements to the existing array of biomarkers and have significant potential to be applied in diseases where gut dysfunction has an important role.acknowledgementswe thank professor tom preston suerc for his constructive critical discussion in drafting this paper and for the picture of isotopic labelling of plants for human studies.financial support work at the stable isotope biochemistry laboratory suerc is funded in part by bbsrc bb l0042591 bbl0254181.

advances in stable isotope labelling techniques open up new possibilities to improve our understanding of gastrointestinal dysfunction and the role of the microbiota in host health.

stable isotope labelling techniques have been used to assess intestinal mucosal injury and barrier function carbohydrate digestion and fermentation protein derived amino acid bioavailability and requirements micronutrient bioavailability and to track microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions at the single cell level.

the non-invasive nature of stable isotope technologies potentially allows for low-hazard field deployable tests of gut dysfunction that are applicable across all age-groups.

stable isotope techniques are often used to determine general epithelial function such as absorption and permeability.

the attraction of stable isotope based technologies in eed is their potential for non-invasive diagnosis in field research settings to assess a wide assortment of different components of gut physiology and function.

8 the most robust safe sensitive and specific stable isotope breath test devised is the 13c urea breath test ubt for diagnosis and monitoring of helicobacter pylori hp.

11 12 several stable isotope breath tests for assessing gastric emptying have been designed and validated against scintigraphic methods.

this experimental approach is exemplarily outlined for stable isotope-labelled plant-derived dietary compounds in figure 2. isotope labeling has been used to describe quantitative exogenous glucose production and insulin sensitivity from native plant-derived starches 3233 34. beyond starch 13c labelling has been used to determine quantitatively scfa production from inulin in vivo 35 and the extent of carbohydrate oxidation from beta- glucan-enriched barley.
