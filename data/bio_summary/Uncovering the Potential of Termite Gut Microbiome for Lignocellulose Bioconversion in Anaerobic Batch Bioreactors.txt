Weighted Unifrac distances of OTUs Figure 4 showed that the two Nasutitermes gut microbiomes were closely related while the M. parvus gut microbiome was closer to those of Nasutitermes than the gut microbial community of T. hospes.

VFA accumulationvaried from 2.2 to 5.8 g.L-1 for the different termite gut inoculawith the N. ephratae gut microbiome yielding the highest concentration Figure 1B.

Finally it was noted that for all termite gut inocula more than 60 of the xylanase and cellulose activities were cell-bound.Diversity Analysis of the Termite-Gut Inocula and Lignocellulose Degradation BioreactorsThe microbial diversity of the original termite gut microbiome and that of the communities developed in the bioreactors was assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 16S rRNA gene region of genomic DNA samples.

Nevertheless the Termes gut microbiome was clearly different to that of Nasutitermes gut being the only termite species displaying abundant OTUs belonging to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.Diversity Changes after Incubation in Lignocellulose BioreactorsDetermination of observed richness Table 2 using a 97 similarity threshold revealed that this was decreased by a factorof 2 147-304 OTUs being reduced to 67 OTUs over the 20- day incubation period.

Therefore it appears that other factors such as the specific physiological state of the gut microbiome at the time of the gut's withdrawal could be responsible for experimental variability.In an attempt to relate wheat straw degradation to enzyme activity cellulose and xylanase activities were monitored.

Indeed the weighted-Unifrac distance observed between N. ephratae and N. lujae gut communities results from differences in abundance of Fibrobacteres compared to the two other termite gut communities.

High-resolution analysis of gut environment and bacterial microbiota reveals functional compartmentation of the gut in wood-feeding higher termites Nasutitermes spp.. Appl.

This ability to feed on recalcitrant plant material is the result of complex symbiotic relationships which involve termite-specific gut microbiomes.

In this study gut microbiomes of four termite species were studied for their capacity to degrade wheat straw and produce carboxylates in controlled bioreactors.

All of the gut microbiomes successfully degraded lignocellulose and up to 45 ww of wheat straw degradation was observed with the Nasutitermes ephratae gut-microbiome displaying the highest levels of wheat straw degradation carboxylate production and enzymatic activity.
