The changes in the HG group were characterised by a significant increase in these bio- markers at exacerbation Day 0 and recovery to stable levels with treatment.GF analysis at exacerbation day 0 identifies HG group membership better than conventional culture or pathogen directed PCRThe HG subgroup identified by GF analysis was characterised by correlated changes in microbiome inflammatory markers and respiratory function whereas the microbiome was dissociated from these changes in the HF and GF groups.

We hypothesised that selective assessment of the balance between the two dominant bacterial groups Gammaproteobacteria G and Firmicutes F in COPD sputum samples might reveal a subgroup with a bacterial community structure change at exacerbation that was restored to baseline on recovery and potentially reflects effective antibiotic treatment.MethodsPhylogenetically specific 16S rRNA genes were determined by quantitative real time PCR to derive a GF ratio in serial sputum samples from 66 extensively-phenotyped COPD exacer- bation episodes.ResultsCluster analysis based on Euclidean distance measures generated across the 4 visit times stable and exacerbation day 014 and 42 for the 66 exacerbation episodes revealed three subgroups designated HG HF and GF reflecting predominance or equivalence of the two target bacterial groups.

Two outlier events showed a Firmicute dominated stable ratio and like the HG group a shift towards the Gammaproteobacteria at exacerbation followed by a return to the stable pattern during recovery.A significant increase in GF ratio p0.00001 was apparent at exacerbation in the HG cluster and this returned to stable visit levels in the follow up and recovery visits p0.00001 .

In particular the HG cluster showed an increase at exacerbation whichA single GF ratio assay at exacerbation identifies membership of the HG cluster.

Heterogeneity in exacerbation aeti- ology lack of generally accepted biomarkers for guiding treatment and a precautionary Exacerbation GF ratio identifies HG membership better than culture and qPCR.Culture and qPCR  10 5 genomeml positives at exacerbation for M. catarrhalis H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae to identify the HG cluster membership.614GF values are determined at threshold of 22.67 from ROC analysis.approach to patients with heavily colonised lower airways may underpin excessive use of anti- biotics in COPD.

We suggest that both the pattern of GF ratios and the association with inflam- matory and FEV1 changes in the HG group and the lack thereof in the other groups indicate that antibiotics may not have contributed to symptomatic relief in the non HG exacerbations.Notably we have shown that the GF ratio at exacerbation can identify the HG group mem- bership.

At exacerbation GF showed a significant receiver-operator-characteristic curve to identify the HG subgroup AUC 0.90 p0.0001.ConclusionsThe GF ratio at exacerbation can be determined on a timescale compatible with decisions regarding clinical management.

Viruses were detected in 15 out of 66 exacerbations but there was no significant association between virus positivity in the HG cluster 23 compared to the non HG-associated events 21 Table E in DiscussionUsing an assay that assesses the balance between the two numerically dominant bacterial groups in COPD sputum samples we have identified a subgroup of exacerbation events in which this balance is disturbed at exacerbation and returns to baseline with clinical recovery.

In contrast post BD FEV1 in the other clusters showed  5 mean decline at exacerbation .Comparison of post-bronchodilator FEV1 across visit times in individual clusters shows significant decline in lung function at exacerbation in the HG cluster.

While the other subgroups showed no change at exacerbationthe HG cluster n  20 was characterized by GF ratios that increased significantly at exacerbation and returned to baseline on recovery p0.00001 ratios in the HG group alsoby the National Institute for Health Research NIHR.
