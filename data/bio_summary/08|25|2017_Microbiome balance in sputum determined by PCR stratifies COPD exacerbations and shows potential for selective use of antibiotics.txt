the changes in the hg group were characterised by a significant increase in these bio- markers at exacerbation day 0 and recovery to stable levels with treatment.gf analysis at exacerbation day 0 identifies hg group membership better than conventional culture or pathogen directed pcrthe hg subgroup identified by gf analysis was characterised by correlated changes in microbiome inflammatory markers and respiratory function whereas the microbiome was dissociated from these changes in the hf and gf groups.

we hypothesised that selective assessment of the balance between the two dominant bacterial groups gammaproteobacteria g and firmicutes f in copd sputum samples might reveal a subgroup with a bacterial community structure change at exacerbation that was restored to baseline on recovery and potentially reflects effective antibiotic treatment.methodsphylogenetically specific 16s rrna genes were determined by quantitative real time pcr to derive a gf ratio in serial sputum samples from 66 extensively-phenotyped copd exacer- bation episodes.resultscluster analysis based on euclidean distance measures generated across the 4 visit times stable and exacerbation day 014 and 42 for the 66 exacerbation episodes revealed three subgroups designated hg hf and gf reflecting predominance or equivalence of the two target bacterial groups.

two outlier events showed a firmicute dominated stable ratio and like the hg group a shift towards the gammaproteobacteria at exacerbation followed by a return to the stable pattern during recovery.a significant increase in gf ratio p0.00001 was apparent at exacerbation in the hg cluster and this returned to stable visit levels in the follow up and recovery visits p0.00001 .

note the preponderance of red lines in the hg cluster and blue lines in the hf cluster.pcr-based viral analysis was done in our copd subjects 8. viruses were detected in 15 out of 66 exacerbations but there was no significant association between virus positivity in the hg cluster 23 compared to the non hg-associated events 21 table e in discussionusing an assay that assesses the balance between the two numerically dominant bacterial groups in copd sputum samples we have identified a subgroup of exacerbation events in which this balance is disturbed at exacerbation and returns to baseline with clinical recovery.

in particular the hg cluster showed an increase at exacerbation whicha single gf ratio assay at exacerbation identifies membership of the hg cluster.

data presented as mean sem n  number of subjects in each cluster bmi  body mass index bdp  beclomethasone dipropionate sgrq  st george's respiratory questionnaire.the hg cluster was significantly associated with dynamic changes in inflammatory markers and fev1 over the time course of an exacerbation episodethe increase in the gf ratio exclusive to the hg cluster was strongly associated with mean serum crp levels across the sample visits day 0 day 42 day 14stable p  0.0002. when the analysis was confined to episodes for which we had complete sets of metadata  the hg cluster demonstrated a significant change across visits in crp p  0.004 sputum il-1b p  0.03 and sputum neutrophil  p  0.01 that was not seen in the other groups.

we suggest that both the pattern of gf ratios and the association with inflam- matory and fev1 changes in the hg group and the lack thereof in the other groups indicate that antibiotics may not have contributed to symptomatic relief in the non hg exacerbations.notably we have shown that the gf ratio at exacerbation can identify the hg group mem- bership.

at exacerbation gf showed a significant receiver-operator-characteristic curve to identify the hg subgroup auc 0.90 p0.0001.conclusionsthe gf ratio at exacerbation can be determined on a timescale compatible with decisions regarding clinical management.

in contrast post bd fev1 in the other clusters showed  5 mean decline at exacerbation .comparison of post-bronchodilator fev1 across visit times in individual clusters shows significant decline in lung function at exacerbation in the hg cluster.

while the other subgroups showed no change at exacerbationthe hg cluster n  20 was characterized by gf ratios that increased significantly at exacerbation and returned to baseline on recovery p0.00001 ratios in the hg group alsoby the national institute for health research nihr.

thus at exacerbation the hg subgroup showed a shift in the ratio between the dominant bac- terial groups present and this balance was unperturbed at that time in the other clusters.interestingly on comparison of baseline clinical characteristics among the three gf clus- ters the frequency of exacerbations was 2-fold higher in the hf compared to the hg and gf clusters this observation accords with the reported increased frequency of exacerbations associated with veilonella firmicutes rich populations .

in one of the sub- groups this ratio increased at the time of exacerbation and returned to baseline on recovery.this observation led us to hypothesise that the gf ratio might identify a clinically distinct sub-group in whom a dysbiotic microbiome disturbance at exacerbation might be restored to a more healthy balance though recovery possibly as a result of effective antibiotic treatment.accordingly we have established and investigated a real time pcr assay to directly determine this ratio in sputum samples to test our hypothesis and to explore the possibility that timely gf assay might have potential to inform clinical practice.

analyses were applied to sequential sputum samples taken at visit times des- ignated stable s at least 8 weeks after last exacerbation exacerbation day 0 as defined and treated by anthonisen criteria  and sampled prior to initiation of treatment and two follow-up samples taken 14 and 42 days later respectively day 14 and day 42. sixty six exac- erbations yielded adequate sputum samples for analysis at all four visit times thus 264 samples generated by 58 subjects some subjects had multiple episodes were analysed here.

we emphasise that this approach took into account the results at all four visit times for each of the exacerbation events analysed and identified their related- ness to every other exacerbation event by pairwise comparison.
