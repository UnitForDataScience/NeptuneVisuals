Genetic and Phenotypic Differences from Outgroup SpeciesUbiquity of 1037 Enterococcus core genes in eubacteria BLASTx against 100 representative eubacterial genomes Table S4 tab 2 in quintiles.Genera of microbes harboring genes seldom found outside of enterococci first quintile 1-20 genera ranked by the number of first quintile genes shared.Top Venn diagram showing shared and unique genes in Enterococcus core genome and Vagococcus lutrae LBD1.

The large genome E. pallens group was precipitated by an initial gain of 1157 genes at node 18 followed by successive large gains at nodes 19 410 genes and 20 408 genes.

E. columbae also acquired 40 genes for flagellar assembly and chemotaxis which may relate to novel aspects of this vertical transmission to offspring.Origins of the EnterococciTo gain insight into ecological relationships between all other enterococcal species where definitive hosts information is much more limited and to quantify the divergence distance be- tween species we calculated 1 the fraction of genes shared be- tween each genome pair and 2 the average nucleotide identity ANI between those shared genes A and S5.

Enterococcal 16S DNA is highly enriched in metagenomes from land animals Fisher's exact test p  10-51 and vagococcal sequences are highly enriched in marine life p  10-21 independently support- ing inferences from the literature C Table S3.Genes and Traits that Distinguish Enterococci from Other MicrobesAlthough the Enterococcus pan-genome is large Figures S2A and S2B a core of 1037 genes occurs in 90 allowing for genes missed by sequence gaps of enterococcal species including M. plutonius and T. halophilus Table S4 tab 1.

To identify possibly unique genes we compared the core set of 1037 enterococcal genes to 100 genomes from representative branches of the eubacterial domain Table S4 tab 2.

In contrast the E. pallens group with large genomes showed the least tolerance for desiccation or starva- tion suggesting that they may derive from hosts that inhabit ecologies where regular desiccation and starvation are less selective such as wet coastal margins.Energy Source Drives Enterococcal SpeciationTo infer changes in the host gut environment that may have driven the diversification of enterococci into various species we performed a flux analysis  of genes gained and lost at each node of speciation A. Diversificationat each node is associated with an average gain of 618 -304 and loss of 135 -103 genes with notable exceptions.

For example 1775 new genes were acquired by the E. pallens strain analyzed which cluster in syntenic regions from which genes core to the genus are largely excluded Figure S2H.

For 10803 genes with ascribable putative functions the greatest flux was in genes for carbohydrate utilization and its transcrip- tional control B.

Large gains and losses of genes associated with amino acid uptake and metabolism were also observed among genes in flux 12 of 10803 anno- tated NSG further supporting nutrient availability as a main driver of speciation Figure S3.Host Association and AdaptationBecause of the emergence of enterococci as hospital patho- gens we closely examined the patterns of gene gain and loss in the evolution of M. plutonius into an overt pathogen from its common ancestor with the most widespread generalistE.
