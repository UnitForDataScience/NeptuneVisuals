the graphs e show the ms1 chromatographic peak ratios r values for all peptides identified from the thp1 membrane fraction treated with 25 mm phe-phe-h. the red dots indicate cysteines with r values 5 and the red line indicates the r value 5 threshold.see also supplemental figure s4 figure s5 figure s6 and table s1.

cluster-harboring strains were cultivated at 5 ml scale for 1-2 days to determine whether they produce a pathway-specific metabolite.guo et al.page 4experimental analysis of the gut nrps gene clusterslc-ms analysis of culture fluid extract from e. coli strains harboring bgc35 and bgc52 showed evidence of seven and eight new peaks respectively figure 2 which is notable since both clusters are from gram-positive hosts.

lc-ms analysis of a time course ofthis reaction showed the formation of two products identical to compounds 2 and 4 suggesting that these are native products of bgc35 figure 2.the gut nrps family is widely distributed in healthy humanshaving identified the small molecule products of a subset of the gut nrps family we next turned to the question of how widely distributed this cluster family is in the human population.

the gradient system was mecn solventb and h2o solvent a.purification of compounds 1-5 from bgc35 compounds 1 to 5 were identified in the metabolite profiles of the e. coli mutant strains heterologously expressing bgc35.

2016.detailed structural characterization of purified compounds isolated in this study--compounds identified in this study can be grouped into three classes dihydropyrazinones compounds 1 and 2 for example pyrazinones compounds 3-15 and n-acyl peptide aldehydes compound 16 figure 2. their biosynthetic origin from a group of nrpss which take amino acids as substrates facilitates the structural elucidation process.for dihyropyrazinones compound 1 was purified as an amorphous yellowish solid and its molecular formula was determined to be c20h19n3o by its hrms spectral data suggesting thirteen indices of hydrogen deficiency ihd.

compounds 9 and 10 were eluted in the same fraction which was further purified using gradient 0-3 min 100  a 3-5 min 100-44  a 5-10 min 44-43  a 10-11 min0  a 11-12 min 0-100  a 12-13 min 100  a. the same gradient was used to purify fraction containing compounds 11 and 12. the four compounds 9 1.13 mgl of culture 10 1.19 mgl of culture 11 1.12 mgl of culture 12 1.25 mgl of culture were elutedat 8.90 9.12 9.35 9.70 min respectively.purification of compound 14 from bgc38 the gradient purifying the crude from the mutant strains carrying bgc38 is 0-5 min 100  a 5-23 min 100-40  a 23-24 min 40-0  a 24-25 min 0-100  a 25-26 min 100  a. compound 14 1.23 mgl of culture was eluted at 20.10 min.purification of compounds 15 and 16 from bgc33 sixteen l of bgc33 were extracted with ea and dried by rotary evaporation.

3 nearly all of the clusters reside in isolates from the human gut and that of other mammals figure 1. very few of the clusters are found in relatives of these organisms that are free-living or inhabit a non- intestinal host-associated niche implying a function that is relevant to the biology of host colonization.

the host organisms of three of the clusters bgc34 bgc35 bgc52 were available from laboratories or culture collections clusters from these hosts were cloned in their native form omitting regulatory genes into e. coli or b. subtilis vectors in which expression was driven by a strong promoter see figure s1 for more details.

2014. as such the only way to access these clusters is to synthesize them a problem of increasing importance as the volume of metagenomic sequence data increases and tools are developed for assembling short-read metagenomic data into cluster-size fragments.we selected 14 of these clusters for analysis colored red or blue in figure 1. clusters were chosen to represent the diversity of sequences and domain architectures from the four clades of the family.

in addition to the seven clusters from which we observed products seven additional clusters were synthesized and expressed in e. coli dh10b e. coli bap1 or b. subtilis 168 colored blue in figure 1 no high-titer products were observed from any of these bgcs using an lc-ms trace comparison.
