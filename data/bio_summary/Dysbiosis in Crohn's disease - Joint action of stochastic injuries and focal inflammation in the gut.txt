Butto and Dirk HallerTechnische UniversitEURat MEURunchen Chair of Nutrition and Immunology Freising GermanyARTICLE HISTORYReceived 21 July 2016 Revised 27 September 2016 Accepted 7 December 2016KEYWORDSDysbiosis microbiota microbiome inflammation Crohn's disease TNFDARE IBD intestinal epithelial cells IEC stochastic injuriesDysbiotic microbiota induces transmissible CD-like ileitis in susceptible hostOur laboratory recently demonstrated that germ-free GF TNFDARE mice do not develop CD-like ileitis supporting the initial hypothesis that bacterial trig- gers are essential tassels of disease pathogenesis.Of high relevance only specific dysbiotic bacterial communities so-called responder R or aggressive microbiota are associated to a disease phenotype in these mice capable to transmit disease once trans- ferred into a GF susceptible host TNFDARE mice.

A Independently from the litter of origin SPF TNFDARE mice housed in the same cage display a gradient of ileitis severity ranging from not diseased i.e.

Non-para- metrical multiple dimensional scaling NMDS analysis displaying phylogenetic distances between fecal bacterial communities of 4- week old TNFDARE mice including mice that later in life develop severe R intermediate lowR and no disease NR adapted from.microbiota is based on innate tissue activation or on antigen recognition.Gut epithelial stochastic injuries generate focal inflammation leading to a dysbiotic microbial ecosystem A provoking hypothesisIt is very challenging to unravel the mechanisms by which inflammation drives bacterial taxa selection and molds microbiota into a disease-conditioning commu- nity.
