In   considering only bacteria and virus communities we established a plausible route to the assembly of a community consisting of n bacterial strains and either n or n 1 virus strains in which the infection network is one to one under suitable conditions.

For example they hold for a nested infection network.The results described above allow one to determine a plausible route by which a KtW community satisfying 1-4 consisting of n bacterial strains n 1 virus strains and a single non-specific zooplankton grazer might be assembled starting with a community consisting of a single bacteria and its associated virus and subsequently adding one new population at a time until the final community is achieved.

The kill the winner KtW mathematical model of this scenario in the form of a system of Lotka-Volterra equations for bacterial virus and zooplankton densities is as noted by  based on the assumptions that 1 all microbes compete for a common resource 2 all microbes except for one population are susceptible to virus infection 3 all microbes are subjected to zooplankton grazing 4 each virus strain infects a unique bacterial strain and each bacterial strain is infected by at most one virus strain.Various forms of the KtW model have appeared in the work of Thingstad     and recently in the monograph of .

Therefore since we merely need to add zooplankton to community consisting of n bacteria and n 1 virus the main result of this paper ensures that there is a plausible assembly path to the KtW community.In the broader ecological context our results are just another example of Butler and Wolkow- icz   .

Tech- nical details are include in a final section.The KtW ModelOur KtW model consisting of n 2 bacterial types n 1 virus types and one zooplankton is patterned after equations 7.28 in  with slight changes.

The latter would imply that each pair Hi  Pi is periodic with period depending on parameters and its amplitude note that the period may be different for different i .However the restriction n Hi t  n Hi requires a very special resonanceamong the periods suggesting that this alternative is unlikely.
