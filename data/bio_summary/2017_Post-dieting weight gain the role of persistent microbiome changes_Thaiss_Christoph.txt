the gut microbiome of obese mice was found to feature a shift toward a higher capacity of energy harvest 10. studies in rodents and humans have shown reduced compositional diversity of the gut microbiome in obesity and its associated morbidities 1112. interestingly this altered microbiome was not only accompanying an obese state of the host but itself contained obesogenic properties that were transmissible to germ-free mice by fecal transplantation leading to weight gain and increased body mass compared with germ-free mice transplanted with microbiome from lean donors 1013-14.we have recently discovered that although many of the structural alterations of the microbiome are reversible upon weight normali-the diagnosis and individual risk assessment for recurrent obesity.a similar persistence phenomenon has recently been described with regard to adipose tissue inflammation another hallmark of the obese state.

flavonoids however are potent stimuli of host energy expenditure 16 suggesting that diminished post-dieting levels of intestinal flavonoids mightthe physiological role of microbiome persistencethe stable obesogenic property conferred by the microbiome of obese donors upon transplantation to a lean recipient 1014 seems to be in contradiction with the rapid adapta- tion of the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome to abrupt changes in diet 20-22. the finding of microbiome persis- tence after a dietary challenge might provide a potential explanation for this discrepancy since it suggests that the intestinal microbialcommunity is shaped by the past history of dietary encounters and does not fully return to a 'naive' state.

more impor- tantly flavonoids might serve in this case as 'post-biotics' microbiota-modulated metabolites with a beneficial effect on the host 27 which might help to bypass the large interindividual variability in microbiome compositions found in the human population.several importantinsights needto be established in human trials before such microbiome-targeted strategies can be therapeutically implemented the role of persistent postobesity microbiome altera- tions in humans the importance of such persistent microbiome effects in post-dieting weight regain the duration and pervasiveness of postobesity sig- nature in the human microbiome and the role of flavonoids in human weight management.

notably the post-dieting microbiome composition was sufficiently informative for the accurate predic- tion of individual weight regain based solely on microbiome data suggesting that microbiome features might serve as powerful biomarkers for...certain elements of the obesity-associated composition and function persist after dieting even when the majority of metabolic parameters have already normalized to preobesity levels.microbiome persistence in recurrent obesitystudies in mice have recently highlighted an additional player in the pathophysiology of obesity and associated metabolic complications the community of commensal microorganisms residing in the gi tract.

of note this immune cell infiltration and expression of proinflammatory cytokines is not fully reversible upon weight reduction and persists despite metabolic normalization 1718. whether persistence in adipose tissue inflam- mation is functionally coupled to postobesity microbiome persistence remains to be deter- mined but recent studies have suggested a link between intestinal microbial colonization toll- like receptor tlr signaling and the aggrava- tion of adipose tissue inflammation 19 indi- cating a potential role for the microbiome in maintaining inflammatory processes in adipose tissue after successful reversal of obesity.zation after obesity certain elements of the obe- sity-associated composition and function persist after dieting even when the majority of meta- bolic parameters have already normalized to preobesity levels 15. one such persistent charac- teristic of the microbiome that is enhanced dur- ing obesity and persists during the post-dieting phase is the enzymatic conversion of flavonoids resulting in reduced levels of these plant-derived dietary metabolites in the intestine.

this has been exemplified by experi- ments in germ-free mice colonized with human microbiota and exposed to defined experimen- tal diets which revealed that the dietary history of the respective donor influences the extent to which the microbiome responds to a new dietary challenge in the murine recipient 23. the refractory properties of the microbiome after prolonged dietary exposure can even per-in which the host induces erratic changes in its physiology exemplified by cycling weight gain and dieting this may result in the refractory state of the microbiome preventing the return of the host toward baseline metabolic homeostasis and thus predispose to exaggerated metabolic responses in ensuing weight gain cycles.

a plau- sible but currently speculative explanation might be that coevolution of the host and its micro- biome favored long-term stabilization of meta- bolic responses in face of a generally stable envi- ronment withstanding short-term alterations in dietary conditions while not anticipating the rapid behavioral changes that characterize human weight management in the past century.sist across generations as has been found in mice harboring a human microbiome and fed a diet deficient in plant polysaccharides 24. similarly the maternal diet might shape the infant long-term microbiome in humans 25.it thus seems that the microbiome at any given time point can be interpreted as a 'memory-like' function of its past dietary influ- ences and that these past influences determine its responsiveness to future exposures.

thus while the initial property of the obesity-associated micro- biome to confer weight gain is lost upon weight normalization the memory-like properties generate a 'window of susceptibility' for weight regain that lasts for the duration of microbiome persistence 15. although the length of this time window remains to be determined and is likely dependent on the dietary context and dura- tion of past dietary exposure it might offer a microbiome-based mechanistic explanation to the enhanced tendency in humans to regain weight promptly after successful dieting.from an evolutionary perspective such memory-like microbiome characteristics might have potentially be purposed to contribute to the stability and persistence of host metabo- lism over prolonged periods of time.

the recent realization that the microbiome is involved in regulating brown adipose tissue biology and that intestinal flavo- noid levels might be centrally involved in this regulatory pathway 1526 provides a rationale for modulating post-dieting energy expenditure through alterations of the composition and func- tion of the intestinal microbiome.

indeed we found that the flavonoids apigenin and naringenin stimulate the expression of ucp-1 in brown adipose tissue and enhance energy expenditure in mice 15. consequently treatments that elevate the levels of intestinal flavonoids including antibiotics- mediated depletion of flavonoid-metabolizing commensals replenishment of a preobesity community by fecal microbiome transplanta- tion and dietary supplementation of flavonoids promoted energy expenditure and ameliorated secondary weight gain after dieting.

what is the physiological relevance of this phenomenon in the case of microbial alterations induced by a high-fat diet post-dieting microbiome per- sistence renders the host more susceptible to exacerbated weight regain but only upon re- exposure to the obesogenic diet.
