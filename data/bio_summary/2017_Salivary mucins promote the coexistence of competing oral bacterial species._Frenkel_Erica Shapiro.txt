mutans and S. sanguinis the total number of viable cells increased in the presence of MUC5B II yet there was only a slight increase or no change in biofilm formation in the presence of MUC5B relative to the control without polymer Fi F. Taken together these results indicate that MUC5B could enhance bacterial coexistence and ultimately bacterial diversity by shifting competing species away from the biofilm and into the less competitive planktonic state.In this work we use a dual-species bacterial model containing human MUC5B salivary mucin to under- stand how this prevalent environmental factor influences bacterial viability.

After 4 h of co-culture in the dual-species model we found that MUC5B also reduced biofilm formation of the primary colonizer in the mixed biofilm by 19-fold for S. mutans and 3-fold for S. sanguinis relative to the control without polymer F. As shown in  the total cell population in each of these cases was unaffected S. mutans or increased S. sanguinis by MUC5B indicating a decrease in the relative proportion of biofilm cells.

Our results show that1 MUC5B promotes S. mutans and S. sanguinis coexistence and 2 MUC5B shifts cells from the biofilm into the planktonic state H. By promoting the single-cell planktonic state MUC5B could alter cell-cell interactions toxin production or other mechanisms of competition.

When S. mutans was the primary colonizer and MUC5B mucins were not present in the growth medium viability of the secondary colonizer S. sanguinis rapidly declined suggesting that S. mutans outcompetes S. sanguinis Fi II.

G H schematic illustrating a summary of conclusions.

First we determined that the observed protective effect of MUC5B was not due to increased bacterial growth MUC5B slightly reduces or has no effect on S. mutans and S. sanguinis growth rates B.

Another way MUC5B could increase bacter- ial survival is by altering the cells' mode of growth which can influence interspecies competition and cell properties such as gene regulation and cell-cell communication O Our data show that MUC5B efficiently reduces S. mutans and S. sanguinis biofilm forma- tion in single-species cultures at 6 h and 9 h1287108106104102100SMediumSMediumMucinStart345Time of co-culture h108106104102100Start345Time of co-culture h1010108106104102108106104102100Start456Time of co-culture h100Start456Time of co-culture h105104103102101100Primary colonizerS.

Together these results show that MUC5B significantly enhances bacterial diversity by increasing survival of at least one bacterial popula- tion compared with the control without MUC5B D.To better understand how MUC5B influences bacterial viability we studied several aspects ofS.
