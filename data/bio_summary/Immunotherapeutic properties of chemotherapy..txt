this phenomenon when preceded by the cell-surface expression of calreticulin crt an endoplasmic reticulum er-associated protein which acts as an 'eat-me' signal upon cell surface expression enhancing cancer cell phagocytosis by dcs  is referred to as immunogenic cell death icd.

have revealed that oxaliplatin-ctx combination by inducing tumor immunogenicity leading to an increase of cd8 t cell treg cell ratio in lung adecarcinoma-bearing mice lacking t cell infiltration is able to sensitize tumors to check- point inhibition and controls cancer sustainably  they confirmed these results in other icb-resistant tumor models including fibrosarcoma- and colon carci- noma-bearing mice.

in addition to the cell surface exposure of crt various molecular signals emitted from tumor cells treated with icd inducers have been described i high mobility group box 1 hmgb1 which binds to toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 on dcs resulting in optimal tumor antigen presentation to cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls  ii atp which interacts with purinergic receptors and leadsto the nlrp3 inflammasome-induced release of il-1b resulting in cd8 t cell activation  iii and type i interferons which induce cxcl10 secretion thereby attracting innate immune cells .

the identification of novel resistance mechanisms to anticancer immune response will drive further the development of personal- ized therapeutic strategies for patients who fail to respond to icd inducers.the antitumor immunopotentiation of chemotherapeutic agents not only involves the stimulation of effector immune cells but also requires the inhibition of immune cells suppressing anticancer immune responses in the tumor microenvironment including regulatory t treg cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells mdscs.

in this regard metronomic doses of ctx in animal models and breast ovarian or various advanced cancer patients selectively decrease the number andor the suppressive function of treg cells and enhance natural killer nk and t cell function .

for example trastuzumab which specifically targets the erb- b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 erbb2 an oncodriver conferring a poor prognosis in breast cancer bc report- edly requires a competent anti-erbb2 cd4 th1 immu- nity to elicit ctl-mediated tumor cell lysis  and activate nk cells .

moreover imatinibpromotes dc-mediated nk cell activation  while dasatinib when combined with dc-based vaccine depletes tumor-infiltrating treg cells and mdscs thereby favoring effector t cell expansion .

importantly the link between dysbiosis and cancer is not restricted to the colorectal area and can also be notable in mammary carcinoma-bearing mice and breast cancer patients under antibiotic treatment .

we will eventually introduce the scientific rationale for therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapeutic drugs and immune checkpoint blockers.addresses1 inserm u1231 dijon france2 faculte' de me' decine universite' de bourgogne franche comte'  dijon france3 centre georges franc ois leclerc dijon francecorresponding author apetoh lionel introductiona real craze has emerged for anticancer immunotherapies when impressive remissions were observed in advanced melanoma and metastatic non-small cell lung nscl cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers icbs .

such results demonstrate that cancer can be efficiently managed by targeting immune in addition to tumor cells.

we will eventually highlight the rationale to combine chemotherapy with anticancer immunotherapies for the benefit of cancer patients.cytotoxic chemotherapeutics can enhance anticancer immune responsesapoptotic necrotic and autophagic tumor cells emit a panel of 'danger signals' the so-called damage associ- ated molecular patterns damps which can activate innate and adaptive immune responses .

preclin- ical findings reveal that antineoplastic effects of oxalipla- tin requires tumor infiltration by ros-producing myeloid cells triggered by microbial component detection and tlr4 activation in a colon cancer murine model .

altogether these findings suggest that the reestablishment of an appropri- ate gut microbiota via fmt dietary changes or pre probiotics consumption could be an effective therapeutic adjuvant strategy to optimize the chemotherapeutic- induced immune responses in cancer patients.chemotherapy and immunotherapy combinationimmune checkpoints prevent t cell activation and the induction of excessive immune responses that drive autoimmunity.
