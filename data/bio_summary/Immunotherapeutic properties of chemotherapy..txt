CD8 T cell CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte CTLA4 Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte associated protein 4 ICB immune checkpoint blocker MDSC myeloid-derived suppressor cell NK natural killer PD-1 programmed-death 1.mediated by Enterococcus hirae and Barnesiella intestiniho- minis are clinically relevant as illustrated by longer pro- gression-free survival in advanced cancer patients Perturbations of the gut homeostasis have consequences that extend beyond cancer development.

This phenomenon when preceded by the cell-surface expression of calreticulin CRT an endoplasmic reticulum ER-associated protein which acts as an 'eat-me' signal upon cell surface expression enhancing cancer cell phagocytosis by DCs  is referred to as immunogenic cell death ICD.

have revealed that oxaliplatin-CTX combination by inducing tumor immunogenicity leading to an increase of CD8 T cell Treg cell ratio in lung adecarcinoma-bearing mice lacking T cell infiltration is able to sensitize tumors to check- point inhibition and controls cancer sustainably  They confirmed these results in other ICB-resistant tumor models including fibrosarcoma- and colon carci- noma-bearing mice.

In addition to the cell surface exposure of CRT various molecular signals emitted from tumor cells treated with ICD inducers have been described i High mobility group box 1 HMGB1 which binds to Toll-like receptor 4 TLR4 on DCs resulting in optimal tumor antigen presentation to Cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs  ii ATP which interacts with purinergic receptors and leadsto the NLRP3 inflammasome-induced release of IL-1b resulting in CD8 T cell activation  iii and type I interferons which induce CXCL10 secretion thereby attracting innate immune cells .

The identification of novel resistance mechanisms to anticancer immune response will drive further the development of personal- ized therapeutic strategies for patients who fail to respond to ICD inducers.The antitumor immunopotentiation of chemotherapeutic agents not only involves the stimulation of effector immune cells but also requires the inhibition of immune cells suppressing anticancer immune responses in the tumor microenvironment including regulatory T Treg cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells MDSCs.

Available online at ScienceDirectImmunotherapeutic properties of chemotherapy Carole Fournier222 Andre' a Melis2 3Impressive remissions driven by immunological checkpoint blockade in cancer patients have prompted the scientific community to investigate afresh the crosstalk between cancer cells and the patient's immune system.

In this regard metronomic doses of CTX in animal models and breast ovarian or various advanced cancer patients selectively decrease the number andor the suppressive function of Treg cells and enhance natural killer NK and T cell function .

For example trastuzumab which specifically targets the erb- b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 ERBB2 an oncodriver conferring a poor prognosis in breast cancer BC report- edly requires a competent anti-ERBB2 CD4 Th1 immu- nity to elicit CTL-mediated tumor cell lysis  and activate NK cells .

Moreover imatinibpromotes DC-mediated NK cell activation  while dasatinib when combined with DC-based vaccine depletes tumor-infiltrating Treg cells and MDSCs thereby favoring effector T cell expansion .

Importantly the link between dysbiosis and cancer is not restricted to the colorectal area and can also be notable in mammary carcinoma-bearing mice and breast cancer patients under antibiotic treatment .
