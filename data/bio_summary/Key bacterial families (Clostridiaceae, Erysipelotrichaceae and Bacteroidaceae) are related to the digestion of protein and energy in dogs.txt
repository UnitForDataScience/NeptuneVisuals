in kittens the abundance of bacteriodes is unaffected by a low carbohydrate-high protein diet compared to high carbohydrate-moderate protein diet  however in older cats fed similar diets bacteriodes were significantly higher in cats fed high carbohydrate-moderate protein diets .

isobutryrate and isovalerate -0.63 and dietary fat content -0.70. negative correlations between clostridiaceae and the levels of acetate propionate and butyrate were also observed -0.56 to -0.63. a more detailed analysis shows that within the clostridiaceae family clostridium and unclassified clostridiaceae were positively correlated to faecal dry matter 0.66 and crude protein content of the diet and negatively correlated with crude fat content -0.66 of the diet and .erysipelotrichaceae were positively correlated with total protein and fat excreted 0.84 metabolites of protein digestion e.g.

positive correlations with the levels of aceate propionate and butyrate were also observed 0.63-0.70. erysipelotrichaceae were negatively correlated with crude protein content of the diet and crude protein digestibility -0.77 faecal health score -0.70 gross energy content of the diet -0.63 energy digestibility -0.63 and fat digestibility -0.14 were observed .

a more detailed analysis shows that the correlations between genera within the erysipelotrichaceaefamily namely allobaculum catenibacterium holdemania turibacter and unclassified erysipelotrichaceae had weaker associations with the parameters measured .bacteroidaceae showed positive correlations with dietary carbohydrate 0.56 crude fibre 0.56 and dry matter 0.56 content and faecal output 0.35. in contrast bacteroidaceae were negatively correlated with the crude protein -0.63 and gross energy content of the diet -0.63 and faecal health score -0.35. bacteriodes was the only genus associated with bacteriodaceae and a more detailed analysis shows a strong positive correlation with valerate  and the levels of protein and fat in the faeces .bifidobacteriaceae showed a strong positive correlation to fat digestibility 0.84  and a negative correlation to faecal output and crude fibre and carbohydrate content -0.63. lactobacillaceae showed only weak correlations to fat digestibility 0.42 whereas ruminococcaceae was positively correlated to the content of carbohydrate and dry matter in the diet 0.63 .discussionthere is a growing understanding of the importance of the intestinal microbiota on health both in humans and other animals.

we observed a positive correlation between clostridiaceae and dietary protein content and protein digestibility and a negative correlation with faecal protein content.

differences between mean relative abundance of taxa between treatments were analysed by two-factor anova diet x time and single factor diet permutation anova using the rvaidememoire r package with 2000 permutations .samples which did not have complete data for the physical measurement metabolomics and 16s amplicon data were removed from the integrated analyses.

the use of methods such as cca provides a better overall picture of the data than two sets of p-values obtained from standard univariate analyses would otherwise provide as demonstrated previously  .resultsphysiological parametersdogs fed the kibble diet had a higher dry matter intake compared to dogs fed the meat diet .

dogs have no nutritional requirement for carbohydrates   and have evolved to thrive on a diet high in animal protein and fat  .

for each digestibility period a sub-sample of each diet and the faeces collected were frozen -20 c freeze-dried and ground before macronutrient analysis.after the digestibility period a fresh faecal sample was collected from each dog within 10 min of excretion and stored at -85 c to measure volatile fatty acids vfa and faecal microbial composition.laboratory analysesmacronutrient analysisdiets and faecal samples were analysed for percentage moisture using a convection oven at 105 c aoac 930.15 925.10 and percentage ash residue was determined using a furnace at 550 c aoac 942.05. crude protein and crude fat were determined using the leco total combustion method aoac 968.06 and acid hydrolysismojonnier extraction aoac 954.02 respectively.
