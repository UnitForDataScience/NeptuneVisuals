H. illucens candidate AMP genes wereidentified using an established reference set of insect-derived AMPs and lysozymes and additional filtering steps as previously described to avoid interpreting incomplete genes or allelic variants as further AMP genes .

Although the presence of a large bacterial load in the diet resulted in the significant upregulation of more than half of the identified candidate AMP genes larvae fed on the diet supple- mented with plant oil displayed the most robust overall induction of immunity-related genes both quantitatively and qualitatively .Diet dependent antibacterial activities in H. illucensStandard plate-growth inhibition assays were used for the relative quantification of the diet-dependent antimicrobial activity of H. illucens extracts against the bacterial species E. coli M. luteusP.

For both methods the thresholds for differ- entially expressed genes were a minimum two-fold change in expression and a false discovery rate FDR-corrected p-value of0.05.ResultsIdentification and relative expression levels of immunity- related genesThe screening of our H. illucens larval de novo transcriptome assembly revealed a diverse spectrum of AMP and lysozyme gene family members.

We identified a total of 53 genes encoding putative AMPs in the H. illucens transcriptome .

We also identified genes mediating the recognition of bacteria such as those encoding peptidoglycan recognition proteins PGRPs Gram-negative bac- teria binding proteins GNBPS and phenoloxidases .Principal component analysis of the H. illucens RNA-Seq data Fig.
