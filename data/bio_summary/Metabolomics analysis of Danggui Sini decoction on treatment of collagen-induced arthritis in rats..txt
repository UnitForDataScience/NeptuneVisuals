According to pathway analysis using identified metabolites and correlation construction taurine and hypotaurine metabolism gut microbiota metabolism pyruvate metabolism glycolysisgluconeogenesis the citrate cycle TCA cycle and lipid metabolism were recognized as being the most influenced metabolic pathways associated with RA.

Based on the visualized network constructed by the correlation coeffi- ciency -B metabolites such as taurine pyruvate succinate be- taine and acetone were found to exist with stronger correlations ac- cording to the different width of edges which further indicated that the taurine and hypotaurine metabolism gut microbiota metabolism pyr- uvate metabolism glycolysisgluconeogenesis TCA cycle and lipid metabolism were the most relevant pathways in RA.

However further study of DSD remains necessary to identify more potential active components or sy- nergistic actions that can contribute to the restoration of deviations in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism gut microbiota metabolism pyr- uvate metabolism glycolysisgluconeogenesis TCA cycle and lipid metabolism pathways.

As shown in  the elevated level of acetone was observed to decrease significantly following treatment with DSD and joints with a slighter degree of articular cartilage injuries were found in the DSD treated group than in the CIA model group -D which suggested that DSD might remedy the dysregulation of lipid metabolism corresponding to glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism induced in RA.Fig.

Degradation of lipid peroxides results in various products in CIA rats including a variety of carbonyl com- pounds such as acetone whose appearance was considered to be one of the biomarkers for dysfunctioned lipid metabolism induced in CIA rats .

However various toxicities such as Cushing's syndrome and diabetes have been associated with chronic administration of glucocorticoids which preclude their clinicalTable 1Biochemical parameters study of serum TNF-a in normal group NG model group MG dexamethasone group DG and DSD treated group TG x - S n  6.GroupsTNF-a pgmlNG31.648 - 2.630MG65.283 - 5.779DG35.767 - 7.152TG38.464 - 8.200Compared to model group  p  0.05.use at highly effective anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory doses.
