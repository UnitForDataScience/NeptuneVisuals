The CD patients with high colonic FPRL1 mRNA expression above five fold had significantly higher colonic COL1A2 mRNA expression than those with low colonic FPRL1 mRNA expression below five fold Fig.

Based on our evidence CSA13 may be an FPRL1 pathway activator.Fluorescent BODIPY-conjugated CSA13 binding to human colonic fibroblasts was not significantly affected by pretreatment of FPRL1 inhibitor WRW4 data not shown suggesting that CSA13 did not bind to FPRL1 receptor directly.

The high colonic FPRL1 mRNA expression was associated with increased immune cell infiltration as reflected by the elevated immune cell subscore Supplementary Table 2.CD patients with high colonic FPRL1 mRNA expression had an elevated relative risk of intesti- nal stricture.

To make CSA13 clinically applicable for this use we collaborated with Southwest Research Institute SWRI in Texas to combine the CSA13 with the Eudragit polymer.

To determine whether CSA13 can serve as an anti-fibrogenic drug we subcutaneously administered CSA13 to the 246-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid TNBS-exposed mice with colonic fibrosis Fig.

As cell culture model was not able to address how CSA13 inhibited fibroblast accumulation we believe that CSA13 may change the intestinal chemical environment leading to inhibition of fibroblast accumulation.Metabolomic analysis of fecal samples indicated that 19 out of 790 detected fecal metabolites were significantly influenced by both TNBS and oral CSA13-Eudragit Fig.

CSA13 unlike cathelicidin has a high safety margin for clinical application.Both routes of CSA13 administration demonstrated effective suppression of colitis and fibrosis.

However low concentration of CSA13 promoted cell migration without affecting cell viability of human colonic epithelial cells Supplementary Figure 3BC suggesting that CSA13 may ameliorate mucosal damages by promoting epithelial healing process.The 16 S sequencing of mouse fecal samples demonstrated that there was no significant change in the micro- bial environment during the fibrogenic phase of chronic TNBS colitis Fig.

Colitis developed at ten weeks after T-cell injection.Subcutaneous CSA13 treatment and microbiomemetabolomic analysis Mice were injected with CSA13 in saline 100 mL under the skin daily during the weeks 7-8.

We thank Prof. Paul Savage Brigham Young University Utah for providing pure CSA13 and BODIPY-labeled CSA13 and Dr. Xingguo Cheng Southwest Research Institute Texas for providing the CSA13-Eudragit.
