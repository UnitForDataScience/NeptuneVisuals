therefore using this system we explored the factors structuring the cutaneous microbial communities of amphibians in madagascar by investigating the following main questions 1 what are the primary drivers of microbial community structure and diversity and more specifically 2 what is the role of host phylogeny versus host ecology in shaping microbial community structure and diversitymaterials and methodsfield samplingfield sampling occurred during three field visits 14 august - 12 september 2013 4 january - 9 february 2014 and 5 november -15 december 2014. in total 1021 microbial samples 989 frog skin swabs 32 environmental samples were collected from10 locations 30 sites and 96 host species  and supplementary tables 1 2.amphibians were captured during day and night surveys with clean nitrile gloves and placed in sterile whirl-pakqr bags nasco fort atkinson wi united states.

microbial therapies have been proposed as a possible disease mitigation strategy for combating chytridiomycosis       and thus investigation of the basic ecological principles dictating skin microbial community structure on amphibians can inform the development and application of probiotic therapies.the extent to which host factors versus environmental factors structure skin microbial communities of amphibians as well as those of other hosts is not fully understood.

permanovas we found no further evidence for strong phylosymbiosis in frog skin microbial communities that is the similarity of amphibian skin microbial communities did not parallel host phylogeny  .

do amphibian skin microbiotas exhibit phylosymbiosis    or the role of host ecology in shaping amphibian skin microbial communities on a large scale.

this study is among the first to systematically explore amphibian skin microbiota on such a large geographical scale and to comparatively evaluate the roles of host phylogeny and host ecology.our results demonstrate that frogs skin microbiota differed from environmental substrates suggesting that the skin is a unique niche in which only selected taxa can colonize and persist.

these factors both represent site parameters suggesting that geographic location plays at least a small role in assembly of amphibian skin microbiota which has also been found in previous studies on amphibian skin microbiota    .

multiple locations are known to have over 100 co-occurring species which is ideal for investigating the primary drivers of microbial community assembly on amphibian skin on a large scale and teasing apart how symbiotic microbiota are influenced by environmental factors host-produced factors and host ecology.

for example amphibian species produce different suites of antimicrobial peptides     and alkaloids are synthesized or sequestered by particular amphibian species    .

uv radiation has been shown to affect soil and aquatic environmental microbial communities       and therefore may also influence the microbial communities on frog skin.
