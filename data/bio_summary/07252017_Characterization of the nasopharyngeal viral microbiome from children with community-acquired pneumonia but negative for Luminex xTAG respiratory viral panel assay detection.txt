almost all children encounter hpivs within the first few years after birth but immunity is incomplete and re-infections occur throughout life.23 two thirds of children are infected by hpiv3 in the first year of life mainly result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia.24 america an estimated 7600-48 000 children under the age of 1 and 8100-42 600 children aged 1-4 years are hospitalized with hpiv infection annually.25 bchnp43 matched hpiv 3. these sequences were used in the clc genomic workbench mapping analysis to determine the genome coverage and sequencing depth.

virome results for the pediatric respiratory tract have been reported by several groups.4-7 viromes between children with severe acute respiratory infection sari and those without sari and showed that members of the paramyxoviridae coronaviridae parvoviridae orthomyxoviridae pi- cornaviridae anelloviridae and adenoviridae families represented the most abundant families identified in the respiratory tracts of children with sari.

comprehen- sive and detailed metagenomic analyses of the respiratory tracts of children with cap but not carrying common respiratory viruses have not yet been reported.therefore in the present study clinical specimens from children with cap but negative with common respiratory pathogens were screened using the fda-cleared luminex xtag respiratory viral panel assay.

materials and methods study population and sample collectionwe randomly enrolled 368 paediatric patients 6 years of age mean age of child patients was 1.18 years at beijing children's hospital who met the child cap case definition.14 samples were collected from december 2014 to may 2015. this study was performed in strict accordance with the human subject protection guidance and was approved by the ethical review committee of beijing children's hospital.

7.39. infection of these pathogens may be the main reason for cap in these children especially for streptococcus.1819 rothiataxa are generally considered part of the normal flora but have been identified in individuals with cap.1920 have been detected in cases of aspiration pneumonia and empyemain children.21 mycoplasma these bacteria frequently colonize the nasopharynx in healthy children and are also common pathogens in the respiratory tract.181921 sequences found in this study are likely biased and not representative for these patients.

previous metagenomic analyses of respiratory samples from children with lower and upper respiratory tract infections have indicated that cases associated with bacterial infections accounted for a small proportion of sari cases22 more studies of the relationship between respiratory diseases and the diversity of bacteriophage are needed.the viral metagenomic analyses revealed a variety of viruses in the respiratory tracts of children with cap but negative for luminex xtag respiratory viral panel assay detection.

since its first identification wupyv sequences have been confirmed world- wide in respiratory samples from children with respiratory tract diseases with a prevalence ranging from 1.1 to 7.34-38 we reported that children with cap could also be carrying wupyv.

2017892098-2107. introduction community-acquired pneumonia cap is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide.

in addition several multiplex pcr assays and dna microarray testing methods have been proposed to screen dozens to hundreds of pathogens simultaneously.1-3 next-generation sequencing ngs technology has recently become a powerful tool for microbial community characterization and new pathogen identification because genetic materials are isolated directly from environmentalclinical samples and sequenced thus no cultur- ing cloning or a priori knowledge of what pathogens may be present is required.the application of ngs to the respiratory tracts of children is expected to provide comprehensive information about the respira- tory tract virome and allow the characterization of specific viruses.

the viral population in the respiratory tracts of children without sari was less diverse and mainly dominated by the anelloviridae family with only a small proportion of common epidemic respiratory viruses.8although the agent most commonly detected in cap is streptococcus pneumoniae9 allowed us to detect many respiratory viruses associated with cap mostly influenza virus respiratory syncytial virus parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus.10-12 have also been detected.101113 pathogens could cause cap remains to be investigated.

we provide a picture of the viral content and diversity in the respiratory tracts of children with cap but uninfected with common respiratory viruses.

ofthe remaining 151 negative specimens we randomly selected 50 specimens for the following viral microbiome analyses.table 1 clinical characteristics of the 50 children patients with cap in this study clinical characteristics of pediatric patients used in the metagenomic analysisfor the 50 specimens selected for viral microbiome analyses clinical information including the child's age and sex history of repeated infection in the respiratory tract and respiratory symptoms is presented in table the mean age of the pediatric patients was2.36 years and 33 66 were boys.

the latter data were valuable for further analyzing the cap- associated children respiratory virome.

after 7 days ofhospitalization in beijing children hospital and treatmentwith antibiotics cough-relieving and sputum-reducing cardiac and diuresis and anticoagulant all symptoms were improved and the patient was discharged.in addition to specimen bchnp43 we detected 3 18 72 28 29 80 and 23 reads related to hpiv3 in specimens 22 34 35 41 42 45 and 47 respectively.
