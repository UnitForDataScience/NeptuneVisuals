regional gradi- ents of epithelial microbial and dietary products therefore impact both the localization and activationdifferentiation state of immune cells at the barrier.by expressing various tight junction proteins mononuclear phagocytic macrophagesdcs can send dendrites through the epithelial monolayer to sample the intestinal lumen while replac- ing tight junctions between epithelial cells thus preserving the integrity of the epithelial barrier .

we try to provide an integra- tive view on concerted mechanisms of epithelial and mesen- chymal communication with immune cells and microorganisms that support tissue function or are subverted to propagate path- ological inflammation.know thy neighbors--immune cell interaction with the gut stroma and epitheliumimmune cell function is greatly dependent on local cues derived from mesenchymal and epithelial cells that define the localiza- tion activation state immune phenotype and survival of tissue hematopoietic cells.

alveolar epithelial cellfigure 2. subversion of epithelial homeostatic immune modules in barrier pathology homeostatic production of epithelial cytokines is imperative to control the type and intensity of inflammatory responses at mucosal barrier sites.

induction of tg-2 signaling in alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts following lung injury leads to epithelial il-6 production and activation of inflammatory responsesfigure 3. mesenchymal cells at the crossroads of reparative and pathological inflammation mesenchymal mechanisms controlling immunity in the skin and intestine include direct bactericidal activity and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes as well as homeostatic regulation of epithelial inflammatory mediators and immune cell activation top right.

many of these modules either activate or are activated by the major epithelial survival programs orchestrated by transducer and acti- vator of transcription 3 stat3 and nuclear factor kb nf-kb .multiple independent signals converge on epithelial stat3 activation to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis collec- tively leading to containment of immune cell inflammatory profile.

these homeostatic modules can however pro-mote tissue pathology when exacerbated in response to injury or infection .the mesenchymal barrier in regulation of immune homeostasisthe connective tissue underlying the epithelial barrier is composed of mesenchymal cells and extracellular matrix ecm that provide the structural support for epithelial vascular lymphatic and neuronal organization as well as serves as a conduit for migration of immune cells.

these studies depict a th2-propagating cycle involving epithelial il-33 alarmin production that induces an il-13-spdef feedforward loop driving goblet cell hyperreactiv- ity and th2 inflammation in the airways .epithelial immune modules in the airwaysin analogy to the intestinal epithelium immune homeostasis in the airways is dependent on the ability of epithelial cells to sense environmental signals and produce an immunomodulatoryoutput.

in concert with the hematopoietic immune system recent studies demon- strate the central role of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in regulating the shape and intensity of localized immune re- sponses highlighting the contribution of these cells to immune homeostasis and inflammation.

in summary constitutive and inducible epithelial immune modules initiate protective immune responses by sensing tissue damage microorganisms and their products inhaled particulates or aller- gens and immune cell-derived signals.

this nonimmune cell regulationof immune responses is pertinent to all phases of the inflamma- tory process from promoting microbial symbiosis and immune homeostasis to immune cell activation recruitment and sup- pression in case of pathogenic infection or injury.epithelial and mesenchymal cells line most organ surfaces and form barriers that enable physical separation and functional communication between the environment and the immune sys- tem.

taken together these studies illustrate that local immune cell interactions with epithe- lial and stromal cells shape the homeostatic functions of the in- testinal barrier by instructing regional specificity in immune cell distribution and phenotype.epithelial immune modules controlling intestinal homeostasisepithelial cells have the capacity to function as immune rheo- stats by employing sensory mechanisms that induce an immu- nomodulatory output.

stat3 activation by il-22 is important for epithelial restitution the process whereby epithelial cells migrate to reseal breached epithelial surfaces and directly promotes intestinal stem cell regeneration following injury  .

regional epithelial cytokine produc- tion may further regulate effector immune subsets as localized production of il-33 by epithelial cells in the proximal small intes- tine confers a regulatory phenotype with immunosuppressive properties on st2 th17 cells .

various epithelial immune mod- ules are integrated by epithelial survival pathways enabling the coupling of physical and functional barrier functions in controlling homeostatic symbiosis in the intestine .immune regulation of goblet cells and the mucus layer at mucosal barrier sites goblet cells and surface secretory cells generate protective gel mucus layers by luminal secretion of mucin glycoproteins forming a mesh of elongated polymers.goblet cell abundance in the gut is increased toward the distal colon in concert with a parallel gradient of increased microbial load and expansion of the mucus layer.

it is likely that research in the upcoming years will yield a more comprehensive understanding of homeostatic and in- flammatory immune modules activated in specialized differenti- ated epithelial populations at barrier sites together with the associated question of how inflammation regulates epithelial dif- ferentiation and wound healing.
