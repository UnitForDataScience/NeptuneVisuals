Regional gradi- ents of epithelial microbial and dietary products therefore impact both the localization and activationdifferentiation state of immune cells at the barrier.By expressing various tight junction proteins mononuclear phagocytic macrophagesDCs can send dendrites through the epithelial monolayer to sample the intestinal lumen while replac- ing tight junctions between epithelial cells thus preserving the integrity of the epithelial barrier .

We try to provide an integra- tive view on concerted mechanisms of epithelial and mesen- chymal communication with immune cells and microorganisms that support tissue function or are subverted to propagate path- ological inflammation.Know Thy Neighbors--Immune Cell Interaction with the Gut Stroma and EpitheliumImmune cell function is greatly dependent on local cues derived from mesenchymal and epithelial cells that define the localiza- tion activation state immune phenotype and survival of tissue hematopoietic cells.

Many of these modules either activate or are activated by the major epithelial survival programs orchestrated by transducer and acti- vator of transcription 3 STAT3 and nuclear factor kB NF-kB .Multiple independent signals converge on epithelial STAT3 activation to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis collec- tively leading to containment of immune cell inflammatory profile.

In concert with the hematopoietic immune system recent studies demon- strate the central role of epithelial and mesenchymal cells in regulating the shape and intensity of localized immune re- sponses highlighting the contribution of these cells to immune homeostasis and inflammation.

In summary constitutive and inducible epithelial immune modules initiate protective immune responses by sensing tissue damage microorganisms and their products inhaled particulates or aller- gens and immune cell-derived signals.

This nonimmune cell regulationof immune responses is pertinent to all phases of the inflamma- tory process from promoting microbial symbiosis and immune homeostasis to immune cell activation recruitment and sup- pression in case of pathogenic infection or injury.Epithelial and mesenchymal cells line most organ surfaces and form barriers that enable physical separation and functional communication between the environment and the immune sys- tem.

STAT3 activation by IL-22 is important for epithelial restitution the process whereby epithelial cells migrate to reseal breached epithelial surfaces and directly promotes intestinal stem cell regeneration following injury  .

Regional epithelial cytokine produc- tion may further regulate effector immune subsets as localized production of IL-33 by epithelial cells in the proximal small intes- tine confers a regulatory phenotype with immunosuppressive properties on ST2 Th17 cells .

Various epithelial immune mod- ules are integrated by epithelial survival pathways enabling the coupling of physical and functional barrier functions in controlling homeostatic symbiosis in the intestine .Immune Regulation of Goblet Cells and the Mucus Layer At mucosal barrier sites goblet cells and surface secretory cells generate protective gel mucus layers by luminal secretion of mucin glycoproteins forming a mesh of elongated polymers.Goblet cell abundance in the gut is increased toward the distal colon in concert with a parallel gradient of increased microbial load and expansion of the mucus layer.

These studies depict a Th2-propagating cycle involving epithelial IL-33 alarmin production that induces an IL-13-SPDEF feedforward loop driving goblet cell hyperreactiv- ity and Th2 inflammation in the airways .Epithelial Immune Modules in the AirwaysIn analogy to the intestinal epithelium immune homeostasis in the airways is dependent on the ability of epithelial cells to sense environmental signals and produce an immunomodulatoryoutput.
