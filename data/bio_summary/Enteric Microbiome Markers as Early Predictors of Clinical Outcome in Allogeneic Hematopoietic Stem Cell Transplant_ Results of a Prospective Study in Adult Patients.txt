in this study we longitudinally investigated the enteric micro-biome profiles of patients undergoing allo-hsct in an effort to identify possible early pretransplant microbiome-based mark- ers starting from the beginning of the conditioning regimen.methodsstudy setting and designwe conducted a prospective observational study of the enteric microbiome by next-generation sequencing ngs in 96 con- secutive patients receiving an allo-hsct at the hematology and bone marrow transplant unit of ospedale san raffaele milan italy from october 2014 to april 2016. all details of the cohort are reported in .

all patients were closely monitored and treated for fever in the setting of neutropenia according to insti- tutional guidelines in particular all patients were administered levofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as prophylaxis and piperacillin-tazobactam as firstline empirical treatment.sample processing and sequencingstool samples were collected at 3 time points at the begin- ning of the pretransplantation conditioning regimen usually 6 days before transplant t0 10 days following transplant t1 in correspondence with the period of full aplasia and thef41 42.70m55 57.30complete remission43 44.80active disease51 53.12not applicable2 2.08gvhd prophylaxis 1rapamycin78 81.25cyclosporine18 18.75previous infectious episodesyes52 54.17no44 45.83table 1. continuedclinical variablesno.

microbiome markers can be useful in the very early identification of patients at risk for major transplant-related complications offering new tools for individualized preemptive or therapeutic strategies to improve allo-hsct outcomes.keywords.

as an example the differ- ent overall survival rates at 3 years were 36 60 and 67 in transplanted patients featuring low intermediate and high microbiome diversity at engraftment respectively .
