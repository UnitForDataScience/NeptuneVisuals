No sig- nificant risk factors were identified for microbiologically con- firmed enteric sepsis by gram-positive GP pathogens.Analogously no significant clinical or microbiome variables were identified in the 21 HSCT recipients 22.82 who devel- oped clinically defined severe sepsis or septic shock.At T0Microbiome MarkersShannon index 4 at T0 Enterobacteriaceae 5 at T0 Lachnospiraceae 10 at T0 Ruminococcaceae 10 at T0Risk of Graft-vs-Host DiseaseAcute GvHD developed in 23 HSCT recipients 25.27 within 30 days early acute GvHD and in 46 50.55 within 100 daysAt T1Shannon index 1.3 at T1 Staphylococcaceae 40 at T1Abbreviations T0 the day of the initiation of the pretransplantation conditioning regimen approximately 6 days before the transplant T1 10 days following transplant.Table 4.

Further details regarding GvHD grade and organ site are reported in the Supplementary Methods.In the risk stratification for early acute GvHD no sig- nificant variables were identified at T0.

Moreover 10 Lachnospiraceae at T0 was the only significant factor for increased risk of overall mortality including death from both infectious and noninfectious causes.Finally a low bacterial alpha-diversity Shannon index  1.3 at T1 was the only variable significantly correlating with an increased risk of GvHD within 30 days.Conclusions.

Fecal samples were collected at all time points T0 T1 and T2 in 54 54 patients whereas adequate samples were available at T0 and T1 in 18 18 patients at T0 and T2 in 14 14 patients and only at T0 in 10 10 patients.

However no significant associations were observed with late acute GvHD GvHD severity and GvHD organ localization.Risk of RelapseDuring the study period relapse was observed in 30 31.25 patients.

Modifications of the enteric microbiome have also been correlated to different risk of GvHD in both mouse models and transplanted patients .

have been associated to higher risk of GvHD both in children and adults   .

No significant microbiome cutoffs were identified at T2 data not shown The microbiome cutoffs were then used in univariate and multivariate regression analyses together with the other clinical variables for risk stratification of trans- plant-related infectious and noninfectious complications.The significant microbiome cutoffs and clinical variables associated with specific clinical outcomes emerging from the univariate analysis are reported in for microbiologically confirmed sepsis relapse of the underlying disease and GvHD and in Supplementary Table 7 for death.

Current immune suppression strategies are only partially effective at preventing GvHD and increase the risk of infections and disease recurrence.
