The daily consumption of P. marcusii DB11 and B. cereus G19 considerably increased the number of generalists within the ecological networks and it made them more stable which suggested that P. marcusii DB11 and B. cereus G19 may promote the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota in sea cucumber.

However the effects of these probiotics and an antibiotic on ecological networks within intestinal microbiota have not been reported previously.To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report the effects of probiotics P. marcusii DB11 andcereus G19 and an antibiotics florfenicol on the intestinal microbiota homeostasis in aquatic animals by assessing modularity species-species interactions and their topological roles.

Our results showed that intestinal microbiota homeostasis can be improved by the daily consumption of B. cereus G19 and P. marcusii DB11 which affect intestinal microbiota homeostasis through modulation of ecological network by improving modularity enhancing species-species interactions and increasing the number of gener- alists rather than fundamentally changing its composition.

Therefore our results suggest that the dominant genera in intestinal microbial community perform important roles in the ecological network.In contrast the use of antibiotics is considered the strongest and most common cause of disturbance of the intestinal microbiota and here we showed that the dietary supplementation with florfenicol considerably decreased the proportion of Flavobacteriia and caused the extinction of connectors and module hubs in the ecological network.

As shown here each treatment had its unique ecological network model with charac- teristic modules but the composition of ecological networks was shown to be similar to intestinal microflora which indicates that the dominant microflora plays an important role in the ecological network.

The ecological network of the intestinal microbiota in sea cucumber.

Dietary supplementation with B. cereus G19 P. marcusii DB11 and florfenicol significantly affected the ecological network within the intestinal microbiota observed in terms of the average path distance GD average clustering coefficient avgCC and modularity.

Both weighted and unweighted UniFrac analysis showed that the bacterial communities in the PM G19 and FL group had different characteristic bacterial communities compared to Control group indicating great regulating effects of P. marcusii DB11 B. cereus G19 and florfenicol on the intestinal microbiota structure in sea cucumber.Modularity analysis.

In this study the administration of P. marcusii DB11 PM B. cereus G19 G19 and florfenicol FL was shown to affect intestinal microbial community with an obvious decrease in the percentage of Flavobacteriia classified as Flavobacteriaceae in this study in sea cucumber intestines while core microbiota remained the same as in the Control group.

Currently there is no systematic study addressing the effects of antibiotics or probiotics on intes- tinal microbiota homeostasis and no standard for the evaluation of intestinal microbiota homeostasis has been developed.Sea cucumber represent one of the most economically important holothurian species in China.
