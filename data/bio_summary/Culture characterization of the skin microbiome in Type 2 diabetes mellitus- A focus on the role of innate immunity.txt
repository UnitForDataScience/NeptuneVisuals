one study found the constituent colonizers of the cutaneous microbiome in patients with diabetes to differ significantly from those without  but the study did not examine the cutaneous niche of the feet.the current study aimed at determining the differencesbetween the cutaneous microbial flora of patients with t2dm and those without and thus evaluate for cutaneous microbiome dysbiosis in diabetes.

higher sweat glucose concentrations and an altered cutaneous thermoregulatory function arising as sequelae of neuropathy are thought to promote higher micro- bial diversity in t2dm .second s. epidermidis which represented the largest pro- portion 50 of all staphylococcus species isolated had a sig- nificantly higher prevalence among patients with t2dm 77.5 as opposed to 53.7 among controls p  0.02. these results are consistent with a recent study culture-based study done on the axillary skin niche .

this change was not statistically significant p 0.17. s. epidermidis and s. aureus represented large proportions of all staphylococcal colonies isolated 53.54 and 31.31 respec- tively n  99. s. epidermidis was isolated from 65.4 of all samples n  81 with a higher prevalence among cases 31 77.5 as opposed to 22 53.7 among controls producing a statistically significant difference in proportions of 0.24 p  0.02. s. aureus was isolated from 38.2 of all samples n  81 with a higher prevalence among cases 18 45 as opposed 13 31.7 among controls.

the regression model determined a significant association between t2dm status and heavy colonization by s. epidermidis or - 5.40 p  0.02. also agricultural workers were significantly more likely to have heavy colonization by s. epidermidis or - 3.75 p  0.02. other predictor variables did not show significant association with heavy col- onization by any of the isolated microbes.conclusions our findings support the existence of cutaneous microbiome dysbiosis among patients with t2dm.

as opposed to controls patients with t2dm were5.40 times more likely to have heavy colonization by s. epider- midis p  0.01. also patients having agricultural occupations were 3.75 times more likely to have heavy colonization by s. epidermidis p  0.02.similar logistic regression models were constructed to ascertain the likelihood of heavy colonization by other microbes.

a recent study has found patients with t2dm to have a marked reduction in cutaneous lcs leading to reduced skin infiltration of immune cells  another factor that could contribute to dysbiosis in these patients.

this finding was one of the factors proposed to explain the increased risk of ssti seen in this patient group .in addition bacillus species aerobic spore-bearers had aconflicts of interestthe authors declare and certify that they have no financial and non-financial interest.statistically significant lower prevalence among cases 15 as opposed to 34.1 among controls p  0.046. these results are dissimilar to a recent culture-based study done on the axillary skin niche that found no differences in the preva- lences of this species among t2dm patients and healthy con- trols .

all statistical analyses were two-tailed set at a confidence interval of 95 with a p-value of less than0.05 considered statistically significant.-0.13 to 0.66 t 59.4  1.33 p  0.19. however these differ- ences were not statistically significant.3.2.2.prevalence of cutaneous microbesthe prevalence of cutaneous microbes among cases and con- trols are summarized in .two hundred and twenty microbial colonies were isolated from all samples n  81.

among other factors thought to affect skin flora  in our study only age differed significantly between subject groups.
