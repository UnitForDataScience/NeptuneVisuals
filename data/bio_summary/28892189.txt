The color indicates the fold change of the abundance of each taxon orange 14 abundance is up green 14 abundance is down.experiments whereas Dinophyta and Archaeplastida had higher abundances in chironomid than in amphipod experiments Figure 5E.Thresholds of spiked Cu to microbiota in sedimentsThe relative abundance of 51 microbiota 22 prokaryotes and 29 eukaryotes was decreased by spiked Cu in both amphipod and chironomid experiments.

The weighted UniFrac distance of eukaryotes between amphipod and chironomid experiments increased in high-spiked Cu treatments which further indicated that experimental animalscould affect the response of microeukaryotes to spiked Cu.In the present study a large number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa across a broad range of groups in sediments were affected by the spiked Cu.

In chironomid experiments the weighted UniFrac distances of prokaryotic communities were changed significantly when spiked Cu was 250 mgkg and the weighted UniFrac distance of eukaryotic communities was changed significantly when spiked Cu was 500 mgkg Table 1.In addition alpha-diversity measures Chao1 index were significantly different among the spiked-Cu treatments Figure 3CD.

was positively correlated with spiked Cu.Twenty-two out of 932 prokaryotic taxa from 4 phyla Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Chloroflexi and Cyanobacte- ria were negatively correlated with increased concentrations of spiked Cu in both amphipod and chironomid experimentsFIGURE 2 Composition of microbial communities in sediments from ecotoxicity test using amphipods or chironomids.FIGURE 3 Structures and diversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in spiked-Cu sediments.

This threshold means that at least 75 of sensitive microorganisms were affected by the spiked Cu in sediment.DISCUSSIONThe effects of spiked Cu on the composition of benthic microeukaryotic and prokaryotic communities in sediment were assessed by DNA metabarcoding in laboratory-based sedimentFIGURE 5 Differences in microbiota between amphipod and chironomid experiments.

Ten fungal taxa Chytridiomycetes were negatively associated with spiked Cu and 2 fungal taxa Penicillium and Leotiomycetes were positively associated with spiked Cu.

The spiked sediment was taken at the start and end of the experiment for chemical analysis of total Cu by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy 20.

The measured concentrations did not differ from the nominal spiked concentrations by more than 10.Sediment toxicity bioassaysSediment toxicity experiments were performed following the procedures described in Gagliardi et al.

The relationship between spiked Cu and taxon abundance was analyzed by Pearson correlation and highly correlated taxa were determined by rho  0.5 and p  0.05.

The emergence time of chironomids is the time from the second-instar larvae being added at the start of the experiment to the emergence of adults.The threshold of spiked Cu to microbiota was determined by the lower quartiles of the EC10 values of all sensitive taxa.
