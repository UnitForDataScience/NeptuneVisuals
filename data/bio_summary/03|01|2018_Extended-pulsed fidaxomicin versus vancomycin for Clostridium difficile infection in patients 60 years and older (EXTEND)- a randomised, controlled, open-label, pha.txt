One death in the vancomycin arm was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.Interpretation Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin was superior to standard-dose vancomycin for sustained cure of C difficile infection and to our knowledge extended-pulsed fidaxomicin recurrence rates in this study are the lowest observed in a randomised clinical trial of antibiotic treatment for C difficile infection.Funding Astellas Pharma Inc.of Cologne Clinical Trials Centre Cologne ZKS Koln Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases University of Cologne Cologne Germany Prof O A Cornely MD and Department I of Internal Medicine University Hospital of Cologne and German Centre for Infection Research Partner Site Bonn-Cologne CologneGermanyM J G T Vehreschild MDIntroductionClostridium difficile is the leading cause of infectious health-care-associated diarrhoea in developed countries.1 C difficile infection is particularly serious in older individuals in whom it is associated with severe infection and complications including recurrence and death.2-4Prevention of recurrence of C difficile infection has been identified as a key unmet need.5 Recurrence is estimated to occur in up to 25 of patients treated with metronidazole or vancomycin56 is associated with a substantial health-care burden6 and is a particular problem in high-risk individuals.7 Previous administration of antimicrobials typically results in disruption of the colonic microbiota preceding C difficilecolonisation.89 Recurrence is thought to be a consequence of delayed recovery of this previously disrupted microbiota during C difficile infection therapy.8 Although oral vancomycin is the standard of care for severe C difficile infection3 this drug has a substantial deleterious effect on the intestinal bacterial microbiota.1011 The narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxo- micin showed efficacy and tolerability for treatment of C difficile infection when administered as a standard regimen 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days and is non-inferior to standard vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days in achieving initial clinical cure.1213 Fidaxomicin is better able to preserve the gut microbiota than is vancomycin10 which might explainResearch in context Evidence before this studyMetronidazole and vancomycin have been the mainstays of Clostridium difficile infection treatment for several decades with vancomycin efficacy superior to that of metronidazole.We searched PubMed for articles published in any language up to March 6 2017 using the terms Clostridium difficile infection and recurrence.

Time to C difficile infection recurrence was longer after the end of treatment with extended-pulsed fidaxomicin than with vancomycin p00001 appendix.The median time from start of treatment to resolution of diarrhoea appeared to favour vancomycin censored at day 10 end of treatment rather than extended-pulsed fidaxomicin censored at day 25 end of treatment although groups did not differ in the modified full analysis set table 2 or the per-protocol set table 3.Most patients 127 of 137 extended-pulsed fidaxomicin patients and 114 of 147 vancomycin patients of those who responded at test of cure did not show symptoms of diarrhoea after day 10 and remained in the analysis until they discontinued or completed the study after which they were censored.

Secondary endpoints were sustained clinical cure of C difficile infection at days 40 55 and90 for both treatment groups clinical response of C difficile infection at day 12 and at 2 days after end of treatment day 12 or day 27 for both vancomycin and extended-pulsed fidaxomicin rate of relapse at day 90 as determined by whole genome sequencing of C difficile isolates from patients who had documented recurrence after test of cure time to resolution of diarrhoea from the start of treatment sustained to test of cure ie time of the last unformed bowel movement the day before the first of two consecutive days of 3 unformed bowel movements50 reduction in number of stools or 75 reduction in liquid stool volume recurrence of C difficile infection at days 40 55 and 90 time to C difficile infection recurrence after end of treatment for patients with clinical response disease-free survival after day10 for patients with clinical response incidence of mortality and severity of adverse events at day 90 health- related quality of life up to day 55 and readmission andent4 lost to follow-up6 withdrawal by patient 2 physician decision1 non-compliance with study drug ent4 withdrawal by patient 1 other179 included in modified full analysis set 125 included in per-protocol set22 microbiologically evaluable9 samples for paired microbiome analysis Shannon index9 samples for paired initialrecurrence samples for whole genome sequencingFigure 1 Trial profilelength of hospital stay at day 90.

Both treatment groups were similar regarding baseline characteristics including age C difficile infection severity number of previous C difficile infection occurrences and number of unformed bowel movements in the 24 h before randomisation table 1.For the primary efficacy endpoint 124 70 of 177 patients in the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin group had sustained clinical cure at 30 days after end of treatment compared with 106 59 of 179 patients who received vancomycin OR 162 95 CI 104 -254 p0030 Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test primary analysis and p0035 multivariate analysis figure 2 table 2.Results for the primary endpoint in the per-protocol set were similar to those in the modified full analysis set with sustained clinical cure at 30 days after end of treatment higher in patients who received extended-pulsed fidaxomicin compared with those who received vancomycin p0001 table 3.

Percentage increase or decrease for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin is shown above each pair of bars.For patients who had clinical response to treatment at test of cure visit day 12 for vancomycin and day 27 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin fewer patients in the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin than in the vancomycin arm had recurrence of C difficile infection at all three timepoints day 40 day 55 and day 90 tables 2 3 figure 2.

Available in-vitro and clinical evidence suggests that the sparing effect of fidaxomicin on the gut microbiota might contribute to observed treatment outcomes.Correspondence toProf Benoit Guery Infectious Diseases Service Department of Medicine University Hospital and University of Lausanne 1011 Lausanne Switzerland See Online for appendixthe well-documented reduced C difficile infection recurrence about 15 and improved sustained clinical cure about 75 with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin about 27 for C difficile infection recurrence and 64 for sustained clinical cure.1213Evidence from a validated in-vitro human gut model suggests that an extended-pulsed fidaxomicin regimen which extends 20 fidaxomicin doses over a longer time period after initial daily dosing might allow persistence of fidaxomicin at above inhibitory concentrations thus prolonging suppression of C difficile and simultaneously facilitating microbiota recovery.14 Consequently extended-pulsed fidaxomicin is hypothesised to show equivalent efficacy to vancomycin in resolving C difficile infection.

At 30 days after end of treatment day 55 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and day 40 for vancomycin recurrence had occurred in seven 4 patients receiving extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and 30 17 patients receiving vancomycin.

More patients in the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin arm than in the vancomycin arm achieved the secondary efficacy endpoint of sustained clinical cure at days 40 55 and 90 in the modified full analysis set table 2 figure 2 and per- protocol set table 3.At day 12 and day 27 2 days after end of treatment the clinical response to treatment did not differ between the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and vancomycin study arms for the modified full analysis set table 2 figure 2 and the per-protocol set table 3.Figure 2 Selected clinical outcomesBars show 95 CI.

The drug-related serious adverse events in the vancomycin arm were one event each of cardiac failure ileus leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug treatment failure Clostridium spp infection Klebsiella spp infection sepsis somnolence and eczema.65 18 deaths occurred during the study with 29 16 in the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin arm and 36 20 in the vancomycin arm appendix.

Information was collected if patients died were readmitted to hospital or if they received treatment or diagnostic procedures as either an inpatient or outpatient resource utilisation.OutcomesThe primary efficacy endpoint was sustained clinical cure of C difficile infection at 30 days after end of treatment day 40 for vancomycin and day 55 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin.
