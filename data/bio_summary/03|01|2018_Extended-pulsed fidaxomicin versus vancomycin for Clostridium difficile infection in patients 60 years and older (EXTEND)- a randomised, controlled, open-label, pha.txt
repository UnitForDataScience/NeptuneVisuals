one death in the vancomycin arm was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.interpretation extended-pulsed fidaxomicin was superior to standard-dose vancomycin for sustained cure of c difficile infection and to our knowledge extended-pulsed fidaxomicin recurrence rates in this study are the lowest observed in a randomised clinical trial of antibiotic treatment for c difficile infection.funding astellas pharma inc.of cologne clinical trials centre cologne zks koln cologne excellence cluster on cellular stress responses in aging-associated diseases university of cologne cologne germany prof o a cornely md and department i of internal medicine university hospital of cologne and german centre for infection research partner site bonn-cologne colognegermanym j g t vehreschild mdintroductionclostridium difficile is the leading cause of infectious health-care-associated diarrhoea in developed countries.1 c difficile infection is particularly serious in older individuals in whom it is associated with severe infection and complications including recurrence and death.2-4prevention of recurrence of c difficile infection has been identified as a key unmet need.5 recurrence is estimated to occur in up to 25 of patients treated with metronidazole or vancomycin56 is associated with a substantial health-care burden6 and is a particular problem in high-risk individuals.7 previous administration of antimicrobials typically results in disruption of the colonic microbiota preceding c difficilecolonisation.89 recurrence is thought to be a consequence of delayed recovery of this previously disrupted microbiota during c difficile infection therapy.8 although oral vancomycin is the standard of care for severe c difficile infection3 this drug has a substantial deleterious effect on the intestinal bacterial microbiota.1011 the narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxo- micin showed efficacy and tolerability for treatment of c difficile infection when administered as a standard regimen 200 mg orally twice daily for 10 days and is non-inferior to standard vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 days in achieving initial clinical cure.1213 fidaxomicin is better able to preserve the gut microbiota than is vancomycin10 which might explainresearch in context evidence before this studymetronidazole and vancomycin have been the mainstays of clostridium difficile infection treatment for several decades with vancomycin efficacy superior to that of metronidazole.we searched pubmed for articles published in any language up to march 6 2017 using the terms clostridium difficile infection and recurrence.

secondary endpoints were sustained clinical cure of c difficile infection at days 40 55 and90 for both treatment groups clinical response of c difficile infection at day 12 and at 2 days after end of treatment day 12 or day 27 for both vancomycin and extended-pulsed fidaxomicin rate of relapse at day 90 as determined by whole genome sequencing of c difficile isolates from patients who had documented recurrence after test of cure time to resolution of diarrhoea from the start of treatment sustained to test of cure ie time of the last unformed bowel movement the day before the first of two consecutive days of 3 unformed bowel movements50 reduction in number of stools or 75 reduction in liquid stool volume recurrence of c difficile infection at days 40 55 and 90 time to c difficile infection recurrence after end of treatment for patients with clinical response disease-free survival after day10 for patients with clinical response incidence of mortality and severity of adverse events at day 90 health- related quality of life up to day 55 and readmission andent4 lost to follow-up6 withdrawal by patient 2 physician decision1 non-compliance with study drug ent4 withdrawal by patient 1 other179 included in modified full analysis set 125 included in per-protocol set22 microbiologically evaluable9 samples for paired microbiome analysis shannon index9 samples for paired initialrecurrence samples for whole genome sequencingfigure 1 trial profilelength of hospital stay at day 90. at the time of writing data were not available on health-related quality of life readmission or length of stay and these data will be reported separately.

percentage increase or decrease for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin is shown above each pair of bars.for patients who had clinical response to treatment at test of cure visit day 12 for vancomycin and day 27 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin fewer patients in the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin than in the vancomycin arm had recurrence of c difficile infection at all three timepoints day 40 day 55 and day 90 tables 2 3 figure 2. at 30 days after end of treatment day 55 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and day 40 for vancomycin recurrence had occurred in seven 4 patients receiving extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and 30 17 patients receiving vancomycin.

time to c difficile infection recurrence was longer after the end of treatment with extended-pulsed fidaxomicin than with vancomycin p00001 appendix.the median time from start of treatment to resolution of diarrhoea appeared to favour vancomycin censored at day 10 end of treatment rather than extended-pulsed fidaxomicin censored at day 25 end of treatment although groups did not differ in the modified full analysis set table 2 or the per-protocol set table 3.most patients 127 of 137 extended-pulsed fidaxomicin patients and 114 of 147 vancomycin patients of those who responded at test of cure did not show symptoms of diarrhoea after day 10 and remained in the analysis until they discontinued or completed the study after which they were censored.

available in-vitro and clinical evidence suggests that the sparing effect of fidaxomicin on the gut microbiota might contribute to observed treatment outcomes.correspondence toprof benoit guery infectious diseases service department of medicine university hospital and university of lausanne 1011 lausanne switzerland see online for appendixthe well-documented reduced c difficile infection recurrence about 15 and improved sustained clinical cure about 75 with fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin about 27 for c difficile infection recurrence and 64 for sustained clinical cure.1213evidence from a validated in-vitro human gut model suggests that an extended-pulsed fidaxomicin regimen which extends 20 fidaxomicin doses over a longer time period after initial daily dosing might allow persistence of fidaxomicin at above inhibitory concentrations thus prolonging suppression of c difficile and simultaneously facilitating microbiota recovery.14 consequently extended-pulsed fidaxomicin is hypothesised to show equivalent efficacy to vancomycin in resolving c difficile infection.

362 patients received at least one dose of study medication 181 received extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and 181 received vancomycin and were included in the safety analysis figure 1. two patients randomised to extended- pulsed fidaxomicin did not have clinically confirmed c difficile and did not receive treatment.two patients in the vancomycin group and four in the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin group did not have confirmed c difficile infection so were excluded from the modified full analysis set.

adverse events of mild intensity were defined as those that did not disrupt normal daily activities.statistical analysisto detect a difference between extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and vancomycin in relation to the primary endpoint a maximum sample size of 346 patients 173 per arm provided approximately 90 power at a two-sided overall significance level of 005. assumptions were based on sustained clinical cure rates of 85 for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin and 70 for vancomycin corresponding to anodds ratio or of 2431213 accounting for an interim analysis conducted after about 55 of patients with confirmed c difficile infection had completed the primary endpoint assessment.

124 70 of 177 patients in the modified full analysis set receiving extended-pulsed fidaxomicin achieved sustained clinical cure 30 days after end of treatment compared with 106 59 of 179 patients receiving vancomycin difference 11 95 ci 10-207 p0030 odds ratio 162 95 ci 104-254. incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events did not differ between extended-pulsed fidaxomicin 121 67 of 181 and vancomycin 128 71 of 181 treatment arms.

hospitalised patients were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 60 years and older with clinically confirmed c difficile infection defined by either more than three unformed bowel movements or at least 200 ml unformed stool for patients with rectal collection devices in the 24 h before randomisation in addition to presence of c difficile toxin a or b in stool within 48 h of randomisation by local laboratory c difficile infection toxin test.

additionally as c difficile infection recurrence has high cost implications avoidance of recurrence is considered economically important particularly in high-risk patients.19 for every seven patients treated with fidaxomicin an estimated one hospital readmission for c difficile infection is prevented compared with patients treated with vancomycin.20 in our study of an older patient population the number needed to treat withextended-pulsed fidaxomicin is estimated at 66 derived from the absolute difference in recurrence rate with vancomycin at a similar timepoint of 40 days.

patients were randomly assigned 11 using an interactive web response system to receive extended-pulsed fidaxomicin 200 mg oral tablets twice daily on days 1-5 then once daily on alternate days on days 7-25 or vancomycin 125 mg oral capsules four times daily on days 1-10 stratified by baseline c difficile infection severity cancer presence age 75 years vs 75 years and number of previous c difficile infection occurrences.

ptreatment difference 191 87-294 p00011.table 3 clinical outcomes for the per-protocol setdiscussionin this multicentre randomised c difficile infection study testing the concept of pulsed dosing as a microbiota- sparing strategy extended-pulsed fidaxomicin was superior to standard-dose vancomycin for the primary endpoint of sustained clinical cure of c difficile infection in patients aged 60 years and older.

this drug regimen might also have the potential to reduce c difficile infection recurrence beyond that documented for standard fidaxomicin and increase sustained clinical cure.we aimed to assess clinical outcomes of extended-pulsed fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin with a primary efficacy endpoint of sustained clinicalcure of c difficile infection 30 days after the end of treatment in a microbiota-sparing strategy.methodsstudy design and patientswe did a phase 3b4 randomised controlled parallel superiority open-label trial at 86 hospitals in 21 european countries.

all other cases were deemed treatment failures for sustained clinical cure.for patients with clinical response at test of cure recurrence of c difficile infection was defined as return of diarrhoea after test of cure to an extent according to the frequency of unformed bowel movements that was greater than the frequency recorded on day 10 for the vancomycin arm or day 25 for the extended-pulsed fidaxomicin arm confirmed by a local c difficile infectiontest positive for toxin a or b and requiring further therapy.
