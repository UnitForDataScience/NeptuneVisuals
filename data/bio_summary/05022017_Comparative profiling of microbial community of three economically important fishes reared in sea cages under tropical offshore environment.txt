The plot projected that cobia and pompano got clustered together whereas milkfish remained at a fair distance from the other two species.Statistical analysis of similarity and dissimilarity measuresSimilarity index of abundance in microbiota among studied cobia pompano and milkfish and reported farmed fishes rainbow trout sea bream carp and sturgeon were carried out using NMDS plot  .

The feeding strategy stocking density and digestive physiology of the three candidate species are provided in .Fishes were randomly selected and caught before feeding using afish net and immediately lifted on board a boat for further examination.Sample preparation for culture independent microbial analysisAfter eight months of culture five individuals of each fish species cobia milkfish and pompano were collected and kept alive in aerated FRP tanks holding sea water until processing approximately 3 h for microbiota analysis.

Alternatively species evenness was significantly higher in milkfish as compared to cobia and pompano which is consis- tent with results from three warm water fish species Fig.

While cobia and pompano shared 261 1.07 OTUs in common milkfish shared 44 0.18 OTUs with cobia and 42 0.17 OTUs with pompano.

Among the hatchery bred species available for commercial farming cobia Rachycentron canadum seabass Lates calcarifer and pompano Trachinotus blochii are the three important mariculture species for which the hatchery technology is standardized Corresponding author.E-mail address K. Ramalingam.1 Authors have contributed equally for the manuscript.and commercial seed production is initiated  .

However from the results obtained it is ev- ident that pompano displayed highest species abundance followed by cobia while milkfish exhibited more evenness.

Interestingly cobia and pompano though rationed different feeds grouped together confirming the role of host in determining the microbiome.Percentage of dissimilarity between the three fish species was stud- ied through SIMPER analysis based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index.

Beta Diversity among samples determined through Principal Component Analysis plot using MOTHUR.Contrary to the earlier reports from mammals that displayed more richness in bacterial diversity in a herbivorous model compared to om- nivorous and carnivorous species  our analysis demon- strated decrease in the number of predicted OTUs from carnivorepompano cobia to herbivoreplanktivore milkfish and the differ- ence was significant.

The phylumVerrucomicrobia was seen in milkfish and pompano but not in cobia.The shared classes identified in farmed species were Bacilli Gamma- Beta- and Alphaproteobacteria.
