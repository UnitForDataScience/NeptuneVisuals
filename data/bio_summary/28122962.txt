thus downregulation of ip-10 expression by s. aureus was not the result of increased de novo ip-10 mrna degradation but of decreased ip-10 gene transcription.figure 2. s. aureus downregulates th1 cell- recruiting chemokine production and prevents th1 cell recruitment.

importantly note that although il-10 can inhibit ip-10 44 it is not essential for s. aureus-induced inhibition of ip-10 as demonstrated by the observation that neutralizing abs against il-10 and the il-10r did not rescue ip-10 production.

to confirm that the ip-10 production to see was dependent on ifn-g 31 we blocked ifn-g r signaling using an anti-ifngr1 ab and found that this blockade abrogated the ip-10 response to see fig.

4a such a response did not seem to mediate ip-10 inhibition becauseblocking il-10 r binding with neutralizing abs against il-10 or the il-10 r did not restore ip-10 production in response to see fig.

aureus downregulates monocyte ip-10 gene transcriptionnext we investigated the mechanism of inhibition of ip-10 production by s. aureus.

we found that the main source of ip-10 in pbmcs was the cd14 monocyte population with .95 of monocytes pro- ducing ip-10 in response to see fig.

aureus downregulated ip-10 mrna in the presence of chx by 80.5 implying that de novo protein synthesis is not re- quired for ip-10 downregulation by s. aureus.

moreover the downregulation of ip-10 mrna was not due to mrna insta- bility as the rate of decay of ip-10 mrna was unaffected by the presence of s. aureus fig.

aureus modulates ip-10 production through tlr2 and mapks p38 and erk signalingnext we examined how the cell wall of s. aureus could selectively modulate the production of ip-10 and other ifn-g-dependent chemokines.

sb239063 a selective inhibitor of the p38 mapk pathway almost completely restored ifn-g-induced ip-10 production in the presence of s. aureus.figure 4. il-10 is not required for ip-10 inhi- bition by s. aureus.

aureusthe ip-10 gene is a target of stat1 which is activated by ifn-g binding to its receptors ifngr1 and ifngr2 34. because ifn-g production to see was not affected by s. aureus stimulation wefigure 5. monocytes are the main source of ip-10 in human pbmcs responding to see superantigen.

also de novo synthesis of ifn-g is required for the induction of ip-10 because chx dramatically inhibited see-induced ip-10 mrna in pbmcs data not shown.however unregulated production of ifn-g and other th1 cyto- kines may have lethal effects for the host e.g.

ip-10 is a chemokine that recruits cxcr3-expressing cells such as activated t lymphocytes macrophages dendritic cells and nk cells 58. aberrant expression of ip-10 has been linked to various diseases including infections e.g.

mycoplasma helicobacter pylori and malaria autoimmune diseases marginal periodontitis and cancer 59. accordingly several therapeutic strategies have been developed to target ip-10 including anti-ip-10 mabs and ip-10 antagonists.
