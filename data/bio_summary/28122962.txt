Thus downregulation of IP-10 expression by S. aureus was not the result of increased de novo IP-10 mRNA degradation but of decreased IP-10 gene transcription.FIGURE 2.

Importantly note that although IL-10 can inhibit IP-10 44 it is not essential for S. aureus-induced inhibition of IP-10 as demonstrated by the observation that neutralizing Abs against IL-10 and the IL-10R did not rescue IP-10 production.

To confirm that the IP-10 production to SEE was dependent on IFN-g 31 we blocked IFN-g R signaling using an anti-IFNGR1 Ab and found that this blockade abrogated the IP-10 response to SEE Fig.

G Quantification of IFN-g in supernatants from human PBMC cultures stimulated with the indicated concentrations of SEE for 18 h. H Quantification of IP-10 in the culture supernatants of human PBMCs stimulated with the indicated concentrations of rhIFN-g for 18 h. I Quantifi- cation of IP-10 in supernatants of human PBMC cultures stimulated with SEE 1 ngml in the ab- sence or presence of neutralizing Ab against IFN-g R IFNGR1 or its isotype control Iso 10 or 20 mgml for 18 h. Results are plotted as mean 6 SD and are representative of three independent exper- iments from three different donors triplicate sam- ples for each experiment.

4A such a response did not seem to mediate IP-10 inhibition becauseblocking IL-10 R binding with neutralizing Abs against IL-10 or the IL-10 R did not restore IP-10 production in response to SEE Fig.

aureus downregulates monocyte IP-10 gene transcriptionNext we investigated the mechanism of inhibition of IP-10 production by S. aureus.

We found that the main source of IP-10 in PBMCs was the CD14 monocyte population with .95 of monocytes pro- ducing IP-10 in response to SEE Fig.

aureus downregulated IP-10 mRNA in the presence of CHX by 80.5 implying that de novo protein synthesis is not re- quired for IP-10 downregulation by S. aureus.

Moreover the downregulation of IP-10 mRNA was not due to mRNA insta- bility as the rate of decay of IP-10 mRNA was unaffected by the presence of S. aureus Fig.

aureus modulates IP-10 production through TLR2 and MAPKs p38 and ERK signalingNext we examined how the cell wall of S. aureus could selectively modulate the production of IP-10 and other IFN-g-dependent chemokines.
