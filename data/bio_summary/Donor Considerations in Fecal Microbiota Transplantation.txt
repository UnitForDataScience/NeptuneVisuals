Though safety appropriately prevails overall further research to go beyond the absence of infectious pathogens is lacking and consider- ations for selection of the ideal donor are still in their infancy.Future Considerations for FMT DonorsThe goal of FMT is the re-population of the gut microbiota because of the known association of the microbiota with health and disease there is heightened interest in the scientific community to explore unanswered questions for optimizing FMT donors.

.Current FMT Donor ConsiderationsThe current state of FMT donor selection largely focuses on infectious screening and the use of a one-donor-for-one- patient approach.

Park2Published online 13 March 2017 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York outside the USA 2017AbstractPurpose of Review Tremendous acceleration has been made in understanding the gut microbiota in the past decade and with it further understanding of the pathologic role of dysbiosis and the use of fecal microbiota transplantation FMT as therapy.

FMT has been studied in many disease states including the most common indication of Clostridium difficile infection CDI though many questions regarding stool donor selection remain.Recent Findings Though traditionally one donor has provid- ed stool for one patient research is underway to explore many donor selection considerations from the use of pooled donor stool to selection of a high diversity donor.

It is well-known that dietary intake shapes the gut microbiota and the potential implications of this on FMT donor selection are being explored.Summary Though further high-quality research is needed op- timizing the fecal microbiota inoculum holds great promise.Keywords Fecal microbiota transplant .

FMT can be ac- complished via a range of introduction methods including in oral pill form  via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube   post-pylorically   colonoscopically  or via enema --though data do not yet support an unequivocally supe- rior method of introduction.

The range of disease states in which FMT has been tested as a therapy is broad as well-- from acute graft-versus-host disease  to ulcerative colitis UC  to the most common indication recurrent CDI       .

A minimally ex- plored frontier of FMT is that of donor considerations Fig.
