prenatal maternal distress is thought to influence vari- ous fetal and neonatal outcomes prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction psychiatric diseases and the metabolic syn- drome.2 given the high prevalence of prenatal maternal dis- tress and substantial medical burden of allergic diseases inves- tigation of the association between prenatal maternal distressand allergic diseases in offspring and the possible underlying mechanisms warrants attention.in this review we aim to summarize current evidence on the impact of prenatal maternal psychological distress on the de- velopment of allergic diseases and to discuss possible pathways linking prenatal stress and allergic diseases.

prenatal maternal distress had a close association with wheezingasthma in 17 studies346-192122 and atopic dermatitis in 5 studies.511122022 two studies reported good relationships with both asthma and atopic dermatitis.1122 only 1 cohort study as- sessed the possible relationship between maternal distress and allergic rhinitis.11 the earliest report on the effect of prenatal maternal distress on allergic diseases was published only in 20092122 which may be related to the fact that the fetal origins hypothesis began gaining substantial attention during the late 1990s and the international society for developmental origins of health and disease was established in 2003. although we have not proceeded a meta-analysis the attributable risk of prenatal maternal stress seems to be present but limited.

these factors are thought to modu- late the allergic manifestations independently of or via indirect interaction with prenatal distress.first familial factors such as parental history of atopic diseas- es are associated with an increased risk of atopic diseases in offspring.45 although no reports are available on whether pa- rental atopy plays a synergistic or antagonistic role with prena- tal distress in developing allergic diseases the effect of prenatal distress is enhanced in the absence of a maternal atopic predis- position.11 sex difference can also modulate the risk of allergy development in offspring.

from offspring's side markers for stress-reactivity such as cortisol levels in saliva are good candidate biomarkers for prenatal distress and later dis- ease development.69 moreover as another marker of early ex- posure and later disease potential telomere shortening is no- ticeable for predicting development of noncommunicable dis- ease.70 the role of these biomarkers however has not been ver- ified in the development allergic diseases and now warrants at- tention.conclusioncurrent evidence had succeeded in demonstrating a close as- sociation between prenatal maternal distress and the develop- ment of allergic diseases in offspring.

a study conducted in the uk assessed prenatal anxiety at 2 time points 18 and 32 weeks of gestation and found similar trends of a positive asso- ciation between prenatal anxiety and subsequent childhood asthma at 712 years though the estimated parameter was larger for anxiety during the third trimester.21in some studies negative or stressful life events were used as a proxy for prenatal maternal distress.4681115 maternal bereave-ment involving a spouse or child one of the most extreme trau- mas a person may face was found to be significantly associated with later allergic diseases71617 and the number of stressful life events during pregnancy was also reported to show a dose-re- sponse relationship.6 recently studies using validated self-re- ported questionnaires have also been published.3581314181921 however there are as yet no studies that applied observational or objective measures to assess maternal psychological status.

moreover the effect of prenatal distress on hpa function is substantially more marked in girls than in boys.48 secondly physical factors such as intrauterine growth restric- tion are also closely associated with prenatal distress49 possi- bly through uteroplacental insufficiency and maternal un- healthy habits including poor sleep pattern sedentary lifestyle or a greater propensity for alcohol abuse and cigarette smoking.

as a result despite the clear association between prenatal distress and offspring's allergic diseases no single bio- marker was identified that could specify vulnerable subjects re- garding the prenatal distress-offspring's allergic diseases rela- tionship.

all but one study assessed maternal distress at just 1-time point thus making it difficult to ascertain the critical period for the effect of prenatal maternal distress on fetal and neonatal immune development.

prenatal distress also influences methylation in the cortico- trophin releasing factor promoter and gr promoter regions of the hypothalamus as well as in the hsd11b2 promoter region within the placenta controlling excessive glucocorticoid expo- sure to the fetus.42 due to the rapid development of laboratory technology a recent study has succeeded in demonstrating di-rect links between maternal distress epigenetic changes and the development of allergic diseases.

hence they did not gather sufficient prenatal or perinatal biologic samples related to prenatal exposure or im- munologic changes.

through this we will present a viewpoint of selecting vulnerable subgroups and choosing intervention strategies.200c copyright the korean academy of asthma allergy and clinical immunology  the korean academy of pediatric allergy and respiratory diseaseevidence of the impact of prenatal maternal distress on allergic diseases in their offspringto locate current evidence on the topic we conducted a key- word search through the pubmed databases see supplemen- tary table available from httpwww.e-aair.org.

from the 238 results we selected cohort or registry studies published be- tween january 1 2000 and june 30 2016 that examined the as- sociation between prenatal maternal distress and allergic dis- eases in offspring.

al- though these are lists of studies that presented only positive re- sults 16 out of 20 80 studies presented odds relative risk or hazard ratio of less than 2. moreover no study has found a sig- nificant association between prenatal maternal stress and aller- gic rhinitis development.prenatal maternal distress was ascertained by various meth- ods during different time periods.
