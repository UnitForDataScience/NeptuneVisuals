Prenatal maternal distress had a close association with wheezingasthma in 17 studies346-192122 and atopic dermatitis in 5 studies.511122022 Two studies reported good relationships with both asthma and atopic dermatitis.1122 Only 1 cohort study as- sessed the possible relationship between maternal distress and allergic rhinitis.11 The earliest report on the effect of prenatal maternal distress on allergic diseases was published only in 20092122 which may be related to the fact that the fetal origins hypothesis began gaining substantial attention during the late 1990s and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease was established in 2003.

Prenatal maternal distress is thought to influence vari- ous fetal and neonatal outcomes prematurity and intrauterine growth restriction psychiatric diseases and the metabolic syn- drome.2 Given the high prevalence of prenatal maternal dis- tress and substantial medical burden of allergic diseases inves- tigation of the association between prenatal maternal distressand allergic diseases in offspring and the possible underlying mechanisms warrants attention.In this review we aim to summarize current evidence on the impact of prenatal maternal psychological distress on the de- velopment of allergic diseases and to discuss possible pathways linking prenatal stress and allergic diseases.

All but one study assessed maternal distress at just 1-time point thus making it difficult to ascertain the critical period for the effect of prenatal maternal distress on fetal and neonatal immune development.

Any physical or psychological stress that can affect fetal psycho-neuro-endo- crine systems could cause offspring's allergic diseases.2628A dysregulated HPA axis is one of the representative patho- physiologies in this relationship.Chronic stress may alter the maternal HPA axis.230 Pregnant women experiencing much distress have persistently high lev- els of cortisol.31 Elevated levels of maternal serum cortisol result in more cortisol passing through the placental barrier thereby increasing the cortisol level in the fetus.30 Maternal cortisol can also stimulate production of placental cortisol-releasing hor- mone CRH leading to elevated fetal CRH levels.228 Moreover maternal distress itself reduces uteroplacental blood flow initi-Figure.

As mater- nal glucocorticoid levels are significantly higher than those of the fetus subtle changes in HSD2 activity including ones in- duced by maternal distress can allow significant fetal exposure to excessive concentrations of glucocorticoids.2530Maternal and fetal distress also stimulate CRH secretion in the placenta which results in increased levels of CRH in the fetal circulation.

Prenatal distress also influences methylation in the cortico- trophin releasing factor promoter and GR promoter regions of the hypothalamus as well as in the HSD11B2 promoter region within the placenta controlling excessive glucocorticoid expo- sure to the fetus.42 Due to the rapid development of laboratory technology a recent study has succeeded in demonstrating di-rect links between maternal distress epigenetic changes and the development of allergic diseases.

Innate immunity is compromised by ma- ternal distress.29 Maternal distress limits macrophage and neu- trophil function and attenuates natural killer cell cytotoxicity.43 By resetting homeostatic set points and the responsiveness of stress pathways maternal distress can change the pattern of macrophage-derived cytokine release and consequently may adjust the regulatory mechanisms related to spreading and phagocytosis.

These factors are thought to modu- late the allergic manifestations independently of or via indirect interaction with prenatal distress.First familial factors such as parental history of atopic diseas- es are associated with an increased risk of atopic diseases in offspring.45 Although no reports are available on whether pa- rental atopy plays a synergistic or antagonistic role with prena- tal distress in developing allergic diseases the effect of prenatal distress is enhanced in the absence of a maternal atopic predis- position.11 Sex difference can also modulate the risk of allergy development in offspring.
