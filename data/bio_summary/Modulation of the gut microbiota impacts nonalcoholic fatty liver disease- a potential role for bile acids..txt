P  0.05 P  0.001.that GG enhanced bile acid absorption leading to higher bile acid levels in the plasma and elevated bile acid content in the liver which in turn triggered compensatory changes in the expression of genes involved in hepatic bile acid syn- thesis and uptake.To examine whether the elevated plasma levels of bile acids may contribute to hepatic inflammation and fibrosis we gave mice the bile acid taurocholic acid for 7 days by mixing it in their feed 0.5 ww.

In addition taurocholic acid also significantly increased the primary bile acids cholic acid glycocholic acid chenodeoxycholic acid tau- rochenodeoxycholic acid and unconjugated muricholic acids as well as the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acidtaurodeoxycholic acid glycodeoxycholic acid ursodeoxy- cholic acid and -muricholic acid Fig.

Specifically plasma levels of various primary bile acids including cholic acid taurocholic acid muricholic acids and tauromuricholic acids as well as the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid taurodeoxycholic acid ursodeoxycholic acid hyodeoxycholic acid and tau- rohyodeoxycholic acid were significantly higher in the GG mice as compared with CTRL mice Fig.

Furthermore NAFLD was found to be associated with intestinal dysbiosis and altered fecal bile acid levels in hu- man subjects 52.One type of bile acid that may be particularly involved inpromoting liver injury and NAFLD is deoxycholic acid lev- els of which were increased by 4.2-fold in the plasma of mice fed GG.

Taken together GG suppressed bodyweight gain which wasaccompanied by decreased adipose tissue inflammation and improved glucose tolerance.Modulation of the gut microbiota by GG is associated with reduced hepatic steatosis but enhanced hepatic inflammationIn accordance with a lower fat mass in the GG mice hepatic lipid accumulation was significantly lower in mice fed GG as revealed by HE and Oil Red O stainings and quantitation of liver triglycerides Fig.

Together these data demonstrate that although feeding GG suppressed diet-induced obesity it stimulatedspecific inflammatory cells and pathways in the liver whereas RS had no effect.Modulation of the gut microbiota by GG is associated with enhanced hepatic fibrosisStrikingly further study revealed that the livers of the mice fed GG exhibited pronounced features of hepatic fi- brosis.

A Total bile acid concentration in plasma of CTRL RS and GG mice and concentration of free and conjugated primary and secondary bile acid subspecies in the plasma of CTRL and GG mice.

The 4-hydroxyproline content was determined spectrophotometrically in liver hydrolysates as described previously 33.For hepatic myeloperoxidase activity liver homogenates were prepared and myeloperoxidase peroxidase activity was measured according to manufacturer's instructions Abcam.For the quantification of liver total bile acid content livers were homogenized in 75 ethanol incubated at 50degC and centrifuged.
