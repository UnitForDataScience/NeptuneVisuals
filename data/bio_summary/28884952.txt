The trans-membrane transports of most solutes were mediated by membrane transport proteins which involved the consumption of metabolic energy usually ATP.42 Carbohydrate metabolism denoted the various biochemical processes responsi- ble for the catabolism and interconversion of carbohydrates en- ergy storage and absorption in living organisms.47 The bacteriathat caused higher energy harvest from the diet possibly induced the expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and ATP production.DiscussionATP is required for lyase activity during TMA metabolism indi- cating the necessity of an ATP-dependent repair mechanism.45 AMPK is allosterically activated by an increase in AMPATP ra- tio and its role in the regulation of food intake inhibition whole body energy homeostasis and regulation of hormones acting on the hypothalamus has been addressed.47 Since AMPK is a sen- sor of cellular energy status the intestinal AMPK of hosts could be activated in response to nutrient deficiency and caloric re- striction as in the case of SDF supplementation to red meat diet HF group.48 AMPK activation occurs in response to metabolic stress that impairs ATP production when cellular energy sta- tus is compromised such as loss in glucose content with SDF supplementation.49 This activation switches off ATP-dependent processes required for whole body energy homeostasis.50 There- fore we reasonably speculated that activated intestinal epithe- lial AMPK had a suppressive effect on lyase production by the gut flora and on the interactions with transporters which were energy-dependent events Figure 6.

For example degrada- tion of these specific polysaccharides by the gut microbiota involves the production of specific enzymes such as xylanases arabinoxylanases and b-glucanases.3738 In addition these pentosans differ in molecular weight and substitution degree arabinosexylose which may also exert different modulatory effects on gut microbiota.39 Since gut microbiota fermentation may depend on the structure and size of the SDF molecules.Response of Gut Microbiota Structure and TMA or TMAO Production to SDF Intervention in MiceTo identify functional traits linking clusters that thrived on diets we selected the top 35 abundant taxa clusters and performed a literature search for their lifestyle traits.

The increased complexity of gut microbiota has been suggested to enhance nutrition and en- ergy harvest36 consequently SDF supplementation-induced de- creased gut microbiota complexity could indicate relatively lower energy harvest.

Data are presented as mean - standard error from the mice in each group.bacterial taxa.340 However the complexity of the gut microbiota and host environmental factors have hindered the determination of accurate taxonomic composition and community structure.42 In line with our observation the TMA metabolism profiles of the RM and HF groups were opposite although animals in both groups contained relatively high proportion of Lacto- bacillus belonging to phylum Firmicutes Table 10 Supporting Information.Statistical Differences in Gut Microbiota Induced by SDF DietsSixty male C57BL6 mice aged 4 weeks were purchased from the National Academy of Military Medical Sciences to investigate the interactions between SDF diet and the gut flora.

The other diets LN HN LF HF LE and HE groups were based on 20 red meatsupplementation according to the Western-style diet with SDF arabinoxylan-rich fractions 7.5 for low SDF dose and 15 for high SDF dose complete composition of experimental diets is presented in Table 2 Supporting Information from wheat bran.
