among th17 cell cytokines a key role is played by il-23 that orchestrates the survival and maintenance of the th17 phenotype and in turn the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity in the gut interestingly aberrant expression and activity of the il-17il-23 axis is frequently involved in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory bowel pathologies consis- tently studies report that polymorphisms in the il23r gene are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases ibds another proinflammatory cytokine implicated in ibd pathogenesis is il-21 which is secreted by t follicular helper tfh cells and it is implicated in the differentiation of germinal center b cells into high-affinity antibody- secreting plasma cells and memory b cells that ensure sus- tained immune protection and rapid recall responses against previously encountered foreign antigens il-21 can also play important roles in t cell subset development.

moreover th17 cells also produce il-22 which has important functions in host defense at mucosal surfaces as well as in tissue repair while it is produced by innate lymphoid cells ilcs and th cell subsets includ- ing th17 cells il-22 acts only on nonhematopoietic stromal cells like epithelial cells and keratinocytes.

increased prevalence of circulating novel il-17 secreting foxp3 expressing cd4 t cells and defective suppressive function of circulating foxp3 regulatory cells support plasticity between th17 and regulatory t cells in inflammatory bowel disease patients inflammatory bowel diseases vol.

to this end they are present in the mesenteric lymph nodes in the gut lamina propria and in peyer's patches and participate in the control of intestinal inflamma- tion normally dcs particularly the tolerogenic cd103 dc subset are recruited in the gut during inflamma- tory conditions and in turn efficiently act stimulating the differentiation of foxp3 tregs overall foxp3 tregs in concertation with other immunoregulatory cell types including t regulatory 1 tr1 cells t helper 3 th3 cells regulatory b cells bregs cd103 dcs and m2 cells are instrumental in establishing a global context of immune tolerance to a spectrum of potentially pathogenic microor- ganisms in the gut flora the gut microbiota and mucosal immunity crosstalkgut microbiota is the collection of all microbial populations that reside in the gastrointestinal tract.

in these bowel diseases there is an imbal- ance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses but their full pathogenetic mechanisms are still incompletely understood it is known that in genetically predisposed individuals an inappropriate immune response against luminal agents is activated with an abnormal pro- duction of cytokines and other mediators of inflammation the genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of ibds include genes encoding proteins of immunity involved in environmental sensing of microbial-derived products and signals.in particular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 nod2 is an autophagy- related gene that activates an immune reaction against components of the bacteria cell wall including peptidogly- cans in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as in the case of shigella and listeria nod2 is expressed on the cell surface of various epithelial and innate immune cells such as neutrophils dcs stromal cells macro- phages and others nod2 has several homeostaticfunctions like intracellular bacterial sensing inducing the expression of several antibacterial peptides such as a-defen- sin and participating in the immune tolerance mechanisms by the suppression of the tlr axis under physiological conditions when the equilibrium between pro- and anti- inflammatory factors is maintained in the gut nod2 expression levels are very low on the other hand in pathological situations when proinflammatory factors are predominant over the anti-inflammatory ones nod2 level expressions are increased particularly due to the overexpres- sion of the proinflammatory cytokine tnf-a the activation of nod2 by antimicrobial peptides determines the initiation of a signaling cascade which is responsible for the production of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines involving the activation of nf-kb  the breakdown of the physiological equilibrium between immu- nity and microbiota determines alterations in the nod2 functions the bidirectional function of nod2 is linked to the inflammatory levels present on the gut surface.

however it is the intestinal epithelium with its secretory antibacterial peptides and innate and adaptive immune system cells that regulates gut immunity figure intestinal mucosal immune cells are specificallyorganized to form a so-called gut-associated lymphoid tissue galt where cells are activated by bacterial antigens.

these structural and immunological defense mechanisms of the human gut have been referred to as the mucosal firewall it has been well established that cd4 t cells can differ- entiate into several subtypes that may have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties th1 th2 and th17 cells generate mucosal inflammation and tissue damage while regulatory t cells tregs instead have anti-inflammatory properties and limit mucosal inflammation and promote tissue repair.

gpr41 and gpr43 on the surface of epithelial and immune cells having a range of effects on host immune functions the effects of scfas include inhibition of histone deacetylase activity and altered gene expression in host cells and augmented epithelial barrier function which promotes gut homeostasis via several mechanisms 1 enhanced mucus production by intestinal goblet cells 2 inhibition of nf-kb 3 activation of inflammasomes and il-18 production 4 increased b cell secretion of secretory iga 5 diminished maturation of dcs and 6 increased number and function of colonic foxp3 tregs.

primarily nod2 in the epithelial compartment is able to selectively reduce the levels of alpha- defensins in paneth cells in the small bowel nod2 activation is also linked to disturbance of hematopoietic cells and dc activity moreover nod2 polymorphisms are related to a reduction of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain- enhancer of activated b cells nf-kb in response to bacterial peptidoglycan finally other genetic factors involved in the pathogenesis of ibds include the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 stat3 and il-23 receptor il-23r both humoral and cell mediated immunity are involved in the pathogenesis of ibds ibds are also characterized by an influence of environmental factors.

the disruption of immune tolerance involves inflammatory pathways characterized by an unbalance between the anti-inflammatory regulatory t cells and the proinflammatory th1 th17 cells.

tfh cells differentiate from naive cd4 t helper cell precursors after antigen activation in the presence of il-6 and il-21 and induction of b cell lymphoma 6 bcl6 it must be noted that while th17 cells are prominent inducers of chronic inflammatory responses in disease states of the gut this subset can protect the intestinal mucosa from microbiota and pathogens by its ability to resist infection and promote iga secretion.

intestinal mucosal immune cells are specifically organized to form a so-called gut-associated lymphoid tissue galt where cells are activated by bacterial antigens.

as a classic activatorof cell-mediated immunity ifn-g activates macrophages natural killer nk cells and cd8 t cells.

in turn macrophages may stimulate ilc function by producing il-1b on the other hand ilcs can stimulate t cells by favoring antigen presentation by intramucosal antigen- presenting cells apcs such as dcs the abovementioned cytokines and chemokines are principally related to several t cell subtypes of the adaptive immunity.
