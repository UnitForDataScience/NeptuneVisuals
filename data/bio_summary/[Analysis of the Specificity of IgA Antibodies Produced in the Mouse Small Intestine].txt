The resulting IgA antibodies were found to be specific mostly to Gram-positive bacteria present in intestinal microbiota and to recognize both bacteria from vari- ous sections of the intestine and particular bacterial species associated with the epithelium.

However it is still unclear how the natural repertoire of IgA antibodies produced in the intestine regulates the microbiota composition.To study the mechanism whereby IgA antibodies interact with microbiota it is necessary to systematically analyze the specificity of IgA antibodies produced in vivo and on the other hand to obtain monoclonal IgA suit- able for directional effects on microbiota.

The panel can be used to further under- stand the mechanisms whereby the adaptive immune system controls the microbiota composition.Keywords immunoglobulin A IgA microbiotaDOI 10.1134S0026893317060152INTRODUCTIONTo maintain intestinal homeostasis the immune system of mucous membranes selectively recognizes pathogenic microorganisms and selectively responds to them while remaining tolerant of harmless and symbiotic components of intestinal microbiota 1.

A type A hybridoma reacts with micro- biota from the large and small intestine a type B hybridoma only with large intestinal microbiota and a type C hybridoma with small intestinal microbiota and epithelium-associated bacteria.

Thus maintaining the microbiota composition by the host immune system is crucial and one of the main mechanisms for microbiota control is production of immunoglobulin A IgA at mucosal surfaces.

a Analysis of antibody binding with microbiota from the large and small intestine and epithelium-associated microbiota.

Thus we obtain a panel of IgA antibodies specific to microbiota components.Specificity Analysis of IgA HybridomasThe microbiota composition is known to change from one to another region of the gastrointestinal tract 15.

The microbiota composition changes easily in response to internal or external factors which may result in dysbiosis and associated inf lam- matory reactions.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the interactions between the immune system and microbiota remain obscure.
