h. mertsalmi et al.abcnon  54yesn  18non  54yesn  18non  54yesn  18figure 1 bacteria with significant differences in relative abundance between pd patients with or without ibs-like symptoms.parkinson's disease ibs-like symptoms and microbiotadysregulation of the gut-brain axis and alterations in the composition of intestinal microbiota have been previously linked to ibs pathogenesis and symptoms 17. several studies have reported a higher relative abundance of firmicutes and reduction in the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and bifidobacteria in ibs patients 1819. the results for the abundance of pre- votella have not been consistent 1820. however since our patients suffer from pd and multiple comor- bidities that can possibly affect gut microbiota com- parisons with previous studies contrasting ibs patients and healthy controls are challenging.changes in the gut microbiota might lead to low- grade inflammation and increased permeability of the gut mucosa previously linked to ibs 2122. gut mucosal changes have also been reported in pd and it has been speculated whether this could initiate a- synuclein associated neurodegeneration in the enteric nervous system that subsequently spreads to the cen- tral nervous system as initially proposed by braak 2324.previous studies in this cohort suggested alterations of the intestinal microbiota in pd patients 10. in particular the abundance of the family prevotellaceae was lower in the faeces of pd patients compared with controls.

1. none of the potential confounders showed a statistically significant association with the taxa of interest adjusted p value0.1 for all confounders and all three taxa.a similar comparison including both controls and pd patients was not done since there were only four control subjects with ibs.symptoms that were ibs-like and other non-motor symptomsin pd patients ibs was associated with more reported non-motor symptoms table 5. after multi- ple comparison correction for individual symptoms only the difference in the presence of unexplained pain remained statistically significant ibs 55.6 ibs  10.7 p  0.001. also total non-motor symptoms burden as measured by nmss seemed higher in ibs patients 41.5 27.3-83.5 vs. 33.5 20.8-50.8p  0.079 although the difference was not statisti- cally significant.discussionto our knowledge this is the first time increased prevalence of ibs-like symptoms and related micro- biome alterations have been reported in pd patients.

in the final model with resolved hyperthyroidism and hyperc- holesterolaemia as potential confounders pd patients were 6.86 95 ci 1.80-26.06 times more likely to have ibs than controls.there was no difference in time from motor or non- motor symptom onset between ibs and ibs- patients table 3. there were no statistically signifi- cant differences in use of antiparkinsonian medication between ibs and ibs- patients.the faecal microbiotathe abundances of bacterial taxa in faecal samples were compared with deseq2 on the family genus and otu operational taxonomic unit a computa- tional proxy for species levels between ibs and ibs- patients.

faecal microbiota were assessed by pyrosequenc- ing of the v1-v3 regions of the bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene.results symptoms that were ibs-like were significantly more prevalent in pd patients than in controls 24.3 vs. 5.3 p  0.001. criteria for func- tional constipation were met by 12.2 of pd patients and 6.7 of controls p  0.072. pd patients with ibs-like symptoms had more non-motor symp- toms and a lower faecal abundance of prevotella bacteria than those without ibs-like symptoms.conclusion our results indicate that pd patients may suffer from colonic dysfunction beyond pure constipation.

however the prevalence in our control group 5.3 is close to what has been previously reported from the finnishc 2017 eanbowel symptoms in parkinson's disease1381table 5 non-motor symptoms of pd patients with or without ibs-like symptomspd patientsibsn  18ibs- n  56puncorrectedpcorrectedibs irritable bowel syndrome ibs pd patients with ibs-like symptoms ibs- pd patients without ibs-like symptoms iqr interquartile range nmsquest non-motor symptoms questionnaire nmss non-motor symptom scale pd parkinson's disease p corrected significance threshold corrected by benjamini-hochberg.

the univariate model suggested a significantly lower abundance of the genus prevotella and the familyprevotellaceae in ibs compared to ibs- patients table 4. the multivariate model confirmed these two taxa as well as one otu that represents the genus bacteroides which was also less abundant in ibs pd patients table 4 fig.

furthermore it was speculated that the presence of ibs-like symptoms in pd patients ibs would be associated with the presence of other non-motor symptoms and with alterations of gut microbiota.methodsthe ethics committee of the hospital district of hel- sinki and uusimaa approved the study and all partic- ipants gave informed consent.study subjectsthis case-control study compared patients with a diagnosis of pd according to the queen square brain bank criteria with control subjects frequency matched for sex and age -5 years without any signs of parkin- sonism or potential premotor symptoms.

uncorrected p values were used for identification of potential confounders with a threshold at p  0.2. logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of potential confounders on the connection between pd and ibs-like symptoms.a non-parametric mann-whitney u test was used to determine whether ibs patients also had more other non-motor symptoms than pd patients without ibs-like symptoms ibs-.

a recent japanese study reported ibs criteria to be fulfilled in 17.0 and fc in 27.1 of pd patients 15. moreover 58.1 of pd patients in our study had symptoms of diarrhoea.the prevalence of constipation was higher when assessed both with the nmsquest or the nmss than with the rome iii criteria.

the lower abundance of prevotella bacteria in pd patients with ibs-like symptoms sug- gests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis may be implicated in the gastroin- testinal dysfunction of pd patients.introductionconstipation can affect up to 70 of patients with parkinson's disease pd 1. it is also a frequent pre- motor symptom and is considered one of the strongest risk factors for pd 23. the pathophysiological mechanisms behind constipation in pd include pro- longed intestinal transit and pelvic floor dyssynergia 45. despite its high prevalence no specificcorrespondence f. scheperjans haartmaninkatu 4 00290 helsinki finland tel.
