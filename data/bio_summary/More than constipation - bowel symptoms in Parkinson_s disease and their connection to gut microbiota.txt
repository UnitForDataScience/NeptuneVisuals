However the prevalence in our control group 5.3 is close to what has been previously reported from the Finnishc 2017 EANBOWEL SYMPTOMS IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE1381Table 5 Non-motor symptoms of PD patients with or without IBS-like symptomsPD patientsIBSn  18IBS- n  56PuncorrectedPcorrectedIBS irritable bowel syndrome IBS PD patients with IBS-like symptoms IBS- PD patients without IBS-like symptoms IQR interquartile range NMSQuest Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire NMSS Non-Motor Symptom Scale PD Parkinson's disease P corrected significance threshold corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg.

Furthermore it was speculated that the presence of IBS-like symptoms in PD patients IBS would be associated with the presence of other non-motor symptoms and with alterations of gut microbiota.MethodsThe ethics committee of the Hospital District of Hel- sinki and Uusimaa approved the study and all partic- ipants gave informed consent.Study subjectsThis case-control study compared patients with a diagnosis of PD according to the Queen Square Brain Bank criteria with control subjects frequency matched for sex and age -5 years without any signs of parkin- sonism or potential premotor symptoms.

In contrast the NMSQuest has only yes-or-no options giving no information about frequency of the symp- toms.Parkinson's disease patients with IBS-like symptoms IBS reported more non-motor symptoms in partic- ular pain and symptoms of dysautonomia.

Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of potential confounders on the connection between PD and IBS-like symptoms.A non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine whether IBS patients also had more other non-motor symptoms than PD patients without IBS-like symptoms IBS-.

Also total non-motor symptoms burden as measured by NMSS seemed higher in IBS patients 41.5 27.3-83.5 vs. 33.5 20.8-50.8P  0.079 although the difference was not statisti- cally significant.DiscussionTo our knowledge this is the first time increased prevalence of IBS-like symptoms and related micro- biome alterations have been reported in PD patients.

IBS-like bowel symptoms in PD and their possible connection to other non- motor symptoms and faecal microbiota were assessed.Methods This case-control study compared 74 PD patients with 75 controls without any signs of parkinsonism or potential premotor symptoms.

However our goal here was to assess the complexity of bowel symptoms experi- enced by PD patients rather than to set a definitive diagnosis.The high prevalence of IBS-like symptoms in our cohort therefore suggests that the Rome questionnaire would add valuable information about bowel symp- toms in PD patients.It should also be considered that controls with potential premotor symptoms of PD were excluded.
