Moreover COX activity particularly COX-2 activity is increased in periodontal tissue in disease and in response to periodontal path- ogens in vitro  .Early investigations of pro-resolving mediators in periodontitis revealed that neutrophils from periodontal patients produce increased LXA4 compared to subjects without periodontal disease  especially patients with Localized Aggressive Periodontitis.

Thus to more replicate the treatment of periodontal disease in humans a lipoxin analog was used as an adjunct to periodontal surgical therapy to evaluate the impact on periodontal regeneration  .

The vehicle treated group exhibited further bone loss Panel B and D while the RvE1 treated group exhibited regrowth on bone to near pre-disease levels Panels C and D. and upregulation of systemic inflammation as in obesity and type 2 diabetes can cause dysbiosis of the gut micro- biome .These findings raise the question of the temporal relationship of the periodontal microbiome to inflammation in periodontal dis- ease.

As additional controls two groups of animals were treated with topical application of LTB4 and PGE2 instead of RvE1 .The results of the treatment experiment revealed that topical treatment with RvE1 stopped disease progression and resulted in regeneration of periodontal tissues lost to prior disease including bone and connective tissue attachment of the tooth to the bone .

These data emphasize the dynamic interplay required for maintenance of homeostasis and periodontal health and the central role of inflammation is creation of dysbiosis and disease.Pro-resolving mediators in periodontal regenerationIn chronic osteolytic inflammatory diseases such as periodon- titis sustained microbial challenge and a failure of endogenous resolution pathways result in tissue destruction .

In regenerat- ing tissues in mice treatment with resolvin resulted in differenti- ation and activation of osteoblasts .Animals models of periodontal disease have been used to demonstrate regeneration of periodontal tissues mediated by lip- oxins and resolvins endogenous regulators if inflammation .

Infections including periodontal infections have a significant impact on dia- betic control and diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development and severity of periodontal disease .

Taken together these observations suggest a failure to resolve local inflammatory insults induced by bacteria in the periodontium leading to periodontal disease progression.Interestingly Fredman reported that the in vitro abnormalities in LAP were all reversed with exogenous addition of RvE1 a resolvin of the E series derived from EPA.

A relevant observation in these studies was that treatment with RvE1 caused spontaneous disappearance of the periodontal pathogen P.g.

In a subsequent study by Lee and co-workers the temporal dynamics of inflammation-induced dysbiosis of the periodontal microbiota and the impact of RvE1 were examined in rat periodontitis  .
