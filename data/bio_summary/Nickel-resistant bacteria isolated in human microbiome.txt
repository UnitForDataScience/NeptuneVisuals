Sur- prisingly we realized that the growth occurred only in stools from participants with an increased body mass index and a nickel allergy.After 96 h bacterial growth could also be detected at 1 mM of nickel concentration no viable organisms could be detected above this range of nickel concentration.The growth of nickel-resistant bacteria was constantly characterized by a strict anaerobiosis and a prolonged lag phase the duration of which depended on the nickel concentration in the media.A typical growth curve for human nickel-resistant bacteria is described in the following link fi .We isolated a strict anaerobic nickel-resistant bacterium in 100 of overweight subjects with a nickel allergy.

The biochem- ical behaviour of this isolate is reported in .Concomitantly to the constant presence of this strictly anaerobic nickel-resistant isolate NBCI KY242648 other anaerobic nickel-resistant bacteria were identified.

The top hits of BLASTn search for the nickel-resistant bacteria are re- ported in .ResultsWe isolated nickel-resistant bacteria in obese humans but not in any of the lean participants.

With a very simple and reproducible technique we were able toisolate human nickel-resistant bacteria in the human microbiome duplicating in humans similar findings of nickel-resistant bacteria isolated in contaminated soils and wastewaters polluted with effluents of metallurgic electroplating industrial sources .

The aim of our study was to determine if nickel-resistant bacteria could also be isolated from human samples.

antibiotic-tolerant bacteria but also thrive on the excess nickel which results in its degradation and removal from the environment .Although nickel-resistant bacteria in the environment have been extensively studied essentially in humans no specific study has been undertaken to prove the presence of analogous nickel- resistant bacteria despite the fact that we are constantly exposed to nickel.The aim of this study was to investigate the potential exis- tence of 'nickel-tolerant' bacteria in the human microbiome.Materials and methodsSamplingApproval for this study was obtained from the IRB of the Italian Red Cross No.

Within 30 min after defe- cation the faecal samples were immediately stored at 4degC and processed within 2 h.Isolation and screening of nickel-resistant bacteria Stool cultures were made at different nickel sulphate concen- trations in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
