h. pylori-induced angiogenesis can be efficiently blocked with proton pump inhibitor ppi treatment through blockade of the mapk signaling pathway .the inflammatory chemokine il-8cxcl8 a potent angiogenesis inducer   is shown to be upregulated in gastric cancer and its presence strongly correlates with adhesion migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells   also verified by il-8 overexpression and knockdown experiments using gastric cancer cells .

in another study h. pylori was proposed to increase the fragility of gastric endothelial cells in vitro via secretion of biologically active proteins such as caga an hsp70 inhibitor into cells.

collagens and interleukins demonstrates an active role in the remodeling of the surrounding microenvironment inducing stromal reac- tion angiogenesis and inflammatory responses .several studies have shown that mucosal e. coli express- ing the afa-1 operon upregulates hif-1a expression in the intestinal epithelial cells leading to increased vegf and il-8 expression and increased activation of the vegfr-2 signaling pathway in the intestinal epithelial cells therefore inducing inflammation and promoting tumor growth through angiogenesis upregulation -.

therefore p38 jnk and erk mapk pathways are inhibited while downregulation of pro-angiogenic cytokines such as vegf and il-8 in both tumor and endothelial cells and apoptotic effects in endothelial cells have been reported.
