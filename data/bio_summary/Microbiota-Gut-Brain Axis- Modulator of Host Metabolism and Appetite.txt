The importance of the gut microbiota is emphasized by the fact that antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cefdinir reduce mortality in children with kwashiorkor 81 82.The Gut Microbiota as a Key Player in Obesity and Metabolic and Eating-Related DisordersOne of the early and pivotal experiments demonstrating the key role of the gut microbiota in host energy metabolism showed thatmice with an absent microbiota i.e.

As such influencing one of these factors will most likely result in alterations in the others making the gut microbiota easily accessible and manipulable for targeting host metabolism and appetite control.Gut Microbiota and Its Metabolites as a Therapeutic Target in Host Metabolism and Appetite ControlThere are 4 primary means by which the gut microbiota can be modulated 1 the administration of live beneficial bacterial strains probiotics 2 the administration of host-indigestible dietary fibers which undergo bacterial fermentation and subse- quently stimulate the growth of certain types of bacteria prebiotics 3 the administration of targeted antibiotics and finally 4 fecal microbiota transplantation Table 1.

They deplete specific gut microbial taxa depending on the particular antibiotic given resulting in long-term alterations in gut microbial composition.Fecal microbiota transplantationThis procedure normally is used after antibiotictreatment results in microbiota depletion or in studies of germ-free animal models since fecal microbiota transplantation provides an elegant way to demonstrate gut microbial-dependent effects.Particular bacterial strains can affect body weight or symptoms associated with being overweight or obese such as metabolic endotoxemia insulin resistance and cardiometabolic disorders.These increase satiety and affect postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations.

J Nutr 2017147727-45.Keywords nutrition microbiota obesity metabolism behaviorIntroductionThe role of the gut microbiota in the regulation of physiology in both health and disease is becoming increasingly recognized 1 2.

Finally we briefly emphasize the multifaceted nature of eating disorders in regard to their food-related behavioral components other behavioral comorbidities such as anxiety and depression and the role that the gut microbiota plays herein.Metabolic and Eating DisordersThe role of the gut microbiota in host metabolism and appetite has been primarily investigated in regard to obesity and metabolic syndrome.

There is a growing realization that there is involvement of the gut microbiota in obesity especially considering that gut microbiota features could be used to predict glucose responses enabling personalized dietary interventions 45.

The importance of the gut microbiota in obesity is also emphasized by the fact that interventions targeting this disorder including bariatric surgery and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in particular induce substantial weight loss and are associated with alterations in gut microbiota composition 21-23 48.

Indeed colonization of GF mice with a gut microbiota originating from an obese human resulted in a substantial increase in total body fat compared with a lean gut microbiota 86.

Perturbation of the gut microbiota in the form of severe acute malnutrition during this period isMicrobiota and eating behavior 729associated with persistent relative microbiota immaturity 77 and this could also result in alterations in the development of organs tissues andor body systems 99 which may subse- quently increase the predisposition to various diseases at an older age 100.

In addition tryptophan decarboxylase enzymes have been detected in the human gut microbiota suggesting that the gut microbiota could produce the neurotransmitter trypta- mine 159.
