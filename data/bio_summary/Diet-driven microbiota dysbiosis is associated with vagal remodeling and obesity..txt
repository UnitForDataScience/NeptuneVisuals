Obesity research traditionally uses low and high fat diets and there has been limited investigation of the potential detrimental effects of a low-fathigh-sugar diet LFHSD on body fat accumulation and health.Therefore in the present study we investigated the effects of HFHSD and LFHSD on microbiota composition gut inflammation gut-brain vagal communication and body fat accumulation.Specifically we tested the hypothesis that LFHSD changes the gut microbiota induces gut inflammation and alters vagal gut-brain communication associated with increased body fat accumulation.Sprague-Dawley rats were fed an HFHSD LFHSD or control low-fatlow-sugar diet LFLSD for 4 weeks.

HSD consumption increases body fat contentA-C. Daily changes in body weight A body fat B lean mass C of rats fed with regular diet LFLSD in blue low-fat diet LFHSD in green or high-fat diet HFHSD in red for four weeks n4 shows that both HFHSD and LFHSD can significantly increase both body weight and body fat gains compared to control LFLSD.

However the observed increased body fat accumulation cannot be attributed solely to just the sugar content because of some fiber and microelements differences between the control LFLSD and high-sugar diets used in the study.Sen et al.Page 9HSD consumption significantly alters gut microbial ecologyDiet-induced obesity is associated with marked changes in the microbiota composition and there is evidence that microbiota composition can regulate body fat accumulation colonization of GF mice with the microbiota from a diet-induced obese animal notably leads to a significant increase in body fat 32 33.

Both LFHSD and HFHSD rats were required to consume significantly fewer calories to gain a gram of body fat than the LFLSD animals Figure 2D suggesting that despite providing less fat the LFHSD diet modified body fat metabolism and storage similarly to the energy dense HFHSD resulting in an increase in adiposity 30.

Compared to LFLSD LFHSD fed rats had significant increases in body fat after one week on their diet and significant increases in body weight appeared after threeSen et al.Page 20weeks.

Overall body fat mass was greater in LFHSD than LFLSD LFHSD 39-3.1 g and LFLSD 29.7-2 g and greater in HFHSD than both LF fed groups HFHSD 59.8-8.5 g Figure 1B.Sprague-Dawley rats have previously been reported to display different phenotypes obesity- prone and obesity-resistant when fed a high-fat diet 25.

Recent studies have shown that a leaky gut can contribute to theSen et al.Page 8onset and progression of liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD 27.In this study we found that liver fat was significantly increased in the LFHSD group compared to LFLSD-fed rats LFLSD 12.05 - 1.317g LFHSD 19.575 - 2.013 g p0.05 by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-Kramer test.

The HFHSD fed animals weighed significantly more than the LFLSD after only one week on their diet LFLSD 332.12-3.8g and HFHSD 355.94-7.4g while the LFHSD fed became significantly heavier than the LFLSD-fed rats after week 3 of their diet LFLSD 351.36-6.4g and LFHSD 373.15-6.2g.

The one-way ANOVA with a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc correction shows a significant increase in expression of IL-6 IL-1b and TNFa in HFHSD and LFHSD compared to that of LFLSD P0.05 abcMean values at week 4 with unlike letters were significantly different P0.05.C-D. Immunoblot analysis C and quantification of immunoblot D the average densitometric analysis as compared with actin with whole cell lysate from cecum using the occludin antibody show both HFHSD and LFHSD have significantly lower expression compared to LFLSD P0.05 compared to LFLSD.

Difference between the LFHSD and HFHSD did not reach significance at week 4 Figure 2A.The LFHSD rats had increased body fat accumulation Figure 1B when compared to the LFLSD rat while consuming fewer calories Figure 2A.
