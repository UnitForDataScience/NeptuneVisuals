since we have only analysed one of the 35 putatively functional mouse tas2r genes represented by our genetically modified mouse model and it is known that individual bitter taste receptor cells express only subsets of the entire bitter taste receptor gene repertoire  it could be speculated that a much larger rather heterogeneous tas2r expressing paneth cellpopulation exists in mice.the tas2r genes are differentially expressed in gi tissuesin a second set of experiments analysing the tas2r gene expression in gi tissues a qrt-pcr screening of all murine tas2r genes was performed to assess the putative bitter sens- ing capacity in gi tissues.the results show that within the detection limits of our study gi tissues express only subsets of tas2r genes.

however the fact that all of the genes are expressed and present at differ- ent expression levels indicates that additional mechanisms govern the transcription of bitter taste receptor genes in the vp as proposed by lossow and colleagues .possible functional significance of tas2r gene expression in gi tissuesa crucial point regards the possible functional impact of the differential expression of the tas2r genes as assessed by our qrt-pcr profiling.

interestingly the expressed tas2r genescan be grouped according to their expression levels and40distributions.3020the tas2r genes have precise expression patterns10along the gi tract0after showing that gi tissues express subsets of tas2r genes we analysed the quantitative relationships among the differ- ent genes in different gi regions.

as it is believed that such species-specific tas2r gene expan- sions allow adaptations to specific nutritional needs and or habitats while one-to-one orthologous genes show func- tional conservation for the recognition of important bitter compounds shared by more diverse species  gi tissuemay analogous to the gustatory system dynamically adapt to different dietary habits.also foster and colleagues observed a gene cluster- dependent expression for tas2r genes in heart tissue .

of course acomplementary role of tas2r117 for bile acid sensing could be envisaged as well.the fact that many bitter compounds do exert physi- ological effects also in absence of their cognate bitter taste receptor confirms that bitter tasting molecules have a broad pharmacological activity that involve different tar- gets other than tas2r receptors online resource 4.functional significance of tas2r gene expression in paneth cellsbitter taste receptors have been associated with different functions in the gi tract ranging from food intake regula- tion   metabolic control  to defensive roles   .

this indicateswe investigated on the one hand the phylogenetic rela- tionship among the mouse tas2r genes which may point to similarities extending into their promoter regions as well as on the other hand the positions of the expressed tas2r genes on the mouse chromosomes fig.

although it remains to be formally proven that these effects are mediated by bitter taste receptors these results indicate that sensing mechanisms for bitter compounds are prominently present in the large intestine.unlike the above-mentioned studies where only subsets of tas2r genes were analysed jeon et al.

the broadly expressed genes are depicted in white the intestine-spe- cific genes in gray and the gi region-specific genes in black.

in between these two groups lie the remaining genes although they still retain a high variability in their expression levels.within the detection limits of our study the gi tissues unlike the vp exhibit a much more restricted tas2r expres- sion that varies both in the number of expressed genes and their expression levels.

the colon with 12 tas2r genes is the gi region with the highest number of detected tas2rs whereas the caecum expresses only 6 genes.

pictures of mouse chromosomes were taken from tas2r131 belong to a cluster of genes glires cluster i expanded in the glires clade including lagomorphs and rodents whereas primate species did not show expansion of the corresponding tas2r genes .

intriguingly we noticed that most tas2r genes of glires cluster i which represents genes that have been expanded specifically in the glires clade whereas e.g.

indeed it was already reported that the rodent stomach expresses several bitter taste receptor genes   and functional experiments showed that gavage of bitter agonists affects stomach emptying and food intake  .

to get a broader perspective on the expression of bitter taste receptors in the alimentary canal we quantified the expression of all 35 tas2r genes along the gastrointesti- nal tract by qrt-pcr.
