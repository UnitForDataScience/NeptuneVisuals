Since we have only analysed one of the 35 putatively functional mouse Tas2r genes represented by our genetically modified mouse model and it is known that individual bitter taste receptor cells express only subsets of the entire bitter taste receptor gene repertoire  it could be speculated that a much larger rather heterogeneous Tas2r expressing Paneth cellpopulation exists in mice.The Tas2r genes are differentially expressed in GI tissuesIn a second set of experiments analysing the Tas2r gene expression in GI tissues a qRT-PCR screening of all murine Tas2r genes was performed to assess the putative bitter sens- ing capacity in GI tissues.The results show that within the detection limits of our study GI tissues express only subsets of Tas2r genes.

However the fact that all of the genes are expressed and present at differ- ent expression levels indicates that additional mechanisms govern the transcription of bitter taste receptor genes in the VP as proposed by Lossow and colleagues .Possible functional significance of Tas2r gene expression in GI tissuesA crucial point regards the possible functional impact of the differential expression of the Tas2r genes as assessed by our qRT-PCR profiling.

The most likely rea- son is that two different VP preparations were used taste epithelium  and the entire taste papilla this study which differ in the proportion of non-taste tissue used for RNA extraction.The proximal and the distal GI tract are the most promi- nent sites of Tas2r gene expression as indicated by the number of detected genes 9 in the stomach and 12 in the colon and by their expression levels Tas2r108 Tas2r126 Tas2r135 Tas2r137 Tas2r143 and Tas2r138 have the high- est expression hinting at important physiological functions in these GI regions.

The broadly expressed genes are depicted in white the intestine-spe- cific genes in gray and the GI region-specific genes in black.

In addi- tion to these three GPCR-dependent taste qualities salty and sour recognition is mediated by ion channels however the molecular identity of the corresponding receptors are less well understood .In recent years it has become clear that the role of taste receptors is not restricted to the oral cavity.

Of course acomplementary role of Tas2r117 for bile acid sensing could be envisaged as well.The fact that many bitter compounds do exert physi- ological effects also in absence of their cognate bitter taste receptor confirms that bitter tasting molecules have a broad pharmacological activity that involve different tar- gets other than Tas2r receptors Online Resource 4.Functional significance of Tas2r gene expression in Paneth cellsBitter taste receptors have been associated with different functions in the GI tract ranging from food intake regula- tion   metabolic control  to defensive roles   .

To get a broader perspective on the expression of bitter taste receptors in the alimentary canal we quantified the expression of all 35 Tas2r genes along the gastrointesti- nal tract by qRT-PCR.
