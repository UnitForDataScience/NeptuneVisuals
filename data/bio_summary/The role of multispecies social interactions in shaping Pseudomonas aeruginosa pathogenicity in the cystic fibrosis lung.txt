These interactions may shape the evolutionary trajectory of P. aeruginosa while providing new opportunities for therapeutic exploitation of the CF lung microbiome.Keywords interspecific interactions multispecies interactions microbiome cystic fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa microbial communitiesINTRODUCTIONIndividuals with cystic fibrosis CF suffer from a buildup of thick viscous mucous in the airways predisposing them to life- long bacterial lung infections which are often fatal.

Crucially this implies that the role of some CF microorganisms in disease may be subtle actingthrough cross-species interactions rather than being recognised pathogens per se.HOW MIGHT MULTISPECIES INTERACTIONSSHAPE P. aeruginosa VIRULENCEOver the course of chronic infections P. aeruginosa CF isolates commonly display adaptive phenotypes such as conversion to mucoidy and loss of motility as well as reduced expression of acute virulence factors and extracellular toxins Smith et al.

aeruginosa evolution within the CF lung.Here we focus on four clinically relevant P. aeruginosa traits that may in part shape and be shaped by interactions with the natural microbial community.

reported enhanced P. aeruginosa pyocyanin production when co-cultured with oral viridans streptococci Streptococcus oralis Streptococcus mitis Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis and these co- cultures exhibited increased pathogenicity in an insect host model compared with P. aeruginosa alone.

Ultimately by under- standing whether community context matters for P. aeruginosa pyocyanin production it may be possible to manipulate the lung microbiome to reduce the severity of clinical symptoms during CF-associated exacerbations.Biofilm formationThe intractability of P. aeruginosa in CF has been largely at- tributed to the presence of mucoid alginate-producing strains in the later stages of infection Ramsey and Wozniak  Sousa and Periera  Winstanley O'Brien and Brockhurst .

For instance competition between P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia induces P. aeruginosa genes normally ex- pressed under iron-limited conditions including siderophores.

This is because a B. cepacia siderophore ornibactin which P. aeruginosa cannot use restricts iron availability to P. aeruginosa Weaver and Kolter .

aeruginosa and S. aureus display a striking negative cor- relation with one another as CF patients age Cystic Fibrosis Foundation  suggesting that P. aeruginosa can displace S. aureus in the later stages of infection.

This interaction between the host and P. aeruginosa enhances the clearance of S. aureus without significantly affecting the growth of P. aeruginosa.

Infection tends to occur subsequent to P. aeruginosa colonisation resulting in co-infections that trig- ger more severe clinical outcomes compared with P. aeruginosa or A. fumigatus alone Amin et al.
