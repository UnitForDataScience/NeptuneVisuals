2005.Functional Diversity of the P. xylostella Gut MicrobiotaMetaGene analysis revealed 15046 18324 and 18197 non- redundant protein-coding genes in the gut microbiota of the P. xylostella larva pupa and adult respectively Supplementary Table 3.

The high abundance of GH5cellulases in the P. xylostella gut microbiota may contribute to its adaptive capacity to feed on these plants specifically to maximize the extent to which these complex substrates are digested.A series of enzymes associated with cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis was found to be encoded by C. maltaromaticum and Enterobacter living in the P. xylostella gut including 14-beta-cellobiosidase endoglucanase and beta-glucosidase.

Thus we speculate that the abundance of aromatic compound degradation enzymes in the P. xylostella gut microbiota may have led to co-benefits for P. xylostella and its gut microbiota.Some plant phenolics such as phenol catechol chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are directly or indirectly toxic to herbivores by stimulating DNA degradation via the induction of reactive oxygen species ROS when they are oxidized Moran et al.

Further research is needed to identify thesepathways nevertheless our study opens an avenue for the study of nutrition interaction between P. xylostella and its gut bacteria.CONCLUSIONSOur study based on metagenomic analysis of P. xylostella gut microbiota using next-generation sequencing provides a detailed profile of taxonomic and functional information regarding theP.

This may be a unique phenomenon to P. xylostella leading to a new question does the same set of bacteria perform different functions during host development Future studies should include metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics to validate this phenomenon and thus clarify the expressions of functional genes of the gut in vivo.Our research combined with the previous P. xylostella genome studies indicates that its gut microbe complements its own genome allowing the resulting holobiont to function as an evolutionarily adaptive herbivore and assuming the status as one of the world's most serious pests.

Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by LSD post-hoc test using IBM SPSS Statistics 19.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompositional Diversity of the P. xylostellaGut MicrobiotaGut microbiota of P. xylostella larvae pupae and adults were sequenced.

Our results support the hypothesis that these microbiota enzymes have a potential ability to enhance resistance of P. xylostella gut to ROS.Amino Acid Synthesis in the Gut Microbiota of P. xylostellaAnimals cannot synthesize some essential amino acids and must therefore obtain them from food Hansen and Moran 2011.

xylostella gut microbiota a bar-coded pyrosequencing on the V3V5 of 16S rRNA region in different P. xylostella developmental stages of the gut microbiota was carried out see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
