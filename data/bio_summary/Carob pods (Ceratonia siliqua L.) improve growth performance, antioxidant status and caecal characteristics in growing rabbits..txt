Dietary groups were as follows C basal diet with no supplementation CP1 basal diet  2.5 carob pods CP2 basal diet  5 carob pods and CP3 basal diet  10 carob pods.

The increase in inclusion rate of carob pods signifi- cantly decreased feed intake whereas carob pods at 5 in the CP2 group recorded the best value of feed con- version ratio.

In conclusion 5 of carob pods in the diet stimulated the per- formance of growing rabbits and thus it has potential as an unconventional feed resource for rabbits without any adverse effects.Keywords carob pods digestibility of nutrients performance antioxidant activity caecal characteristics rabbitCorrespondence S.

Due to the afore- mentioned attributes of carob pods and its possible incorporation as an energy supplement in rabbit feed formulation it is possible that carob pods will beneficially alter gut microflora improve feed intake and efficiency and enhance performance characteris- tics in rabbits.

2016 who reported a signifi- cant decrease in NH3-N and total volatile fatty acids TVFA concentrations in goats supplemented with carob pods 100 ghday and an increase in TVFA concentrations in goats supplemented with carob pods 50 ghday compared with other groups.

Molar pro- portion  of propionic acid was insignificantly lower with carob pods 50 ghday experimental rations however acetic acid was higher p  0.05 with carob pods 50 ghday rations.

Future studies must be carried out to determine the nature and extent of specific components of polyphenols in carob pods with potential antimicrobial properties.ConclusionResults demonstrated that the inclusion of carob pods at 50 gkg enhanced antioxidant activity and had pos- itive effect on growth performance carcass character- istics and meat quality and reduced the internal pathogens.ReferencesAbdallah E.
