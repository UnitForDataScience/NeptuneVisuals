In particular the marginal analysis has power to detect an association between counts of OTUs in a cluster and survival times but virtually no power to detect associations between presenceabsence of clustered OTUs and survival or asso- ciations involving unclustered OTUs.

Accordingly the high significance of MiRKAT-S using K0.5 may indicate that one of those settings holds either moderately rare clusters of OTUs are driving the relationship between the microbiota and overall survival or multiple clusters of OTUs some of which are abundant and some of which are rare are associated with over- all survival.

Four simula-Ti lexp Xitb  g scale jAIZij5 0tion settings were considered varying 1 whether OTU abundance or the presenceabsence of OTUs was asso- ciated with the outcome and 2 whether phylogeneti- cally clustered or unclustered OTUs were associated with the outcome.In setting 1 the abundances of OTUs in one cluster on a phylogenetic tree were associated with survival time.

For example the lung micro- biota has been related to progression of idiopathic pul- monary fibrosis and the gut microbiota to overall survival after allogeneic blood and bone marrow trans- plant Additional OTU-level studies with survival out- comes have shown associations between the intestinal microbiota and development of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis in children.To address this critical gap in the literature in this paper we propose a test for association between the microbiota and censored survival outcomes MiRKAT-S account- ing for covariates and potential confounders.

Set- ting 2 is comparable to setting 1 when the associated cluster is common since in both cases the abundance of common OTUs is associated with survival times but it lacks setting 1's close phylogenetic relationship between associated OTUs.In setting 3 the presence or absence of each OTU in a cluster was associated with survival time.

We selected an abundant cluster containing 19.7 of all reads and a rare cluster containing 0.9 of all reads to be associated with exponentially distributed survival times through the model -logUiAs in setting 1 we simulated situations where an abundant cluster containing 19.7 of all reads was associated with the outcome and where a rare cluster containing 0.9 of all reads was associated with the outcome.Finally in setting 4 the presence or absence of 40 ran- domly selected OTUs was associated with the survival time.

However without further analysis we cannot determine which OTUs or clusters are associated with survival times in aGVHD patients.DiscussionWe propose MiRKAT-S for testing the association between the human microbiota and survival outcomes.

Therefore this kernel has highest power to detect rela- tionships between taxonomic profiles and overall survival that occur through moderately rare clusters of OTUs or through a combination of common and rare clusters of OTUs.

We wish to test whether taxonomic profiles Z are associated with survival time adjusting for covariates X.The most commonly used model for censored survival times is the Cox proportional hazards model due to its flexibility and relative robustness.
