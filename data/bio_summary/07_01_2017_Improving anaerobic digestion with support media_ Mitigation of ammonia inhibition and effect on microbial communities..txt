Furthermore ultimate CH4 and CO2 production yields in presence of activated carbon 1 was comparable to those obtained under non-inhibiting conditions while with activated carbon 2 they were respectively lowered by 17 and 4.

In presence of activated carbon 1 Methanoculleus became predominant earlier than without support while chitosan and activated carbon 2 limited its implantation.

In presence of activated carbon 1 lag time was reduced by 10 days while acti- vated carbon 2 led to an increase of 21 days of the lag time com- pared to inhibited digesters without support.

Interestingly this OTU became predominant earlier in presence of activated carbon 1 than with activated carbon 2.

Moreover compared to the digester without support zeolites did not enhance the emergence of Thermotogaceae.In presence of activated carbon 1 family Porphyromonadaceae predominance was relatively lower than in the digester incubated without support throughout the experiment However similarly to zeolites activated carbon 1 seemed to slightly enhance the emer- gence of families belonging to order Bacteroidales such as Marinil- abiaceae.

However despite the presence of these OTUs lower CH4 production performance was observed in the digester incubated with activated carbon 2.

While under non-inhibiting conditions acti- vated carbon 2 did not influence anaerobic digestion performance in presence of 19 gL of TAN its presence intensified TAN inhibitory effect.

Activated carbon 2 had a smaller surface 600 m2g than activated carbon 1 600-800 m2g.

Consistently with biogas kinetics both zeolites and acti- vated carbon 1 enhanced anaerobic degradation of these VFAs while activated carbon 2 and chitosan led to longer complete degradation times.
