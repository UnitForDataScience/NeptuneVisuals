1995 dunne 2002. thus mature dw biofilms may be a more accurate representa- tion of biofilms within building systems and hence more relevant in examining legionella colonization in premise plumbing systems.using approximately 20-month-old biofilms the results from this study indicated that cu dw biofilms inoculated with lpvv co-cultures exhibited temperature-dependent colonization of lp at high and persistent levels for up to 7 months fig.

2011 while in older mature bio- films 18 months old cu biofilm growth was two- to eightfold higher than pvc pe and ss biofilms wingen- der and flemming 2004. moreover legionella densities were initially higher in  250-day-old ss than in cubiofilms but after 24 months similar levels of legionella were observed within ss and cu biofilms suggesting the inhibitory effect of cu on legionella may be transient and reduced by the accumulation of corrosion products on the cu surfaces over time van der kooij et al.

fla grazing on stream water-derived biofilms and klebsiella pneumoniae pseudomonas fluorescens and staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were shown to alter overall morphology and microbial composition of their respective biofilms huws et al.

in con37degc biofilms the absence of lpvv and higher temperatures seemed to support a higher diversity of bacteria including gemmatimonadetes planctomycetes and d-proteobacteria sequences being more abundant compared to samples from the other three reactors table 1. moreover introduction of lpvv into cu dw biofilms seemed to result in a slight decrease in the group of bacterial operational taxonomic units otus that were detected at  1 each table 1 lpvv sam-relative abundance is shown for each reactor for all time points.

2013.notably mycobacterium avium m. intracellulare andabscessus other opportunistic water-based patho- gens have been shown to readily adhere and stably col- onize dw biofilms grown on glass stainless steel pvc and zinc-galvanized steel coupons mullis and falkin- ham 2013. their stable colonization and relatively high abundance within dw biofilms were supported in this study for cu surfaces as mycobacterium was found to be one of the top 20 indicator otus impacting overall diversity with relative abundance across all samples unaffected by temperature or lpvv colonization fig.

2007. thus in this study the ability of the partial 16srrna gene sequences to differentiate l. pneumophila from non-pneumophila legionella species was confirmed by comparing sequences against the ribosomal data- bases silva greengenes and rdp using 100 cut-off and similarity values for the analysis which yielded consistent results for each database.notably vv was not detected in any of the control bio- film samples and in inoculated reactors vv was detected only transiently in the lpvv37degc biofilms at day 4 and week 1 fig.

4c and could also be contributing exclusively to the relative abundance of 21 of acidobacteria bacte- rial phylum sequences observed for lpvv37degc samples table 1. notably a relatively high abundance 3-8 of mycobacterium-associated sequences was found in all reactors and they did not cluster with any particular reactor samples in the nmds plots indicating the organ- ism's ability to stably colonize dw cu biofilms regardless of temperature and pathogenhost colonization fig.

of the 96 biofilm samples 90 were pooled on an equal molar basis 200 ng and the remaining six samples with low-yield pcr products were pooled based on 'maximum volume' criteria maximum volume of the 90 samples which is 50 ll.

after laboratory inoculation of l. pneumophila into biofilm reactors operated at 20degc culturable l. pneumophila can persist for up to 4 weeks in pex- and cu-grown dw biofilms and up to 4 months in upvc-grown dw biofilms moritz et al.

however at the same temperature l. pneumophila culturability was not supported within cu dw biofilms compared to growth within polybutylene and cpvc dw biofilms yet at 40degcl.
