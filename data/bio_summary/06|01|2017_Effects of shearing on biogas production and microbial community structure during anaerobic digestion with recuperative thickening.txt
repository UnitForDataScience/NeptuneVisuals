error bars indicate standard deviation of duplicate samples collected from at day 55 and day 110 of experimental period for three anaerobic digesters digester 1 d1d55 and d1d110 digester 2 d2d55 and d2d110 and digester 3d3d55 and d3d110.then lowest in d3 from 2.1 in day 55 to 2.7 in day 110. syntro- phobacterales was a specialized group for metabolic function of short-chain fatty acid oxidation  .

duplicate samples collected from three anaerobic digesters at day 55 and day 110 of experimental period digester 1 d1d55 and d1d110 digester 2 d2d55 and d2d110 and digester 3 d3d55 and d3d110.microbial communities observed in d1 and d2 showed the increase of even distribution of the bacterial phylotypes from day 55 to day 110 the decrease of abundant phylotypes as well as increase of minor groups .

plotted values are mean of duplicate samples collected from three anaerobic digesters at day 55 and day 110 of experimental period digester 1 d1d55 and d1d110 digester 2 d2d55 and d2d110 and digester 3 d3d55 and d3d110.

in all cases the shearing process lasted 5 min.regeneration of the anaerobic digesterdue to the deteriorated digester performance caused by exces- sive or high shearing digester d3 was regenerated by renewing part of the biomass content with 5 l of digestate from a full scale wwtp at the beginning of the third experimental period.

compared to the control digester d1 digester d2 produced approximately 15 more biogas throughout the experiment periods  which is comparable to the 10 increase in biogas yield observed by when they conducted recuperative thick-ening experiment without any shearing.

biogas production from digester d3 was approximately 30 lower than that of the control digester d1 in the 1st experimental phase.

compared to the control digester d1 digester d2 with medium shearing showed similar tcod and scod removal efficiencies during the entire experimental periods from 1 to 4. this observation is consistent with the methane production activity of d1 and d2 .

it is also indi- cated that excessive or high level of shearing in digester d3 did not favour the bacteroidales and syntrophobaterales which worked as hydrolyzer and acetogens respectively in the anaerobic diges- tion process and led to reduced biogas production for digester d3 .

microbial analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing showed that medium shearing increased the evenness and diversity of the microbial community in the anaerobic digester which is consistent with the observed improved biogas production.

recuperative thickening can decouple the sludge retention time srt from the hydraulic retention time hrt by obtaining and thickening a pro- portion of the sludge and returning the thickened sludge to the digester  .

in other words recuperative thickening can allow for about 25 increase in anaerobic digestion capacity without any expansion of the digester volume .

operating conditions process configurations and substrate characteristics could lead to the variability in structure and func- tion of microbial population hence the performance of anaerobic digester system .

microbial community was also affected by the shear in the continuously stirred anaerobic digester  .

became more abundant in the intensely mixed digester.

compared to recupera- tive thickening operation by rotary drum or centrifuge in an upflow or continuously mixed anaerobic digester shearing takes place continuously but usually at the much lower intensity.
