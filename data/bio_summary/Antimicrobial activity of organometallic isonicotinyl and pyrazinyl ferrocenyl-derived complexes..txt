furthermore all these compounds when screened on several normal flora bacteria of humans showed no effect on the microbiome emphasizing the selection of these compounds for these pathogens.

compounds thattable 2 predicted log p values for 1-6 and isoniazidexhibit significant differences between the mic values ofdcydko and qcrba317t are believed to target this pathway.52 selected compounds were also screened in vitro for mam-malian cytotoxicity against chinese hamster ovarian cho cells using emetine as the control.

the minimum inhibitory concen- tration mic of compounds was determined in either 7h9 difco medium supplemented with 0.05 tween-80 0.2 gly- cerol and albuminnaclglucose adc complex andor in gast-fe glycerol-alanine-salts medium ph 6.6 sup- plemented with 0.05 tween-80.62 compounds were dissolved in dmso to a final stock concentration of 10 mm.

the antiplasmodial activities against the nf54 chloroquine-sensitive strain of plasmodium falciparum of some compounds were moderate while some complexes also showed prom- ising activity against trichomonas vaginalis.

the promising antimicrobial activities of the complexes thus sup- ports incorporation of ferrocene as part of existing antimicrobial therapies in order to alter their biological activities favorably.introductionthe development of organometallic compounds as potential medicinal agents has been on the rise for the past decade.1-3 although the field of bioorganometallic anticancer studies remains one of the most prevalent research areas recent advances in other fields have also generated scientific inter-adepartment of chemistry university of cape town rondebosch 7701 cape town south africa.

for example the replacement of an aromatic group in penicillin by ferrocene resulted in a com- pound comparable in activity to benzyl penicillin.56 ferrocene- containing compounds also exhibit antiproliferative activities.7-10 hydroxyferrocifen shows promising antiprolifera- tive activity against various breast cancer cell lines.

the data are pre- sented in table 1.all of the compounds were screened against m. tuberculosis h37rvgfp in two different growth media - the glycerol-based gast-fe which does not contain bovine serum albumin and a glucose-based middlebrook 7h9-adc which does contain bsa supplement - to elucidate any condition-selective antimy- cobacterial activity.

the majority of the compounds tested exhibited potent activity in gast-fe medium giving minimum inhibitory concentration mic90 and mic99 values lower than 1 um on day 14. isoniazid exhibited similar activity profiles in both media.

no signifi- cant differences in the mic values were observed between the two mutants unlike the control qcrb inhibitor suggesting that these compounds may not target the qcrb subunit of the respiratory bc1 complex in m. tuberculosis.
