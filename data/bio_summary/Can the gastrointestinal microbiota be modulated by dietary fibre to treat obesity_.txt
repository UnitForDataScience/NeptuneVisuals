although fmt is not the traditional obesity cure in humans mice models have time after time revealed positive results with fmt from lean to obese mice .gut microbiome and obesity mouse modelsmurine models are commonly used for gut microbial research for two main reasons 1 murine models make it easier to control for extrinsic factors and 2 the anatomy physiology and genetics between humans and murine are highly similar .

furthermore an overall poor microbial diversity was associated with obesity .unfortunately the studies investigating the microbial com- position in obese individuals have given highly inconsistent results.

the microbial signature in obese indi- viduals presented a similar degree of intra-individual variabil- ity to healthy individuals but obesity was associated with an overall poor microbial diversity compared to the lean partici- pants .

thus a better understanding of the cross-feeding interactions may be vital in developing dietary strategies to treat or prevent obesity or disease related to dysbiosis .fernandez et al.
