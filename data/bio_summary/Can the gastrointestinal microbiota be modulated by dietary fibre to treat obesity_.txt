It may be more valid to investigate the gut microbial metabolic pathways rather than the microbi- al variety and abundance in obese versus lean individuals or by having a closer look at the microbial composition at a lower taxonomic level.Human faecal microbiota transplantationFaecal microbiota transplantation FMT is a method whereof microbiota from healthy donors is engrafted into patients suf- fering from dysbiosis in attempt to establish a homeostatic microbiome.

Hypothetically personalised drug andor dietary treatment could be applied to manipulate an individual's gut microbial composition and abundance to promote a more health supportive microbial structure.Gut microbial signature in obese humansThe Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes are the main favourable bacterial communities found in the human gut.

Thus a better understanding of the cross-feeding interactions may be vital in developing dietary strategies to treat or prevent obesity or disease related to dysbiosis .Fernandez et al.
