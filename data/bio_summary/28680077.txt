The sufficiency of P is a concern because of it's essential role in plant growth the finite availability of P-rock for fertilizer production and the poor plant availability of soil P. This study investigated whether biofertilizers and bioenhancers such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF and their associated bacteria could enhance growth and P uptake in maize.

The abundant plant root-associated microbiota represents one sustainable strategy for the exploitation and mobilization of the soil P pool.Arbuscular mycorrhizal AM fungi AMF Glomeromycota are important beneficial soil microorganisms establishing mutualistic associations with most food crops.

AMF mycorrhizal networks may differentially affect P and N supply to host plants depending on their structural and functional properties- including the occurrence and differential expression of P transporter and N assimilation fungal genes-.

email mycorrhizal plants is also the result of hyphal P uptake beyond the P depletion zone caused by the fast root absorption of P from the soil solution which cannot be rapidly replenished given the poor mobility of P in the soil .

Recently a culture-dependent approach allowed the isolation in pure culture of 374 bacterial strains strictly associated with Rhizophagus irregularis for- merly Glomus intraradices spores and the selection of Actinobacteria Bacillaceae and Sinorhizobium meliloti strains showing several PGP activities including P mineralization from phytate and mineral P solubilization.This work for the first time investigated to which degree growth and P uptake of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal maize plants would benefit from inoculation with a selection of bacterial strains isolated from AMF spores showing multiple PGP activities in vitro.

Bacterial inoculation had no effects on mycorrhizal colonization which ranged from 78 to 87 in Exp.
