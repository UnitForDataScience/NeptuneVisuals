Indeed a large array of bacteria belonging to different genera was reported to indirectly improve P uptake by altering root architecture through IAA production.In conclusion root colonization by AMF produced large plant growth responses while seven bacterial strains further facilitated root growth and P uptake by promoting the development of AMF extraradical mycelium.

While AM colonization resulted in large plant growth responses the bacteria inoculants increased the abundance of AMF hyphae in soil and four of them also root P content and dry weight.ResultsRoot growth and AMF abundance in roots and hyphal compartment soil.

The key role of the root-external mycelium in AMF effects on plant P uptake was confirmed by the large uptake of 32P or 33P from the root free HC into shoots this uptake corresponded to 12-15 and 4-9 of the radioactivity that had been added to and equilibrated with the native P pools in the HC soil in Exp.

The sufficiency of P is a concern because of it's essential role in plant growth the finite availability of P-rock for fertilizer production and the poor plant availability of soil P. This study investigated whether biofertilizers and bioenhancers such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF and their associated bacteria could enhance growth and P uptake in maize.

Root colonization by AMF produced large plant growth responses while seven bacterial strains further facilitated root growth and P uptake by promoting the development of AMF extraradical mycelium.

Here the labelling of HC soil with radioactive P 32P or 33P made it possible to distinguish between P uptake by AM hyphae and P uptake by roots and hyphae in combination and to detect a wide variation among the bacterial strains in their ability to improve P uptake via mycorrhizal pathway.

The soil was a local low P sandy loam and had the fol- lowing characteristics 10 clay 12 silt 46 fine sand 30 coarse sand 1.2 total Organic Carbon 10 mg P kg-1 0.5 M NaHCO3 extractable P. In order to ensure an adequacy of all nutrients but P the growth medium hereafter called soil was supplemented with basal nutrients minus P. Soil for the HC was uniformly labelled with 5 kBq g-1 soil of carrier-free H332PO4.

1Treatment with four biological replicates 2Treatment with three biological replicates.only to AMF spores but also to plant roots further studies could show whether their effects on plant growth and P uptake are maintained when inoculated far from the roots for example in the root-free compartment.The influence of bacterial inoculation on the AMF-mediated P uptake from the HC was further supported by the significant positive correlation between shoot P content and shoot 32P.

Labelling of HC soil with radioactive P 32P or 33P made it possible to distinguish between P uptake by AM hyphae and P uptake by roots and hyphae in combination.

email mycorrhizal plants is also the result of hyphal P uptake beyond the P depletion zone caused by the fast root absorption of P from the soil solution which cannot be rapidly replenished given the poor mobility of P in the soil .
