Indicates patients who went into remission at 2 weeks  indicates patients who went into remission at 6 weeks.Compositional changes in microbiotaPrincipal coordinate analysis PCoA was undertaken for all samples following analysis through application of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity 4A BC compositional dissimilarity between samples unweighted UniFrac 4B UU diversity between samples incorporating relative relatedness and weighted UniFrac 4C WU diversity between samples incorporating relative relatedness and relative abundance.Both Bray-Curtis and UniFrac PCoA revealed high similarity between patient 1 at diagnosis and their sibling control and patient 3 at diagnosis and their sibling control.Patients with CD or UC showed a distinct shift on PCoA BC UU and WU from diagnosis to treatment.

For example the metabolic pathway associated with purine metabolism first pathway on x-axis displayed the greatest loss of function in TN samples compared to both control samples and samples from patients in remission.

All patients provided fecal samples before commencement of bowel preparation for diagnostic endoscopy and further fecal samples at 2 weeks median 14 days range 12-25 days and 6 weeks median 41 days range 36-49 days after commence- ment of treatment.

It should be noted that the microbiota of fecal samples may be influenced by bowel preparation medication up to 2 to 4 weeks after administration.Some studies have followed children with CD from diagnosis through treatment with EEN.141630 Most of these studies have reported a decrease in diversity during treatment with EEN our results demonstrate a different pattern over the period of EEN with an increase in diversity peaking at 2 weeks.

A Observed species for individual patients across treatment B Chao1 diversity for individual patients across treatment C Shannon diversity for individual patients across treatment.

A unit of 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline30 glycerol solution was added and samples were further homogenized using sterile glass beads and vortex these samples were then frozen immediately at-80 degC in 450-mL aliquots.DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene sequencingDeoxyribonucleic acid DNA was extracted using MP Biomedi- cal Santa Ana California Feces Extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.

This details the most common species seen across all samples and the relationship between samples and bacteria.Figure 1.

Comparison of TN patients at diagnosis with control samples and with samples from the patients in remission showed significantly different metabolic function across the 147 KEGG pathways identified as assessed by gene copy number P .038 and .027 respectively .

Genes involved in both amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism specifically starch sucrose fructose and mannose metabolism were less abundant in the pretreat- ment samples when the disease was active than in the later samples taken during remission.

High concentrations of lactate which has been implicated in UC were observed in the pretreatment samples forthis patient only.It is worth noting that SCFA detection in fecal samples is affected by both production and absorption of SCFAs in the large intestine.
