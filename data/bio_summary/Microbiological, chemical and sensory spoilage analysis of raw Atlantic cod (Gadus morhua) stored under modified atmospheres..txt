the limit of 7.0 log cfug was exceeded after 2 days under air storage at 4 oc whereas at both map conditions this limit was reached within 2 days at 8 oc and 4 days at 4 oc.

on the later days of storage over 88 was detected under both map conditions at 4 oc.under ma conditions the relative abundance of photobacterium was highest during intermediate storage and decreased to some extent by the end of storage thus increasing community diversity supplementary table 4. at higher storage temperature 8 oc photobacterium decreased from 78 to 60 under h8 and 65 to 46under l8 under these conditions acinetobacter brochothrix and carnobacterium were also able to grow.

shelf life of fish is affected by several factors including storage temperature fish species initial microbial contamination and packaging conditions  .

generally more rapid growth was observed on all tested media under air when compared to the map conditions at the respective storage temperature 4 oc.
