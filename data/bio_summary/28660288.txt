in this study the bacterial commu- nity inhabiting the rhizosphere of rice plants cultivated with different water regimes in an unpolluted soil has been inves- tigated in order to identify specific populations responsible for as contamination of rice grains.materials and methodsexperimental setupnine rice paddy macrocosms containing 10-15 rice plants oryza sativa subsp.

this evidence strongly indicates an active role of the rhizosphere microbiota in driving arsenic biogeochemistry in rice paddies influenced by water management explaining amounts and speciation of arsenic often found in rice grains.keywords rice rhizosphere microbiota .

in accordance with the increase of dasrb and asmb in cf and cf-d water re- gimes higher asiii concentrations were detected in the cor- responding soil pore water and higher methylated as was detected in the corresponding rice grains.together these outcomes indicate a dramatic effect of wa- ter management of rice paddies in shaping the rhizosphere microbiota.

bacteria belonging to the class deltaproteobacteria were se- lected by cf accounting for 4.5 and 6 of the total commu- nity in cf rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane fig.
