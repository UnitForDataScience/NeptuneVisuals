In this study the bacterial commu- nity inhabiting the rhizosphere of rice plants cultivated with different water regimes in an unpolluted soil has been inves- tigated in order to identify specific populations responsible for As contamination of rice grains.Materials and methodsExperimental setupNine rice paddy macrocosms containing 10-15 rice plants Oryza sativa subsp.

Values are shown for the original soil T0 rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane treated under continuous flooding CF RS and CF RP under CF with 14 days of drainage before flowering CF-D RS and CF-D RP and under watering every 10 days D RS and D RPOTUs with D treatments with respect to 3 with CF.

Methylated As forms represented 46 of total As in CF and 18 in CF-D and they were negligible in D Zecchin et al.

The rarefaction analysis per- formed on the observed species confirmed the ACE trend with the diversity within the samples decreasing as follows CF rhizoplane  CF-D rhizoplane  CF rhizosphere soil  T0 D rhizosphere soil  CF-D rhizosphere soil  D rhizoplane Fig.

In accordance with the increase of DAsRB and AsMB in CF and CF-D water re- gimes higher AsIII concentrations were detected in the cor- responding soil pore water and higher methylated As was detected in the corresponding rice grains.Together these outcomes indicate a dramatic effect of wa- ter management of rice paddies in shaping the rhizosphere microbiota.

Organic As constituted almost 50 of total As in rice grains in CF condition in the same experimental set up Zecchin et al.

The mobilization of As in pore water in CF agronomic schemes has been recently proven to lead to As enrichment of rice grains if compared to the CF-D and D ones Zecchin et al.

Recent studies indicated that rice roots microbiome is entirely responsible for the production of meth- ylated As present in rice grains which accounts for 50 of total As content Lomax et al.

This evidence strongly indicates an active role of the rhizosphere microbiota in driving arsenic biogeochemistry in rice paddies influenced by water management explaining amounts and speciation of arsenic often found in rice grains.Keywords Rice rhizosphere microbiota .

Bacteria belonging to the class Deltaproteobacteria were se- lected by CF accounting for 4.5 and 6 of the total commu- nity in CF rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane Fig.
