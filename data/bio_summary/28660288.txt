Values are shown for the original soil T0 rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane treated under continuous flooding CF RS and CF RP under CF with 14 days of drainage before flowering CF-D RS and CF-D RP and under watering every 10 days D RS and D RPOTUs with D treatments with respect to 3 with CF.

The rarefaction analysis per- formed on the observed species confirmed the ACE trend with the diversity within the samples decreasing as follows CF rhizoplane  CF-D rhizoplane  CF rhizosphere soil  T0 D rhizosphere soil  CF-D rhizosphere soil  D rhizoplane Fig.

Methylated As forms represented 46 of total As in CF and 18 in CF-D and they were negligible in D Zecchin et al.

In this study the bacterial commu- nity inhabiting the rhizosphere of rice plants cultivated with different water regimes in an unpolluted soil has been inves- tigated in order to identify specific populations responsible for As contamination of rice grains.Materials and methodsExperimental setupNine rice paddy macrocosms containing 10-15 rice plants Oryza sativa subsp.

The mobilization of As in pore water in CF agronomic schemes has been recently proven to lead to As enrichment of rice grains if compared to the CF-D and D ones Zecchin et al.

In accordance with the increase of DAsRB and AsMB in CF and CF-D water re- gimes higher AsIII concentrations were detected in the cor- responding soil pore water and higher methylated As was detected in the corresponding rice grains.Together these outcomes indicate a dramatic effect of wa- ter management of rice paddies in shaping the rhizosphere microbiota.

Within these members the genus Sphingomonas accounted for 17 in both compartment.In both compartments of D the two most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria respectively account- ing for 53.68 and 31.31 in D rhizosphere soil and 60.56 and 25.25 in D rhizoplane Fig.
