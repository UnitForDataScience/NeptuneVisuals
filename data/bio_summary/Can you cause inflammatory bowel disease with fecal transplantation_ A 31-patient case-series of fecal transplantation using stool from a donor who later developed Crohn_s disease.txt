While our current understanding of the etiology of Crohn's dis- ease emphasizes the defective recognition tolerance or elimination of microbiota the causal role of irregular gut microbiota in the development of Crohn's disease is unclear.Despite extensive research the chicken or egg conundrum persists Do abnormal microbiota elicit and sustain an inappropriate immune response in genetically susceptible hosts or do unrelenting inflammatory processes create a pathologic milieu that selects for abnormal microbial communities Promis- ing data from FMT studies in ulcerative colitis suggest that microbial alterations can induce remission in inflammatory bowel disease IBD raising the concern that unfavorable changes could also cause disease in other contexts.While there is a paucity of human data evaluating the risks of such unfavorable changes animal studies suggest that in genetically predisposed germ-free mice transfer of dysbiotic microbiota can induce terminal ileitis or colitis.We report a novel case-series of patients who received FMT for recurrent Clostridium difficile infec- tions from a donor who was later diagnosed withileocolonic Crohn's disease.

In Crohn's disease dysbiotic gut microbiota are charac- terized by decreases in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes with increases in Gammaproteobacteria.

Five patients had pre-existing IBD 3 ulcerative colitis 2 Crohn's disease and 7 were immunocompromised .

Among the pre-existing IBD patients 1 UC patient and 1 Crohn's patient had significant improve- ment in clinical and endoscopic disease activity post- FMT while 3 had unchanged IBD symptoms.

Moreover when banking universal donor material consideration should be given to quarantining before usage - as practiced by stool banks - to allow for identification of latent disease and to increase the safety of FMT.Disclosure of potential conflicts of interestEliseo Papa Mark Smith and Zain Kassam are consultants for Finch Therapeutics.
