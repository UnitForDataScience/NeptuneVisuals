REVIEW ARTICLEOPENThe gut-brain axis is intestinal inflammation a silent driver of Parkinson's disease pathogenesisMadelyn C. Houser1 and Malu G. Tansey1INTRODUCTIONThere is growing awareness within the scientific and medical communities of the strong connection between the status of the intestinal environment and the function of the central nervous system CNS.

Here we focus on the potential for intestinal health to impact the brain and review evidence supporting the possibility that chronic intestinal inflammation may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease PD.Mechanisms of intestinal modulation of CNS activityNumerous mechanisms mediate correspondence between the brain and the intestine.
