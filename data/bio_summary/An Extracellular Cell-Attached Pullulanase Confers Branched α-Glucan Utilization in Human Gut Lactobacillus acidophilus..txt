The supernatants from the growth experiments were assayed for pullulanase activity using the standard reducing sugar assay described below whereas the cells were washed twice with 0.9 NaCl before measurements of pullulanase activity described below.Additional growth experiments were performed to compare the growth of L. acidophilus NCFM to those of L. acidophilus DSM-20242 which possesses identical organization of the maltodextrin utilization cluster as L. acidophilus NCFM and is used as a control and L. acidophilus DSM-9126 which possesses a typical maltodextrin utilization locus and lacks the inserted transposase present in both L. acidophilus NCFM and DSM-20242.

In short 1.1-ml reaction mixtures containing substrate 0.225 mg ml-1 pullulan for specific activity 0.02 to 1 mg ml-1 pullulan and 0.1 to 10 mg ml-1 potato amylopectin dissolved in 8 volvol dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO or 0.225 to 9 mg ml-1 -limit dextrin for kinetic analysis and LaPul1314 0.05 to 1.5 nM in assay buffer 20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 5 mM CaCl2 0.005 Triton X-100 were incubated at 37degC and aliquots 200 ul for pullulan and 100 ul for amylopectin and -limit dextrin were removed at five time points 3 6 9 12 and 15 min and added to 500 ul stop solutions 0.4 M sodium carbonate pH 10.7 2.5 mM CuSO2 2.5 mM 44-dicarboxy-12-biquinoline 6 mM L-serine.

After each run the column was regenerated with a constant concentration of 0.1 M NaOH and 400 mM sodium acetate for 5 min followed by a gradient from 400 mM to 37.5 mM sodium acetate over 5 min and finally an equilibration with 37.5 mM sodium acetate and 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min.Construction of LBA1710 LaPul1314 deletion mutant.

The inactivation of the gene encoding this enzyme abolished the cell-attached pullu- lanase activity providing compelling evidence that LaPul1314 is the sole extracellular a-glucan-debranching enzyme in L. acidophilus NCFM .The gene encoding LaPul1314 resides on a separate locus than that of themaltodextrin utilization cluster .

B Cell-associated pullulan-hydrolyzing activity of cells har- vested after 10 h of growth.maltotriose and maltotetraose were also taken up albeit at a considerably lower rate .To verify that the measured cell-associated pullulan-hydrolyzing activity stems from LaPul1314 the gene encoding this enzyme was deleted and the L. acidophilus NCFM gene knockout KO strain was grown on glucose or maltose.

The prevalence of this domain in the S-layer exoproteome of distinct lactobacilli is also in agreement with this role .In this study we present the functional characterization of the SLAP domain- containing enzyme from L. acidophilus NCFM that is active on starch-derived dietary glucans.TABLE 2 Binding of cyclodextrins to LaPul1314 determined by surface plasmon resonanceLaPul1314 is a cell-attached debranching enzyme that exclusively confers the utilization of branched O-glucans in L. acidophilus.

The products were quantified based on peak areas from HPAEC-PAD analysis which was performed as described above.The described standard reducing sugar assay was also used to determine the pullulanase activity in the L. acidophilus culture supernatant and in the washed cell pellets with the following exceptions cells from 1 ml of culture in the late log phase see above were resuspended in 600 ul preheated 37degC pullulan solution 0.4 mg ml-1 pullulan 40 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0 0.5 mM CaCl2 0.005 volvol Triton X-100 while 100 ul culture supernatant was mixed with 500 ul 0.48-mg ml-1 pullulan solution.
