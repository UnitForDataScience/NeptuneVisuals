The initial oven temperature was held at 50 degC for 2 min ramped to 70 degC at a rate of 10 degC min-1 to 85 degC at a rate of 3 degC min-1 to 110 degC at a rate of 5 degC min-1 to 290 degC at a rate of 30 degC min and finally held at 290 degC for 8 min.

Interestingly while gas production and drops in pH were more intense in the initial 4 h of FOS fermentation for the glucans most of the gas production A and pH reduction B occurred after 8 and 4 h of fermentation respectively.This tendency of the insoluble glucans towards a slower fermenta- tion profile compared to FOS was also observed for SCFA production A-D. Glucans A and B presented progressive increases in acetate and propionate production at all time points and in butyrate produc- tion especially after 8 h fermentation while the production of all three SCFAs from FOS was more intense in the initial 4 h fermentation A-C.At 24 h fermentation acetate production rates for glucans A and B were similar and significantly lower than for FOS 46 A.

A comparable tendency was ob- served in FOS ferments which presented a similar bacterial composi- tion from 4 to 24 h. On the other hand the fermentation of Glucans A and B led to progressive shifts in bacterial composition at all timepoints presenting very distinct bacterial populations from the blank and FOS in the 24 h ferments A.Major changes in bacterial groups are visualized in B. Bac- teroides uniformis in the Bacteroidetes phylum presented large in- creases in the glucan ferments reaching a population 8.1-8.3 fold higher than the blank at 24 h to represent around 22 of the total bacterial population.

In 24 h fermentation Bacter- oidetes and Firmicutes reached 27.2 and 14.5 fold increaserespectively for Glucan A and 16.7 and 22.0 fold increase for Glucan B compared to initial bacterial populations.Due to the high proportions of butyrate observed during Glucan A and B fermentation as well as the marked increase in the Firmicutes phylum the high butyrogenic Clostridium cluster XIVa and a butyrate- producing representative from its cluster E. rectale were also eval- uated.

The removal of lateral side chains from the 1 - 3 1 - 6-linked b-D-glucan generated a faster fermentation profile with the linear 1 - 3-linked b-D-glucan ferments promoting higher Clostridium cluster XIVa populations at 24 h fermentation.

Moreover Glucans A and B led to a proportionally higher production of butyrate and propionate and lower production of acetate compared to FOS .Bacterial shifts during in vitro fecal fermentationFirmicutes and Bacteroidetes which usually are the most abundant phyla in the human gut microbiome as well as the highly butyrogenic Clostridium cluster XIVa and a representative species from its cluster E.Fig.

Expression increases of 58.8 and 71.9 fold were observed in Clostridium cluster XIVa for Glucans A and B respectively but not for FOS or the blank at 24 h fermentation.

Although some members of this cluster such as Blautia Ruminococcus and other species from the Lach- nospiraceae family presented small decreases the final counterbalance remained positive around 10 and 16 higher for Glucans A and B respectively than the Clostridium cluster XIVa population in the blank at 24 h.DiscussionThe selective modulation observed in bacterial groups as well as metabolites produced after in vitro fecal fermentation of glucans from C. speciosa is distinct from changes observed with fructooligosaccharides.

These glucans are widely found among different edible mushrooms             and further human studies could be con- ducted to test whether the consumption of these glucan sources as a dietetic approach could be used for the augmentation of the Clostridium cluster XIVa population in the human gut.ConclusionsGlucans obtained from C. speciosa were highly butyrogenic and propiogenic with low gas production during in vitro fecal fermentation and led to distinct bacterial shifts compared to FOS.
