Because diet appears to drive inter-group differences in the gut microbiota of black howler monkeys  we controlled for social group in our analyses to try to address the potential effect of diet on our results but including diet directly into our analyses might provide stronger results.Overall our data suggest that even in arboreal primates that live in small social groups and spend a relatively low propor- tion of their time in physical contact social interactions are associated with variation in gut microbiota composition.

Because kinship and social contact can influence the composition of the gut microbiota - these factors must be considered in addition to diet when examining differ- ences in gut microbiota composition among populations of the same host species.For social animals many of the same factors are likely to drive spatial patterns in gut microbiota composition within populations.

Specifically for species or individuals within a species that live in larger social groups and spend more time in social contact social interactions should be a stronger factor in determining gut microbiota composition.

Non-human primates are a par- ticularly good model due to their complex social systems and a wealth of available behavioral data.In several species of wild non-human primates differences in the gut microbiota have been reported among neighboring social groups  - and recent studies provide impor- tant baseline data describing the role of kinship and social interactions in driving these patterns.

Additionally a study of 48 baboons Papio cynocephalus found that con- trolling for host kinship baboons that spent the most time grooming during social contact also exhibited more similar gut microbial communities .While grooming is crucial for building and maintaining social relationships in both baboons and chimpanzees  these data suggest it may also be important for shaping the composition of the gut microbiota which in turn can influ- ence host nutrition health and behavior   .

Therefore understanding the relationship between social contact and the gut microbiota may contribute to broader theories regarding primate socioecology and the evolution of social behavior.

Currently no published study ad- dresses this topic.Therefore in an effort to contribute to an understanding of host-gut microbe dynamics across the primate radiation we explore the effect of kinship and social interactions on the gut microbiota of wild black howler monkeys Alouatta pigra belonging to five social groups in Palenque National Park Mexico.

None of the microbial genera we selected a priori showed a strong effect of kinship either Table .We also found that time spent in social contact 0 m had no relationship with gut microbiota similarity betweenindividuals within a given social group controlling for kin- ship.

Diet influ- ences the howler monkey gut microbiota across habitats and seasons and social groups of howler monkeys have distinct gut microbiota compositions that are correlated to diet.
