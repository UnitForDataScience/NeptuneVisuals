The results of XRD showed that although the per- centages of CuFeS2 were 80.64 75.27 and 74.80 in C CP and CS respectively the mass of residue was the maximum in C group 1.68 g second was in CS group 1.14 g and was the minimum in CP group only 0.81 g. Furthermore FeS2 was almost not detected in CP and CS group while it still occupied 3.45 in C group.

The ferrous ions of all groups increased first to 500-600 mgL and then decreased rap- idly however this process ended earlier in CP group on day 6.There are two key points of these results 1 the pH value in CP and CS group had two decreasing period while that in C group had only one 2 the concentration of ferric ions in CP and CS group had two increasing periods while that in C group had only one.Analysis variation of microbial community composition and dynamicsTo explore the changes of microbial community structure in the solution and on the ore surface in detail we deter- mined time profiles using the real-time PCR as a surrogate of relative abundance.

The pH value was lower in CS than that in C group leading to higher amount of F. thermophi- lum in CS group Fig.

Compared with C group additions of pyrite or sphalerite improved the proportion of sulfur in CP and CS groups which indicated that more element sulfur or thiosulfate might be generated in these two groups leading to more protons generation thus pH was lower in CP and CS groups.

The results suggested that pyrite might accelerate chalcopyrite bioleaching process while sphalerite would inhibit the process.Variation of physical and chemical parameterswith additional pyrite or sphalerite during chalcopyrite bioleachingThe pH value increased during the process of acid leaching with sulfuric acid adjusted to 2.0.

d. The amount of S. thermosulfi- dooxidans was similar in these C and CS groups which was higher than that in CP group.

Dissimilarly copper extraction efficiencies were similar between C group and CS group before day 9 however it was significantly lower in CS group 29.0 than C group 35.4 on day 12.

Compared with C group the concentra- tions of ferric ions were higher in both CP and CS group but they increased more quickly in CP group and slowly in CS group than that in C group.

However the results of XRD in CP and CS group showed that FeS2 was almost little and CuFeS2 still remain much even ZnS also remained in CS group.

The results showed that the addition of pyrite or sphalerite changed the microbial community com- position and dynamics dramatically during the chalcopyrite bioleaching process.
