much effort continues to be expended in identifying characteristics of the host- bacteria interactions that are critical for maintaining a healthy oral microbiome 350. as importantly current concepts of the transition of the ecology from health to disease now emphasize forces that can drive a change in the balance of the oral micro- biome resulting in a 'dysbiosis' that can trigger a disease process 350. it still remains ill-defined how this dysbiosis is created and whether this is primar- ily being driven by an emergence of pathogenic bacteria in the subgingival ecology andor stimula- tion of a dysregulated host innate and inflammatory response that is modulated by genetic and epige- netic predisposition as well as by patient-modifi- able factors including smoking diet diabetes and stress 350. an interesting new perspective has arisen regarding the concept of microbial genome- wide association studies related to enhancing the understanding of population variation in expressing disease related to complex microbiomes 522. while some historical data in the field of periodontal microbiology and pathogenesis have proposed a potential importance of clonal diversity within the putative periodontal pathogens as an explanation for disease or no disease in the presence of these targeted species 504 674 679 beyond the data derived regarding high leukotoxin production witha.

although data from clinical and radiographic assessments are important they are lim- ited in human studies to parameters associated with periodontal destruction and do not provide informa- tion regarding the earliest changes associated with disease transition progression or resolution.the use of biologically based thresholds as adjuncts in periodontal disease is critically important for advancing the field based upon the followingbiological measures are consistently recognized in other diseases to enhance the understanding and management of disease.the findings can provide critical baseline evidence enabling innovative processes for decision making regarding periodontal monitoring and therapy.the findings will lead to improved management of periodontal disease through identification of defined biosignatures that associate with disease stage.the biosignatures could result in earlier individual- ized therapies afforded to persons not responding to care 74 680.sophisticated data analysis with novel pattern recognition tools will help determine the effective- ness and value of the biosignatures.importantly these personalized biosignatures will enable improved preemptive care by detecting markers predictive of progressing disease before clinical symptoms arise to effect change more rapidly in chronic disease-management strategies for individual patients.

while useful a majority of existing classifica- tion techniques and previous studies have clear limi- tations as they i used the same set of features as representative of the samples within and between the disease groups of interest ii focused on discerning the 'average variation' between disease groups with- out sufficient insights into potential variations within the disease groups and iii investigated changes between the disease groups at a single scale e.g.

current data from humans to identify these 'stage specific' responses are substan- tially hampered by the lack of capacity to identify 'truly unaffected' subjects for genome-wide associa- tion studies or other types of studies when including subjects 35-50 years of age as healthy who may develop disease at 60 or 70 years of age 130 131 162 as well as the vast majority of translational stud- ies that sample human patients via identification of clinical disease parameters with limited ability to determine whether the site-specific disease has just started has peakedplateaued or has stabilized and is resolving 23 64 680. the need to identify biosigna- tures associated with periodontal disease staging and progression would be predicted to shift the current paradigm and clinical focus from sole use of visual assessments to the use of adjunctive biologic markers that will allow for new approaches in periodontal dis- ease management.

furthermore the stochasticity of the feasible solutions algorithm allows it to produce multiple candidate gene sets for researchers to further con- sider as possible biosignatures for disease that could contribute additional insights into biologic pathway profiles underpinning the risk of periodontal tissue destruction.the modern approach for personalizing care with respect to periodontal disease will probably require the use of a greater number of clinical and biological strategies that provide insight into the dynamics of the disease process.

the initial peri- odontal therapy is generally successful in improving clinical measures of disease but assumes that all patients will respond in the same way 268 295. fur- thermore the clinical measures of periodontal dis- ease status including probing pocket depth bleeding upon probing and calculated measures of loss of attachment reflect a macroscopic history of disease progression rather than a more precise measure of real-time changes of inflammation or advancing peri- odontitis 295.substantial work has been undertaken to identify risk factorsmarkers for periodontal disease progres- sion.

the test is uti- lized as a personal risk-assessment tool for periodontitis myperioidr however interpretation of these types of gene polymorphisms and how they should impact treatment decisions and modalities in affected patients remains equivocal.periodontal disease pathogenesis is not solely dependent on the quantity and quality of the bacte- rial burden but is influenced by complex gene and environmental interactions such as aging smoking and nutrition 448. these interactions determine susceptibility of the host and regulate the sequence of inflammatory processes in periodontal diseases 364 534. epigenetics is an area of science that studies the interface between genetic and environmental factors which give rise to a certain phenotype 40. recent studies have identified increased methylation in cer- tain genes in patients with chronic periodontitis and underpinned epigenetic changes in response to bac- teria and inflammatory processes in periodontal tis- sues 47 146 412 595 647 693. these epigenetic changes may be crucial in explaining critical conceptsin periodontal disease such as susceptibility clinical heterogeneity disease progression and response to treatment.

as this autoimmune disease has clear susceptibility genes the interaction of a 'risk' gut microbial dysbiosis with the extensive immune system in the gut probably contributes to progression of this disease 562. related to the gut microbiome low diversity and resi- lience has been described in diabetic patients.

in both rheumatic disease 2 and alz- heimer's disease 356 there exists the concept of an altered gut microbiome contributing to a 'leaky gut'enabling more robust translocation of bacteria and lodging of bacteria in tissues to induce destructive inflammatory responses.

additionally a sizable effort continues to be expended in strategies to characterize the currently existing 'uncultivable' members of the oral micro- biome 137 269 580. as the breadth of oral bacterial genera and species in the human population contin- ues to expand challenges evolve in trying to delineate bacteria in disease variances within an individual and changes in the microbiome that trigger or respond to the disease process.

analyses of the oral microbial ecology in periodontitis have also incorporated various con- founders including aging diabetes rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease and even sex as potentially modifying the oral microbiome in health and disease 52 133 157 178 374 375 404. often alterations in the distribution of putative oral patho- gens have been observed with these systemic con- founders.

thus an important newer initiative is identifying novel bioin- formatics approaches to help visualize and interpret the diversity of the metagenomics signatures in healthy and diseased sulci 456 as well as the meta- transciptomic patterns that are needed to provide clear insights into the biology of the host-bacteria interactions in health and disease 312. recent stud- ies have also attempted to document the importance of a clearer understanding of functional genomics by identifying unique biologic signatures of the microbiome in stable sites vs. sites with progressing periodontitis 140 141 and by identifying gene expression changes in individual bacterial species that could enhance the dysbiotic disease process trig- gering destruction of the periodontal structures 248 250 251.as additional information has been obtained pro- viding substantial detail regarding the complexity of the human oral microbiome various conceptscontinue to evolve.

however there are as yet no definitive data in humans demonstrating that an individual bacterial species can elicit the range of tissue changes reflecting pro- gressing periodontal destruction and this is consis- tent with the identification of a complex of bacterial species in biofilms that 'accompany the transition' from a healthy oral environment to gingivitis and to periodontal disease 30 178 620. nevertheless the results of studies carried out in the last 30 years have provided evidence delineating the likely role of sev- eral bacterial species in the complex biofilms associ- ated with the progression of periodontal disease.

thus this bac- terium has the capacity to contribute multiple properties to the characteristics of the microenviron- mental milieu of the biofilm that could enhance dis- ease processes.aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was ini- tially described in oral samples in the 1970s and doc- umented in association with disease in young adults with generalized severe bone loss 683. since that time this species transitioning from actinobacillus to hemophilus to aggregatibacter genera has consis- tently been associated with severe forms of periodon- titis related to early-onset and localized disease 554. additional species of bacteria have also been fre- quently associated with the biofilms of periodontitis with varied predictive roles in the process.

while a. actinomycetemcomitans has routinely been documented in disease sites of patients with localized aggressive periodontitis and is consistentwith an identification of an etiologic agent in this disease fine et al.
