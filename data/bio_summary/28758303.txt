Although data from clinical and radiographic assessments are important they are lim- ited in human studies to parameters associated with periodontal destruction and do not provide informa- tion regarding the earliest changes associated with disease transition progression or resolution.The use of biologically based thresholds as adjuncts in periodontal disease is critically important for advancing the field based upon the followingbiological measures are consistently recognized in other diseases to enhance the understanding and management of disease.the findings can provide critical baseline evidence enabling innovative processes for decision making regarding periodontal monitoring and therapy.the findings will lead to improved management of periodontal disease through identification of defined biosignatures that associate with disease stage.the biosignatures could result in earlier individual- ized therapies afforded to persons not responding to care 74 680.sophisticated data analysis with novel pattern recognition tools will help determine the effective- ness and value of the biosignatures.Importantly these personalized biosignatures will enable improved preemptive care by detecting markers predictive of progressing disease before clinical symptoms arise to effect change more rapidly in chronic disease-management strategies for individual patients.

Use of the Human Oral Microbe Identifica- tion Microarray provided a description of these spe- cies within a more specific phylotype ecology representing responsiveness to therapy.Active current research targets with the oral micro- biome include an emphasis on the microbial transi- tions in oral diseases 30 documentation that lifestyle changes can impact the oral microbiome and alter the symbiotic relationship 112 and micro- biome shifts based upon consideration of community dynamics with microbial successions with disease probably reflecting interspecies interactions and community adaptation to the altered subgingival microenvironment at inflamed sites 125.

Thus this oral pathogen has adopted an array of strategies andbiomolecular structures to engage in 'skirmishes' with the host all directed toward enhanced adherence colonization and expansion of the species within the oral environment.Other oral bacteria often related to pathogenic bio- films and disease have also been shown to possess host-reactive moleculesstructures.

Analyses of the oral microbial ecology in periodontitis have also incorporated various con- founders including aging diabetes rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease and even sex as potentially modifying the oral microbiome in health and disease 52 133 157 178 374 375 404.

While useful a majority of existing classifica- tion techniques and previous studies have clear limi- tations as they i used the same set of features as representative of the samples within and between the disease groups of interest ii focused on discerning the 'average variation' between disease groups with- out sufficient insights into potential variations within the disease groups and iii investigated changes between the disease groups at a single scale e.g.

Consistently specific T-cell responses have been mostly explored against P. gin- givalis as one of the key periodontopathogenic bacte- ria using P. gingivalis-specific T-cell lines established in vitro with initial reports suggesting that P. gingi- valis-specific T-cell lines produced mainly T-helper 1 and T-helper 2 cytokines 207.Nevertheless the complex oral environment with a plethora of bacterial antigens constantly stimulating the oral mucosa provides a challenge to describe T- cell clonality properly in oral health andor periodon- titis.

Recently Gomez  Nelson 225 have reviewed the literature regarding aspects of the oral microbiome in children and the relationship of this early acquired generally symbiotic microbial ecology to develop- ment and disease within and beyond the oral cavity.

forsythia T. denticola and F. alocis examples of cultivable bacteria that have been examined.The description of specific microbial complexes or consortia as representative of various stages in the progression of oral health to periodontal tissue destruction has provided a more organized approach with which to evaluate the roles of the large number of oral species some of which might contribute to disease in the maturecomplex biofilms of periodon- tal lesions.

Moreover a critical aspect for individual bacteria in the oral cavity is identifyingcreating a niche in complex biofilms that enables bacterial sur- vival and replication involving features of coaggrega- tion and metabolic cooperation.Substantial evidence is available demonstrating a critical role of F. nucleatum in the evolution of oral biofilms and transition from health to disease partic- ularly related to interactions with P. gingivalis.

Consistent with these findings CD4 T-cell plasticity involving a temporal conversion from regulatory T-cells to T- helper 1 interferon-gamma producers or T-helper17 interleukin-17 producers phenotypes in peri- odontal disease was demonstrated in an oral lavage mouse model and these responses were regulated by oral epithelial cells 10.Antigenic specificityT-cells express receptors known as T-cell receptors which are transmembrane molecules consisting of a b the vast majority of T cells or cd  10 of T cells heterodimers.
