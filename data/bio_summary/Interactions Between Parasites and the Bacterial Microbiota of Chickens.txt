Experimental infection with isolates from chickens quails geese and humans did not cause lesions 52113.Not all studies detected correlations between Blastocystis and the intestinal bacteria 76 but several investigations suggest interactions between Blastocystis and the intestinal bacteria in humans.

Most tested bacteria allowed E. tenella to cause lesions comparable to lesions E. tenella caused in birds with normal intestinal microbiota whereas the tested fungi did not Table 2.Gnotobiotic chickens with Lactobacillus acidophilus and S. faecalis or with L. acidophilus alone as intestinal microbiota developed lesions comparable to birds with normal intestinal microbiota after infection with E. brunetti.

However at slaughter the prevalence of A. galli can be as high as 37.3 and the prevalence of Heterakis gallinarum as high as 7.5 130.Okulewicz and Zlotorzycka 82 found a lower diversity of the microbiota and a smaller number of bacteria in the intestinal content of commercial hens infected with A. galli than in uninfected hens.

On the other hand conditioning medium before inoculation with histomonas by growing bacteria in it over night can improve results when the inoculum does not contain many bacteria 4044.It has been claimed that living bacteria can be substituted with bacteria inactivated by high doses of antibiotics but not sterile filtrates of bacterial cultures or autoclaved bacterial cultures 64.

Understanding the intestinal bacterial microbiota will help in the development of alternative methods for prevention and treatment of intestinal disorders.In cases in which lesions indicate that viruses are the primarily responsible pathogens intestinal disease is referred to as runting stunting syndrome 20 when bacteria seem to be primarily responsible culprits often the expression dysbacteriosis is used 114.

Parasites that increase the risk for intestinal disease might be targeted instead of bacteria in the prevention or treatment intestinal disorders or parasitosis could be treated by modulating the intestinal microbiota 123.

Colonization of the inner surface of the intestines by both pathogens was more intense with a longer and more severe infection and the patent of the parasite period was longer 124.In contrast to the synergy between specific pathogens the presence of normal intestinal bacterial microbiota in immunodeficient mice induced some resistance against experimental infection with C. parvum compared to bacteria-free mice.

Not much is known about intestinal cryptosporidiosis in chickens but results in mice show that the intestinal microbiota induces some resistance against infection with Cryptosporidium parvum and that the innate immune response triggered by infections with cryptosporidia might have an effect on other intestinal microbes.
