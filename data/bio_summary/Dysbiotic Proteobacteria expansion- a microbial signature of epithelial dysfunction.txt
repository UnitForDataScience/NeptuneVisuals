Collectively these data show that increased oxygen availability during intestinal inflammation drives a dysbiotic expansion of facultative anaerobic Enterobacteriaceae.Intestinal inflammation also increases the availability of alternative electron acceptors that support growth of facultative anaerobic bacteria through anaerobic respira- tion summarized in .

The colonic epithelium is hypoxic but intestinal inflammation or antibiotic treatment increases epithelial oxygenation in the colon thereby disrupting anaerobiosis to drive a dysbiotic expansion of facultative anaerobic Proteobacteria through aerobic respiration.

These observations suggest a dysbiotic expansion of Proteobacteria is a potential diagnostic microbial signature of epithelial dysfunction a hypothesis that could spawn novel preventative or therapeutic strategies for a broad spectrum of human diseases.AddressDepartment of Medical Microbiology and Immunology School of Medicine University of California Davis One Shields Ave Davis CA 95616 USACorresponding author Ba umler Andreas J IntroductionThe human large intestine is host to a dense microbial community that is dominated by obligate anaerobic bac- teria .

This epithelial dysfunction disrupts anaerobiasis in the lumen thereby driving an expansion of facultative anaerobic Proteobacteria by aerobic respiration.

A conse- quent reduction in the luminal butyrate concentration leads to a metabolic reprogramming of surface colono- cytes during S. enterica-induced colitis which in turn increases epithelial oxygenation thereby driving a luminal pathogen expansion by aerobic respiration 30 b.Collectively these data suggest that a disruption of intestinal homeostasis by antibiotic treatment or intesti- nal inflammation can eliminate epithelial hypoxia there- by increasing the amount of oxygen emanating from the colonic surface .

However a better understanding of the mecha- nisms controlling epithelial energy metabolism is needed to identify host proteins as potential targets for interven- tion strategies.The idea that an expansion of Proteobacteria is a microbial signature of epithelial dysfunction also has important ramifications for conditions where drivers of gut dysbiosis are poorly understood.

Minor constituents commonly found within a balanced gut microbiota in- clude obligate anaerobic bacteria belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria .The dominance of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the large bowel is likely a consequence of the severe oxygen limitation that characterizes this host environment which in turn has important consequences for the catabolic pathways used to break down nutrients.

Thus the dominance of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the large intestine ensures production of metabolites that maintain gut homeostasis.An expansion of Proteobacteria is a microbial signature of gut dysbiosisChanges in the composition of the gut-associated micro- bial community are associated with many human diseases but the mechanisms driving this imbalance dysbiosis are incompletely understood.

However a dis- ruption of the gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment results in a dysbiotic expansion of facultative anaerobic Proteobacteria in mice  and humans .

Increased oxygen availability would disrupt anaerobiosis in the large bowel and confer an ecological selective advantage to facultative anaerobic bacteria thereby driving their expansion within the gut-associated microbial community .
