We have outlined the CHEO IBD Centre research initiative to illustrate how patient- specific microbial data can contribute to therapeutic decisions and development of precision care for IBD.As with human genetic and human genomic data the inte- gration of patient-specific microbial data into clinical practice warrants careful consideration of data storage privacy and confidentiality.

To date much discussion in this context has focused on the potential of human genomic data and not yet on human microbiome data.

However the emergence of Big Data such as EHRs and a range of mechanisms that enable data sharing are creating new challenges around data owner- ship privacy and confidentiality while promoting new re- search and commercial opportunities Kostkova et al.

It sought to develop and evaluate tools and services that in- tegrate EHRs and other data sources to facilitate decision support for diagnosis identification of patients eligible for research and standardization of data elements.The use of Big Data in an LHS raises many important questions regarding their ethical management and use in healthcare.

Some of these questions include the challenges of data stewardship data governance transparency and ac- countability to patients providing practitioners other stake- holders and the public Schilsky et al.

data and biosamples for research and sharing and enhance patient trust.Effective patient engagement is particularly important for successful implementation of initiatives that involve the sharing of large amounts of patient data across multiple in- stitutions.

A BBC poll of 860 adults esti- mated that over two-thirds could not recall receiving theleaflet Vallance 2014.Public outcry over the lack of clarity about data safety and patient privacy deepened with news that patient data had been sold to private organizations including insurance and drugcompanies Presser et al.

General practitioners were seen as being pulled in two contradicting directions with obligations to protect their patients' data under the Data Protection Act while having to transfer data to HSCIC under the Health and Social Care Act.

Despite considerable excitement in both the scien- tific and public communities about the medical applications of human microbiome research most discussion regarding the integration of research and clinical care has focused on the potential of human genetic and human genomic data and not yet on human microbiome data.

At present it is uncertain whether an individual's microbial data can provide additional information that is personal and sensitive beyond genetic data.
