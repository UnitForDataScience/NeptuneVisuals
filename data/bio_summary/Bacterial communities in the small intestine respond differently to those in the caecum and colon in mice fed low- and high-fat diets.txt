The bacteria in the small intestine may be involved in nutrient sensing that potentially affects various host functions .

Four supplementary tables and two supplementary figures are available with the online Supplementary Material.000496 a 2017 The AuthorsDIO mouse model to compare the microbiome in the small intestine to that found in two sections of the large intestine the caecum and colon.

The ani- mals were housed using conventional conditions with open shoe box cages and were provided with tap water and corn cob bedding Bed O' Cob Anderson's Laboratory Bedding.

The mice were placed in an animal room containing 350-400 mice.

The mice were maintained on a 12 h lightdark cycle and allowed ab libi- tum access to standard rodent chow Purina Laboratory Rodent Diet 5015.

The fat sources in both diets were soybean oil and lard and carbohydrate in the diets was supplied as cornstarch maltodextrin and sucrose.

The diets were balanced so that the differen- ces between the LF and HF diets were the fat and carbohydrate levels but the macronutrient sources were identical.

The level of fat chosen 45 kcal  is used to pro- mote obesity in mice  using physiologically relevant fat levels and without lowering carbohydrate to an extent that could promote ketogenesis .

The body weights were measured weekly daily food intake and whole-body fat mass determined and euthanasia performed as described .

The studies were approved by and conducted in accor- dance with Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies.Preparation of intestinal contentsThe intestine from the stomach to the anus was removed intact and placed on a sterile Petri plate.
