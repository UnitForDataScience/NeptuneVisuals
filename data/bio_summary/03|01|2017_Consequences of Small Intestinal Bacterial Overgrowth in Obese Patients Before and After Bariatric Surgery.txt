Weight loss and serum vitamin concentrations were measured after bariat- ric surgery while a multivitamin supplement was systemati- cally given.Results Three hundred seventy-eight mean - SD patients who performed a BT before andor after surgery were includ- ed before surgery BT was positive in 15.4  55357.

Morbid obesity is also associated with nutritional deficiencies that have been described before bariatric surgery -.The only effective treatment considered for sustained long- term weight loss is bariatric surgery and the most effectiveprocedure is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGBP.

Bariatric surgery was proposed to obese patients with BMI 40 or 35 kgm2 in association with other comorbidities such as sleep apnoea diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease.All obese patients were proposed to perform a glucose hydrogen breath test before and after surgery to look for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

In univariate analysis neither patients' characteristics nor caloric intake or dietary characteristics were associated with the presence of SIBO Table .Proportions of patients with decreased serum vitamin con- centrations before surgery were 30.6  for vitamin B136.8  for vitamin B6 46.5  for vitamin C 17.6  for vitamin D 2.2  for vitamin A 2.1  for vitamin B12 and0.8  for vitamin E. Vitamin levels were not different in patients with or without SIBO.After SurgeryAGB Twenty patients with AGB had a glucose breath test after a median follow-up of 36 months after surgery 26-47 and a mean weight loss of 22.9 - 14.1 kg.

In the 43 patients who had two BT one before and one after bariatric surgery all the patients with post- operative positive BT had negative BT before bariatric sur- gery and two patients with positive test before surgery had negative test after RYGBP meaning that the positiveness of post-RYGBP BT was not influenced by the result of preoper- ative BT p  0.306.Sixty-three percent of patients presented at least one diges- tive symptoms including diarrhoea in 15.4  constipation in9.5  abdominal pain in 17.3  rumbling in 5.8  dumping syndrome in 34.6  and vomitingregurgitation in 7.7 .

Patients with positive BT had a lower caloric intake without difference in dietary composition but a significant lower weight loss and TWL 25.6 - 6.0 vs. 29.2 - 6.9 p  0.044 compared to those with negative BT.Table 1 Characteristics of patients in preoperative settings according to positive or negative breath testsNegative breath test n  290Positive breath test n  55pGender  of women85.675.00.09Age years39.3 - 11.341.2 - 14.10.26BMI kgm245.7 - 6.345.5 - 5.10.80Diabetes mellitus 18.518.81Hypertension 26.131.30.52Caloric intake kcalday1976 - 7651949 - 7380.86 proteins16.8 - 616.9 - 30.97 fat37.3 - 737.9 - 60.69 carbohydrates45.9 - 844.9 - 70.51Mean - SD corresponds to the percentage of patients with the conditionThis difference between patients with negative and positive BT was not explained by a different delay after surgery me- dian 9.3 6.8 22.8 months vs. 7.9 6.8 21.8 months respec- tively p  0.64 or a different preoperative BMI 46.7 - 1.2 vs. 45.8 - 1.5 kgm2 p  0.64.A multivariate analysis showed that only the result of the BT was predictive of percent TWL a positive BT being associated with lower TWL OR -0.321 CI 95 -0.085 -0.001 p  0.046 while age gender and initial BMI were not.DiscussionIn our study SIBO diagnosed using glucose breath test was present in one to six patients with morbid obesity prior to surgery.

We found that some patients had vitamin deficiencies before surgery less than 3  for vitamin B12 or vitamin E and vita- min A less than 20  for vitamin D one third of patients for vitamin B1 or B6 and about half of the patient for vitamin C. Other studies have also found micronutrient deficiencies be- fore surgery  .

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the prevalence and consequences of SIBO in obese patients before and after bariatric surgery.Patients and Methods From October 2001 to July 2009 in obese patients referred for bariatric surgery BMI 40 kgm2 or 35 in association with comorbidities a glucose hydrogen H2 breath test BT was performed before andor after either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGBP or adjustable gastric banding AGB to assess the presence of SIBO.

After surgery BTwas positive in 10  220 of AGB and 40  2665 of RYGBP p  0.001 compared to preoperative situation.
