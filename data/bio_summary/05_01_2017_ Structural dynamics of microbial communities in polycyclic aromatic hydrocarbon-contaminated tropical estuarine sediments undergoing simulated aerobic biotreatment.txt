Seven OTUs significantly in- creased in two communities Tables 3 4 and 5 five of these were common to the Apapa and Ofin sediments OTU 750785 795 1002 and 1050 one was shared between the Apapa and Eledu communities OTU 1011 and one was common between the Ofin and Eledu sediments OTU 155.

Identification of common responders to PAH in sediments would strengthen the ability to relate NGS data on community dynamics to PAH biodegradation in those environments.In prior work we examined estuarine sediments of the Lagos Lagoon Nigeria and assessed relationships between microbial community structure and variation in the types and levels of a wide range of municipal and industrial wastes Obi et al.

However the majority of the OTU with significant in- creases was of low abundance 1 of the sediment commu- nity and the bulk of the total abundance increases was attrib- utable to only a few OTU in each sediment.

For example in microcosm experiments with sediment from the Milazzo Harbor Sicily addition of oil or naphthalene resulted in sig- nificant decreases in diversity and reflected expansion of a relatively narrow spectrum of OMHB specialized for degra- dation of the materials Yakimov et al.

In contrast spiking noncontaminated mangrove sediment with heavy fuel oil wasfollowed by an increase in microbial diversity dos Santos et al.

The responsive community in the Ofin sediment was most diverse and encompassed 15 different phy- la compared to seven phyla for the Eledu sediment and fourphyla for the Apapa community.DiscussionLevels of PAH biodegradation in the Ofin sediment were gen- erally less than that which occurred in the Apapa or Eledu microcosms.

Coastal and marine sediments become the ultimate sinks of PAHs and in some cases PAH contamination may reach levels that warrant remediation such as when the con- centration of benzoapyrene a suspected human carcinogen exceeds a threshold of 0.9 mgkg Burgess et al.

.Microbial degradation is a key process affecting the fate of PAH in soils and sediments and may be carried out by either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria Bouchez-Naitali et al.

However blooms are not limited to marine wa- ters as NGS analysis of microcosms in which pristine man- grove sediments were spiked with 2-5 heavy fuel oil also revealed a response of the OMHB to become dominant in the communities dos Santos et al.

but is also not strictly reliable as the 13C-label can pass from organisms that are hydrocarbon-degraders to those that are not false posi- tives and organisms that may make important contributions to hydrocarbon degradation via cometabolism could evade detection false negatives.For PAH-contaminated sediments being remediated by landfarming NGS analysis could be helpful in monitoring the progress of biotreatment by tracking microbial indicators of PAH biodegradation Yakimov et al.
