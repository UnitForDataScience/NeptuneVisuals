Given the vast diversity of both bacteria and genes in the external environment  environmental gene cassettes are likely to be an important source of novel resistance genes to pathogens.Early knowledge of genes with a potential to become clinically relevant resistance genes is important because this helps us to better understand how resistance de- velops and to prepare surveillance and control measures to reduce their dissemination.

The fact that so few genes have been detected despite almost 80 years of intense usage of sulfonamides is intriguing as there are considerably more types of mobile genes fortetracycline resistance beta-lactamases or aminoglyco- side acetyltransferases Our finding of a fourth mo- bile sulfonamide resistance gene indicates that there are still ongoing forces that introduce mobilize and main- tain new sulfonamide resistance genes in bacterial com- munities.

The gene cassette contains an ORF for the sul4 gene and a partial domain of FolK COG0801 that is present in the upstream region of sul4 similar to the fused folKP gene in chlamydia.

To the best of our knowledge the numbers of differ- ent partial integrons and putative gene cassettes in this study are considerably higher than any previous study that has identified gene cassettes from environ- mental samples Table .For both sites resistance gene cassettes known and pu- tative dominated 51 to 89 Fig.

Many of the known and putative ARGs that were found were previ- ously not reported as gene cassettes thus revealing a potential to be spread via integrons.A mobile sulfonamide resistance gene with only 31-33 identity to previously known mobile sulfonamide resist- ance genes was discovered providing a very high level ofresistance when expressed in E. coli.

The intI gene encodes a site-specific tyrosine re- combinase which performs integration and excision of genetic elements known as gene cassettes at the recom- bination site attI.

The sul4 gene was retrieved by amplifying gene cassettes using class 1 integron-specific primers the most common type of integron found in hu- man pathogens.

The high abundance of resistance gene cassettes both in environmental and clinical inte- grons indicates an extensive exchange of gene cassettes between them.

The MICs of the antibiotics for the strains containing the candidate novel resistance genes were determined using E-tests on Mueller-Hinton Agar plates BioMerieux France with the addition of 100 ngml anhydrotetracycline aTC which acts as an ex- pression inducer for the pZE21-MCS1 gene inserts .
