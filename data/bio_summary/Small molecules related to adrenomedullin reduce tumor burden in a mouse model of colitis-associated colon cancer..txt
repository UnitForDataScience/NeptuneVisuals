as expected there was no significant modification of am levels in untreated animals but in dss-treated mice there was a downregulation by the inhibitory sm 16311 and a significant upregulation by the positive modulator 145425 which would help to explain the beneficial effects of sm 145425 and the increase of colitis symptoms by sm 16311. the expression of am2 was not modified bysm 16311 but sm 145425 reduced the expression of am2 on untreated animals.

genus turicibacter increased significantly with dss treatment a. akkermansia was significantly reduced by 145425 in untreated mice but that difference did not persist after dss treatment b. interestingly prevotella decreased with dss treatment but this decrease was completely prevented by 145425 c. besides 145425 prevented the large increase in the bacteroidesprevotella ratio elicited by dss d. data are shown as mean -sem.

in addition several small molecules sm have been identified which can either increase or decrease am or pamp functions.to further investigate the contribution of am and its gene-related peptide pamp to the progression and potential treatment of colon cancer we have studied the effects of several sm related to am and pamp on a mouse model of colon cancer.

the dysbiosis produced by dss predisposes mice to worse colitis symptoms and 145425 prevents such microbiota modifications.in conclusion am may have a protective role during the progression phase of colon cancer and treatment with am or with positive modulator sms may represent a novel treatment for colon cancer.material and methodscolitis-associated cancer induction.

the number of proliferating cells was similar between dss and dsssm groups b. the tunel technique detected few apoptotic cells in the colon of animals belongingto control groups but the number increased in animals treated with dss but did not vary after treatment with 145425 c. scale bar for a 10 mm for b and c  100 um.table 2. relative abundance of the most representative phyla in the gut of control 145425 dss and dss- 145425 groups.

for each sm four experimental groups of male mice were used i control group ii sm group iii dss group injected with azoxymethane aom and drank dextran sulfate sodium dss and iv dss sm group treated with aom dss and the sm.

this marker was significantly reduced by treatment with 145425 c. on the other hand erbb2 had the reverse behavior decreasing by dss and being modulated by 145425 d. moreover treatment with 16311 did not affect any of these two genes studied when compared with their respective dss-treated controls ab.

supplementary figure s5 shows the alpha and beta-diversity analysis.discussionin this study we have shown that am positive modulation by 145425 treatment reduces tumor incidence in a mouse model of colitis-associated colon cancer and results in gut microbiota changes thus linking am with colorectal cancer initiation and progression.

concerning am2 expression sm 145425 reduced am2 levels in untreated animals but had no significant effects on dss-treated mice supplementary figure s2d.sm 145425 prevents dss-related changes in lgr5 and erbb2 expression.

since 145425 seems to offer a therapeutic potential we further investigated the influence of this sm in histopathology and microbiota modulation.sm 145425 reduces tumor growth in dss treated mice.

sm 16311-treated mice exhibited severe colitis symptoms reaching higher scores than their dss-treated counterparts b. sm 145425 had no effect on any of the parameters studied cd.

sm 145425 significantly reduced the number of tumors in treated mice c. the reduction in thenumber of tumors was also evidenced by a reduction in colon weight d. sm 16311 had no significant effect on any of these parameters ab.

four sm were tested 16311 a negative modulator of am 145425 a positive modulator of am 87877 a negative modulator of pamp and 106221 a positive modulator of pamp.resultspamp-related sms do not modify cancer phenotype.

moreover 145425 modulates some bacteria by itself for example akkermansia was significantly reduced by 145425 in untreated mice but that difference did not persists after dss treatment.
