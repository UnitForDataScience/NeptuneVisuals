It is im- portant to understand the response of human skin micro- biota to the RF-EMF from cell phones and personal electronic devices since this may be one of the potential mechanisms of a human health threat brought about by the disruption of the intimate and balanced host-microbiota relationship.

The low cell phone usage and lack of exposure to RF-EMF could be linked to a higher chance of affected growth in bacteria.

These findings led us to hypothesize that cell phone level RF-EMF disrupts human skin microbiota.

Thus the results from the current study lay ground for more comprehensive research on the effect of RF-EMF on human health through the human-microbiota relationship.Keywords skin microbiota bacterial growth cell phone SMF RF-EMFIntroductionWith ever-progressing technological advancements and the fast integration of electronic devices in our everyday lives sources of low electromagnetic field EMF are omnipresentFor correspondence.

The demographics were one Caucasian male with high cell phone usage one Caucasian female with very high phone usage and two Asian females with moderate cell phone usage.

Future mechanistic studies based on evolutionary response framework using genomics and transcriptomics tools along with a larger sampling size from distinctive cohort groups consisting of a distinctive demog- raphy and cell phone and other personal electronic devices usage history are necessary to further advance the research on the effect of RF-EMF to human health.AcknowledgementsAuthors are grateful for the technical assistance by Dr. Ran- dall Jean and his research team Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Baylor University for the RE- EMF simulation.

These findings add to the ever-growing evidence that even cell phone level RF-EMFs have the potential to negatively impact human health and that human exposure may need to be more strictly regulated.ConclusionBoth static and radiofrequency electromagnetic fields have significant yet variable effects on the growth of common hu- man bacteria.

Under both SMF and RF-EMF bacterial growth was unaffected increased or suppressed per species of bac- teria and the responses seemed to be determined by historic exposure to RF-EMF and life style.

The direct effect of EMF on humans or others mammals has been studied numerous times with RF-EMF.

The control was prepared in identical settings except for the RF-EMF exposure background level.
