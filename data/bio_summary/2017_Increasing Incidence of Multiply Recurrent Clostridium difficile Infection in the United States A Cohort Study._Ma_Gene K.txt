When the model was run with states instead of geo- graphic regions patients in Florida aOR 0.66 CI 0.52 to 0.85 and Texas aOR 0.46 CI 0.35 to 0.62 had decreased risk for mrCDI Appendix Figure available at When an interaction term for geography state or geographic region and calendar year was added to the regression model there was no significant differ- ence in the increase in mrCDI per calendar year de- pending on geography P  0.179 for interaction of cal- endar year and state and 0.34 for interaction of calendar year and geographic region Appendix Table 2 available at indicating that the increase in mrCDI occurred in all geographic areas.DISCUSSIONClostridium difficile infection is a common expen- sive and potentially fatal infection that is increasing in incidence.

Fecal micro- biota transplantation is increasingly used to treat multiply recur- rent CDI mrCDI.Objective To determine whether the incidence of mrCDI is in- creasing in proportion to CDI and to identify risk factors for mrCDI.Design Retrospective cohort study.Setting United States.Participants 38 911 718 commercially insured patients in the OptumInsight Clinformatics Database of whom 45 341 devel- oped CDI.Measurements Age- and sex-standardized incidence rates for CDI and mrCDI.Results From 2001 to 2012 the annual incidence of CDI and mrCDI per 1000 person-years increased by 42.7 from 0.4408to 0.6289 case and 188.8 from 0.0107 to 0.0309 case re- spectively.

Chronic kidney disease 10.4 vs. 5.6 aOR 1.49 CI1.24 to 1.80 and diagnosis in a nursing home 2.1 vs. 0.6 aOR 1.99 CI 1.34 to 2.93 were also associated with increased risk for mrCDI.Limitation The primary analyses included only commercially insured patients in the United States.Conclusion Relative to CDI mrCDI incidence has dispropor- tionately increased indicating a rising demand for mrCDI therapies.Primary Funding Source National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Ann Intern Med.

In this study we sought to evaluate whether incidence of mrCDI is increasing to determine whether any such increase is proportional to the increase in CDI and to identify risk factors for mrCDI among patients with an episode of CDI.METHODSStudy DesignWe performed a retrospective cohort study using the OptumInsight Clinformatics Database which con- tains information on an insured population from a di- verse group of health plans in the United States.

The annual incidence of mrCDI increased by 188.8 over the same period from 0.0107 to 0.0309 case per 1000 person-years p  0.94 P  0.001.Consistent with the analysis of secular trends in the cohort study conducted among all persons with a first known diagnosis of CDI the relative odds of develop- ing mrCDI increased by approximately 8 per year af- ter adjustment for potential confounders aOR 1.08 95 CI 1.06 to 1.09 Table 2.

A sensitivity analysis that included Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and adjusted for insurance type similarly showed a positive association between calendar year and development of mrCDI aOR 1.06 CI 1.05 to 1.08 Appendix Table 1 available at Characteristics of Patients With and Without mrCDICompared with persons who did not develop mrCDI those who did were older median age 56.0 vs.49.0 years aOR per 10-year increase in age 1.25 CI1.21 to 1.29 and more likely to be female 63.8 vs. 58.7 aOR 1.24 CI 1.11 to 1.38.

Chronic kidney disease aOR 1.49 CI 1.24 to 1.80 was associated with an increased risk for mrCDI whereas inflammatory bowel disease aOR 1.07 CI0.83 to 1.38 and diabetes mellitus aOR 0.89 CI 0.76 to 1.04 were not.Diagnosis in a nursing home was also associated with development of mrCDI aOR 1.99 CI 1.34 to 2.93.

This increase in mrCDI incidence is likely a consequence of increases in both the incidence of CDI and the proportion that be- comes mrCDI.

However incidence of CDI and mrCDI increased consistently across the en- tire study period and thus has likely increased further since 2012.Finally our study design prevented us from defini- tively establishing the reason for the observed increase in mrCDI incidence.

Regardless of the cause the dramatic increase in the incidence of mrCDI out of proportion to the increase in first diagno- sis of CDI indicates an increasing demand for therapies to treat mrCDI.In summary this study showed that the increase in incidence of mrCDI 188.8 exceeded that of CDI 42.7 from 2001 to 2012.
