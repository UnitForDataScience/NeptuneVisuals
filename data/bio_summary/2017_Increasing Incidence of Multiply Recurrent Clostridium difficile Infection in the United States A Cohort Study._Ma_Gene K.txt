the study population encompassed most regions of the united states captured both inpatient and outpatient diagnoses and was large enough to al- low for precise estimates of the incidence of cdi and mrcdi by calendar year and region.a recent systematic review of risk factors for cdi recurrence showed that prior investigations have varied substantially in the time frame used to identify recur- rences ranging from 21 days after the last cdi epi- sode in one study to 180 days in another 11. this0.70.60.50.40.30.20.100.0350.030.0250.020.0150.010.00502001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 20122001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012study used a time frame of 14 to 56 days to define recurrence as did the infectious diseases society of america and the society for healthcare epidemiology of america in the 2010 cdi clinical practice guideline 24. furthermore the definition of mrcdi was based on current practice guidelines and required multiple courses of therapy reducing the risk for misclassifica- tion that can result from use of diagnostic codes only 24. in addition the cohort design confirmed that the excessive increase in mrcdi relative to cdi was independent of common risk factors for cdi and geography.our study has several limitations including its use of administrative claims data to identify patients with cdi.

a recent meta-analysis found that 13 to 50 of patients had at least 1 recurrence after an initial episode 7. patients with multiply recurrent cdi mrcdi are in- creasingly treated with fecal microbiota transplantation fmt an expensive and largely unregulated therapywith unknown long-term health consequences.incidence of cdi is widely believed to have in- creased over the past 2 decades with hospitalizations for the infection in the united states doubling between 2000 and 2010 1 6 8. however little is known about trends in incidence of recurrent cdi particularly mrcdi which would be an indication for fmt.

in this study we sought to evaluate whether incidence of mrcdi is increasing to determine whether any such increase is proportional to the increase in cdi and to identify risk factors for mrcdi among patients with an episode of cdi.methodsstudy designwe performed a retrospective cohort study using the optuminsight clinformatics database which con- tains information on an insured population from a di- verse group of health plans in the united states.

this increase in mrcdi incidence is likely a consequence of increases in both the incidence of cdi and the proportion that be- comes mrcdi.

although use of ppis and antibiotics has been shown in this and other studies to be associated with cdi recurrence even after adjustment for these and other risk factors calendar year of diagnosis re- mained strongly associated with development of mrcdi this may suggest a change in the biology of cdi that is independent of common risk factors 11. some of the increase could be due to the emergence of the north american pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 nap1 strain of c difficile which has been shown to be a risk factor for recurrent cdi 12 13. severity of cdi may also have been increasing and may also be a risk factor for recurrence.defining the group of patients who develop mrcdi and assessing potential risk factors may have implica- tions for the surveillance and treatment of patients with4 annals of internal medicineincidence of multiply recurrent c difficile infection in the united statesoriginal researchcdi.

the emer- gence of the nap1 strain is believed to contribute to the changing epidemiology of cdi 6 29. however treatment is currently the same for infection caused by this strain so information on the nap1 strain would notlead to changes in policy or treatment.the optuminsight clinformatics database was used to conduct the study on a national scale but data were available only through 2012. however incidence of cdi and mrcdi increased consistently across the en- tire study period and thus has likely increased further since 2012.finally our study design prevented us from defini- tively establishing the reason for the observed increase in mrcdi incidence.

regardless of the cause the dramatic increase in the incidence of mrcdi out of proportion to the increase in first diagno- sis of cdi indicates an increasing demand for therapies to treat mrcdi.in summary this study showed that the increase in incidence of mrcdi 188.8 exceeded that of cdi 42.7 from 2001 to 2012. this excessive increase was apparent throughout the united states and was inde- pendent of other risk factors for cdi including use of ppis or antibiotics and residence in a nursing home.
