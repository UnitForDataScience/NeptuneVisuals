Many studies suggest that the oral microbiota plays important role in the health of the host however little is known about the association between the oral microbiota and CKD pathogenesis.Methods In this study we surveyed the oral microbiota in saliva the left and right molars and the anterior mandibular lingual area from 77 participants 18 with and 59 without CKD and tested their association with CKD to identify microbial features that may be predictive of CKD status.Results The overall oral microbiota composition significantly differed by oral locations and was associ- ated with CKD status in saliva and anterior mandibular lingual samples.

while recent translational research has shown that deranged fatty acid metabolism in renal tubular cells is linked to profibrotic pathways responsible for kidney disease progression.Thus the link between oral micro- biota dysregulated metabolic pathways and CKD developmentprogression should be evaluated in detail further.There are several potential mechanisms that may explain the altered oral microbial ecology in CKD patients including dysregulated inflammatory and metabolic pathways higher concentration of urea in the saliva mucosal inflammation due to ammonia accumulation decrease in the salivary mucin coating increasing vulnerability to infections and medica- tions specific to CKD patients.Moreover in addition to altered oral microbiota we also tested the rela- tionship between the oral microbiota and 6 plasma cytokines linked to CKD and representing inflamma- tory injury-related and fibrosisrepair pathways.

Other risk factors include family history of CKD male gender older agesmoking African ancestry low socioeconomic status history of cardiovascular disease obesity nephro- toxicity and acute kidney injury.Moreover recent studies have suggested a link between CKD and peri- odontal disease.Although periodontal disease is an infection localized to the oral cavity increasing evi- dence suggests that periodontal disease results from a chronic systematic inflammatory dysregulation medi- ated by the oral microbiome.The oral microbes and the resultant inflammatory mediators may infiltrate the systemic bloodstream interact with host cells of target organs and induce a systematic inflammatory reaction that may exacerbate kidney dysfunction.A recenthuman study showed that the elevated serum antibody to a periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly associated with decreased kidney function.

Second in this study because the oral samples were collected from the participants who were already enrolled in the BioMe Biobank Program with the blood samples collected at the entry there was on average a 48-month gap between the blood sample collection used to measure plasma cytokines and oral sample collection for microbiome analysis which could inaccurately reflect the biomarker levels at the time of oral sampling.

A better understanding of the interplay between the oral microbiota and CKD may help in the development of new strategies to identify at-risk individuals or to serve as a novel target for therapeutic intervention.Kidney Int Rep 2018 3 193-204 KEYWORDS chronic kidney disease dental plaque oral microbiome salivaa 2017 International Society of Nephrology.

However even though many studies have demonstrated that the human oral microbiota represents 1 of the most diverse microbial communities in the body and plays an important role in the health and disease of the host and despite the established link between CKD and periodontal health little is known about the role of the oral microbiota in CKD pathogenesis.

The median time lag between the the closest EMR eGFR measurement to the oral sampling and the oral sample collection date was 0.33 year interquartile range 14 0.6 year and did not differ by CKD status.Cytokine BiomarkersPlasma samples taken at the time of enrollment to the BioMe Biobank Program were stored at 80oC and were used to derive the biomarker measures.

For the first time we compared the microbiota from 4 oral locations saliva mandibular anterior lingual area and plaques from both left and right molar between individuals with and without CKD and detected significant differences in the overall oral microbiome diversity mostly pronounced in saliva and anterior mandibular lingual samples.
