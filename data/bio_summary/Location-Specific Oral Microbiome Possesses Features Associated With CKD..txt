many studies suggest that the oral microbiota plays important role in the health of the host however little is known about the association between the oral microbiota and ckd pathogenesis.methods in this study we surveyed the oral microbiota in saliva the left and right molars and the anterior mandibular lingual area from 77 participants 18 with and 59 without ckd and tested their association with ckd to identify microbial features that may be predictive of ckd status.results the overall oral microbiota composition significantly differed by oral locations and was associ- ated with ckd status in saliva and anterior mandibular lingual samples.

while recent translational research has shown that deranged fatty acid metabolism in renal tubular cells is linked to profibrotic pathways responsible for kidney disease progression.thus the link between oral micro- biota dysregulated metabolic pathways and ckd developmentprogression should be evaluated in detail further.there are several potential mechanisms that may explain the altered oral microbial ecology in ckd patients including dysregulated inflammatory and metabolic pathways higher concentration of urea in the saliva mucosal inflammation due to ammonia accumulation decrease in the salivary mucin coating increasing vulnerability to infections and medica- tions specific to ckd patients.moreover in addition to altered oral microbiota we also tested the rela- tionship between the oral microbiota and 6 plasma cytokines linked to ckd and representing inflamma- tory injury-related and fibrosisrepair pathways.

other risk factors include family history of ckd male gender older agesmoking african ancestry low socioeconomic status history of cardiovascular disease obesity nephro- toxicity and acute kidney injury.moreover recent studies have suggested a link between ckd and peri- odontal disease.although periodontal disease is an infection localized to the oral cavity increasing evi- dence suggests that periodontal disease results from a chronic systematic inflammatory dysregulation medi- ated by the oral microbiome.the oral microbes and the resultant inflammatory mediators may infiltrate the systemic bloodstream interact with host cells of target organs and induce a systematic inflammatory reaction that may exacerbate kidney dysfunction.a recenthuman study showed that the elevated serum antibody to a periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly associated with decreased kidney function.

second in this study because the oral samples were collected from the participants who were already enrolled in the biome biobank program with the blood samples collected at the entry there was on average a 48-month gap between the blood sample collection used to measure plasma cytokines and oral sample collection for microbiome analysis which could inaccurately reflect the biomarker levels at the time of oral sampling.

a better understanding of the interplay between the oral microbiota and ckd may help in the development of new strategies to identify at-risk individuals or to serve as a novel target for therapeutic intervention.kidney int rep 2018 3 193-204 keywords chronic kidney disease dental plaque oral microbiome salivaa 2017 international society of nephrology.

it has been shown that microbial dysregulation in the gut exacerbated uremia leading to further progression of ckd and inflammation reviewed by khoury et al.. however even though many studies have demonstrated that the human oral microbiota represents 1 of the most diverse microbial communities in the body and plays an important role in the health and disease of the host and despite the established link between ckd and periodontal health little is known about the role of the oral microbiota in ckd pathogenesis.

the median time lag between the the closest emr egfr measurement to the oral sampling and the oral sample collection date was 0.33 year interquartile range 14 0.6 year and did not differ by ckd status.cytokine biomarkersplasma samples taken at the time of enrollment to the biome biobank program were stored at 80oc and were used to derive the biomarker measures.

because the oral samples were collected from the participants who were already enrolled in the biome biobank program with the blood samples collected at the entry there was on average a 48-month gap between the blood sample and oral sample collection.bacterial 16s ribosomal rna polymerase chain reaction and sequencingoral plaque and saliva dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit following the protocol from the manufacturer mobio carlsbad ca.

ckd patients were more likely to be treated with antihypertensive medications and insulin.survey of oral microbiomefrom study participants we collected 277 oral sam- ples of which 75 were from the anterior mandibular lingual area 68 from the left molar 69 from the right molar and 65 from saliva.

the nonmetric multiple dimensional scaling plot a visualizes the dissimilarity of the overall oral microbiome abandance among the oral samples b diversity by sampling location.

in the receiver operating characteristic analysis aimed to assess the performance of ckd classification based on selected microbiome features we found that the neisseriaveillonella ratio in anterior mandibular lingual samples and neisseria streptococcus in saliva samples were able to correctly predict the ckd status in 81 and 77 cases respectively outperforming the prediction using neisseria veillonella or streptococcus alone c.differential predicted functional metagenome features and their association with oral location and ckd statuswe performed the picrust analysis to predict the full metagenomic content of microbial communities using 16s gene surveysand compared the predicted meta- genomic pathways by oral location and ckd status figure s2.

for the first time we compared the microbiota from 4 oral locations saliva mandibular anterior lingual area and plaques from both left and right molar between individuals with and without ckd and detected significant differences in the overall oral microbiome diversity mostly pronounced in saliva and anterior mandibular lingual samples.

we found that the association between the oral microbiota and ckd status remained significant after the adjustment suggesting that the observed associa- tions may reflect biological mechanisms largely independent of common ckd risk factors.analysis of inferred metagenomes indicated that the altered oral microbiome is associated with ckd through influencing a number of metabolic pathways while simultaneously having consequences for cellular processing and genetic replication and repair.

first it proved the utility of the biobank setting for comprehensive oral microbiome studies whereby individuals who already consented for biobanking and provided blood samples and whose extensive clinical data are avail- able through emr were approached at a dental clinic for oral sample collection and dental health record verification.

a better understanding of the role of the oral microbiome in kidney function may shed new light on the patho- genesis of renal diseases and help in the designing of novel interventions aimed at restoring oral symbiosis to treat or prevent ckd.
