Phylo- geographic analysis was consistent with the derived Ames clade's historical importation into North America perhaps from China where many close relatives are found .In particular the Ames ancestor and its identical sister genome FTD1004 are very high quality closed and finished sequences that represent two stocks derived directly from the original 1981 Texas B. anthracis isolate.

Together they represent the oldest known laboratory stocks of the original Ames strain established within months of the bovine anthrax case.Directly diverging from these five genomes  is that of strain Porton Down Ames with 65 unique SNPs.

This high identity and phylogenetic topology argue that the Porton Down Ames strain and Porton Down sugar contaminants were derived from the Ames material sent in 1982.In the context of spatial separation of analytical and research facilities to avoid contamination there were no dedicated analytical facilities at the Porton Down defense laboratories in 1998.

The genomes of strains sugar 2 and sugar 4 were identical to each other and differed from that of strain sugar 3 by a single nucleotide polymorphism SNP at position 883096 C  T. In a direct alignment of the three sugar draft genomes with that of the Ames ancestorMarchApril 2017 Volume 8 Issue 2 e00440-17r 1there were 5474730 high-quality nucleotide positions available for genotypic compar- ison.The initial molecular subtyping by canonical SNP typing   assigned the strains to the A.Br.Ames clade.
