Thus the presence of MUP4 with its ligands and of ESP1 in the mouse tears and saliva  may function as the signals that explain the observation of and  who reported that mouth and facial areas are the first and the most frequently investigated areas during mouse social contacts which causes strong neuronal activity responses in accessory olfactory bulbs .MUPs and OBPs may also be used as carriers of VOCs stemming out of metabolic and bacterial degradation and of other potentially toxic waste in mice     and in other taxa including humans   cows and pigs  and elephants .

MUP production is male-biased and sub-species-specific in the mouse urine   and have strong effects on the reproductive success of the signaller   as an honest cheat-proof display of an individual's health and condition   .

2017 On the tear proteome of the house mouse Mus musculus musculus in relation to chemical signalling.

MSP FLP and Aphrodisin are phylogenetically close to mouse OBPs .

However there are more genes for OBPs in the mouse genome   and thus we provided alternative names based on their position on chromosome X as Obp1 Obp2 Obp5 synonym in C57BL--Obp1a  Obp6 Obp7 synonym in C57BL--Obp1b  and Obp8 where Obp3-ps and Obp4-ps are pseudogenes.

OBPs share typical lipocalin motif GxW as well as a specific disulfide bond Cys38-Cys42 which represents a strong OBP-diagnostic motif CXXXC found in many mammalian OBPs including Probasin and which are encoded by genes on the mouse chromosome X   .

Specific antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated for the mouse lipocalin LCN2 which is up-regulated as a response to inflammation in mucosal tissues   and which scavenges for catecholate-type siderophores that bacteria use to sequester free iron  .

These include for example the bactericidalpermeability-increasing proteins - BPI   which are male-biased in the mouse saliva .
