parabacteroides 8.2 cloacibacillus 5.0 alistipes 2.4 in the adult gut microbiota displayed higher abundances accordingly the percentages of pyr- amidobacter 6.8 providencia 5.1 klebsiella 4.6 lachno- clostridium 2.9 for the child exceeded that of the adult.discussionthe data convinced us that the human gut microbiota had the potency to enhance as solubility from soils and as release ability of adult gut microbiota was stronger.

the adult gut microbiota had a great ability of as methylation the child gut microbiota exhibited high asiii level which could encounter high health risk.

however the structure and activity of human gut microbiota from different in- dividuals varies distinctly with diet gender and region   accordingly variability in the diversity of human gut microbiota has been examined in populations with a wide range of ages.

the identity of arsenic-metabolizing bacteria isolated from human gut microbiota should be given the great attention which can further pry the truth of as metabolism in the human gut.conclusionthe present study showed that two individuals gut microbiota had different soil as metabolic potency.

16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that human gut microbiota from 20 various genera potentially had resistance genes to reduce and methylate as under conservative statistics.

our results indicated that as metabolism by gut microbiota from adult and child was significantly different.

the importance of as metabolism has been evidenced with in vitro experiments of human gut microbiota which can induce as speciation changes and affect as bioaccessibility in contaminated media  .

nevertheless human gut microbiota can actively volatilize as with the formation of highly toxic ash3 arsine  .

furthermore as metabolism by human gut microbiota and intestinal absorption of these as metabolites should be concurrent processes.

besides some thiolated methylarsenicals dmmtav and mmmtav are efficiently absorbed across caco-2 cells.the gut microbiota covers a large set of variable genes innumerous bacterial species with significant functions which plays a number of important roles in human health.

to date limited efforts have been made to investigate differences between in- dividuals regarding as metabolism by gut microbiota.

when we conversely consider as exposure linked to a number of diseases found that as exposure alters the gut microbial com- munity at the abundance level which substantially perturbs its metabolic profiles at the function level through the integrated metagenomics analysis.in the present study high performance liquid chromatography- inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc-icp-ms was used to determine as metabolites and to further evaluate vari- ability in the metabolic potency toward soil as of gut microbiota from two healthy individuals adult and child.

the distal colon microbial fermentation activity short chain fatty acid production and ammonium production and community composition are investigated to be consistent with that of previous shime runs and an in vivo situation  .arsenic metabolism of colon microbiota from contaminated soilsarsenic bioaccessibility and its speciation in eight contaminated soils have been investigated through the combination of two in vitro methods including the physiologically based extraction test pbet  and the unified bioaccessibility research group of europe barge method ubm  with shime to subsequently simulate stomach small intestine and co- lon conditions respectively.

furthermore the validation of chromatographic recovery was previously described .16s rrna gene sequencing and data analysistotal dna of the descending colon microbiota from shime reactor of two volunteers was isolated using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer's instructions.
