In addition there is evidence from studies using a various human and animal colon preparations that the colonic epithelium can absorb a range of B vitamins including folate riboflavin biotin niacin and thiamine via specific carrier-mediated mechanisms .Table 1 Estimated maximal  of daily reference intake DRI of B vitamins that could be provided by the gut microbiota from Magnus- dottir et al.

The identification of equol-producing organisms has been the subject of sev- eral studies as a consequence of the potential importance of equol in human health and the intriguing observation that only about 30 of people appear to be capable of its production.Matthies et al.
