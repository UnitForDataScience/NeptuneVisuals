the microbiota is well known to play a critical role in the development and later function of the gastrointestinalmetabolicand immune systems.there is now a growing body of evidence that suggests the gut microbiota also influences the brain and behavior.-robust preclinical and clinical findings indi- cate that a bidirectional route of communication exists be- tween the brain and the gut microbiota and this is termedthe microbiota-gut-brain axis for detailed description of this axis in health and disease across the lifespan see re- cent reviews-.the exact mechanisms by which the gut microbiota communicates with the brain are not yet clear however they include immunological endocrine metabolic and neural pathways for detailed discussion of pathways of communications see recent reviews-.

together these findings indicate there are likely numerous sys- tems simultaneously involved in the bidirectional trans- fer of information between the brain and the gut.altered microbiota composition in perinatal period neurodevelopment and healtha number of diverse factors can contribute to mamma- lian gut microbiota content and complexity and the progression of bacterial colonization is not random.

the exposure to bacteria during birth is a critical juncture in the es- tablishment of a stable core gut microbiota.the ef- fects of the intestinal microbiota on brain physiology include synaptogenesis regulation of microglia devel- opment and maturation and regulation of neurotrans- mitters and neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor.-recently several preclinical studies using gf mice have highlighted the ability of early-life microbiota to influence neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects on neural function.during development the nervous system is assembled and sculpted by a series of temporally regulated developmental processes that shape the functional neural circuitry which is critical for normal cognitive motor and emotional develop- ment.

maternally derived environmental disturbances eg infection stress drug and alcohol exposure preterm birth during this time period can have profound and enduring structural and func- tional consequences for brain development in affected offspring.-despite the overwhelming evidence of the crucialrole that the microbiota plays in the postnatal develop- ment and maturation of the cns the pathways as to how disturbances in microbiota development could lead to abnormal brain development cognitive and be- havioral deficits allergyautoimmunity and metabolic disorders remain to be elucidated .

these data suggest that the gut microbiota is capable of modulating brain development and behavior but that critical time windows exist for intestinal microbes to exert this influence.alteration to the composition of the gut microbiota often occurs during the postnatal period.

this figure summarizes the current modulating therapies to improve the composition of the microbiota and neurodevelopmental health of the infant.composition of the microbiota in early life is strongly influenced by mode of deliverywhich could account for the increased risk of certain diseases associated with c-section delivery.

this is clearly evidenced by mam- malian mother-infant dyads as the human microbiota is shaped by mothers and breast milk.microbes are present in breast milk and may contribute to the composition of the infant microbiota although this is at present an open question.

in fact these early exposures that impact the intestinal microbiota have been associated with the development of diseases such as obesity type 1 diabetes asthma allergies and even neurodevelopmental disorders.

the present review summarizes the impact of cesarean birth on the gut microbiome and the health status of the developing infant and discusses possible preventative and restorative strategies to compensate for early-life microbial perturbations.introductionhumans share a mutualistic relationship with the com- plex community of microbes living in their bodies collect- ively known as the microbiota.

cortisol can also alter gut permeability and barrier function and change gut microbiota compos- ition.in addition microbes can impact the responsivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as seen in sev- eral studies demonstrating that neuroendocrine signaling is altered in response to microbial manipulation.-given that the human gut is heavily innervated it is not surprising that neural pathways represent an- other important route connecting the brain and the gut.

it is thought that an unhealthy microbiota can promote the increased translocation of pathogenic bacterial components from the intestinal mucosa to the systemic circulation where they activate innate immunity characterized by production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in metabolic inflammation and abnormal gut function.
