This review will demonstrate the influence the gut microbiome has on estrogen and therefore estrogen-mediated disease and related health outcomes .MethodsA search of the scientific literature was conducted using PubMed Medline or Google Scholar using the following search terms estrobo- lome estrogen and gut microbiome phytoestrogen and gut mi- crobiome phytoestrogens and cancer bariatric surgery and gut microbiome gut microbiome and epithelial function and phy- siology and estrogen or phytoestrogen.

The impact of the gut microbiome extends beyond the gut through the inflammatory and metabolic changes induced by the gut microbiome .

The gut microbiome has been shown to be influenced by estrogen however the gut microbiome also sig- nificantly impacts estrogen levels .

The literature searches were performed between March 2017 and May 2017.Gut microbiome and homeostasisThe gut epithelial barrier is maintained by a healthy diverse gut microbiome composed primarily of 4 phyla Bacteriodetes Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria.

Gut microbiome diversity is important since a more diverse gut microbiome contains a greater diversity and abundance of enzymes capable of synthesizing metabolites such as butyrate that then contribute to gut homeostasis and health .An imbalance of the gut microbiota is referred to as dysbiosis and has pathophysiological consequences.

The effects of dysbiosis have been shown to be alleviated through fecal microbiome transplant FMT bariatric surgery and pharmaceutical interventions metformin enabling the re-establishment of home- ostasis by increasing gut microbiome diversity decreasing inflamma- tion and altering metabolite composition  .Physiological role of estrogenThe role of estrogens in female reproductive development and maintenance is well defined .

Further- more clinical studies have revealed gut dysbiosis and reduced gut microbiome diversity in both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive in- dividuals .The reduction in diversity of the gut microbiome in CVD patients and the putative reduction in estrogen and phytoestrogen levels through reduced b-glucuronidase activity may be a key aspect of the gut microbiome-CVD interaction considering the important protective role estrogen plays against CVD.

While beyond the scope of this review numerous fecal microbiome transplant and antibiotic studies have been performed illustrating the role of the gut microbiome in cognitive conditions such as anxiety depression and memory impairment .

Modulation of the gut microbiome and meta- bolic profile as a means of treating estrogen-driven disease through surgical bariatric surgery fecal microbiome transfer nutraceutical genistein and pharmaceutical metformin methods also shows pro- mise for combating the metabolic aspects of disease states which subsequently aids in resolving the associated disease .
