The Review focuses on disorders of immunity using the intesti- nal disorder inflammatory bowel disease IBD as an example and of metabolism using the extra-intestinal disorder of obesity as an example.Microbiome GWASmGWAS are cohort studies that combine human geno- typing or whole-genome sequencing with microbiome analysis 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA or metagenomicsequencing from the same individual to investigate howhost genetics and microbiome composition affect health and disease.An early mGWAS by Blekhman et al.

Variants in this gene were linked to changes in the composition of the gut microbiome14 supporting the notion that behavioural changes resulting from this genetically determined die- tary preference might alter the composition of the gut microbiome but mechanistic insights regarding this association are lacking.Overall the most significant challenge facing the host genetics and microbiome field is the establishment of causality in the observed associations between the environment host genetics the gut microbiome andHeritabilityThe proportion of variance of a trait attributed to host genetics rather than environmental effects.

As another example germ-free mice colonized with species from the human gut microbiome lost almost all human microbial spe- cies and re-established mouse-specific microbiota within 14 days of cohabiting with normal mice13.Genetic variants within a host species are implicated in the dramatic variation of the gut microbiome between individuals214.

Knowledge of the factors that affect the gut microbiome is of great importance because dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple diseases1920 including intes- tinal disorders such as Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis and necrotizing enterocolitis as well as extra-intestinal disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus asthma obe- sity autism and rheumatoid arthritis21 FIG.

Age also has specific effects on the diversity and richness of the gut microbiome106107 before the age of 3 years the gut microbiome has a 'child-like' configuration that is characterized by less species diversity whereas after the age of 3 years the gut microbiome attains its more diverse 'adult' configuration108.

Severalvariants in these genes allow for the overgrowth of spe- cific species of the gut microbiome which may trigger the disproportionate immune response that is implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD30.Immunity-related IBD risk alleles alter microbiome composition.

A missense muta- tion in SLC39A8 was associated with both an increased incidence of Crohn's disease and altered microbiome composition50.Additional links between IBD risk variants and the fungal members of the gut microbiome have been revealed.

Thus lactose intolerance arising from genetic variants in the host could potentially be treated using a prebiotic to modulate the composition of the gut microbiome.Obesity-associated variantsObesity is transferable from humans to germ-free mice via faecal microbiome transplant78 supporting the idea that the composition of the gut microbiome has a caus- ative role in modulating weight gain and loss.
