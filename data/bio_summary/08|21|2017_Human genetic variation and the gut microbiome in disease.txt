the review focuses on disorders of immunity using the intesti- nal disorder inflammatory bowel disease ibd as an example and of metabolism using the extra-intestinal disorder of obesity as an example.microbiome gwasmgwas are cohort studies that combine human geno- typing or whole-genome sequencing with microbiome analysis 16s ribosomal rna rrna or metagenomicsequencing from the same individual to investigate howhost genetics and microbiome composition affect health and disease.an early mgwas by blekhman et al.

variants in this gene were linked to changes in the composition of the gut microbiome14 supporting the notion that behavioural changes resulting from this genetically determined die- tary preference might alter the composition of the gut microbiome but mechanistic insights regarding this association are lacking.overall the most significant challenge facing the host genetics and microbiome field is the establishment of causality in the observed associations between the environment host genetics the gut microbiome andheritabilitythe proportion of variance of a trait attributed to host genetics rather than environmental effects.

as another example germ-free mice colonized with species from the human gut microbiome lost almost all human microbial spe- cies and re-established mouse-specific microbiota within 14 days of cohabiting with normal mice13.genetic variants within a host species are implicated in the dramatic variation of the gut microbiome between individuals214.

1. knowledge of the factors that affect the gut microbiome is of great importance because dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple diseases1920 including intes- tinal disorders such as crohn's disease ulcerative colitis and necrotizing enterocolitis as well as extra-intestinal disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus asthma obe- sity autism and rheumatoid arthritis21 fig.

age also has specific effects on the diversity and richness of the gut microbiome106107 before the age of 3 years the gut microbiome has a 'child-like' configuration that is characterized by less species diversity whereas after the age of 3 years the gut microbiome attains its more diverse 'adult' configuration108.

the estimate of heritability is based on a comparison of resemblance in monozygotic twins who share all segregating genetic material and dizygotic twins who share on averagehalf of their segregating genetic material.dysbiosisindividual and context-specific taxonomic and functional changes to the compositionof the microbiome that result in a disease state.variants and the gut microbiome22-24 table 1. thesemgwas support the notion that host genes involved in immunity digestion of sugars dietary preferences or gut architecture can alter the composition of the gut microbiome.here we review how genetic variation in the host may alter the composition of the microbiome towards dysbiosis.

studies in which statistical associations between genetic variants and a disease or trait of interest are identified by genotyping individuals with disease and healthy controls for a set of snps that capture variation across theentire genome.metagenomica term used to describe techniques that characterize the genomes of whole communities of organisms rather than individual species.human microbiome project an interdisciplinary project funded by the us national institutes of health with the aim of generating resources that enable the comprehensive characterization of the human microbiome and the analysis of its role in human healthand disease.analysis of variance anova approach the authors identified 42 host genetic loci that affected b diversity a measure of inter-individual variability in gut micro- biome composition.

severalvariants in these genes allow for the overgrowth of spe- cific species of the gut microbiome which may trigger the disproportionate immune response that is implicated in the pathogenesis of ibd30.immunity-related ibd risk alleles alter microbiome composition.

a missense muta- tion in slc39a8 was associated with both an increased incidence of crohn's disease and altered microbiome composition50.additional links between ibd risk variants and the fungal members of the gut microbiome have been revealed.

thus lactose intolerance arising from genetic variants in the host could potentially be treated using a prebiotic to modulate the composition of the gut microbiome.obesity-associated variantsobesity is transferable from humans to germ-free mice via faecal microbiome transplant78 supporting the idea that the composition of the gut microbiome has a caus- ative role in modulating weight gain and loss.

the fact that variants in genes highly expressed in neurons are linked to alterations in gut microbiome composition raises the possibility that behavioural changes alter the composition of the gut microbiome.

the key question now is which variants have an effect on the composition of the gut microbiome in a manner that promotes dis- ease some genes might act directly to shift the micro- biome to a disease-causing state for example nod2 variants which cause defects in sensing and responding to the gut microbiome.

additional studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms by which variation in host genes affects the composition of the microbiome and to discrimi- nate which microbiome differences are the cause versus the consequence of disease.
