To seek proof of principle that age-related HG-diet-induced phenotypes could be delayed or reversed half of the HG mice consumed the HG diet for 6 mo and then were transferred to the LG diet hereafter HGxoLG mice for the last 6 mo of life see schematic in Fig.

All mice gained weight on their study diet but HG mice gained weight more rapidly than the mice fed the LG diet hereafter LG mice Fig.

Higher levels of hydrophilic metabolites including carbohydrates and amino acids are associated with lower retinal damage scores and consumption of the LG diet whereas higher levels of lipids are associated with higher retinal damage scores and the HG diet Fig.

The shift from the HG to the LG diet was associated with increased Fir- micutes and diminished levels of unclassified phyla thus re- sembling the microbiomes in LG mice Fig.

Gut microbiota were responsive to diet and we identified microbiota in the Clostridiales order as being associated with AMDf and the HG diet whereas protection from AMDf was associated with the Bacteroidales order and the LG diet.

Most of these AMDf were prevented or reversed by consuming the LG diet or by switching from the HG diet to the LG diet during maturity.Metabolic and Biochemical Insights into the Etiology of AMDf.

The con- sumption of a high-glycemia HG diet resulted in many AMD features AMDf including RPE hypopigmentation and atrophy lip- ofuscin accumulation and photoreceptor degeneration whereas consumption of the lower-glycemia LG diet did not.

Impressively there was no further photoreceptor cell loss in the HGxoLG group after their change to the LG diet implying a rapid diet-related arrest or reversal of HG-induced damage.Inner retina layer thinning photoreceptor disorganization and swelling of inner segments as well as photoreceptor de- generation were observed in HG but not in LG or HGxoLG mice Fig.

ANOVA indicated specific metabolites that associated with diet andor retinal damage score be it uniquely additively or as a diet-phenotype interaction Fig.
