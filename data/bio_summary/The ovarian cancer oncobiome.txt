The other parasitic signatures detected in the ovarian cancer listed in Figure 4A were detected with lower hybridization signalintensity log glog r  1 although with high prevalence except for signatures of Loa loa Acanthamoeba Taenia Dicrocoelium Wuchereria which were detected in less than 45 of the ovarian cancer samples screened.

Among the conserved poxviridae probes mentioned a comprises the conserved probes detected significantly in the ovarian cancer versus the controls and b comprises the conserved probes detected significantly in the controls versus the ovarian cancers screened.

The different bacterial signatures unique or common to the control and ovarian cancer samples are listed in Table 1 and represented in Figure 2C.While signatures of Pediococcus was detected with the highest hybridization signal in the ovarian cancer samples screened followed closely by that of Burkholderia Sphingomonas Chryseobacterium Enterococcus Staphylococcus Treponema and Francisella log glog r  1 Shewanella signatures were detected with the highest prevalence in 91 of the cancers Figure 2A.

However they were not detected in the non-matched controls Figure 4A.Hierarchical clustering of the ovarian cancer samplesHierarchical clustering analysis compares the similarity of the overall microbiome signatures detected in each ovarian cancer sample and clusters the samples together based on common microbiome similarity Figure 5A-5B.

Also the majority of the Polyomavirus probes significantly detected in the ovarian cancers were that of Merkel cell Polyomaviruses which were undetectable in the controls whereas the majority of the Polyomavirus probes detected in the controls were that of SV40 traces of which were also detected in the cancers Figure 1F Supplementary Table 2.

The ovarian cancer microbiome signature provides insights for the development of targeted therapeutics against ovarian cancers.INTRODUCTIONIn the US ovarian cancer is the second most common and most deadly of the gynecologic cancers affecting 1 in 70 women with a mortality rate of 1 of all women gynecology-and-obstetricsgynecologic-tumorsovarian- cancer.

The supplemental data contains all of the integration site data for all viruses tested.In conclusion our data suggests that due to the nature of ovarian tumor and its micro-environment significant perturbations have occurred in the ovarian microbiome resulting in a specific ovarian tumor microbiome signature.

However there are distinct viral and microbial signatures in the tumor-specific signature.Viral signatures associated with ovarian cancerThe viral signatures detected in the ovarian cancer and control samples are shown according to their decreasing hybridization signal along with their prevalence in Figure 1A-1E.

Figure 1G and Table 1 shows the common as well as unique viral signatures detected in ovarian cancer when compared to the matched and non-matched controls.The data suggest a substantial perturbation of the virome in ovarian cancer.

This suggests that the fungal signatures may be more tightly associated in this particular microenvironment than previously predicted.Identification of parasitic signatures associated with ovarian cancerThe parasitic signatures detected in the ovarian cancer and controls are shown Figure 4A according to their decreasing prevalence.
