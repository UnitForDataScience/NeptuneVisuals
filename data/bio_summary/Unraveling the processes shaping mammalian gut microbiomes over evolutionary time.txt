this was possiblebecause host phylogeny shapes gut microbiome compositions mainly near the leaves of the bacterial tree mantel test r2 0.38 at 100 myr ago p valueo0.001 r2 0.03 at 1000 myr ago p value40.05 while host diet mostly determines the distribution of more ancient bacterial lineages among hosts mantel test r2 0.08 at 100 myr ago p valueo0.001 r2 0.22 at 1000 myr ago p valueo0.001 1ab.we performed multiple control experiments to evaluate the robustness of this signal of phylogenetic scale disparity between host phylogeny and diet supplementary figs 4-7 and supplementary note 3 and 4. we measured the influence of the intrahost species variability of microbiome compositions the influence of topological uncertainties in the tree of bacteria and the influence of differences in statistical power at different depth of the bacterial tree.

our microbiome-based method to predict ancestral diets uses the correlation between extant diet and extant gut bacterial community compositions.assuming that the relationship between diet and bacterial composition has not varied since the last common ancestor of mammals ancestral diet can be predicted from reconstructed ancestral community compositions 2b.

using such an approach we show that diet drives the horizontal acquisition of bacterial lineages that belong to ancient bacterial clades and that host phylogeny predicts the presence of more recent bacterial lineages.

note that bdtt allows us to statistically disentangle the temporally separatedportions of the contributions of host phylogeny and diet when defined with a coarse granularity not the totality of the processes themselves.to further resolve the roles of host diet and phylogeny we asked whether the more recent bacterial lineages that correlate with host phylogeny are nested within ancient diet-related bacterial lineages or whether they are independent from them supplementary fig.

however it does not rule out the possibility that fine-grained differences in diet that are locally correlated with host phylogeny and which are not captured by our diet distance metric have promoted co-speciation or alternatively have created spurious co-speciation signals see supplementary discussion.altogether while most bacterial lineages do show evidence of horizontal inheritance our results also suggest that vertical inheritance is an evolutionary path followed by numerous mammalian gut symbionts and extend the recent results on patterns of co-speciation between gut bacterial lineages andhominids to larger evolutionary scales see supplementarynote 9.co-speciating bacteria are associated with disease in humans.

this means that althoughsome bacteria related to host phylogeny at recent timescales are nested within higher clades also related to broad categories of host diet a large part of the bacteria associated with host phylogeny are different from the bacteria associated with diet see also 'bacterial lineages correlating with host phylogeny and diet lowly overlap' in supplementary note 5. we also measured to what extent the covariation between host phylogeny and diet drives gut community b-diversities.

for example a given mammalian clade might select non-vertically inherited bacteria within a bacterial lineage that arose prior to the emergence of mammals.thus a phylogenetically informed approach incorporating compositional disparities along the bacterial phylogenetic timescale may allow us to disentangle the individual contributions of host phylogeny and major dietary shifts and to better understand how and to what extent the different types of bacterial inheritance vertical and horizontal have driven gut community evolution.

this suggests that herbivory and carnivory are associated with bacterial lineages that emerged at different evolutionary timescales and that traits allowing bacterial lineages to thrive within a mammalian herbivorous gut appeared early in bacterial evolution while those permitting specializationin carnivore guts arrived much later which is consistent with the late appearance of carnivorous animals.omnivores do not harbour omnivore-specific bacteria.

herbivory is associated with bacterial lineages that arise earlier in bacterial evolution than those associated with carnivory.suggesting that omnivores contain a combination of herbivorous and carnivorous bacterial groups.

at all bacterial scales defined by time or evolutionary distance we measured the percentage of individual bacterial lineages otu that have a distribution across mammalian hostscorrelated to host phylogenetic and dietary distances using permutation multivariate analysis of variance testsand a false discovery rate fdr approach to correct for multiple tests.the ecological niche of a species here each bacterial lineage can be described by its mean and breadth along an environmental gradient.

we hypothesized that major changes in diet and host phylogeny may have driven vertical and horizontal inheritance of bacterial lineages at different bacterial phylogenetic scales.

for example when mammalian lineages shifted their diet towards herbivory they might have horizontally acquired herbivorous-specific bacterial lineages and those bacterial lineages could even predate the divergence of themammals.

the effect of diet on more ancient bacterial lineages is consistent with the evolutionary conservation of functional traits involved in the digestion ofdietary compounds in ancient bacterial taxa.

after removing the bacterial lineages correlated with broad categories of diet 1a we found that the correlations between host phylogeny and bacterial composition within recent time slices decreased but remained very strong 1c close to their previous level mantel testr2 0.34 versus 0.38 at 100 myr ago.

we observed that at all bacterial phylogenetic scales the covariation between hostphylogeny and diet only weakly explains bacterial community dissimilarity r2 ranging from about 0.01 to about 0.04 see supplementary fig.
