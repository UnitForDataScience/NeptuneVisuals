For example a given mammalian clade might select non-vertically inherited bacteria within a bacterial lineage that arose prior to the emergence of mammals.Thus a phylogenetically informed approach incorporating compositional disparities along the bacterial phylogenetic timescale may allow us to disentangle the individual contributions of host phylogeny and major dietary shifts and to better understand how and to what extent the different types of bacterial inheritance vertical and horizontal have driven gut community evolution.

Using such an approach we show that diet drives the horizontal acquisition of bacterial lineages that belong to ancient bacterial clades and that host phylogeny predicts the presence of more recent bacterial lineages.

This suggests that herbivory and carnivory are associated with bacterial lineages that emerged at different evolutionary timescales and that traits allowing bacterial lineages to thrive within a mammalian herbivorous gut appeared early in bacterial evolution while those permitting specializationin carnivore guts arrived much later which is consistent with the late appearance of carnivorous animals.Omnivores do not harbour omnivore-specific bacteria.

Herbivory is associated with bacterial lineages that arise earlier in bacterial evolution than those associated with carnivory.suggesting that omnivores contain a combination of herbivorous and carnivorous bacterial groups.

At all bacterial scales defined by time or evolutionary distance we measured the percentage of individual bacterial lineages OTU that have a distribution across mammalian hostscorrelated to host phylogenetic and dietary distances using permutation multivariate analysis of variance testsand a false discovery rate FDR approach to correct for multiple tests.The ecological niche of a species here each bacterial lineage can be described by its mean and breadth along an environmental gradient.

Here we show that host phylogeny and major dietary shifts have affected the distribution of different gut bacterial lineages and did so on vastly different bacterial phylogenetic resolutions.

We hypothesized that major changes in diet and host phylogeny may have driven vertical and horizontal inheritance of bacterial lineages at different bacterial phylogenetic scales.

For example when mammalian lineages shifted their diet towards herbivory they might have horizontally acquired herbivorous-specific bacterial lineages and those bacterial lineages could even predate the divergence of themammals.

This was possiblebecause host phylogeny shapes gut microbiome compositions mainly near the leaves of the bacterial tree Mantel test R2 0.38 at 100 Myr ago P valueo0.001 R2 0.03 at 1000 Myr ago P value40.05 while host diet mostly determines the distribution of more ancient bacterial lineages among hosts Mantel test R2 0.08 at 100 Myr ago P valueo0.001 R2 0.22 at 1000 Myr ago P valueo0.001 1ab.We performed multiple control experiments to evaluate the robustness of this signal of phylogenetic scale disparity between host phylogeny and diet Supplementary Figs 4-7 and Supplementary Note 3 and 4.

The effect of diet on more ancient bacterial lineages is consistent with the evolutionary conservation of functional traits involved in the digestion ofdietary compounds in ancient bacterial taxa.
