The secondary aim was to assess the effect of BB-12-supplemented yogurt on the gut microbiota of the children.Methods Sixty children ages 1 to 5 years were randomly assigned to consume 4 ounces of either BB-12-supplemented yogurt or nonsupplemented control yogurt daily for 10 days.

This is in agreement with a previous study reporting that the gut microbiota of newborns increase rapidly in diversity through early childhood and become more adult-like during the first 1 to 3 years of life Moreover self-reported adverse events seemed to be associated with the level of diversity observed in the gut microbiota of the present study cohort.

Meanwhile it is noteworthy that the gut microbial com- munities of healthy individuals are relatively stable Probiotics have shown promising effects on gut microbiota in health-com- promised subjects Healthy people with stable gut micro- biota are however likely to be more resilient to probiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota.A few limitations to the present study should be noted.

The gut microbiota contains more than 100 trillion microorganisms and hundreds of species of facultative and obligate anaerobes Interventions such as antibiotics can disrupt the normal micro- biota resulting in among other effects decreased short-chain fatty acid metabolism accumulation of luminal carbohydrate sub- sequent pH changes water absorption and ultimately diarrhea Probiotics may help to normalize the perturbed microbiota of a gastrointestinal tract after antibiotic treatment Previous sys- tematic reviews of probiotics in the prevention of antibiotic-associ- ated diarrhea AAD concluded that probiotics may have a protective effect on AAD Most studies were however conducted outside the United States and were not subject to Investigational New Drug IND guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research FDACBER The evidence for the efficacy of yogurt con- sumption to prevent AAD is further limited The most common strains studied and used in probiotic products are from the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus.

Although numerous studies have shown that a low-diversity gut microbiota are often linked to disease states it is acknowledged that the interaction between gut microbiota and host is much more complicated than just a high or low microbial diversity.

Song et al showed that family members that live together share microbiota with one another and with their dogs.

No significant changes due to probiotic treatment were observed in the gut microbiota of the study cohort.Conclusions BB-12-supplemented yogurt is safe and well-tolerated when consumed by healthy children.
