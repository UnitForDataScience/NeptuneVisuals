the primary outcome was to assess safety and tolerability as determined by the number of reported adverse events.results a total of 186 nonserious adverse events were reported with no significant differences between the control and bb-12 groups.

the events were graded for severity using the national institutes of health division of aids table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric adverse events serious adverse events were defined as any incidences of death life- threatening event hospitalization prolongation of a hospital stay or an event resulting in permanent disability.secondary outcome measuresthe secondary aim was to evaluate the influence of bb- 12-supplemented yogurt on the fecal microbiota of patients and determine any changes in the composition of the microbial community.fecal dna extractiondna from stool samples provided by participants on days 0 10 30 60 and 90 was isolated using mobio powersoil dna isolation kit cat.

the frequencies of adverse and serious adverse outcomes were compared using fisher's exact test.

the participating children con- sumed 4 ounces 112 g of the assigned yogurt beverage which delivered at least 1 1010 colony-forming units of bb-12 per serving orally per day for 10 consecutive days.to assess the safety of the interventions research assistants conducted follow-up interviews at days 6 11 15 and 180 all 2 days and a second physical examination was performed on day 14. a 14-day daily assessment diary was completed by the caregivers which captured data on compliance symptoms and adverse events.

an independent data safety monitoring board reviewed the protocol before study initiation and adverse event data at approximately 33 50 and 66 data completion.

colonies counted as b lactis were randomly picked and confirmed to be b lactis by polymerase chain reaction pcr using subspecies-specific primers primary outcome measuresthe primary outcome was the frequency and severity of adverse events reported during the study.

data on adverse events were collected via daily assessment diaries spontaneous calls to the 24-hour study phone line and regularly scheduled phone interviews with the research personnel.

an adverse event refers to any unto- ward event experienced by a participant during a clinical trial whether or not it is associated with the use of the study products.

adverse events were tabulated by type intensityseverity solicited or unsolicited and charted over time.

the frequency and severity of the adverse events were described using frequencies and percentages.
