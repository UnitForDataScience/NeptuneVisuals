HAY diets had a greater bacterial diversity indices in the SAB community in terms of richness Shannon and Simpson index indicating the presence of a greater number of bacterial species and similar abundance of the different bacterial species OTU's compared to GRA diets Supplementary Table 4 but those differences tended to disappear at 48 h incubation F T. Permutational analysis of variance showed a strong effect of the F T interaction on the structure of the SAB community  indicating that differences between forage types disappeared at later stages of the colonization process 48 h. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on the structure of the SAB community.

In terms of bacterial diversity Supplementary Table 4 Chao index or Good's coverage remained high and constant indicating that sequencing depth was comparable across all samples.The bacterial diversity in the epiphytic community feed samples at 0 h was composed of 480 and 532 OTUs in GRA and HAY diets respectively but once inside the vessels feeds were rapidly colonized by the rumen bacterial community which reached a maximum diversity at 2 h after feeding .

The proportion of SAB-N resulting from ammonia incorporation was 17 20 26 and 33 for treatments GRA  GRA  HAY and HAY  respectively thus higher for HAY than GRA diets P 0.017 with no effect of vitamin E.Quantitative PCR  and Supplementary Table 4 showed a faster colonization of GRA diets by bacteria methanogens and protozoa during the early fermentation 8 h while no differences compared to HAY were observed thereafter F T. Vitamin E supplementation increased the concentration of bacteria methanogens protozoa and anaerobic fungi associated with the plant residues.

Taken together the observations suggest that primary colonizing bacteria for GRA are likely to utilize soluble nutrients and easily accessible substrates as was confirmed by the high disappearances for WSC 75 true N 41 and DM 21 but low NDF disappearance 7.For HAY diets the most abundant genera during the early colonization stage was Streptococcus 20.3 which was part of a more complex bacterial community than observed in GRA diets in terms of diversity  158 OTUs and network density  38 nodes and 80 edges highlighting the complexity of early HAY colonization moreover the high proportion of negative correlations 40 suggested the importance of competition processes among bacterial groups possibly as a result of limiting availability of fermentable substrates.

This secondary colonization was a dynamic and linear process in which the SAB community increased in size but decreased in diversity  122 OTUs indicating a predominance of fewer bacterial groups which took part in a progressively simpler bacterial network composed of half of the bacterial community.

Moreover the structure of the bacterial community differed between the forage types according to CCA the bacterial community in GRA diets was positively correlated with increased levels of bacteria  1.91 log methanogens  1.42 and protozoa  1.06 indicating a more effective colonization process than in HAY diets.

Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinate was performed based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.colonization of GRA was twice as fast as HAY since at 2 h after feeding 16 of the total N in the plant residue from GRA diets was microbial N but only 9 in HAY diets.

Moreover during this interval the HAY diet promoted a more complex bacterial community  179 OTUs and network than the GRA diet in terms of nodes  21 edges  51 and a predominance of positive correlations 67 among the bacterial groups indicating a greater complexity of its secondary colonization.
