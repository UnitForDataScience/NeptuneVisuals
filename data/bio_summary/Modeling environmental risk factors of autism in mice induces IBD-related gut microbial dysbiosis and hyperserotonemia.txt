when subjected to a battery of stand- ard behavioral testing at six weeks of age both poly ic and vpa offspring hereafter referred to as asd mice showed autism-related behavioral abnormalities includ- ing increased anxiety and decreased social behavior additional file figure s1.we analyzed the composition of fecal microbiota of post-weaned postnatal day 21 p21 mice and observed that the overall composition of gut microbes of asd mice did not significantly differ from that of ctl mice at the phylum level except for a slight increase in firmicutes accompanied by a roughly equal amount of decrease in bacteroidetes fig.

collectively the gut microbiota of asd mice was not distinguishable from that of ctl mice at the phylum level or in their general composition rather these results suggest that the decrease in their alpha-diversity indexes might stem from dysbiosis at the genus or species level.asd- and ibd-related gut bacterial species are altered in asd micea number of studies have reported that children with asd - or patients with ibd  - have al- tered gut microbial composition at the genus or species level some of which are consistently reported across a number of clinical studies summarized in table .we therefore performed relative abundance analysis of gut microbiota of asd mice at various taxonomic levels ran- ging from phylum to species and found that prenatal injection of poly ic and vpa resulted in significant changes in specific microbial taxa in a pattern that highly recapitulates those of clinical asd and ibd fig.

a. comprehensive lists of metabolic pathways significantly al- tered in poly ic and vpa mice are provided in the online version of this manuscript additional file table s2.asd mice have elevated level of serum serotonin interestingly we observed one pathway that was up- regulated in vpa p  0.047 and poly ic mice p  0.055 which was not directly implicated in the disease progression of either asd or ibd protein digestion and absorption hsa04974.

lastly we tested if asd mice also display hyperserotonemia another highly occurring comorbidities in asd.methodsgeneration of environmental risk factor-induced mouse models of autismpregnant c57bl6 mice from japan slc inc. japan were purchased via central lab.

differences between groups were deter- mined significant at p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 and p  0.0001.resultsasd mice have reduced gut bacterial diversityaccording to previous literature on generating environ- mental risk factor-induced asd model we intraperito- neally injected pregnant c57bl6 mice with 20 mgkg poly ic  or 500 mgkg vpa  at embryonic day 12.5 e12.5.

however in each of those time points the microbial communities of asd mice were not clearly distinguished from that of ctl mice fig.

when we rea- nalyzed the gut microbial abundance at the family level prevotellaceae comprised more than 7 of the total gut microbial community in ctl mice whereas it only spanned 2.5 in asd mice with many specimens showing close to zero percentage abundances fig.

importantly a recent publication has shown that the gut microbes are responsible for stimulating host serotonin production and noted that spore-forming bac- teria of clostridia class are responsible for such action.we therefore analyzed the relative abundance of clostridia class bacteria in asd mice and found that clos- tridiales tissierellaceae sporanaerobacter a genus that forms spores and produces scfas 8 was significantly increased in both poly ic and vpa mice fig.

indeed when we analyzed the serum from asd mice we observed a significant increase of serum serotonin level compared to ctl mice fig.

we have also observed that asd mice have gut microbial dysbiosis with decreased alpha-diversity com- pared to ctl mice which is in line with few previous publications on gut microbial profiling of children with asd  or patients with ibd this suggests that prenatal events could act as causal agents for microbial alteration responsible for ibd one of the most common comorbidities observed in asd.our result on ibd-like microbial dysbiosis in two environmental risk factor models of asd adds support to previous studies that have investigated how prenatal injection of poly ic or vpa affects the gi tract in off- spring later in life.

recently expression of a variant in serotonin transport gene slc6a4 in mice was shown to result in hyperser- otonemia and asd-related behavioral abnormalities however no single genetic variant or mutation related to asd accounts for more than 1-2 of the total affected population  a figure falling far short of the prevalence of hyperserotonemia 40. instead we here report for the first time that modeling environmental risk factors of asd in mice resulted in a significantly elevated level of serum serotonin fig.

we analyzed the overall composition of gut microbiota in poly ic and vpa mice as well as the relative abundances of 259 microbial taxa and compared the results to existing reports on microbial dysbiosis in clin- ical cases of asd and ibd.

the mice were first tested for anxiety-related behavior using open field chamber 424242 cm in which exploratory behavior in a novel environment was assessed in 10-minute sessions.

the amount of total movement during the experimental session as well as time spent in the center region 3030 cm area was measured and compared to corresponding control ctl group.the mice were also tested for social interaction behavior using 3-chamber assay .
