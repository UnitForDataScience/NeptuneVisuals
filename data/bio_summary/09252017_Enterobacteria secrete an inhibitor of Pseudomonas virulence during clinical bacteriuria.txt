aeruginosa was detected by culture in the urine oninhibiting pyochelin-mediated iron uptake as well as an opposing selective pressure on E. coli to suppress competing Pseudomonas strains in polymicrobial settings.Escherichelin is produced during human E. coli cystitis.

coli isolates frequently possess nonconserved genetic systems related to virulence 7 8.Prominent among virulence-associated adaptations in uro- pathogenic E. coli UPEC isolates are siderophores specialized metabolites able to bind extracellular FeIII ions for nutritional use in low-iron conditions 7 9.

Escherichelin is produced during clinical E. coli UTI and experimental human colonization with the asymptomatic bacteriuria strain E. coli HU2117.

coli strain lacking the virulence-associated papG adhesin E. coli HU2117 27.

Consis- tent with this activity we observed that P. aeruginosa minimizes escherichelin release compared with E. coli despite generating the same biosynthetic precursors to escherichelin during pyoche- lin biosynthesis.

Escherichelin release is suppressed in P. aeruginosa relative to E. coli.

LC-MSMS chromatograms of extracellular metabolites released from Ybt and pyochelin biosynthetic enzymes in the E. coli strain UTI89 left and the P. aeruginosa strain PA01 right cultured in iron-deficient media are displayed in the center.

To determine whether P. aeruginosa minimizes esche- richelin release relative to E. coli we compared escherichelin pro- duction between UTI89 and PAO1 in low-iron medium.

We also experimentally confirmed that escherichelin purified from E. coli inhibits P. aeruginosa pyochelin-dependent growth.

coli in the urinary tract secretes an antivirulence compound against P. aeruginosa 26 27.
