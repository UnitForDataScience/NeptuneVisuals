Subsequent culture- based studies of amniotic fluid confirmed sterility during a healthy pregnancy Specifically bacterial cul- ture of amniotic fluid samples obtained by abdominal puncture n  44 or by transcervical aspiration n  8 showed no growth in 96 and 50 of the cases respect- ively Because fetal infection was absent and because the positive samples were monocultures of Staphylococcus albus Streptococcus or yeast the author concluded that any colonies detected resulted from con- tamination during collection and that his results upheld the notion of sterile amniotic fluid.

Although these studies were not aimed at the determination of a placental microbiome in healthy pregnancies per se their findings do reinforce the idea that bacteria are not present in the healthy fetal environment.In utero colonization hypothesis the womb is not sterile and microbial colonization of the infant begins prior to birthMost of the evidence supporting the sterile womb para- digm was generated with traditional microscopy or culture-based techniques which are today considered deficient for assessing a microbiome.

Reports employing these techniques propose that bacteria are not only present within the fetal environment in healthy full-term preg- nancies  but that they also constitute a pla- cental microbiome that jump-starts the colonization of the fetus - as part of its normal developmental process Additionally it has been suggested that the uterus contains its own microbiome that can contribute to fetal colonization as the placenta develops from both fetal trophoblasts and maternal decidua the inner lining of the uterus After the early studies on the meconium discussed above microbiological research on the meconium ceased for a period of over 30 years reviewed by until Jime- nez and colleagues reported 100 n  21 of meconiums to be positive for bacteria by culture techniques The development of molecular techniques and high-throughput sequencing spurred additional research on the microbiol- ogy of the meconium.

These studies propose that neither the fetus the placenta nor the amniotic fluid are sterile and that acquisition and colonization of the human gastrointes- tinal tract begins in utero - If this in utero colonization hypothesis proves correct there would be major repercussions on our understanding of the estab- lishment of the pioneer human microbiome its role in human health and the role of environmental lifestyle and clinical factors that affect its assembly and function.

These studies included cases of preterm labor where 15 of samples were positive n  166 preeclampsia 9.6 positive samples n  62 small-for- gestational-age pregnancies 6 positive samples n  52 preterm pre-labor membrane rupture 50 positive samples n  204  and neonatal sepsis 57 positive samples n  36 .

Some studies report that the meconium contains bacteria simi- lar to those found in amniotic fluid and authors have proposed that fetal gut colonization could occur through ingestion of amniotic fluid that contains bac- teria  However the vast majority of the lit- erature demonstrates that the pioneer gut microbiome is heavily influenced by birth method and later dominated by species that are characteristic gut microbes while mi- crobes detected in the fetal environment are absent Fig.

Although there may be some evidence albeit in- consistent for the presence of bacterial DNA in placen- tal and amniotic fluid samples of healthy pregnancies it is not at all clear how an immunologically immature fetus would successfully control viable bacteria to pre- vent infections and mortality and develop normally.Methodological considerationsMost of the studies that established the sterile womb paradigm are based on microbial culture which fails to detect viable but non-cultivable microbes.

In fact studies have demonstrated that sequence-based analyses of samples with low DNA levels are not reliable because reagents consumables and components of DNA extraction kits contain bacter- ial DNA - Work by Salter and colleagues has systematically demonstrated that the lower the amount of bacterial DNA in a sample the higher the proportion of sequences that can be attributed to con- tamination.

However germ- free humans although rare have been established using protocols similar to those employed during the generation of large axenic mammals via aseptic hysterotomy - This procedure has been applied in suspected cases of severe immune deficiency of the fetus The firstgerm-free human was delivered by performing a C-section inside a sterile canopy attached to the mother's abdomen which prevented exposure to environmental contaminants Gram stains of feces and aerobic and anaerobic cul- tures of swabs from both the infant and the isolator sur- faces confirmed the germ-free status of the infant  The published cases report axenic status from 6 days to 3 months after which the subjects were either removed from the axenic isolators or microbial contamination was detected 17 9 1.
