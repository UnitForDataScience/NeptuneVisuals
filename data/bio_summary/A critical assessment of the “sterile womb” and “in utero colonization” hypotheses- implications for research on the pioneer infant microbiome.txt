reports employing these techniques propose that bacteria are not only present within the fetal environment in healthy full-term preg- nancies  but that they also constitute a pla- cental microbiome that jump-starts the colonization of the fetus - as part of its normal developmental process additionally it has been suggested that the uterus contains its own microbiome that can contribute to fetal colonization as the placenta develops from both fetal trophoblasts and maternal decidua the inner lining of the uterus after the early studies on the meconium discussed above microbiological research on the meconium ceased for a period of over 30 years reviewed by until jime- nez and colleagues reported 100 n  21 of meconiums to be positive for bacteria by culture techniques the development of molecular techniques and high-throughput sequencing spurred additional research on the microbiol- ogy of the meconium.

using sterile gloves the surgeon makes an incision in the uterus and removes the placenta and amniotic sac which are then transferred into a second sterile iso- lator so the fetuses can be revived in an aseptic envir- onment 9.during hysterotomies and hysterectomies either the intact pregnant uterus or its entire contents including the placenta the amniotic sac and the fetus respect- ively are removed and transferred to generate germ-free animals.

all women in labor for less than 6 h n  28 tested negative for bac- teria while positive cultures were obtained from those in labor for more than 6 h n  22. subsequent culture- based studies of amniotic fluid confirmed sterility during a healthy pregnancy specifically bacterial cul- ture of amniotic fluid samples obtained by abdominal puncture n  44 or by transcervical aspiration n  8 showed no growth in 96 and 50 of the cases respect- ively because fetal infection was absent and because the positive samples were monocultures of staphylococcus albus streptococcus or yeast the author concluded that any colonies detected resulted from con- tamination during collection and that his results upheld the notion of sterile amniotic fluid.

overall these studies suggest that early meconium har- bors no detectable bacteria while later samples do indi- cating the need to account for time elapsed post-birth when investigating bacterial presence in these samples.seminal work by harris and brown significantly shaped the concept of a sterile amniotic cavity by inves- tigating the presence of cultivable bacteria in the amni- otic fluid of women undergoing c-sections.

some studies report that the meconium contains bacteria simi- lar to those found in amniotic fluid and authors have proposed that fetal gut colonization could occur through ingestion of amniotic fluid that contains bac- teria  however the vast majority of the lit- erature demonstrates that the pioneer gut microbiome is heavily influenced by birth method and later dominated by species that are characteristic gut microbes while mi- crobes detected in the fetal environment are absent fig.

experiments with germ-free mice have shown that bacterial colonization is rapid with bacterial species detectable 8 h after the initial exposure of the mice to conventional housing and bacterial counts becoming equivalent to those of conventional mice after 24 h if the germ- free human supports microbial growth similarly to that of a germ-free mouse then a rapid colonization process would also be expected to occur in the neonatal gut.

this study revealed that placenta samples contained exactly the same marginal amounts of bacterial dna as the extraction blanks and that the bacterial communitiesdetected clustered closely with the contaminant commu- nity of the respective dna isolation kit.

accordingly the placenta has several ana- tomical physiological and immunological features that prevent bacterial colonization.anatomical and physiological barriersthe materno-fetal barrier contains two anatomically distinct elements the chorioallantoic placenta and the chorioamnion.

bacterial communities of meconium and colostrum share a common maternal source colostrum does not directly contribute to the meconium microbiotatable 1 summary of recent studies on the microbiology of amniotic fluid placenta and meconium continuedmeconiumvaginally or cesarean-delivered healthy full-term japanese infants n  151rt-qpcr for selected speciesbacteria were detected in 95 of meconiums.the infant microbiota is strongly influenced by delivery mode.

although the authors attribute this result to freezing the samples prior to processing they also ponder the possibility that only bacterial products including dna rather than living bacteria are present in the placenta.

proponents of a fetal microbiome suggest several routes of bacterial access to the placenta including ascension from the lower genital tract entry through the mother's bloodstream or active transport of microbes by immune cells from the gut or oral cavity fig.

several aspects must be taken into consideration these include the ana- tomical immunological and physiological features of the placenta the immunological status of the fetus the limitations of the research methods used to study micro- bial populations the microbiome during the very first days of life and the evidence provided by the generation of germ-free animals including humans.anatomical physical and immunological considerationsthe two main functions of the placenta are nourish- ment of the fetus and its protection from microbial pathogens.
