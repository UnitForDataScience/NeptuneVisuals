Experiments with germ-free mice have shown that bacterial colonization is rapid with bacterial species detectable 8 h after the initial exposure of the mice to conventional housing and bacterial counts becoming equivalent to those of conventional mice after 24 h If the germ- free human supports microbial growth similarly to that of a germ-free mouse then a rapid colonization process would also be expected to occur in the neonatal gut.

This study revealed that placenta samples contained exactly the same marginal amounts of bacterial DNA as the extraction blanks and that the bacterial communitiesdetected clustered closely with the contaminant commu- nity of the respective DNA isolation kit.

Accordingly the placenta has several ana- tomical physiological and immunological features that prevent bacterial colonization.Anatomical and physiological barriersThe materno-fetal barrier contains two anatomically distinct elements the chorioallantoic placenta and the chorioamnion.

Significant differences be- tween the neonatal and adult immune system include a reduction in serum complement activity decreased abil- ity to produce antibodies against bacterial polysaccharide antigens and increased numbers of naive T cells and antigen-presenting cells with a correspondingly naive functional program  Apart from a limited subset of AMPs that are expressed in distinct fetal compart- ments fetuses do not have the immunity needed to successfully overcome bacterial invasion.

Most importantly no bacterial lineages were identified as unique to or present at greater abundances in placental samples when compared to contamination controls.Apart from preventing the contamination of DNA avoiding sample contamination per se is also a signifi- cant challenge when studying low-abundance and low- diversity bacterial communities.

Even though the bacterial species identified by molecular techniques in fetal environments are known to be readily cultivable bacterial culture which does provide a suffi- cient detection limit is almost always negative.

Proponents of a fetal microbiome suggest several routes of bacterial access to the placenta including ascension from the lower genital tract entry through the mother's bloodstream or active transport of microbes by immune cells from the gut or oral cavity Fig.

Only bona fide bacterial pathogens for example Listeria monocytogenes Brucella abortus and Toxiplasma gondii possess the factors necessary for suc- cessful invasion of these barriers subversion of the immune response and establishment in the placenta as viable organisms.
