At this point animals weighed between 200-220 g. The animals were then randomly grouped and subjected to 10-day water avoidance WA stress.At the end of the study ani- mals weighed between 300-350 g. The study and experiments were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals fol- lowing National Institutes of Health guidelines.Experimental stressorThirteen male rats were repeatedly exposed to WA stress as described previously.Briefly the animals were placed on a glass platform in the center of a tank filled with water 25oC to 1 cm below the height of the platform.

The WA dominated cluster is defined by the shared presence of microbial taxa synapomorphies belonging to the genera Corynbacterium Facklamia Anearocuccus and Methylobacterium the familiesFigure 1. a Observed Richness and the b ACE diversity indices indicate significantly p  0.05 increased diversity in the microbiome of WA animals the c Chao1 index tended to significance p 0.05 whereas the d Shannon's index and e Species Accumulation curve did not show differences in diversity in the microbiome of Control and WA animals.Sphingobacteriaceae and Methylobactriaceae and the order Actinomycetales in contrast to animals with more basal positions control dominated on the tree in which these taxa are predominantly absent .Differential microbial abundanceLEfSe analysis performed on microbial abundance data revealed OTUs and microbial clades that were perturbed by the experimental stressor.

How- ever richness and diversity indices indicate a trend of richer and more diverse microbial communities among WA animals compared with control animals .

As the tree is rooted in a hypothetical gnotobiotic individual animals with lower diversity are sorted to the base of the tree cluster composed mostly of HCs and animals with increased diversity are sorted to the terminal branch ends of the tree mostly WA ani- mals.

Of these 19 had higher abundances in control animals and 76 had higher abundances in WA animals .

Red indicates higher abundance in control animals green indicates higher abundance in WA animals and yellow is non-signifi- cant.

Forty-two of these KOs were over-abundant in WA animals and 6 were depleted in WA animals compared with controls.

Functional domains which exhibited increased potential in WA animals included biotin- and sulfur-metabolism and the biosynthesis of fatty acids .DiscussionWA animals exhibited an increased richness and diversity of microbes and predominance of over- abundance among differentially abundant taxa.

Evidence from a noxious-stress mouse model indicates differ- ential responses of the mucosa-adherent and lumi- nal microbial communities and further describes increased richness and diversity in response to an acute dose versus decreased richness and diversity in response to chronic administration.Several microbial taxa were found to be uniquely predominantly present in WA animals compared with controls contributing to the increased diver- sity observed in WA animals.
