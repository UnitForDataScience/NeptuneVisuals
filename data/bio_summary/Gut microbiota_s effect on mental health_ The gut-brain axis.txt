This led to a decrease in differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th2 cells and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B both of which are highly involved in inflammation47 Figure 2.Mothers who consumed probiotics compared to controls were found to have an altered gene expression associated with improved inflammatory responsiveness in the placenta and neonatal gut.20 Probiotic usage in late pregnancy led to a decrease inIL-4 IL-10 and Atopbium a species of the Actinobacteria phylum with a concurrent increase in Bifidobacterium species.48 Mothers who consumed probiotics two weeks prior to delivery had babies with altered expression of TLR-related genes in the placenta and neonatal gut the TLR gene expression varied based on the type of pro- biotics the mother consumed.49 These infants were found to directly respond and modify their inflammatory responses to pathogenic bacteria compared to controls.49 Thus providing mothers with specific pro- biotic formulas may protect the infant from persistent metabolic and immunologic dis- ease processes.Though human symptomatology is the primary interest animal studies have eluci- dated the mechanisms underlying the rela- tionship between probiotics and the immune response.

Those given probiotics showed reduced cortisol levels and improved self- reported psychological effects to a similar degree as participants administered Diazepam a commonly used anti-anxiety medication.52 Analogous studies found that probiotic therapy reduced depressive symp- toms and improved HPA-axis functionality as well as Citalopram and Diazepam.5354Comparing probiotics to the antidepres- sant escitalopram in mice the probiotics were discovered to have similar effects.
