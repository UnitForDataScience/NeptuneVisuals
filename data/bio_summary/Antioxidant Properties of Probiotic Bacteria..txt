Since in recent years oxidative stress has been associated with an altered gut microbiota the effects of probiotics on intestinal flora composition are also elaborated.Keywords oxidative stress antioxidant probiotic signaling pathway gut microbiotaIntroductionOxidative stress refers to elevated intracellular levels of oxygen radicals that cause damage to lipids proteins and DNA .

Additionally recent evidence obtained by our research group also demonstrated that probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 ameliorated the H2O2-induced IPEC-1 oxidative stress by decreasing ROS levels and regulating Nrf2 expressions  Table .NFkBThe first eukaryotic transcription factor shown to respond directly to oxidative stress was NFkB .

Athletes exposed to oxidative stress might benefit from the ability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus to increase antioxidant levels and neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen species .Modes of Action of Probiotic Bacteria in AntioxidationDuring the past decades studies have demonstrated that different probiotic bacteria strains could exert antioxidant capacity in different ways.

It has been recently shown to induce antioxidases in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to suppress hepatic oxidative stress .The levels of antioxidant metabolites of the host can also be regulated by probiotics treatment.

In a very recent study in parallel with the improved intestinal endotoxemia probiotic supplementation consisting of Bifidobacterium infantis Lactobacillus acidopilus and Bacillus cereus increased the levels of these anaerobic bacteria but decreased the abundance of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus in the fecal sample of rats fed a high-sugar and high-fat diet .ConclusionsThe past few years have witnessed a tremendous growth in our knowledge concerning the beneficial effects of probiotics especially those important in mediating responses to oxidative stress.

It is believed that excessive amounts of ROS can cause genomic instability  leading to a variety of chronic diseases including atherosclerosis arthritis diabetes alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases -.However it is worth noting that in addition to oxidative stress when maintained at proper cellular concentrations ROS are important for cell signaling roles .

Hence in the opinion of Lin and Yen the chelating capacity of those probiotic strains may be due to the physiological chelators that exist in the intracellular cell-free extract of probiotics .Antioxidant Enzymes SystemLike animals probiotics also have their own antioxidant enzymatic systems.
