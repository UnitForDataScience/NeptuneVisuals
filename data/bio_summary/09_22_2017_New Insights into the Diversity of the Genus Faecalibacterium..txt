The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences together with the wgMLST profiles and a phylogenomic tree based on comparisons of genome similarity all supported the clustering of Faecalibacterium strains in different genospecies.

The genome data of five different F. prausnitzii strains were retrieved from the PATRIC public database.

The genome of the wild-type strain F. prausnitzii A2-165 F. prausnitziiA2- 165PacBio was sequenced using PacBio single-molecule real- time SMRT technology on an RS system Pacific Bioscience and assembled by the GATC Biotech Company.

The 17 genome sequences were compared with the resulting PGAdb profile using BLASTn with filters of 80 coverage and 90 identity.Average Nucleotide IdentityWe also performed an Average Nucleotide Identity ANI analysis using the whole-genome sequences.

The amino-acid sequences from all coding DNA sequences CDSs in each genome were first used in an all-vs.- all BLASTp analysis with an e-value of 10-6 the sequences were then clustered using the MCL algorithm.

The CDSs observed in all strains were considered to comprise the core genome while the CDSs harbored by only one strain were considered to be singleton genes.To calculate pangenome development we applied Heap's Law with the formula n  kN-a where n is the expected number of genes for a given number of genomes N is the number of genomes and the other terms are constants defined to fit the specific curve.

The extrapolations of the curves of the core genome and singletons were calculated using the least- squares fit of the exponential regression decay of the mean values as represented by the formula n  kexp-xttgth where n is the expected subset of genes for x number of genomes exp is Euler's number and the other terms are constants defined to fitFIGURE 1  Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.

The genome lengths varied by 613994 bp in size.

When the analysis considered only the genomes within a cluster the LCBs were larger and less numerous.Pangenome CalculationTo take a global view of the genome of Faecalibacterium and to further explore the genome diversity of this genus we calculated the size of the pangenome i.e.

Similarly the extrapolation of the pangenome size calculated for groups A B and C generated a values of 0.63 0.77 and 0.66 respectively Figure 6.Examination of the core genome showed that 1421 CDSs were shared by all genomes which corresponded to less than 50 of the average gene content in each genome 3110.29 CDSs and represented 13.71 of the total pangenome.
