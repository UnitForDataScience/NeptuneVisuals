Finally cessation of breastfeedingformula feeding and complete transition to family food marks another important event in gut microbial development       characterized by an increased abundance of Bacteroidaceae Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae and a further reduction in Bifidobacterium aswell as increased alpha diversity      .WHAT DOES IT MATTER FOR CHILD HEALTHThe consistently observed increase in gut microbial alpha diversity during the time period coinciding with complementary feeding       and recent evidence showing that this increase is driven by transition from breastfeeding to family foods    raise some key questions Is the low diversity sustained by breastfeeding beneficial for infant health Does the increase in microbial diversity observed during complementary feeding characterize healthy gut microbiota developmentMany studies have linked low gut microbial diversity to diseases in adulthood as recently reviewed  .

Consequently even though gut microbial diversity increases with protein and fiber intake during the complementary feeding period there is no evidence to support that excessive intake of these macronutrients in early childhood is beneficial for child health.In summary we want to emphasize that findings regarding the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in adults cannot be extrapolated to children since the factors governing the co- development of the microbial ecosystem and the immune system in infanthood are completely different from the factors of importance for adult health.

Further we discuss potential impacts on child health and the need for further studies on this important topic.Keywords infant gut microbiota breast feeding weaning gut microbial diversity complementary diet transition SKOT cohorts family foodsWHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING AND GUT MICROBIOTA DEVELOPMENTThe differential effect of breastfeeding as compared with formula feeding or mixed feeding on the composition of the gut microbiota is well established        .

Formula intake was positively associated with diversity in the breastfed infant subset  supporting the previous observations that mixed-fed infants have higher microbial diversity than exclusively breastfed infants  .

Oppositely formula feeding was negatively associated with diversity in the infants that were no longer breastfed indicating that the substitution of formula with solid foods such as meat cheese and rye bread further increase microbial diversity .

Infant gut microbiota and the hygiene hypothesis of allergic disease impact of household pets and siblings on microbiota composition and diversity.

This perspective paper summarizes the currently very few studies addressing the effects of complementary diet on gut microbiota and highlights the recent finding that transition to family foods greatly impacts the development of gut microbial diversity.

In order to address this issue we recently combined a comprehensive analysis of the complementary diet with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the fecal microbiota in two independent Danish cohorts of infants aged 9 months participating in the previously mentioned SKOT study and demonstrated that gut microbial diversity correlated significantly with the child's progression toward family foods in both cohorts  .

Together these results suggest that effects on gut microbial composition and diversity during the complementary feeding period is not solely mediated by weaningcessation of breastfeeding but indeed affected by the introduction of new specific complementary foods with higher protein and fiber content.The development of the intestinal microbiota is affectedby a number of factors including geography lifestyle and oligosaccharide content of the breastmilk.

An important remaining challenge is to determine the optimal age for increasing intestinal microbial diversity by reduction of breastfeeding and introduction of family foods in order to optimize effects on gut microbiota immune maturation and later health outcomes.ETHICS STATEMENTThe present perspective uses data from previous publications based on the SKOT cohorts in which 311 SKOT I and 184 SKOT II Danish children were followed for the first 3 years after birth with the overall aim of investigating relationships between early diet growth development and later disease risks especially obesity and metabolic syndrome.
