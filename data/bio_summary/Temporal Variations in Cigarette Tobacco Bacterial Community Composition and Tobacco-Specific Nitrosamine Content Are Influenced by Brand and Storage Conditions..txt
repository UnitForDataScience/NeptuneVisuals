For NMB Bacillus decreased in relative abundance between day 0 and day 5 and then stayed relatively unchanged for the remainder of the study .The relative abundance of Pantoea appeared to be more affected by condition whereas changes in the relative abundance occurred in CC at pocket and room conditions  in CCM at room conditions  and in NMB at pocket and refrigerator conditions .

In addition there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of Pantoea between day 0 and day 5 at refrigerator conditions for the same brand.For CC the relative abundance of Pantoea significantly fluctuated between day 0 and day 5 day 5 and day 9 and day 9 and day 14 at pocket conditions.

To reflect normal user storage conditions cigarettes were subjected to 14 days of three different experimental storage conditions pocket 25C and 30 relative humidity refrigerator 5C and 18 relative humidity and room 20C and 50 relative humidity.

However the only significant change in Shannon indices was between day 0 and day 9 in NMB at pocket conditions in which diversity increased p  0.05 Supplementary Figure S3.Comparative Analysis of OTUs by Condition between Day 0 and Day 14Within the experimental conditions tested non-mentholated CC had the greatest amount of OTUs 19 OTUs that were significantly different in relative abundance between day 0and day 14 at refrigerator conditions .

Finally refrigerator conditions had the least number of OTUs 11 OTUs that were significantly different in relative abundance between day 0 and day 14 all of which were higher at day 14.There were only five OTUs at statistically significantly different p  0.001 relative abundances between day 0 and day 14 among the different conditions for NMB .

Room conditions had the least amount of significantly different OTUs nine OTUs between time points of which 55 five OTUs were at higher relative abundance at day 14.In contrast to its non-mentholated counterpart CCM had the greatest number of OTUs 20 OTUs that were significantly different between day 0 and day 14 at room conditions  with 70 14 OTUs at higher abundance at day 0 compared to day 14.

Room conditions had 38 OTUs at significantly different relative abundance between time points all at higher relative abundance at day 14.

The relative abundance of Bacillus was only affected by condition in NMB at pocket conditions and CKM at room conditions.

Room conditions had only one OTU significantly higher at day 14.Operational taxonomic units that are significantly different in relative abundance between day 0 and day 14 in both CC and CCM and in both CK and CKM are described in detail in the Supplementary Material in addition to a comparison of the product lots Supplementary Figures S4-S6.Analysis of TSNA ContentN-nitrosonornicotine levels were significantly higher p  0.05 at pocket conditions from day 0 to day 14 for NMB and CCM .

The second condition that produced the most OTUs with significantly different relative abundances 24 OTUs between time points was refrigerator conditions 54 of OTUs 13 OTUs at higher relative abundance at day 0.
