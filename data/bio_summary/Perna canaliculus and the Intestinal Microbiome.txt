There are three species within the Perna genus that are dispersed across the globe the P. viridis species Asian green mussel in Indo-Pacific region the P. perna brown or rock mussel species from Atlantic regions and the P. canaliculus species limited to the marine regions of New Zealand which has been sustainably farmed for commercial purposes since the early 1970s .

Current studies investigating the therapeutic efficacy of P. canaliculus have only produced low-level evidence however an indication remains that green-lipped mussels GLMs have therapeutic potential as adjunctive agents for rheumatoid arthritis RA  osteoarthritis OA  asthma  and intestinal complaints .Clinical and experimental data has shown various mussel species possess anti-oxidant anti-hypertensive anti-bacterial anti-thrombin and anti-coagulant properties derived from their proteins peptides and amino-acid constituents.Pernin remains the only bioactive protein that has been found in the cell-free hemolymph of the P. canaliculus extract.

Studies conducted recently in humans reported that the administration of a whole P. canaliculus extract may support intestinal function and potentially protect the intestinal tract when delivered in conjunction with analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications in OA patients .Approximately 70 of an extract of whole mussel P. canaliculus is protein.

It has been suggested that P. canaliculus contains active inhibitors of prostaglandins as demonstrated by an increase in the gestation period of rats following the administration of P. canaliculus extract powder .

Clinical data from OA patients treated with a P. canaliculus containing GLM extract reported significant improvement in GSRS scores supporting the hypothesis that the metabolism of P. canaliculus containing GLM compounds may generate the production of SCFA metabolites.

the study showed that Bacteroides a genus of Gram-negative obligate anaerobic bacteria as a group were increased at the end of the P. canaliculus supplementation period indicating that P. canaliculus possibly increased SCFA-producing intestinal bacteria.
