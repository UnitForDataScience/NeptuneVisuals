Prevotella was found to improve glucose metabolism in mice and in the present study elevated levels of Prevotella were observed in mice fed with G C.The present results showed that enrichment with G led to reduced body weight gain in mice.

Graphs marked with different letters a b are significantly different P  0.05.weight was lower among mice that received fiber-enriched diets than among those that received ND B.Fasting levels of glucose were lower in the CP and G mice than in the ND group C. Both fiber-enriched diets led to improved glucose tolerance as indicated by the OGTT results at 30 60 90 and 120 min but no intergroup differences in blood serum insulin levels were observed data not shown.Intestinal contents and SCFA levels as affected by various fibers after fiber fermentationIntestinal histology revealed healthy morphology and no abnormalities were detected among the various groups data not shown.Weights of intestines and intestinal contents were signifi- cantly higher in group G than in CP and ND and were higher in CP than in ND A B.Group average weights of feces were 1.20.2 2.60.2 and1.10.2 g for ND CP and G respectively.The SCFA levels in cecal contents differed among the groups.

Classification according to genus showed that the number of counts of Prevottela was greater among G mice than ND animals C.Liver response to fiber enrichmentHistologic examination did not reveal liver damage that could be attributed to fiber consumption.

C57 BL6 J mice were chosen as the model to compare a condition of normal healthy fiber con- sumption with one of very low fiber consumption.

After 3 wk on the diets the mice were fasted for 12 h and subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT.Table 1Diet compositionBHT butylated hydroxytoluene Diet composition per kg fibers were fenugreek galactomannan or citrus pectin.Before the OGTT the mice were weighed and marked and were given D- glucose 3 gkg body weight by gavage.

By week 2 and continuing into week 3 the average weight of mice consuming the fiber-enriched diets was lower than that of ND-treated mice A.

Compared with mice fed the normal diet microbiota populations were altered in both fiber groups and were found to be richer in Bacteroidetes rather than Firmicutes P  0.05.

It was found that aberrant gut microbiota composition is asso- ciated with metabolic diseases including obesity diabetes and atherosclerosis  and it is clear that the type and quantity of food components that reach the colon have an important effect on microbiota composition and activity .0899-9007c 2017 Elsevier Inc.
