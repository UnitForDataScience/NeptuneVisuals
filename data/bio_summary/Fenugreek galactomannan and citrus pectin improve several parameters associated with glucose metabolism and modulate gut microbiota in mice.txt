The aim of this study was to examine links between galactomannan and CP consumption microbiota development and glucose metabolism.Design Male C57 BL6 J mice ages 7 to 8 wk were fed ad libitum with a normal diet or one sup- plemented with 15 of either galactomannan or CP.

The JMP 7.0.2 and JMP 11 Pro software suites SAS Institute Cary NC USA were used for the analyses.ResultsBody weight epididymal adipose tissue weight and glucose toleranceEnrichment of ND with 15 ww of CP or G fiber led to reduced weight gain.

After 3 wk on the diets the mice were fasted for 12 h and subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT.Table 1Diet compositionBHT butylated hydroxytoluene Diet composition per kg fibers were fenugreek galactomannan or citrus pectin.Before the OGTT the mice were weighed and marked and were given D- glucose 3 gkg body weight by gavage.

Glucose levels were monitored at 0 30 60 and 120 min after glucose loading a glucometer was used to measure glucose levels in blood drawn from the tail tip.After 4 wk on experimental diets the mice were fasted for 12 h their body weights were recorded and they were sacrificed in random order by isoflurane overdose.

Graphs marked with different letters a b are significantly different P  0.05.weight was lower among mice that received fiber-enriched diets than among those that received ND B.Fasting levels of glucose were lower in the CP and G mice than in the ND group C. Both fiber-enriched diets led to improved glucose tolerance as indicated by the OGTT results at 30 60 90 and 120 min but no intergroup differences in blood serum insulin levels were observed data not shown.Intestinal contents and SCFA levels as affected by various fibers after fiber fermentationIntestinal histology revealed healthy morphology and no abnormalities were detected among the various groups data not shown.Weights of intestines and intestinal contents were signifi- cantly higher in group G than in CP and ND and were higher in CP than in ND A B.Group average weights of feces were 1.20.2 2.60.2 and1.10.2 g for ND CP and G respectively.The SCFA levels in cecal contents differed among the groups.

This finding is consistent with the observed increases in fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance A-C. Fenugreek previously was known to have antidiabetic activity to lower plasma cholesterol levels to in- crease antioxidant activity and to exhibit antiinflammatory properties  and in the present study CP was observed to elicit a similar but weaker effect.

It isquite possible that the soluble dietary fiber we used in this study improved the glucose tolerance test and processes involved in glucose metabolism via bile salts.

The modification was significantly greater in galactomannan-fed than in CP-fed mice P  0.0001.
