and saturated long-chain fatty acids promoted liver inflamma- tion through activation of migratory macrophages in the liverso far we have found that sthd-01-induced gut dysbiosis altered microbial metabolic activities and therefore re- sulted in an accumulation of saturated long-chain fatty acids and n-6 unsaturated fatty acids.

feeding of mice with a high-fat diet hfd leads to the development of nash in mice a recent accumulating evidence has highlighted that the gut microbiota and its metabolites play pivotal roles in the development of nash  it has been reported that feeding of a hfd induces the al- teration of gut microbial communities referred to as dysbiosis hfd-induced dysbiosis impairs the in- tegrity of the intestinal epithelium and thereby eliciting the systemic dissemination of the gut microbiota andor microbial products such as lipopolysaccharides lps the microbial stimuli activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver and liver inflam- mation elicits the development of nash in addition to the direct stimulation by microbial compo- nents metabolic alterations caused by dysbiosis are also known to cause nash development.

these changes were not observed in mice that receive abx sug- gesting that sthd-01-induced alteration of the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the development of steatohepatitis.metabolic activities of the gut microbiota were dramatically altered in the sthd-01-fed micenext we analyzed the composition of the gut microbiota in all three groups.

lipid mediators which are generated by the gut microbiotasuch as pa promote the progression of liver inflammation by activating the migrated macrophages.discussionthe gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogen- esis of nash here we comprehensively analyzed the impact of feeding of a new class of hfd sthd-01 on the gut microbiota and subsequent development of steatohepatitis.

saturated fatty acids such as pa which are accumulated upon the feeding of sthd-01 in a gut microbiota dependent manner can activate migratory macrophages in the liver.conclusionsthe gut microbiota and its lipid metabolism play a cen- tral role in the pathogenesis of nash induced by a novel steatohepatitis-inducing sthd-01.

although fatty acid metabolism is believed to be involved in the patho- genesis of nash the precise mechanisms by which high-fat diet-induced dysbiosis affects fatty acid metabol- ism in the gut and the consequent effect of this imbal- ance on liver inflammation have not been fully elucidated.a recent study has reported a new class of hfd known as steatohepatitis-inducing hfd sthd-01.

this fact indicates that the accumulation of fatty acids is not merely caused by the diet rather the generation of saturated fatty acid is enhanced by the gut microbiota.

consistent with this notion it has been re- ported that certain types of gut bacteria can saturate fatty acids -however it is still possible that other bacteria metabolites beside fatty acids are involved in the development of nash induced by sthd-01.

we found that the pathways of long-chain saturated fatty acids fatty acids longer than c14 and n-6 unsatur- ated fatty acids were constantly elevated in the sthd-01 group compared with the control group.

to address the influence of sthd-01-induced dysbiosis on the metabolic activities of the gut microbiota we ana- lyzed the gut metabolome.

depletion of the gut micro- biota by treatment of abx significantly improved the sthd-01-induced mal-metabolic profile in the gut and attenuated liver inflammation.

although saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are contained in the diet the overrepresentation of these lipid metabolism pathways was markedly normalized by the depletion of the gut microbiota.
