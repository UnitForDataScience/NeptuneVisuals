To this end 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and RNAseq transcriptome profiling were employed as proxies for microbiota composition and gut immunophysiological status in the analysis of caecal samples from control mice and mice infected with various poxvirus types.

These viruses could differentially alter gut mucosal immunity in the context of a natural immune response and hence through the joint monitoring of gut mucosal immunity and microbiota composition help increase our understanding of the immune deter- minants of microbiome composition.In this study we employed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and transcriptome profiling as proxies for microbiota composition and gut immunophysiological status respectively.

Our results show that different poxvirus species and mutants elicit different shifts in the mice mucosa-associated microbiota and in some instances significant concomitant shifts in gut transcriptome profiles thus provid- ing an initial validation to the proposed model.IntroductionThe gut microbiome is an influential factor underpinning various health challenges faced by societies today.

Our expectation was that the different viruses would elicit different shifts in both gut microbiota composition and host transcriptome patterns hence providing an initial validation to our hypothesis.Materials and methodsAll samples analyzed in this study originate from mice sacrificed as part of a larger-scale effort to understand poxvirus modulation of immune pathways.

The funders had no role in study design data collection and analysispoxvirus strains and mutants could differentially alter gut mucosal immunity in the context of a natural immune response providing a controlled natural in vivo setting to deepen our under- standing of the immune determinants of microbiome composition.

The present study represents a proof-of-concept that the use of immune-modulating poxviruses may represent a valuable tool in gut microbiome research.

have shown in mice that influenza pulmonary infection alters the gut microbiota through a mechanism dependent on type I IFN.

The analysis ordinates samples VdB18n  7.

The analysis ordinates samples n  6 based on the similarity between their trancriptome profiles.

The infection of mice with VACV and ECTV mutants deficient in immune modulatory proteins represents a unique model system to dissect immune pathways and has produced important advances in the fields of virology and immunology .
