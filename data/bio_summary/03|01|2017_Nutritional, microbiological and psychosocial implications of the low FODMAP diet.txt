Despite this fiber intake of pa- tients following low FODMAP dietary advice is not different to control patients in a majority of the evidence thus far141820 and the proportion of patients meeting the recommended fiber intake is not different compared with patients following habitual diet.20Total protein and fat intake after low FODMAP dietary advice in patients with IBS is not different to controls.14171820 In con- trast findings relating to energy intake are inconsistent.

Therefore there is a risk of dietary inadequacy in the short term as well as a risk of inadequacy in the long term if the diet continues to be significantly restricted.The effect of short term exclusion of high FODMAP foods on macronutrient intake has been investigated in four RCTs in which low FODMAP dietary advice was provided by a dietitian to pa- tients with IBS.14171820 The majority of these trials suggest that carbohydrate intake of patients following such advice is lower than controls who consume their usual diet14 or follow a diet based on traditional IBS advice.1718 This is not unexpected considering the diet is based on restriction of high carbohydrate foods.

In the former study a lower relative abundance of Bifidobacteria was reported compared with habitual diet along with a substantial reduction in total bacte- rial load of 47 and a reduction in the absolute abundance of F. prausnitzii and Clostridium Cluster IV compared with controls.27 These broader alterations in microbiota composition compared with previous trials may have been due to the very low level of FODMAP intake achieved in this study.Two trials have evaluated changes in the diversity of the micro- biota in response to FODMAP restriction using metagenomic se- quencing methods.2829 One small uncontrolled study in children with IBS revealed no change in a-diversity i.e.

A likely explanation for these findings is the inadequate inclusion of low-lactose calcium-rich alternatives in patients following a diet low in FODMAPs although it is also recognized that there is measurement error because of scarcity of nutrient composition data for specialty food products which could lead to an underestimation of calcium intake.Overall dietitian-led low FODMAP dietary advice broadly leads to appropriate nutrient intake in patients with IBS despite re- striction of many nutrient-rich food items across a number of food groups suggesting that the diet can be implemented without nutri- tional concern.

Clearly further RCTs are required to investigate the effect on microbiota diversity particularly in view of the negative associations with low diversity and gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal disease.3031The low FODMAP diet leads to marked effects on taxonomic composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota which is of potential concern.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization the first demonstrated that a re- duction in total FODMAP intake of 50 led to a 6-fold reduction in relative abundance of Bifidobacteria compared with controls who maintained FODMAP intake while following habitual diet.14 There were no differences in total bacteria or other bacterial groups such as Lactobacillus or Faecalbacterium prausnitzii which are like Bifidobacteria considered beneficial for host health.26 Since then the effect on the abundance of Bifidobacteria has been corroborated in a placebo-controlled feeding RCT27 and a dietary advice placebo-controlled RCT16 both utilizing quantita- tive polymerase chain reaction technique.

number of species or richness after 1 week29 whereas a 3-week study in adults demonstrated higher richness compared with high FODMAP con- trols.28 Differences in trial findings could be attributed to several factors including the variance in the FODMAP content of intervention and comparator diets and in sampling and analysis methodologies.

Evidence suggests that the low FODMAP diet leads to some alter- ations in nutrient intake.
