therefore there is a risk of dietary inadequacy in the short term as well as a risk of inadequacy in the long term if the diet continues to be significantly restricted.the effect of short term exclusion of high fodmap foods on macronutrient intake has been investigated in four rcts in which low fodmap dietary advice was provided by a dietitian to pa- tients with ibs.14171820 the majority of these trials suggest that carbohydrate intake of patients following such advice is lower than controls who consume their usual diet14 or follow a diet based on traditional ibs advice.1718 this is not unexpected considering the diet is based on restriction of high carbohydrate foods.

despite this fiber intake of pa- tients following low fodmap dietary advice is not different to control patients in a majority of the evidence thus far141820 and the proportion of patients meeting the recommended fiber intake is not different compared with patients following habitual diet.20total protein and fat intake after low fodmap dietary advice in patients with ibs is not different to controls.14171820 in con- trast findings relating to energy intake are inconsistent.

using fluorescence in situ hybridization the first demonstrated that a re- duction in total fodmap intake of 50 led to a 6-fold reduction in relative abundance of bifidobacteria compared with controls who maintained fodmap intake while following habitual diet.14 there were no differences in total bacteria or other bacterial groups such as lactobacillus or faecalbacterium prausnitzii which are like bifidobacteria considered beneficial for host health.26 since then the effect on the abundance of bifidobacteria has been corroborated in a placebo-controlled feeding rct27 and a dietary advice placebo-controlled rct16 both utilizing quantita- tive polymerase chain reaction technique.

in the former study a lower relative abundance of bifidobacteria was reported compared with habitual diet along with a substantial reduction in total bacte- rial load of 47 and a reduction in the absolute abundance of f. prausnitzii and clostridium cluster iv compared with controls.27 these broader alterations in microbiota composition compared with previous trials may have been due to the very low level of fodmap intake achieved in this study.two trials have evaluated changes in the diversity of the micro- biota in response to fodmap restriction using metagenomic se- quencing methods.2829 one small uncontrolled study in children with ibs revealed no change in a-diversity i.e.

number of species or richness after 1 week29 whereas a 3-week study in adults demonstrated higher richness compared with high fodmap con- trols.28 differences in trial findings could be attributed to several factors including the variance in the fodmap content of intervention and comparator diets and in sampling and analysis methodologies.

evidence suggests that the low fodmap diet leads to some alter- ations in nutrient intake.

in conclusion while robust evidence supports the clinical effectiveness of the low fodmap diet it is important considering the likelihood of its continued widespread use in ibs and other functional bowel disorders that we extend our understanding of the impact of the diet on endpoints that may have potential consequences for long term health.irritable bowel syndrome ibs is a common functional bowel dis- order characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and altered bowel habit.

more- over recent evidence suggests the key to symptom provocation in response to fodmaps in ibs is not enhanced capacity for co- lonic fermentation but the presence of visceral hypersensitivity.10 an increasing number of uncontrolled and controlled trials have examined the clinical effectiveness of a low fodmap diet inpatients with ibs using either dietary advice or feeding protocols.

uncontrolled and unblinded controlled trials suggest symptom re- sponse rates in patients with ibs are as high as 85.13 similarly a beneficial impact on symptoms has been reported in blinded ran- domized controlled trials rct.14-18 as such there is increasing implementation of the low fodmap diet in ibs and other func- tional bowel disorders.

however it is important that any potential pitfalls associated with the diet are considered and addressed.the effect of a low fodmap diet on nutrient intakea potential shortcoming of any diet that involves multiple food ex- clusion is the risk of nutritional inadequacy and this is especially pertinent if the excluded foods are nutrient-rich.

a gluten free diet for example leads to a reduction in carbohydrate fiber and iron in- take compared with that of the pre-diagnosis diet.19 the low fodmap diet requires substitution of selected foods across a number of food groups and therefore there is the potential for in- adequate intake of nutrients particularly carbohydrate fiber iron b vitamins and calcium.

interest- ingly intake of carbohydrate is not different to patients following a placebo sham exclusion diet according to a rct recently con- ducted by our group20 suggesting that it may be its exclusionary nature rather than the low fodmap diet per se that leads to a reduction in carbohydrate intake.

energy in- take has been reported to be lower17 and not different18 to controls following traditional dietary advice and not different to controls following habitual diet14 or a sham exclusion diet.20 overall this fits with evidence that the reduction in bodyweight in response to the diet is not different to controls who also follow an exclusion diet  0.3 kg vs 0.4 kg p  0.738.20 whether energy intake is able to be maintained in patients who self-restrict their diet is unknown.restriction of multiple foods across a number of food groups could lead to potential micronutrient inadequacy in patients fol- lowing low fodmap dietary advice.
