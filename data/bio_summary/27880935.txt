The main objective of our study was to explore the evolution of the microbiota community and molecules related with CRC in the dynamic transition from normal colon epithelium to premalignant adenoma with the aid of an 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model induced by DMH.

Further investigation is warranted to confirm the mechanisms underlying dysbiosis which would aid in the development of effective methods to pre-diagnose CRC.In summary by establishing the network involving microbes and cellular molecules throughout the evolutionary progression of CRC tumorigenesis in the'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse colorectal cancer model we have identified an imbalance in gut microbiota characterized by the 'driver-passenger' model involve in reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria and increase in DNA-damaging bacteria which leads to enhanced accumulation of mutations.

Two OTUs were affiliated with the species Alistipes finegoldii P  0.01 and three OTUs belonging to the genus Clostridium P  0.05 were significantly higher in the model group.

In addition existing bacteria may also enhance the susceptibility to disease such as Helicobacter pylori to gastric cancer and human papilloma virus to cervical cancer.Previous studies demonstrating an association of one or more microbial species with CRC have implied that gut microbiota may be a driver of CRC tumorigenesis and not connected with colitis 10.

Although these families exhibited low abundance variations were statistically significant.Evolutionary biologic changes and identification of key phylotypes during the process of CRC tumorigenesisAs specified previously microbiota structure and diversity were obviously changed during carcinogenesis although the specific phylotypes causing these variations and dynamic patterns of gut microbiota are yet to be identified.

Our results demonstrate that the biological evolutionary shift of gut microbiota characterized by a gradual decrease in 'driver' bacteria and an increase in DNA damage-causing bacteria is accompanied by tumor development in the CRC model.

7 proposed a bacterial driver-passenger model explaining microbiota community involvement during CRC development which may contribute to the genetic paradigm of the 'adenoma- carcinoma sequence'.

All animal experiments were approved by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at Qingdao University and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.Establishment of the 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' animal model and experimental proceduresWe modified the 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model induced by DMH.
