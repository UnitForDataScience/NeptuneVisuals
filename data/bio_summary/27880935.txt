further investigation is warranted to confirm the mechanisms underlying dysbiosis which would aid in the development of effective methods to pre-diagnose crc.in summary by establishing the network involving microbes and cellular molecules throughout the evolutionary progression of crc tumorigenesis in the'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse colorectal cancer model we have identified an imbalance in gut microbiota characterized by the 'driver-passenger' model involve in reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria and increase in dna-damaging bacteria which leads to enhanced accumulation of mutations.

representative photomicrographs showing f mucosalinflammation g hyperproliferation tissueh adenoma and i adenocarcinoma magnified 20x.gut microbiota of experimental groups than control groups with statistically significant differences 77.65 vs. 56.72 p  0.001 whereas firmicutes was markedly less abundant in the experimental groups 19.44 vs. 40.81 p  0.001. diversity changes were additionally examined.

the most abundant family was identified as porphyromonadaceae whereas the individual composition was variable accounting for 13.71-74.03. lachnospiraceae was the second most abundant family in the model groups ranging from 0.37 to 56.06. in addition porphyromonadaceae and prevotellaceae were enriched in the inflammatory group but showed a significant decrease in the hyperprolifaration and adenoma groups p  0.01. conversely lachnospiraceae was enriched in the hyperproliferation adenoma and adenocarcinoma groups p  0.01. rikenellaceae and ruminococcaceae were increased during tumorigenesis.

the synergistic actions of microbiota dysbiosis and effects of bacterial metabolites on related molecular events are proposed to contribute to the progression of crc tumorigenesis.introductioncolorectal cancer is the third most common cancer type in men and the second most common in women and reported as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1 2. the issue of whether the poor prognosis and high mortality of crc are partially attributedto pathogenesis remains unclear.

in addition existing bacteria may also enhance the susceptibility to disease such as helicobacter pylori to gastric cancer and human papilloma virus to cervical cancer.previous studies demonstrating an association of one or more microbial species with crc have implied that gut microbiota may be a driver of crc tumorigenesis and not connected with colitis 10. moreover the differences in microbial species between crc tumor and control tissues have been compared.

firmicutes showed lower abundance in the inflammatory group p  0.01 but was significantly increased in the hyperprolifarative group p  0.01. proteobacteria was the third most abundant phylum in the model groups and interestingly was also enriched in the inflammatory group p  0.01 but decreased gradually during the course of tumor developmentfigure 4a.at the family level we analyzed the microbial composition of each group.

statistically signifcant p  0.05step-by-step during tumorigenesis supporting a role as a 'passenger' bacterium.the potential roles of infection and inflammation in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer cannot be overlooked 21. the family of enterobacteriaceae also participate in the mechanism of colorectal cancer.

the main objective of our study was to explore the evolution of the microbiota community and molecules related with crc in the dynamic transition from normal colon epithelium to premalignant adenoma with the aid of an 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse crc model induced by dmh.

after filtering otus with very low reads 287 otus with 97 similarity remained figure 5. in an extract test 19 otuswere found to be significantly different between the model and control groups p  0.05. among these 12 were higher and 7 were lower in the model group.

the inflammatory group showed enrichment of bacteroidetes and porphyromonadaceae p  0.01. otus affiliated with firmicutes were enriched in the hyperproliferative group p  0.01. rikenellaceae and ruminococcaceae showed an increasing trend during the crc process while the opposite pattern was observed for prevotellaceae and enterobacteriaceae.

although these families exhibited low abundance variations were statistically significant.evolutionary biologic changes and identification of key phylotypes during the process of crc tumorigenesisas specified previously microbiota structure and diversity were obviously changed during carcinogenesis although the specific phylotypes causing these variations and dynamic patterns of gut microbiota are yet to be identified.

two otus were affiliated with the species alistipes finegoldii p  0.01 and three otus belonging to the genus clostridium p  0.05 were significantly higher in the model group.
