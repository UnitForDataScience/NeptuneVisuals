The main objective of our study was to explore the evolution of the microbiota community and molecules related with CRC in the dynamic transition from normal colon epithelium to premalignant adenoma with the aid of an 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model induced by DMH.

Further investigation is warranted to confirm the mechanisms underlying dysbiosis which would aid in the development of effective methods to pre-diagnose CRC.In summary by establishing the network involving microbes and cellular molecules throughout the evolutionary progression of CRC tumorigenesis in the'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse colorectal cancer model we have identified an imbalance in gut microbiota characterized by the 'driver-passenger' model involve in reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria and increase in DNA-damaging bacteria which leads to enhanced accumulation of mutations.

In addition existing bacteria may also enhance the susceptibility to disease such as Helicobacter pylori to gastric cancer and human papilloma virus to cervical cancer.Previous studies demonstrating an association of one or more microbial species with CRC have implied that gut microbiota may be a driver of CRC tumorigenesis and not connected with colitis 10.

Although these families exhibited low abundance variations were statistically significant.Evolutionary biologic changes and identification of key phylotypes during the process of CRC tumorigenesisAs specified previously microbiota structure and diversity were obviously changed during carcinogenesis although the specific phylotypes causing these variations and dynamic patterns of gut microbiota are yet to be identified.

Our results demonstrate that the biological evolutionary shift of gut microbiota characterized by a gradual decrease in 'driver' bacteria and an increase in DNA damage-causing bacteria is accompanied by tumor development in the CRC model.

7 proposed a bacterial driver-passenger model explaining microbiota community involvement during CRC development which may contribute to the genetic paradigm of the 'adenoma- carcinoma sequence'.

All animal experiments were approved by the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at Qingdao University and conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.Establishment of the 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' animal model and experimental proceduresWe modified the 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model induced by DMH.

The synergistic actions of microbiota dysbiosis and effects of bacterial metabolites on related molecular events are proposed to contribute to the progression of CRC tumorigenesis.INTRODUCTIONColorectal cancer is the third most common cancer type in men and the second most common in women and reported as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 1 2.

However the role played by gut microbiota in 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' CRC pathogenesis is yet to be established.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the evolutionary biologic changes of the gut microbiota in tumor progression from normal colon epithelium to premalignant adenoma and subsequently invasive adenocarcinoma with a view to establishing the potential roles of different gut microbes in the specific molecular events characterizing transition to adenocarcinoma in an 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' mouse CRC model.RESULTSProgression of the 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' in a mouse modelAccording to the experimental protocol Figure 1A no obvious macroscopic lesions were observed in colon mucosa on week 6 after the first drug injection Figure 1B but deeper staining for colon epithelial cell nucleus and atypical hyperplasia upon microscopic examination were observed Figure 1F.
