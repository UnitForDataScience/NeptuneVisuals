Similarly this bacterial group may be outcompeted in our WD group but act as a marker of health in the CD animals.When analyzing the data at the phylum level it was observed that the guinea pig fecal microbiota is dominated by Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in all diet and birth weight groups similar to other rodent reports  .

The fecal microbiota of normal birth weight NBW and LBW young guinea pig offspring weaned onto either a control diet CD or WD was determined with 16S rRNA gene next generation sequencing at young adulthood following the early rapid growth phase after weaning.

The gastrointestinal tract GIT microbiota is essential to metabolic health and the prevalence of the Western diet WD high in fat and sugar is increasing with evidence highlighting a negative interaction between the GIT and WD resulting in liver dysfunction.

2017 Impact of birth weight and postnatal diet on the gut microbiota of young adult guinea pigs.

Utilized scripts are provided in and demultiplexed reads are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive BioProject IDNotes.a NBW Normal birth weight or 90 g.b LBW Low birth weight or 85 g.c NS Not significant.d ALB Albumin.e ALP Alkaline Phosphatase.f ALT Alanine Aminotransferase.g BA Bile Acids.h BUN Blood Urea Nitrogen.i TBIL Total Bilirubin.Values are represented as mean - the standard error of the mean.

The model utilizes a combination of uterine artery ablation to induce LBW offspring with a postnatal diet high in total fat and sugar and produces a non-overweight phenotype with impaired vascular function increased visceral adiposity and liver fibrosis with fatty infiltration of the liver hallmarks of metabolic disease    .In the current study birth weight was not significantly associated with an altered GIT microbiota.

These results describe the GIT microbiota in a guinea pig model of LBW and WD associated metabolic syndrome and highlight several WD specific GIT alterations associated with human metabolic disease.How to cite this article Al et al.

It also has an important role in homeostasis and the maintenance of epithelial barriers which when degraded may contribute to inflammation leading to chronic diseases characterized by metabolic dysfunction such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and diabetes  .Due to the divergent nutritional requirements of various bacteria residing in the gut diet has been shown to shape the composition of the microbiota which in turn may lead to adverse health outcomes such as metabolic syndrome  .

At 15 days of age the offspring were weaned separated by sex weighed housed in individual cages and randomized to either CD or a Western diet WD WD 110239 Harlan Laboratoriesas described previously .
