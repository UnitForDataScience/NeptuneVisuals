Although we cannot decisively differentiate between the effect of depth and the effects of the holobiont itself there is evidence that the holobiont Symbiodinium andor coral host modulates the prokaryotic community associ- ated with the coral tissue Ainsworth et al.

Prokaryotes including bacteria and archaea are of particular interest due to their diverse metabolic and functional capabilities within the coral holobiont and their potential to complement the metabolic needs of the coral host Ainsworth et al.

their exact function and metabolic potential remain elusive and require further investigation.The observed spatial dynamics in prokaryotic com- munity composition over depth for these three studied coral species closely resemble those reported earlier for their dominant Symbiodinium communities as determined within the detection limits of ITS2-DGGE by Bongaerts et al.

The homogeneity of multivariate dispersions was tested using a resemblance-based permu- tation test PERMDISP.Indicator values IndVal analysis De Ca'ceres and Legendre  was applied to identify prokaryotic fami- lies significantly associated p  0.05 when both speci- ficity and fidelity have probabilities 0.5 with coral host species and depth zones.Results and discussionProkaryotic communities associated with the tissue of the corals were structured according to coral species and depth permutation test CCA p  0.001 and p  0.01 respec- tively Electronic Supplementary Material ESM Table S1.

The depth distribution range of coral species seemed to affect the overall variability of the prokaryotic community associated with coral tissue.

Here we provide a first detailed assessment of the prokaryotic community associated with scleractinian corals over a depth gradient to the lower mesophotic realm 15-85 m. Speci- mens of three Caribbean coral species exhibiting differences in their depth distribution ranges Agaricia grahamae Madracis pharensis and Stephanocoenia intersepta were collected with a manned submersible on the island of Cur- acao and their prokaryotic communities assessed using 16SrRNA gene sequencing analysis.

There were no significant differences in alpha diversity richness or evenness of the prokaryotic communities based on prokaryotic families among the three studied coral species or in response to depth within each species ESM Tables S3 S4 S5.

likely included a large portion of coral surface mucus whose associated prokaryotic communities are more exposed to the ambient reef environment and therefore more likely to vary spatially.452Coral Reefs 2017 36447-452This study provides the first detailed assessment of the prokaryotic community associated with multiple sclerac- tinian corals toward the lower mesophotic reef.

MCEs can be further divided into the ''upper mesophotic'' 30-60 m and ''lower mesophotic'' 60 m with the first representing a transition zone between shallow-water and lower mesophotic communities sharing species of oppos- ing depth zones and the latter representing a more spe- cialized coral community Bongaerts et al.
