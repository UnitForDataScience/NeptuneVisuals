therefore the significant contribution of gut microbiota to thevariation of blood lipid profile and bmi provides strong evidence for the potential of an approach that alters the gut microbiota to prevent cvds.gut microbiota in diabetescurrent knowledge has supported the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of two main types of diabetes mellitus .

obviously the gut microbiota is the host in energy metabolism.gut microbiota affects lipid metabolismbesides the ability of energy harvesting gut microbiota improves the efficacy of the energy absorption process through promoting the healthy development of intestinal epithelium which is responsible for nutrient uptake in the gut .

obviously dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes.gut microbiota and hypertensionemerging evidence demonstrated that gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of hypertension one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases in both animal and human clinical studies .

therefore restoring the homeostasis of gut microbiota could be a potential strategy for treating hypertension and reducing cardiovascular risks.gut microbiota and psychiatric problemsin general accumulating evidence has shown that dietary habits profoundly influence the gut microbiota thereby affecting host metabolism and even disease risks .

considering the associations of gut microbiota which are the companions for humans from birth to human metabolism - it is reasonable to think that gut microbiota can be an emerging medication for mets and its related diseases.

in addition this study will contribute to our understanding of how gut microbiota modulates human metabolisms exploring the possibility of developing gut microbiota as pharmabiotics in a completely new medication option for treating mets and its related diseases.current approachmetabolic syndrome is a complicated cluster of correlated physiological biochemical clinical and metabolic factors that directly increases the risks of cvds and diabetes .

due to the remarkable increase in both the prevalence and severity as well as the limitations of current pharmaceutical drugs for treating and preventing mets and its related diseases the prediction of safe systemic therapy for mets is extremely urgent.gut microbiota affects mets and its related diseasesthe human intestine harbors a complex of microbial species collectively known as gut microbiota that plays essential roles in physiology development and diseases of the host .

the remarkable increase in the prevalence and severity of mets throughout the world recently is stimulating efforts to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and their host metabolism which mainly relates to the mets epidemic .figure 1. gut microbiota affects mets and its related diseases.

tmao trimethylamine n-oxide.gut microbiota in obesitynumerous studies have deciphered the influences of gut microbiota on host metabolic processes by increasing energy savings from the diet or alternating host metabolic pathways due to microbiota-derived metabolites .

considered as a typical function of gut microbiota fermentation indigestible carbohydrates and plant polysaccharides occur mainly in the large intestine and thus approximately 10-30 of the total energy intake would not be eliminated depending on this extraction process of gut microbiota .

colonization of germ-free gf mice with gut microbiota from obese ones led to a higher increase of adiposity than colonization with gut microbiota from the lean ones .

because the process of t1d usually begins very early in life also known as a critical window time to establish and complete the human gut microbial community therefore the role of microbiota could be emphasized in preventing the initiation and progression of the t1d process by establishing a healthy gut microbiota after birth .

current knowledge suggests that there is a bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host brain  thus the influences of gut microbiota on the metabolic-related diseases via the gut-brain axis have become more important because one of the increasing risk factors that contributes to mets epidemic is psychiatric issues such as stress depression schizophrenia or bipolar disorder .

a recent study of the human microbiome project consortium about the structure functions and diversity of the human microbiome also suggested that a healthy gut microbiota is variable among individuals while the metabolic pathways are evenly distributed and prevalent across all healthy individuals which means the fluctuation of the core microbiota for metabolism mainly contributes to determining the phenotypes of human .

therefore considering the strong associations between gut microbiota and the development and pathogenesis of mets we propose that developing the core of gut microbiota as pharmabiotics as a completely new medication options that may be easily applied to the community could be a potential prevention or treatment of metabolic diseases and thus contribute to controlling the worldwide mets epidemic.acknowledgments this work was supported by a grant from the next-generation biogreen 21 program rural development administration no.
