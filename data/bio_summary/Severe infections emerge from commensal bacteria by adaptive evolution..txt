So while adaptation in pathogenesis genes appears specifically infection-associated other signals of adapta- tion in severely infected patients are driven by selection pressures which might compensate for an altered within-host environment during infection that are as likely to favor mutants in nose-coloniz- ing bacteria as infecting bacteria.Signals of adaptation are specific to infected patients and differ from prevailing signatures of selectionTwo lines of evidence show that the newly discovered signatures of within-host adaptive evolution both in infecting and nose-colonizing bacteria are unique to evolution in infected patients.

In 995 patients with extremely closely related nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria another unrelated ST was also present in the nose six patients or the infection site three patients we excluded these unrelated bacteria from further analysis.

Taken together these lines of evidence show that the ontologies pathways and genes significantly differentiated between nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria arise in response to selection pressures specifically associated with infected patients and are not repeated in asymptomatic carriers or species-level evolution.DiscussionWe found that common life-threatening infections of S. aureus are frequently descended from com- mensal bacteria colonizing the nose.

Our results reveal that adaptive evolution of genes involved in regu- lation toxin production abscess formation cell-cell communication and bacterial-host interaction drives parallel differentiation between commensal constituents of the nose and infecting bacteria providing new insights into the evolution of infection in a major pathogen.ResultsInfecting bacteria are typically descended from the patient's commensal bacteriaWe identified 105 patients suffering severe S. aureus infections admitted to hospitals in Oxford and Brighton England for whom we could recover contemporaneous nose swabs from admission screening.

Conversely in 1049 patients bacteria colonizing the nose were likely descended from blood or deep tissue infections 20 of patients with related strains or 18 of all patients e.g.

We found significant depletions of protein-altering variants in carriers relative to patients in the rsp agr and sarA regulons p10-4.0 and the pathogenesis ontology p10-3.2 .Nor were the relative rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution dNdS higher between unrelated S. aureus Reference Panel IV in the genes that contributed most to the signals associated with adaptation within patients agrA agrC clfA clfB fnbA and sasA.

The nose population was likely ancestral in 3949 80 of patients with related strains or 72 of all patients because all infecting bacteria shared de novo mutations in common that distinguished them from the MRCA whereas nose-colonizing bacteria did not.

For each expression pathway we tested for an enrichment in genes that were up- or down-regulated compared to genes not differentially regulated.The most significant enrichment for protein-altering B-class variants between nose and infection sites occurred in the group of genes down-regulated by the cationic antimicrobial peptide CAMP ovispirin-1 p10-7.8 with a similar enrichment in genes down-regulated by temporin L exposure p10-6.9 .

As expected  most patients possessed extremely closely related nose-colonizing and infecting bacteria sharing the same ST and differing by 0-66 variants 95 patients.
