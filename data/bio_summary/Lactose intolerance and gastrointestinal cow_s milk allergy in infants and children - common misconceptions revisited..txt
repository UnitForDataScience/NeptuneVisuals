maximum lactase expression in enterocytes occurs dur- ing the first months of life and declines after weaning in individuals with lnp lactase levels gradually fall to about 10-25 compared to those of young infants due to a decrease in mrna several single nucleotide polymorphisms snp have been identified in the promoter region of the lactase gene the most common polymorphism associated with lac- tase persistence in caucasians is characterized by a c  t change at 13910 base pairs upstream of the lactase gene.

there are four main clinical types of li developmental lactase defi- ciency congenital lactase deficiency alactasia lactase non-persistence lnp and secondary lactose intolerance table developmental lactase deficiencylactase is the last small intestinal disaccharidase to de- velop during intrauterine development.

in a case series of 98 indonesian adolescents with li abdominal pain was the main complaint 64.1 followed by ab- dominal distension 22.6 nausea 15.1 flatulencetable 1 clinical classification of lactose intolerancedevelopmental lactase deficiencycongenital lactase deficiency alactasialactase non-persistence hypolactasiaobserved in premature infants less than 34 weeks of gestation due to temporary lactase deficiency which improves with time.

malabsorbed lactose is also converted to lactic acid by enteric bacteria streptococcus lactis and others lactaselactase-phlorizin hydrolase commonly called lactase splits lactose into d-glucose and d-galactose  lactase is a member of the beta-galactosidase family and is only expressed by mature enterocytes with its highest expression in the mid-jejunum .

a cochrane review examining the role of enteral lactase supplementation on anthropomet- ric measurements and gastrointestinal symptoms in pre- mature infants found no major clinical benefits .congenital lactase deficiency alactasiaalactasia is a rare and severe autosomal recessive dis- order of the newborn infant the condition mainly occurs in finland and western russia .

while the declince in lactase levels starts soon after weaning symptoms generally do not manifest before 5 years of age in an indonesian study the prevalence of symptomatic hypolactasia at 3 years of age was 9.1. the prevalence rose to 28.6 at 5 years and 73 at 12-14 years of age secondary lactose intolerancesecondary li occurs as a result of small intestinal villous damage and decreased lactase expression.

however older children and adults may tolerate small amounts of dietary lactose depending on the disease severity.lactase supplementationin children and adults with li oral lactase supplements have been shown to ameliorate the severity of gastro- intestinal symptoms after a lactose challenge ingested lactase is easily broken down by gastric acid and inactivated.

lactose requires hydrolysis by the enzyme lactase into d-glucose and d-galactose before it can be absorbed.

about 70 of the world's population suffer from li due to a genetically programmed gradual decline in lactase expression after weaning so-called lac- tase non-persistence lnp  the introduction of dairy farming and regular consumption of cow's milk over 5000 years ago selected individuals who tolerated lactose-containing foods beyond early childhood population genomics suggest that the ability to digest lactose beyond infancy i.e.

the enzyme spans the apical membrane of mature enterocytes and is made up of two identical extracellular 160 kda polypeptide chains as well as a short intracytoplasmic part pathophysiology of lactose malabsorption individuals with li absorb between 42 and 77 of ingested lactose after a 12.5 g dose compared to 95 in lactase persisters the clinical manifestations of li are due to osmotic fluid shifts into the gut as well as gas formation and bowel distension.

non-ige-mediated cma be considered .genetics and epidemiology of lactose intolerance the lactase gene is located on the long arm of chromo- some 2 region 2q21 its expression is regulated by a promoter region located upstream from the gene.

several other polymorphisms for lactose persistence have been identified with specific regional differences - while the cc13910 genotype is associated with lactose mal- absorption the genotypes ct and tt are found in indi- viduals with lactase persistence heterozygotes carrying the ct allele differ in their response to an oral lactose load compared to cc and tt genotypes suggesting an inter- mediate phenotype 2.lactase persistence is common in people of northern european west african or middle eastern background.
