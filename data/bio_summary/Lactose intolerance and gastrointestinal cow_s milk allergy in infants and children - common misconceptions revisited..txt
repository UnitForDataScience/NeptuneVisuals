lactase persistence emerged Correspondence 1Murdoch Childrens Research Institute Melbourne AustraliaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlearound the time of the Eurasian Bronze Age 3000-1000 B.C  While regular ingestion of milk and fermented milk products is likely to have improved individuals' nu- tritional status it remains unclear if other clinical bene- fits have promoted the genetic selection of lactase persistence LI presents with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain flatulence and diar- rhea.

Human milk con- tains about 7.5 g100 mL of lactose compared to about 5 g100 mL in cow's milk and other mammalian milk A term infant is typically able to digest about 60- 70 g of lactose per day equivalent to one liter of breast milk.

Maximum lactase expression in enterocytes occurs dur- ing the first months of life and declines after weaning In individuals with LNP lactase levels gradually fall to about 10-25 compared to those of young infants due to a decrease in mRNA Several single nucleotide polymorphisms SNP have been identified in the promoter region of the lactase gene The most common polymorphism associated with lac- tase persistence in Caucasians is characterized by a C  T change at 13910 base pairs upstream of the lactase gene.

There are four main clinical types of LI developmental lactase defi- ciency congenital lactase deficiency alactasia lactase non-persistence LNP and secondary lactose intolerance Table Developmental lactase deficiencyLactase is the last small intestinal disaccharidase to de- velop during intrauterine development.

Lactose may be tolerated later in the treatment course after intestinal mucosal repair has been achieved on a cow's milk protein-free dietNutritional adequacy of lactose-free dietsOver the past decade there has been a sharp decline in the consumption of fresh cow's milk and increased consump- tion of lactose-free milk and cereal milks in the community Parents may restrict milk products in their children due to unfounded concerns about LI or CMA.

A study of Swedish children and adolescents assessed the likelihood of milk avoidance according to genetic lactase persister status While LI in adolescents did not affect vitamin D levels or anthropometric variables it was associated with reduced milk and calcium intakes compared to those who tolerated lactose OR 3.2 95 CI 1.5 7.3 The main adverse health effects of LI occur as a result of milk avoidance and reduced calcium intakes.

Lactose in breast milk is thought to increase the absorption of calcium As young infants do not absorb all of the lactose from breast milk malabsorbed lactose acts as a prebiotic This is associated with increased counts of Bifido- bacteria and increased concentrations of SCFA which confer a protective effect on colonic mucosal integrity and have a beneficial effect on early immune develop- ment Definitions and classificationsIt is important to distinguish between the terms lactase deficiency lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerancewhich are often used interchangeably.

In premature in- fants 26-34 weeks' gestation lactase activity reaches about 30 of that of term infants maturational delay When commencing breast milk or formula prema- ture infants may develop clinical signs of lactose malab- sorption when exposed to breast milk or formula which are usually transient.

In a case series of 98 Indonesian adolescents with LI abdominal pain was the main complaint 64.1 followed by ab- dominal distension 22.6 nausea 15.1 flatulenceTable 1 Clinical classification of lactose intoleranceDevelopmental lactase deficiencyCongenital lactase deficiency alactasiaLactase non-persistence hypolactasiaObserved in premature infants less than 34 weeks of gestation due to temporary lactase deficiency which improves with time.
