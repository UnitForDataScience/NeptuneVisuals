7440-22-4 from Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO AgNP spherical particles with a particle size 35 nm specific surface area of 30-50 m2g and purity of 99.5 based on trace metal analysis NM- 0023-HP-0010 IoLiTec Ionic Liquids Technologies GmbH Germany and AgNP spherical particles with a particle size 50-60 nm specific surface area of 12 m2g and purity of 99.9 based on trace metal analysis NM-0038-HP-0010 IoLiTec Ionic Liquids Technologies GmbH Germany.The stock suspensions of each AgNPs size 35 nm 50-60 nm and  100 nm was prepared according to .

We assessed the impacts of AgNPs with different size and surface coating 100 nm PVP polyvinylpyrrolidone-dispersant 50- 60 nm and 35 nm uncoated on freshwater decomposers of leaf litter by exposing leaf associated microbial assemblages to increasing concentrations of AgNPs up to 200 mg L-1 and of AgNO3 up to 25 mg L-1.

To that end microbial communities associated with leaf litter were exposed for 28 days to 4 concentrations of AgNPs with 3 different sizes 100 nm PVP polyvinylpyrrolidone-dispersant 50-60 nm and 35 nm uncoated.

Stream water samples were collected and transported 4 degC to the laboratory and analyzed HACH DR2000 spectrophotometer Loveland CO to determine thesupplemented with increasing concentrations of AgNPs of different sizes 35 nm 50-60 nm and 100 nm or ionic metal as follows 25 50 100 and 200 mg L-1 of AgNPs and 2 5 15 and 25 mg L-1 of AgNO3 AgNO3  99 Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO.

At the end of the incubation glycine buffer pH 10.4 was added 11 volvol and the fluorescence was measured at 455 nmTable 1AgNP particle diameter measured by dynamic light scattering DLS on coated 100 nm PVP and uncoated 35 nm and 50 nm AgNP stock suspensions 1000 mg L-1 and on the medium freshly prepared and after 28 days of exposure.

Graph Pad Prism 5 program GraphPad software Inc. San Diego CA was used for all statistical tests described above.ResultsNanoparticle characterizationThe average particle diameter of nanoparticles with initial size of 100 50-60 nm and 35 nm sizes were 158 - 4 240 - 5 and 243 - 34 nm respectively for the stock suspensions with a concentration of 1000 mg L-1 .

Nanoparticle size tended to increase with the exposure time in microcosms with 100 nm AgNP and to decrease in microcosms with 50-60 nm and 35 nm AgNP sizes.

Leaf mass loss was affected by AgNP concentration and size aTable 2Total silver concentration in oak leaves and in the medium in microcosms supplemented or not with coated 100 nm PVP and uncoated 35 nm and 50 nm AgNPs 25 and 200 mg L-1 and AgNO3 2 and 25 mg L-1 kept at 16 degC for 28 days.
