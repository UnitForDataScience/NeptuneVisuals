Microbiome 2017 5148DOI 10.1186s40168-017-0368-1Identifying predictive features of Clostridium difficile infection recurrence before during and after primary antibiotic treatmentSepideh Pakpour123 Amit Bhanvadia46 Roger Zhu56 Abhimanyu Amarnani6 Sean M. Gibbons123 Thomas Gurry123 Eric J. Alm123 and Laura A. Martello6BackgroundClostridium difficile infection CDI is an urgent public health priority worldwide -and despite progress in in- fection control and innovative options for treatment of CDI until recently there has been a steady and considerable ele- vation in its incidence as well as its reported severity of ill- ness - Known factors associated with CDI include hospitalization advanced age antibiotic prescription and gastrointestinal surgery in addition to those less agreed upon such as proton pump inhibitor therapy -.Standard management of CDI involves the administration of antibiotic therapy such as metronidazole and vanco- mycin  but 22.4 and 14.2 of patients have been ob- served to have no response to metronidazole and vancomycin respectively 6.

We hypothesize that patients who did not show recurrence were able to recover towards an invasion-resistant community configuration  com- pared to patients who showed infection recurrence but the exact configuration of this invasion-resistant state re- mains unclear.

The discriminatory power of OTUs genera and families were calculated as the area under the ROC curve AUC in each case.ResultsThis longitudinal study enrolled 31 patients experiencing their first episode of Clostridium difficile infection CDI seven of whom met the criteria of severe or com- plicated disease UPMC score  2  The patient population was mostly of Afro-Caribbean descent and 54.8 of them were taking proton pump inhibitors Additional file 16S rRNA gene analyses at the pre- treatment level revealed random clustering of moder- ately infected patients with both healthy individuals and those with severe disease Fig.

Microbial relationships be- tween disease severity index infection recurrence and other collected metadata were evaluated by Spearman correlation with a false discovery rate FDR correction.Overall microbial community diversity a-diversity was measured using the Shannon entropy Significant difference in a-diversity between groups pa- tients with and without recurrence was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Gut microbiome predictors of treatment response and recurrence in primary Clostridium difficile infection.

age sex BMI pre-CDI antibiotic therapy PPI as determined by FDR-corrected Spearman correlations.Our results surprisingly showed larger difference be- tween patients with and without recurrence before treatment compared to after treatment.

Participants were followed at regular intervals beginning at the time of diagnosis before the administration of antibiotics treatment pre-treatment n  31 2 days after the start of antibiotics treatment post-treatment n  31 7 days after the start of antibiotics treatment or at the time of discharge whichever was earlier pre-discharge n  18 followed by the fourth stool samples collected 2 weeks after the start of antibiotics 4 days after treatment completion post-discharge n  9.

Microbiome data distinguish patients with Clostridium difficile infection and non-C. difficile-associated diarrhea from healthy controls.

Spe- cific questions included 1 are there any associations between severity of CDI microbial or demographic fea- tures and CDI recurrence and 2 can we use microbial or demographic features at the time of diagnosis or after treatment to predict CDI recurrence The meta-analysis was done between our dataset and a recently published dataset with similar sample collection DNA extraction primer selection and sequencing methods.
