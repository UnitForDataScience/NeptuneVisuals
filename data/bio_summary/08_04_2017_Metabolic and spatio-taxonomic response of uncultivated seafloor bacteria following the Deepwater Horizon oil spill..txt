although rrna is not necessarily a good indicator of microbial growth we found rrna gene and rrna relative abundances were generally well correlated for prokaryotes but not eukaryotes particularly for bacteria enriched near the wellhead and for a distally abundant otu belonging to the marine group i archaea otu-15 2. these data along with mrna expression profiles supplementary dataset s1 imply spill-responsive bacterial communities were still viable and active 75 days after well closure.well-conserved bacterial co-occurrences across the seafloor comprising both related groups and diverse bacteriabacterial genome bins were highly and exponen- tially enriched near mc252 supplementary figure s5 supplementary table s3 the average genome read-coverage was only 0.7-6.2 x across widespread sites 10-60 km away but was 7.3-42.6 x among sites within 2.7 km of mc252 1 supplementary figure s6.

related cycloclasticus species and porticoccus hydrocarbonoclasticus cell- vibrionales are known for their ability to degrade various pahs 8 2. all three candidate pah degraders had broadly equivalent spatial abundances supplementary figure s6 and each genome has 17-24 subunits large and small of diverse ring- hydroxylating dioxygenases that except for 2 closely resemble dioxygenases used for the oxidation of pahs and other aromatic hydrocarbons  and supplementary dataset s1 6. as previously observed in cycloclasticus genomes 2 3 each of our three dwh genomes had a greater proportion of large versus small pah dioxygenase subunits 58-63 were large in genomes and 64 in the unbinned fraction.pah dioxygenase sequences from the gsc9 gsc22 and gsc15 genomes chiefly resembled naphthalene dioxygenases 23 large and 17 small subunits--the most abundant pah present in the sediments --whereas the remainder 20 large and 11 small subunits were more closely related to biphenylbenzene anthranilateortho- halobenzoate or pyrene dioxygenases supplementary figure s12 and supplementary table s8.

most sequences 66 or 119 mbp were classified into51 bins comprising 57 genomes supplementary table s2 supplementary dataset s1 associated with the gammaproteobacteria  alphapro- teobacteria deltaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes supplementary table s2.

distal-most sites were either un- impacted or minimally impacted based on greatly diminishing plume hydrocarbon concentrations beyond  30 km  and oil-proxy sediment hopane concentrations beyond 40 km from the wellhead  results provide insights into the genomic potential and in situ transcriptional activity of dozens of spill-responsive bacteria including 420 candidate hydrocarbon degraders.materials and methodssampling and nucleic acid sequencingthirteen seafloor sediment cores were collected between 28 september and 19 october 2010 at radially distributed locations around the capped mc252 wellhead x7 cores between 0.3 and 2.7 km from mc252 and along a distal southwesterly linear transect x6 cores between 10.1 and 59.5 km from mc252 supplementary figure s1 and supplementary table s1 .

correlations between genome bin relatedness and common and phylogen- etically diverse alkb alkane degradation genes supplementary figure s11 suggest dwh bacteria acquired these genes vertically rather than by recent lateral gene transfer and hence also that the spill- enriched bacteria were indigenous deep-sea hydro- carbon degraders.we observed the expression of 21 genes involved in the aerobic degradation of the three hydrocarbon classes across multiple seafloor sites and some at all sites.

prevalent phylogenetic clustering suggests strong habitat selection for traits shared among genetically similar organisms  gammaproteobacterial clusters included gen- omes related to sulfur-oxidizing candidatus halo- beggiatoa  and tohydrocarbonoclastic colwellia cycloclasticus and porticoccus cellvibrionales species 1 supplementary table s7 supplementary figure s8.

when compared with culti- vated representatives emirge-reconstructed 16s rrna gene sequences related to cycloclasticus and porticoccus formed distinct dwh seafloor clades whereas extremely diverse sequences were asso- ciated with the colwellia-thalassomonas-glaciecola group supplementary figure s9.organisms within phylogenetic clusters shared common metabolic pathways for example sulfur oxidation or reduction alkane degradation via alkbtg and denitrification supplementary table s8 and 4. however with the exception of sulfur metabolism metabolic traits observed were not unique to clusters and we found no evidence for niche differentiation amongst clusters based on unique functions.

most hcd genes belonged to aerobic pathways supplementary table s8 and were observed almost exclusively within genomes in additive combinations targeting one or all three of the following hydrocarbon classes 1 n-alkanes 2 n-alkanesaromatics or3 n-alkanesaromaticspahs  and supplementary figure s5.

collectively the transmembrane 1-alkane monooxygenase alkb - alkgt rubredoxin rubredoxin reductase and cyp153  - ferredoxin ferredoxin reductase hydroxylase genes are present in 11 out of 14 key gammaproteobacterial genome bins depicted in bin groups 1-4. although the alk genes were the most widespread and were also found in other phyla supplementary table s8 cyp153 genes were more commonly expressed 5. pathway analysis of key gammaproteo- bacterial bins with these genes for alkane degrada- tion suggests 1-alcohol generated by alkane oxidation could be converted sequentially to alde- hydes by alcohol dehydrogenase ec 1.1.1.1 car- boxylates by aldehyde dehydrogenase nad ec 1.2.1.3 and acetyl-coa via beta oxidation and supplementary figure s10.genes resembling particulate and soluble methane or ammonia monooxygenases were also common and provide an alternative method for alkane metabolism by group 2 populations in 4. we recovered a diverse group of six genomes with particulate methane monooxygenase-like genes ca.

however all have the genetic capacity to convert 1-alcohols generated from n-alkane oxidation to acetyl-coa and supplementary figure s10 and some bins expressed pmo or mmo genes alongside genes in downstream alkane degra- dation pathways 3 supplementary dataset s1.

distance along the x axis is not shown to scale.eukaryotic ssu rrna gene sequences demonstrated that bacteria near mc252 increased appreciably relative to archaea and eukaryotes supplementary figure s4.

meanwhile distal sediments appeared to be primarily dominated by aerobic processes 3 with a large number of bacteria engaged in aerobic oxidative phosphorylation 3 supplementary dataset s1.

although both distal versus near- well upregulating sets of bacteria were active across large distances and all at proximal sites the distal set appeared to be more active at 10 and 15 km distances 5 where total petroleum hydro- carbon and n-alkane concentrations were generally lower m supplementary figure s5.abundant mechanisms for pah and aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation among a small group of unrelated bacteriatotal pah concentrations particularly naphthale- ne4fluorene4phenanthrene4chrysenes remained high in sediments surrounding mc252 in the months following the spill  b although they were no longer in excess of the epa benchmark in the water column 0. we identified 3 candidate pah degraders bin group4  ca.
