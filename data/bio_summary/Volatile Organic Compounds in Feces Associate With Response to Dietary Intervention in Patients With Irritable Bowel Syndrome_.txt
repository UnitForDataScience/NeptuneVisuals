the morbidity associated with ibs places a huge financial burden on both the healthcare system and workplace and significantly impairs patients' quality of life.the pathogenesis of ibs is multifactorial although the gut microbiota is thought to play a pivotal role.some patients with ibs have intestinal dysbiosis characterized by a loss of microbial diversity especially in those with diarrhea-predominant ibs ibs-d.moreover gutaauthors share co-first authorship.abbreviations used in this paper fodmaps fermentable oligosaccha- rides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyols gc-ms gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ibs irritable bowel syndrome ibs-d diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ibs-m mixed subtype irritable bowel syndrome ibs-sss irritable bowel syndrome symptom scoring system ibs-u unsubtyped irritable bowel syndrome lfd low-fodmap diet pca principal component analysis pls partial least squares voc volatile organic compound.most current articlec 2018 by the aga institute 1542-356536.00microbiota transplants from patients have been shown to induce an ibs-like disorder in mice.the gut microbiota has also been used to predict ibs severity.nonetheless the microbiota is currently an unrealistic diagnostic target or predictor of treatment outcome in practice because of the costs of its measurement.evidence suggests that microbial function as opposed to composition may better predict clinical outcome.this is supported by research demonstrating that the fecal metabolome provides useful insight into ibs patho- physiology.

at baseline voc profiles contained 15 features that classified response to the low-fodmap diet with a mean accuracy of 97 95 ci 96-99 and 10 features that classified response to probiotic with a mean accuracy of 89 95 ci 86-92. end of treatment models achieved similar predictive powers and accuracies.conclusionfecal voc profiling is a low cost non-invasive tool that might be used to predict responses of patients with ibs to low-fodmap diet and probiotics and identify their mechanisms of action.

more patients responded to the low-fodmap diet 3746 80 than the sham diet 2147 45 p  .001 but there was no difference in response between patients given the probiotic 3149 63 vs the placebo 2744 61 p  .850 with no interaction between the diet and supplement interventions.

furthermore it is common in the clinical setting for patients to follow multiple interventions eg lfd and probiotics therefore the fact that voc profile could predict response to one intervention despite some patients also receiving an additional intervention is testament to the potential clinical utility.in summary this exploratory study suggests that fecal voc profiling is a promising noninvasive tool that may not only help predict response to dietary interventions but also opens up a new opportunity to better understand the pathophysiology of ibs and mechanisms underpinning therapeutic response.

however the same lfd baseline pls model showed low accuracy when classifying baseline samples from the patients in the control group shamplacebo  indicating that the model was specific to response to the lfdprobiotic rather than merely response per se.similarly the pls model on baseline samples from the probiotic group predicted response to probiotic with median accuracy of 89 median sensitivity of 100table 1. baseline characteristics of participants by treatment arm and by treatment responselow fodmapdiet thlow fodmapdiet thsham thsham thnon-probioticnon-note.

in addition a reduction from baseline of 50 points on the ibs-sss is widely accepted as a minimally clinically important difference to define patients as responders.patients with a change of50 on the ibs-sss were defined as non-responders.references-.-.-.-.fi-.supplementary table 1. accuracy sensitivity and specificity of end-of-treatment low fodmap diet model and end-of-treatment probiotic model in allocating responders and non-responders to low fodmap diet or probiotic intervention or shamplaceboaccuracy sensitivity specificity end-of-treatmentmodelresponders non-responders median meancimedian meancimedian meancilow fodmapdiet n 14 393091009693-9810010099-1001008270-92probiotic n 14 442916899188-941009288-961009084-96note.

once the normal diet has been replaced by a lfd there is less substrate for bacterial metabolism consequently gas production and the associated symptoms are reduced.on the basis of this hypothesis only people with the saccharolytic-rich ibs-associated dysbiosis eating a high fodmap diet may exhibit the specific voc pattern predictive of response.similarly with the probiotic intervention only patients whose symptoms are triggered by ibs-associated dysbio- sis in theory may respond to the probiotic intervention.

this validates the potential for voc as a diagnostic biomarker for ibs and supports the contention that ibs is associated with abnormal microbial metabolism.there is currently no universal treatment for ibs.

this study measured voc in baseline fecal samples and through building separate models using key features of voc profiles it could correctly predict response to the lfd in 100 and to probiotic in 89 of patients.

therefore this exploratory study aimed to investigate whether a noninvasive diagnostic model using fecal voc could be used to identify features associated with response to dietary intervention in ibs.materials and methodsour hypothesis was that specific voc signatures at baseline would be able to predict response to lfd and probiotic interventions further the voc signatures at follow-up would differ between responders and non- responders.
