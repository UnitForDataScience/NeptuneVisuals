In terms of soilborne disease control such actualities are evidenced in the form of disease-suppressive soils which commonly are dependent upon the activity of the resident soil microbial community WDisease suppression may operate through competitive interactions among broad elements of the soil microbiome to diminish overall pathogen activity com- monly referred to as general suppression Alternatively the suppressive activity may be operative in a more defined manner toward a specific pathogen and involving the action of a distinct subset of the soil microbiome Given the apparent existence of common attributes for suppressive systems for a given pathogen W management of the microbiological resources endemic to a soil may be a means to more effectively yield biological disease control.

The inoculativeinundative model of microbial introductions has been the most commonly employed in the field of biological disease control following on the paradigm utilized in the field of entomology vHowever the inherent biological complexity of soil systems has served as a challenge to the success of biological soilborne disease control a feature that in general is not limiting to a similar degree in the domain of phyllosphere microbiology.

Mating the desired microbial agent for introduction with the appropriate perturbation event will be instrumental in determining the capacity of this approach to achieve enhanced establishment of biological control strains in the soil environment.Soil solarization is a well-studied method for use in the control of soilborne plant diseases with efficacy resulting in part due to thermal inactivation of the pathogen Elevated soil temperatures achieved during solarization afford an alterna- tive disturbance that may be exploited to extend persistence of introduced biological control agents into crop soil systems.

A combination of horticultural ecological and computational approaches need to be employed to address the above challenges and promote the development of robust approaches for the educated design of specific strategies in manipulation of the soil microbiome for soilborne disease control.OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE ASSEMBLY OF SUPPRESSIVE MICROBIOMESuccess of a substrate-based treatment to stimulate a microbiome- mediated disease control strategy will be determined by the introduction of accessible metabolites that are beneficial to organisms functional in disease control or deleterious to organisms contributing to disease progression.

Significant transformation of the rhizosphere microbiome occurred at lower seed meal rates for G.210 rootstock than MM.106 rootstock and corresponded with relative disease control achieved.CURRENT LIMITS IN THOUGHT AND PRACTICE TO INDUCED BIOLOGICAL CONTROLThe argument can be made that use of input strategies to foster development of biologically mediated soilborne disease control suffers in some degree from the same limitations in predicting effective outcomes as biological controls applied using the inundative release strategy Although recent studies employing next-generation sequence analysis have effec- tively outlined changes in the soil microbiome associated with disease suppression in response to a management practice there has been an absence of analysis concerning the evolutionary processes that ultimately yield composition of the effective microbiome.

n'These biological transfor- mations not only are associated with disease suppression but may create a biological environment that is even more resistant to invasion by introduced agents than the nontreated soil system 1.Capacity to integrate biological controls with these methods through enhanced microbial persistence cannot be assumed and would require a more complete understanding of microbial agents with potential to benefit from such modified systems.

Invariably disease control attained in the greenhouse was superior to that in the field with disease control failure a common occurrence in the field W In the context of the extended range of field studies reported comparison at the field scale was not related to the plant performance in the absence of disease thus the economic signi- ficance of the findings is not clear.The failure of introduced microbial agents to consistently and effectively provide biological control should not come as un- expected based upon the inherent requirements to attain soilborne disease suppression.

Augmentation of microbial consortia indigenous to a soil system for biological disease control requires significant knowl-edge of functional attributes factors regulating their activity and complexity of the plantmicrobe and microbemicrobe interac-tions some of which may be attained through previous and ongoing study of disease-suppressive soils The institution of practices promoting the assembly of a disease- suppressive soil microbiome in a cropping system would intuitively possess advantages over the introduction of nonnative organisms.
