The TT genotype is associated with CRC risk in the context of low folate intake whereas it is protective for CRC when high intake of folate occurs -.Many other examples of polymorphisms in diet-nutrition andor metabolism-related genes that modulate CRC risk have been described in the literature.

Authors found evidence for an association of hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15-NAD HPGD phospholipase A2 group VI PLA2G6 and transient receptor potential vanilloid 3 TRPV3 with increased risk for CRC while prostaglandin E receptor 2 PTGER2 was associated with lower CRC risk.

The extent to which genetic variants together with the intake of specific dietary components affect the risk of CRC is currently under investigation and new therapeutic or preventive applications must be explored in CRC models.

In a multivariate model adjusting for clinical risk factors and multiple comparisons the SNP rs8086 in ACSL1 was associated with CRC disease-free survival DFS indicating that patients carrying the ACSL1 rs8086 TT genotype had significantly decreased DFS compared with patients carrying the CT or CC genotype with 3-fold higher risk of relapse Table .

These profiles indeed determine CRC incidence in different populations due to changes in dietary patterns as they occur when rural native Africans are compared with African Americans .The etiology of CRC is partially dependent on microflora and diet so nowadays there is increasing interest in the use of probiotics to modulate gut microbiota .

When pre-diagnosed consumption of red processed meat and poultry was assessed no relation to CRC survival was found for red meat whereas positive association was demonstrated for processed meat and CRC mortality in females.

GCNT3 expression is altered in cancer - and its upregulation has been clearly associated with favorable CRC prognosis .It has been established that rosemary extracts regulate GCNT3 expression in CRC.
