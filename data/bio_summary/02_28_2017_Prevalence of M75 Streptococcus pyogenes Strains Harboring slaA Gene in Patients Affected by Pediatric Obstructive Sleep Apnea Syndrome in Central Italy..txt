interestingly slaa gene was found significantly associated p  0.002 with gas strains isolated from osas patients as compared with gas strains isolated fromchemo-susceptibility patterns of the isolates from osas and non-osas subjects table 3.presence of slaa gene correlates with m75 typethe emm type analysis of the gas strains isolated from osas cases or from non-osas subjects showed that most of the isolates 32 n  7 from the gas osas group belonged to m75 type whereas only 4 out of 59 6.8 of the gas strains isolated from non-osas subjects belonged to this m type p  0.03. moreover no other m type was found to be prevalent in osas or non-osas group table 4. interestingly 6 out of the 7 m75 strains isolated from patients affected by osas harbored the slaa gene table s1 which when sequenced did not presented any allelic variation data not shown.

in conclusion we found an association between slaa gene and the gas osas strains and we showed that the clone emm75st49 harboring genes smez and slaa was exclusively isolated from patients affected by osas thus suggesting that this genotype might be associated to the pathogenesis of osas although further studies are needed to elucidate the possible role of slaa in tonsil hypertrophy development.keywords streptococcus pyogenes obstructive sleep apnea syndrome osas slaa gene multilocus sequence typing mlst molecular epidemiologyintroductionobstructive sleep apnea syndrome osas has emerged in children as the primary indication for surgical removal of adenoids and tonsils american thoracic society 1996 marcus et al.

in fact the clone emm75st49 harboring slaa and smez geneswas associated to osas in a period ranging from 2009 to 2011 table s1 however when spea gene was additionally present pattern two no association with osas patients was observed.the genotype m75st49 harboring slaagene is prevalent in osas casesthe characterization of the gas strains isolated from osas patients showed the significant prevalence of slaa gene in these isolates as compared with non-osas gas strains isolated in the same area.

interestingly only 4 out of the 28 non- osas gas strains harbored the slaa gene table 5. therefore our results indicated a significant association p  0.00018 of slaa gene with gas m75 strains isolated from patients affected by osas.no correlation was found between st and osas casesbased on this finding we decided to perform an mlst analysis of m75 strains in order to investigate whether the pattern harboring slaa gene was due to clonality or to different gas strains.

it has also to be noted that in m75st49 strains the presence of spec gene is negatively associated to osas cases p  0.0003.taken together these data show the association of gas clone emm75st49 harboring slaa gene with pediatric patients affected by osas leading to hypothesize a possible role of the slaa protein in the pathogenesis of tonsil hypertrophy and thus possibly of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.table 5  distribution of virulence factors and mlst analysis in a panel of emm75 gas strains isolated from osas or non-osas patients.gas tonsillar superinfection during mononucleosis.

furthermore 6 out of 7 85.7 of the m75 gas strains isolated from osas patients harbored slaa gene whereas the analysis for the presence of this gene in a panel of non-osas m75 strains isolated in different countries showed that only 4 out of 28 strains 14.3 harbored slaa gene.

in the present study we characterized the gas strains isolated from pediatric osas patients in comparison with a panel of age and sex matched gas strains unrelated to osas but isolated in the same area and during the same period ranging from 2009 to 2013. we found that slaa gene previously reported to be associated to cyslts production pathway was significantly associated to gas osas strains.

moreover since only a subset 45.5 of gas osas strains in our study harbors slaa gene we cannot rule out the importance of other risk factors such as slotoxin thus slaa gene should be considered as a part of a combination of factors which may have a possible role in chronic diseases.author contributionsconceived and designed the experiments reviewed and approved the final version of the manuscript and analyzed the data ev fm gt ar ls ad pr and am.

moreover when all 6 m75 stains were co-cultured with a549 human epithelial lung cells they increased slaa gene expression levels figure 1 showing to harbor host epithelial cell-inducible expression of slaa gene.

2006.in this study we characterized the gas strains isolated from pediatric osas patients investigating the possible association between a panel of gas virulence factors including slaa and osas.

of note unlike slaa the superantigene smez was not prevalently associated with gas strains isolated from osas patients when compared with gas strains isolate from non-osas subjects p  0.86 table 2 suggesting that this virulence factor is not particularly associated to patients affected by osas.
