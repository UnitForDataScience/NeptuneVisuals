for the first time they might make the bridge between autoimmune psychosis and the glutamate theory of psychosis and doing so sheds light on the pathophysiology of autoimmune psychosis.in summary there is a whole array of peripheral and central autoantibodies in schizophrenia which deserve further explora- tion to explore their pathogenic role and to describe possible associated clinico-biological signatures helping to more precise the concept of autoimmune psychosis.autoimmune psychosis clinical picturewe have seen that among the heterogeneous group of schizo- phrenic patients it is possible to hypothesize the existence of an autoimmune psychosis subgroup.

accordingly our goal is to review the evocative characteristics that should prompt the search of autoantibodies in front of a patient in particular in cases of first episode resistant ones or schizophrenia with neurological comorbidity.biological and clinical features of patients with autoimmune psychosisautoimmune psychosis genetic and environmental risk factorsseveral genome-wide association studies gwas confirmed an association between the mhc region chromosome 6 and psychosis  .

for example polymor- phisms of the innate system genes like il1b il6 tnf alpha or interferon will lead to a bigger release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to environmental stressors .in summary immunogenetic dissection especially of the mchhla region according to the natural history of deleterious immune processes including early infection andor autoimmune features might be a promising route to better understand the interactions between gene and environment.autoimmune psychosis peripheral biomarkers from dysbiosis to autoantibodiessimilar to autoimmunity dysbiosis is found in patients with psychosis .

catatonia schizophrenia and nmdar-ab have been extensively associ- ated in the literature which might indicate catatonia as a sign of autoimmune psychosis -.in summary in front of an early age at onset of psychosis discrete neurological symptoms and catatonia search for autoantibodies should be performed.treatment responsemore than 30 of schizophrenic patients are resistant to conven- tional antipsychotics .

however based on a french cohort of patients with psychiatric symptoms and autoantibodies against nmda-r we described clinical characteristics of patients that should lead to search of biological markers of an autoimmune psychosis for details see ref.

these data seem to indicate a different pathophysiology not related to the clas- sical dopaminergic hypothesis in patients with an autoimmune psychosis.all these arguments have led to propose that all treatment- resistantintolerant patients should have an autoantibodies screening and particularly nmdar-ab as a part of the diag- nostic process.in summary based on epidemiological studies genetic and biological biomarkers but also environmental risk factors there are many arguments to suggest that among schizophrenia it is useful to ensure the identification of a subgroup of autoimmune psychosis.

this dysbiosis seems to be the origin of the emergence of different autoantibodies even if the exact mechanisms involved are still under debate .in psychosis settings similar epidemiological associations with early infections autoimmune disorders and dysbiosis have pinpointed the possible existence of an autoimmune psychosis subgroup in schizophrenia.

even if more studies are needed to understand the link between immunogenetic and psychosis disentangling such diversity might help to delineate the concept of autoimmune psychosis at least on a genetic point of view.on the other side although data on gene-environment interactions are scarce several environmental risk factors have been associated with schizophrenia and would be worth testing with mhchla haplotypes.

altogether the reported deep intricacies between infection and autoimmunity either under an additive or a more complex framework with a consequent risk of psychosis reinforce the concept of autoim- mune psychosis concept .more than separated risk factors actual studies argue for a complex interaction between genetic risk factors conferring susceptibility to environmental injuries.

more than that the discovery of n-methyl- d-aspartate receptors antibodies nmdar-ab is also of major importance for a better comprehension of the neurobiological basis not only of autoimmune psychosis but also psychosis in general.

inspite of such impre- cisions defining and isolating seropositive patients suffering from autoimmune psychosis is a major challenge for appropriate treatments.

in this review we focus our attention on the potential elements possibly helping to define an autoimmune psychosis subgroup of schizophrenic patients.

furthermore we outline some of the specific clinical presentation of these patients that will be of great importance to optimize the diagnostic and subsequent therapies.autoimmunity and psychosis rootsautoimmune disorders occur after the failure of self-recognition processes with consequent production of pathogenic autoanti- bodies directed against specific or multiple organs.

these data along with the strong association between the interindividual immunogenetic background and the whole array of brain and peripheral autoan- tibodies in at least a subgroup of schizophrenic patients led us to propose the concept of autoimmune psychosis.
