On Day 7 cells were treated with HbAHP-25 17.8-571.2 lM or gp120 0.01 0.1 1 and 2 lgmL and TER was measured afterh.In another set of experiments HbAHP-25 20 lM or gp120 1 lgmL or gp120 pre-incubated with HbAHP-25 for 30 min was added to cells on Day 7 and TER values were measured 24 h post-treatment.

The present study was therefore undertaken to investigate whether 1 HbAHP-25 has any adverse effect on growth and membrane integrity of various cell lines and 2 HbAHP-25 neutralizes gp120 mediated insults on genital epithelial cells.MethodsMTT and trans-epithelial resistance TER assays were performed to assess the viability and integrity of epithelial cells.

This study provides significant evidences in the favor of HbAHP-25's potential as a topical anti-HIV agent.Keywords HbAHP-25 HIV-1 Inflammation Cytokines Barrier integrity Tight Junctions Claudin-1 ZO-1Accepted 9 October 2017IntroductionThe human genital tract is constantly exposed to a vari- ety of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses 1.

The results are expressed as the resistance measured in Ohms multiplied by the area of the filter l 9 cm2.ImmunofluorescenceIndirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the presence and distribution of Claudin-1 and ZO-1 in HEC- 1A cells treated with gp120 or HbAHP-25 or gp120 pre- incubated with HbAHP-25.

Cells were then trea- ted with HbAHP-25 20 100 and 500 lM or gp120 0.1 1 and 2 lgmL or gp120 1 lgmL pre-incubated with HbAHP-25 20 lM for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 2 paraformaldehyde and blocked with 1 BSA.

Cells were then treated with HbAHP-25 20 lM or gp120 1 lgmL or gp120 1 lgmL pre-incubated with HbAHP-25 30 min for 24 h. TNF-a 0.1 lgmL was used as a positive control.

The rest of the protocol was thesame as above.ImmunoblottingConfluent monolayers of HEC-1A cells were treated with HbAHP-25 20 lM or gp120 1 lgmL or gp120 pre- incubated with HbAHP-25 30 min.

The qRT-PCR reac- tion was carried out in triplicates in four independent experiments.Multiplex cytokine assayHEC-1A cells 2 9 105 cellswell VK2E6E7 cells andEct1E6E7 cells 3 9 105 cellswell were treated with71.4 lM HbAHP-25 or gp120 1 lgmL or gp120 1 lg mL  HbAHP-25 20 lM for 24 h. The supernatant was collected centrifuged at 13 500 g for 20 min at 4degC to remove cell debris and subjected to cytokine detectionusing Bio-Plex ProTM Human Cytokine 17-plex Assay BioRad.

Data presented were expressed as the mean - SD P  0.05 was considered to reflect a statistically significant difference.ResultsExposure to HbAHP-25 does not affect viability of cellslactobacilliOur results revealed that HbAHP-25 even at concentra- tions higher than its IC50 does not adversely affect the viability of vaginal epithelial cells VK2E6E7 endocervi- cal cells End1E6E7 ectocervical cells Ect1E6E7 and endometrial cells HEC-1A cells Fig.

Also HbAHP-25 does not affect the growth of lactobacilli Lactobacillus gasseri Lactobacillus aci- dophilus Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus plantarum as no significant difference was observed in the viability of lactobacilli when treated with HbAHP-25 Fig.
