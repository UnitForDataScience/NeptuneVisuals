on day 7 cells were treated with hbahp-25 17.8-571.2 lm or gp120 0.01 0.1 1 and 2 lgml and ter was measured afterh.in another set of experiments hbahp-25 20 lm or gp120 1 lgml or gp120 pre-incubated with hbahp-25 for 30 min was added to cells on day 7 and ter values were measured 24 h post-treatment.

the present study was therefore undertaken to investigate whether 1 hbahp-25 has any adverse effect on growth and membrane integrity of various cell lines and 2 hbahp-25 neutralizes gp120 mediated insults on genital epithelial cells.methodsmtt and trans-epithelial resistance ter assays were performed to assess the viability and integrity of epithelial cells.

this study provides significant evidences in the favor of hbahp-25's potential as a topical anti-hiv agent.keywords hbahp-25 hiv-1 inflammation cytokines barrier integrity tight junctions claudin-1 zo-1accepted 9 october 2017introductionthe human genital tract is constantly exposed to a vari- ety of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses 1. how- ever genital epithelium remains impervious to these pathogens due to barrier integrity mediated by tight junction and adherent junction proteins 23. tight junc- tions maintain the polarity of the cells by making thecorrespondence dr kvr reddy mim nirrh indian council of medical research mumbai 400 012 india.

the results are expressed as the resistance measured in ohms multiplied by the area of the filter l 9 cm2.immunofluorescenceindirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the presence and distribution of claudin-1 and zo-1 in hec- 1a cells treated with gp120 or hbahp-25 or gp120 pre- incubated with hbahp-25.

on day 5. cells were then treated with hbahp-25 20 lm or gp120 1 lgml or gp120 1 lgml pre-incubated with hbahp-25 30 min for 24 h. tnf-a 0.1 lgml was used as a positive control.

the rest of the protocol was thesame as above.immunoblottingconfluent monolayers of hec-1a cells were treated with hbahp-25 20 lm or gp120 1 lgml or gp120 pre- incubated with hbahp-25 30 min.

data presented were expressed as the mean - sd p  0.05 was considered to reflect a statistically significant difference.resultsexposure to hbahp-25 does not affect viability of cellslactobacilliour results revealed that hbahp-25 even at concentra- tions higher than its ic50 does not adversely affect the viability of vaginal epithelial cells vk2e6e7 endocervi- cal cells end1e6e7 ectocervical cells ect1e6e7 and endometrial cells hec-1a cells fig.

also hbahp-25 does not affect the growth of lactobacilli lactobacillus gasseri lactobacillus aci- dophilus lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus plantarum as no significant difference was observed in the viability of lactobacilli when treated with hbahp-25 fig.

ter values were constant across various concentrations of hbahp-25 17.8-571.2 lm suggesting that hbahp-25 does not affect monolayer formation of cells.

this clearly indicates that hbahp-25 abrogates gp120- induced disruption of barrier integrity.hbahp-25 does not affect tight junction proteins claudin-1 and zo-1epithelial monolayers of hec-1a cells were treated with gp120 or hbahp-25 for 24 h because these cells form better monolayers than ectocerival or vaginal epithelial cells.

this suggests that gp120 damages tight junctions within 6 h after its addition and although hbahp-25 protects cells from gp120-mediated disruption of tight junctions it cannot reverse this damage manifested by gp120.hbahp-25 limits production of tnf-a in gp120 hiv-1-treated cellslevels of various cytokines produced in the presence of hbahp-25 or gp120hiv-1 or gp120hbahp-25 wasfig.

this property of hbahp-25 is a huge bonus because any topical agent that inhibits hiv-1 entry at the mucosal surfaces and protects it from hiv-1gp120-mediated insults may have a significant impact on preventing new infections via the sexual route.in another set of experiments we investigated whether hbahp-25 reverses the damage caused by gp120.
