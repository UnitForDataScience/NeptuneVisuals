Within each wine the natural must fermentations performed with commercial S. cerevisiae strains contained higher levels of glycerol and acetic acid than fermentations performed with autochthonous strains however when synthetic must was used the highest values were exhibitedTABLE 2  Percentages of the inoculated S. cerevisiae strains recovered at the end of different fermentations.B-CA641224by the mixed fermentation .Volatile Compound Production in Industrial FermentationsThe volatile profiles of the six final wines were evaluated Supplementary Table S2.

In natural must fermentations inoculated with non-Saccharomyces yeast  showed some species diversity at the beginning of the fermentation compared with pure S. cerevisiae fermentations  although the most abundant yeast in all cases was H. uvarum with proportions of approximately 86 and 95 in the GR and CA varieties respectively.Among non-Saccharomyces species this yeast dominated throughout fermentation with just one non-inoculated species H. guilliermondii detected in small percentages at mid-fermentation in the case of GR wines.The yeast dynamics for natural must fermentations were also analyzed by culture-independent techniques specifically by qPCR .

The A fermentations A-SM in Synthetic must A-GR in Grenache must and A-CA in Carignan must contained a combination of the seven native strains which were sequentially inoculated.

However in synthetic must the decreased appears shortly after S. cerevisiae inoculation whereas in natural musts these decreases were later.Mixed fermentation in synthetic must revealed the maximum yeast diversity on YPD plates at mid fermentation.

When the commercial yeast strains were used  the pattern was also very similar to the inoculation of the three S. cerevisiae strains.The fermentation kinetics observed by density monitoring showed that the fermentations finished within 8 days when a mixture of Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces are present independently of the origin natural or synthetic of the must.

The defense of the wine typicality should actually include a combination of non-Saccharomyces and S. cerevisiae strains with the aim to obtain wines exhibiting complexity but avoiding the risks related to natural fermentations           .Thus the proper design of an autochthonous starter culture is essential to reproduce the local sensory properties including the incorporation of a mixture of different non-Saccharomyces species and different strains of S. cerevisiae to mimic spontaneous alcoholic fermentations.

During theinitial sampling points a high presence of H. uvarum was detected however these non-Saccharomyces yeast species were not identified at the last sampling point in which all of the colonies were identified as S. cerevisiae.When the three selected S. cerevisiae strains were used  the non-Saccharomyces populations had a similar pattern with Grenache must samples reaching slightly lower populations.
