Obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation has been shown to be a key feature in the de- velopment of IR hence T2D.5253 Initiation of inflammation in obesity involves inflammation of visceral adipose tissue AT and the releaseof free fatty acids FFA as well as liver inflammation called nonalco- holic steatohepatitis NASH which then promote systemic inflam- mation reflected by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.52 Inflammation itself has been associated with an impairment in insulin signalling52 thereby affecting the action of insulin on glucose metabolism.54 Activation of the insulin receptor will result in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 IRS1 and initiation of signal transduction.52 However pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a can inhibit insulin signalling through inhibitory serine phospho- rylation of IRS-1.55 Impaired insulin signalling leads to IR associated with a reduced glucose uptake increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and an increase in circulating free fatty acids.52 Indeed increased cir- culating levels of TNF-a have been associated with IR.56 In contrast to TNF-a IL-10 acts in an anti-inflammatory manner by inhibiting TNF- a-induced NF-kB activation57 and reduced serum levels of IL-10 have been associated with an impairment in glucose metabolism.58AT inflammation plays a prominent role in the development of obesity-induced inflammation53 which is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells in obese AT creating a pro- inflammatory milieu.59 A number of studies have shown that there is a phenotypic switch60-62 from anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages AAM or M2 which are activated by IL-4 and IL-3 and express anti-inflammatory IL-105963 towards pro-inflammatory clas- sically activated macrophages CAM or M1 which secrete various pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-a IL-6 IL-12 IL-23.5963 This phe- notypic switch is positively correlated with IR60-62 and is secondary to T-cell infiltration into obese AT.5964 Whereas Th1 and Th17 cells promote polarization towards CAMs Th2 and Treg cells induce AAM polarization.65-67 The presence of DCs in obese AT might have a reg- ulatory role in AT inflammation as they could also induce Th17 differ- entiation in obese AT.68 In addition IgG secreted by B cells targeting necrotic adipocytes could promote secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by T cells resulting in CAM polarization.69 Increased neu- trophil infiltration of AT in obese subjects and its associated increase of neutrophil elastase can also lead to CAM polarization hence the development of IR.70 While mast cell accumulation in AT of obese mice is associated with IR71 eosinophils seem to have a protective role in AT inflammation and glucose homeostasis.72In addition to the aforementioned roles of different immune cells on AT inflammation and IR an imbalance between pro- and anti- inflammatory adipokines may also contribute to the development of IR.73 Leptin a pro-inflammatory adipokine73 can increase and sup- press the production of circulating Th1- and Th2-type cytokines respectively.74 Other pro-inflammatory adipokines such as resistin retinol-binding protein RBP4 lipocalin 2 angiopoietin-like protein 2 ANGPTL2 CC-chemokine ligand 2 CCL2 CXC-chemokine ligand 5 CXCL5 TNF-a IL-6 and IL-18 have been reported to be upregulated in an obese state.73 Adiponectin an anti-inflammatory adipokine7576 can stimulate the production of IL-10 by macrophages.77 Recently another anti-inflammatory adipokine Sfrp5 was reported to have beneficial metabolic effects.75Aside from the AT inflammation in other tissues such as the liver the skeletal muscle and the pancreas might also contribute to theFIGURE 3 The effects of helminths and obesity on the immune cell composition in adipose tissue.

Indeed there seems to be an immunological interaction between hel- minths and their host in which helminths polarize the immune system towards a strong type 2 immune response that is believed to be asso- ciated with tissue repair8 as well as establishment of a regulatory net- work which can contribute to the control of overt immune responses to allow longer term survival of the parasite while restricting inflam- mation that might otherwise lead to pathology.92  HELMINTH-ASSOCIATED TH2 RESPONSES AND IMMUNE REGULATORY NETWORK Helminth parasites are strong inducers of type 2 immunity which in- volves activation and expansion of CD4 T helper 2 Th2 cells pro- ducing the cytokines interleukin IL-4 IL-5 IL-9 IL-10 and IL-13 systemic and localized eosinophilia expansion of basophils and mast cells goblet cell hyperplasia and the production of IgE.10 Moreover the presence of alternatively activated macrophages AAMs induced by IL-4 andor IL-13 is a characteristic feature of the polarized Th2 response.11 The type 2 response is host protective by controlling the number of parasites through direct killing or expulsion and induc- ing tissue repair necessary to protect against the damage caused by tissue-migrating helminths.12 Crucial for type 2 immune function is the IL-4 receptor a-chain IL-4Ra a component of both the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor and as expressed on immune effector cells and tissue cells its signalling results in a broad range of downstream effector mechanisms important for anti-helminth immunity reviewed in10.Cellular immune hyporesponsiveness in individuals infected with helminths was first observed in the 1970s when lymphocytes isolated from subjects chronically infected with Schistosoma mansoni showed a diminished proliferative response upon stimulation with schisto- some antigens.13 Subsequently several human studies demonstrated that chronic helminth infections such as schistosomiasis and filariasis result in parasite-antigen-specific immune suppression.14-17 As the responsiveness is restored after anthelmintic treatment18-22 a causal relationship between the presence of helminths and suppression of the immune system was considered likely.23This T-cell hyporesponsiveness is thought to be mediated by a helminth-induced regulatory network involving regulatory T cells Tregs and their associated regulatory cytokines IL-10 and transform- ing growth factor TGF-b as key players.1424 Tregs the subset of T cells that maintains self-tolerance in humans23 can dampen both Th1 andTh2 cell activation9 and can be activated during many infections such as parasitic viral fungal and bacterial infections.25 Several studies in animal models and humans show that helminth infections are associ- ated with increased Treg frequencies andor functional capacity.26-28 The link between Tregs and cellular immune hyporesponsiveness was confirmed when in vitro removal of Tregs restored suppressed lympho- cyte proliferation in patients with microfilaremia while proliferative responses in uninfected individuals and chronic pathology patients were not enhanced suggesting a strong regulatory function in as- ymptomatic infected subjects.29 Moreover the observed impairment of parasite-specific Th1 and Th2 immune responses in filaria-infected individuals could be reversed by blocking cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated protein 4 CTLA-4 and neutralizing TGF-b both associated with regulatory T-cell activity in in vitro cell culture.30It is therefore thought that Tregs suppress antiparasite effector cells and can thereby protect the host from pathology by restricting damage to tissues and organs.

Key to this was the finding that the IL-4STAT6 immune axis involved in helminth immunity and allergies controls peripheralnutrient metabolism and insulin sensitivity.84 Insulin sensitivity was improved in high-fat diet HFD-fed mice after IL-4 administration and Th2 polarization via antagonism of the catabolic programme controlled by PPARa in the liver and by attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation.Next it was demonstrated that the maintenance of AAMs in white adipose tissue WAT necessary to maintain glucose homeostasis partly through secretion of IL-106063 depends on the presence of IL- 4-secreting eosinophils.72 Helminth infections promote WAT eosino- philia72 and this accumulation is highly dependent on type 2 cytokines particularly IL-5.85-87 Innate lymphoid type 2 cells ILC2s are widely distributed in tissues including WAT lack antigen-specific receptors and are capable of producing type 2 cytokines in response to alarm- ins such as IL-25 and IL-33.88 By functional deletion of these cells it was shown that ILC2s are required to sustain eosinophils and AAMs in WAT as they are the major source of IL-5 and IL-13.89 These find- ings indicate that the presence of eosinophils AAMs and ILC2 immune cells in WAT has beneficial effects on obesity-induced inflammation and improves glucose homeostasis in obese mice.Recent studies have provided further evidence by demonstrating that the type 2 environment induced by infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis90 S. mansoni91 or the filarial nematode Litomosoides sig- modontis92 improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet- induced obese mice.

In Chennai Indiaa significantly lower prevalence of lymphatic filariasis was observed among diabetic subjects compared to prediabetic and nondiabetic subjects.46 In contrast a relatively small study 120 participants in Brazil reported a positive association between S. stercoralis infection and T2D.48The four subsequent studies reported helminth infection as the exposure and various parameters of metabolic diseases as outcomes including metabolic syndrome prevalence4445 T2D prevalence4345 and HOMA-IR homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resis- tance.42 Interestingly these studies consistently reported an inverse association between previous4445 or current4243 helminth infections and metabolic diseases.Chen et al.45 used self-reported disease and medication history cross-referenced with local government registry data from 1989 as a method to diagnose previous schistosome infections PSI and in- cluded men and women aged 60 years and older from two rural com- munities previously known to be endemic for schistosomiasis.

However further studies are needed to confirm these findings and unravel the complex interaction between helminth infections gut microbiome and insulin resistance.6  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Although the number of epidemiological studies investigating the im- pact of helminth infections on T2D is still limited results support the notion that helminths may have beneficial effects on the development of T2D.

Several clinical trials have been registered in which patients with inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease ulcerative colitis coeliac disease asthma and multiple sclerosis are treated with helminths and so far results have been inconclusive.623Whereas clinical benefits were observed when patients with ulcer- ative colitis were treated with Trichuris suis pig whipworm ova112 re- sults could not be reproduced in a phase 2 trial including 250 patients with Crohn's disease.113 Recently infection with Necator americanus human hookworm larvae was shown to enhance the tolerance in- duced by gluten microchallenge in patients with coeliac disease.114 However no beneficial effects were found against asthma symptoms when asthma patients were treated with N. americanus larvae.115 Up to now these are the only two helminth species that have been tested for human helminth therapy and no study treating patients with T2D has been reported yet.The question remains how long it takes for the helminth-induced immunomodulatory effects to take place as it might be more difficult to treat ongoing inflammatory reactions than prevent its develop- ment.23 In addition the impact of infections during early life might be crucial to develop an immunoregulatory network.116 Another aspect to keep in mind is the low dose of infection used in these trials where the aim was to achieve a protective but well-tolerated infection in- tensity.117 However in contrast to naive subjects who are not living in endemic areas and are not previously exposed higher intensity of infection is tolerated in endemic areas with possibly a stronger regu- latory network.Experimental infections with helminths or helminth-derived mol- ecules in diet-induced obese mice have shown to improve glucose tolerance and increase insulin sensitivity compared to controls.90-93 Importantly these experimental studies enable us to investigate the potential mechanisms by which helminths can influence metabolic outcomes.

AAM alternatively activated macrophage ILC2 innate lymphoid type 2 cells T2D type 2 diabetes STH soil-transmitted helminths PSI previous schistosome infection HDL-C high-density lipoprotein cholesterol BMI body mass index HOMA-IR homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistancepopulations have reported an inverse association between helminths and metabolic diseases and those will be summarized below.42-47Since 2001 seven cross-sectional studies have reported a link between previous or current helminth infections and metabolic dis- eases42-48 Figure 2.

This association was consistently observed across hetero- geneous populations across different countries and when different helminth species were studied.50 However a limitation of the current studies is their cross-sectional design and to study the causal relation- ship between helminths and T2D longitudinal studies are needed.51 Such deworming trials often take place in poor-resource settings where it might be difficult to interpret the results due to presence of other infections that could be affected by treatment the chance of reinfection and the observation that protective effects of helminths might persist long after treatment.64445Meanwhile helminth therapy has generated a strong interest as an alternative approach to assess whether controlled helminth infec- tions or administration of helminth-derived molecules can improve metabolic outcomes.
