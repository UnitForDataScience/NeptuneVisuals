obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation has been shown to be a key feature in the de- velopment of ir hence t2d.5253 initiation of inflammation in obesity involves inflammation of visceral adipose tissue at and the releaseof free fatty acids ffa as well as liver inflammation called nonalco- holic steatohepatitis nash which then promote systemic inflam- mation reflected by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.52 inflammation itself has been associated with an impairment in insulin signalling52 thereby affecting the action of insulin on glucose metabolism.54 activation of the insulin receptor will result in tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 irs1 and initiation of signal transduction.52 however pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-a can inhibit insulin signalling through inhibitory serine phospho- rylation of irs-1.55 impaired insulin signalling leads to ir associated with a reduced glucose uptake increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and an increase in circulating free fatty acids.52 indeed increased cir- culating levels of tnf-a have been associated with ir.56 in contrast to tnf-a il-10 acts in an anti-inflammatory manner by inhibiting tnf- a-induced nf-kb activation57 and reduced serum levels of il-10 have been associated with an impairment in glucose metabolism.58at inflammation plays a prominent role in the development of obesity-induced inflammation53 which is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory cells in obese at creating a pro- inflammatory milieu.59 a number of studies have shown that there is a phenotypic switch60-62 from anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages aam or m2 which are activated by il-4 and il-3 and express anti-inflammatory il-105963 towards pro-inflammatory clas- sically activated macrophages cam or m1 which secrete various pro-inflammatory mediators tnf-a il-6 il-12 il-23.5963 this phe- notypic switch is positively correlated with ir60-62 and is secondary to t-cell infiltration into obese at.5964 whereas th1 and th17 cells promote polarization towards cams th2 and treg cells induce aam polarization.65-67 the presence of dcs in obese at might have a reg- ulatory role in at inflammation as they could also induce th17 differ- entiation in obese at.68 in addition igg secreted by b cells targeting necrotic adipocytes could promote secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by t cells resulting in cam polarization.69 increased neu- trophil infiltration of at in obese subjects and its associated increase of neutrophil elastase can also lead to cam polarization hence the development of ir.70 while mast cell accumulation in at of obese mice is associated with ir71 eosinophils seem to have a protective role in at inflammation and glucose homeostasis.72in addition to the aforementioned roles of different immune cells on at inflammation and ir an imbalance between pro- and anti- inflammatory adipokines may also contribute to the development of ir.73 leptin a pro-inflammatory adipokine73 can increase and sup- press the production of circulating th1- and th2-type cytokines respectively.74 other pro-inflammatory adipokines such as resistin retinol-binding protein rbp4 lipocalin 2 angiopoietin-like protein 2 angptl2 cc-chemokine ligand 2 ccl2 cxc-chemokine ligand 5 cxcl5 tnf-a il-6 and il-18 have been reported to be upregulated in an obese state.73 adiponectin an anti-inflammatory adipokine7576 can stimulate the production of il-10 by macrophages.77 recently another anti-inflammatory adipokine sfrp5 was reported to have beneficial metabolic effects.75aside from the at inflammation in other tissues such as the liver the skeletal muscle and the pancreas might also contribute to thefigure 3 the effects of helminths and obesity on the immune cell composition in adipose tissue.

indeed there seems to be an immunological interaction between hel- minths and their host in which helminths polarize the immune system towards a strong type 2 immune response that is believed to be asso- ciated with tissue repair8 as well as establishment of a regulatory net- work which can contribute to the control of overt immune responses to allow longer term survival of the parasite while restricting inflam- mation that might otherwise lead to pathology.92  helminth-associated th2 responses and immune regulatory network helminth parasites are strong inducers of type 2 immunity which in- volves activation and expansion of cd4 t helper 2 th2 cells pro- ducing the cytokines interleukin il-4 il-5 il-9 il-10 and il-13 systemic and localized eosinophilia expansion of basophils and mast cells goblet cell hyperplasia and the production of ige.10 moreover the presence of alternatively activated macrophages aams induced by il-4 andor il-13 is a characteristic feature of the polarized th2 response.11 the type 2 response is host protective by controlling the number of parasites through direct killing or expulsion and induc- ing tissue repair necessary to protect against the damage caused by tissue-migrating helminths.12 crucial for type 2 immune function is the il-4 receptor a-chain il-4ra a component of both the il-4 and il-13 receptor and as expressed on immune effector cells and tissue cells its signalling results in a broad range of downstream effector mechanisms important for anti-helminth immunity reviewed in10.cellular immune hyporesponsiveness in individuals infected with helminths was first observed in the 1970s when lymphocytes isolated from subjects chronically infected with schistosoma mansoni showed a diminished proliferative response upon stimulation with schisto- some antigens.13 subsequently several human studies demonstrated that chronic helminth infections such as schistosomiasis and filariasis result in parasite-antigen-specific immune suppression.14-17 as the responsiveness is restored after anthelmintic treatment18-22 a causal relationship between the presence of helminths and suppression of the immune system was considered likely.23this t-cell hyporesponsiveness is thought to be mediated by a helminth-induced regulatory network involving regulatory t cells tregs and their associated regulatory cytokines il-10 and transform- ing growth factor tgf-b as key players.1424 tregs the subset of t cells that maintains self-tolerance in humans23 can dampen both th1 andth2 cell activation9 and can be activated during many infections such as parasitic viral fungal and bacterial infections.25 several studies in animal models and humans show that helminth infections are associ- ated with increased treg frequencies andor functional capacity.26-28 the link between tregs and cellular immune hyporesponsiveness was confirmed when in vitro removal of tregs restored suppressed lympho- cyte proliferation in patients with microfilaremia while proliferative responses in uninfected individuals and chronic pathology patients were not enhanced suggesting a strong regulatory function in as- ymptomatic infected subjects.29 moreover the observed impairment of parasite-specific th1 and th2 immune responses in filaria-infected individuals could be reversed by blocking cytotoxic t-lymphocyte- associated protein 4 ctla-4 and neutralizing tgf-b both associated with regulatory t-cell activity in in vitro cell culture.30it is therefore thought that tregs suppress antiparasite effector cells and can thereby protect the host from pathology by restricting damage to tissues and organs.

whereas obesity-induced low- grade chronic inflammation is characterized by the accumulation of cd8 t cells cd4 th1 cells cams b cells and mast cells in the ad- ipose tissue chronic helminth infections or helminth-derived mole- cules induce increased numbers of cd4 th2 cells eosinophils aams tregs and ilc2s dampening the inflammation and improving glucose tolerance figure 3. it has to be noted that not only changes in adi- pose tissue take place but also the cellular composition of the liver has been shown to be affected by administration of sea.91 furthermore the helminth-induced increase in ilc2s eosinophils and aams may result in browning of white adipose tissue generating beige cells.96-98 beige cells increase energy expenditure and decrease adiposity asthey can burn energy from fat by producing heat and may thereby prevent the development of insulin resistance.9699 this thermogenic process is dependent on mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 ucp1 and both ilc2s and aams were shown to directly upregulate ucp1 in adipocytes by producing methionine-enkephalin peptides or catechol- amines respectively.96although there is very little human data available that could ex- plain the mechanism by which helminths may protect against t2d it can be speculated that helminths suppress chronic inflammation associated with t2d by modulating the immune response.

key to this was the finding that the il-4stat6 immune axis involved in helminth immunity and allergies controls peripheralnutrient metabolism and insulin sensitivity.84 insulin sensitivity was improved in high-fat diet hfd-fed mice after il-4 administration and th2 polarization via antagonism of the catabolic programme controlled by ppara in the liver and by attenuation of adipose tissue inflammation.next it was demonstrated that the maintenance of aams in white adipose tissue wat necessary to maintain glucose homeostasis partly through secretion of il-106063 depends on the presence of il- 4-secreting eosinophils.72 helminth infections promote wat eosino- philia72 and this accumulation is highly dependent on type 2 cytokines particularly il-5.85-87 innate lymphoid type 2 cells ilc2s are widely distributed in tissues including wat lack antigen-specific receptors and are capable of producing type 2 cytokines in response to alarm- ins such as il-25 and il-33.88 by functional deletion of these cells it was shown that ilc2s are required to sustain eosinophils and aams in wat as they are the major source of il-5 and il-13.89 these find- ings indicate that the presence of eosinophils aams and ilc2 immune cells in wat has beneficial effects on obesity-induced inflammation and improves glucose homeostasis in obese mice.recent studies have provided further evidence by demonstrating that the type 2 environment induced by infection with nippostrongylus brasiliensis90 s. mansoni91 or the filarial nematode litomosoides sig- modontis92 improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet- induced obese mice.

several clinical trials have been registered in which patients with inflammatory diseases such as crohn's disease ulcerative colitis coeliac disease asthma and multiple sclerosis are treated with helminths and so far results have been inconclusive.623whereas clinical benefits were observed when patients with ulcer- ative colitis were treated with trichuris suis pig whipworm ova112 re- sults could not be reproduced in a phase 2 trial including 250 patients with crohn's disease.113 recently infection with necator americanus human hookworm larvae was shown to enhance the tolerance in- duced by gluten microchallenge in patients with coeliac disease.114 however no beneficial effects were found against asthma symptoms when asthma patients were treated with n. americanus larvae.115 up to now these are the only two helminth species that have been tested for human helminth therapy and no study treating patients with t2d has been reported yet.the question remains how long it takes for the helminth-induced immunomodulatory effects to take place as it might be more difficult to treat ongoing inflammatory reactions than prevent its develop- ment.23 in addition the impact of infections during early life might be crucial to develop an immunoregulatory network.116 another aspect to keep in mind is the low dose of infection used in these trials where the aim was to achieve a protective but well-tolerated infection in- tensity.117 however in contrast to naive subjects who are not living in endemic areas and are not previously exposed higher intensity of infection is tolerated in endemic areas with possibly a stronger regu- latory network.experimental infections with helminths or helminth-derived mol- ecules in diet-induced obese mice have shown to improve glucose tolerance and increase insulin sensitivity compared to controls.90-93 importantly these experimental studies enable us to investigate the potential mechanisms by which helminths can influence metabolic outcomes.

overexpression of il-10 has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity94 and treatment with the immu- nomodulatory glycan lnfpiii present in helminths increased insulin sensitivity in wat of diet-induced obese mice in an il-10-dependent manner.95taken together these findings suggest that helminths influence metabolic homeostasis at least partly by changing the immune cell composition in the adipose tissue.

removal of helminths has also not been associated with changes of gut microbiota composition.106108 furthermore human experimental hookworm infection failed to in- duce changes in bacterial diversity however it did induce a minor increase in the richness of the microbial species.109 interestingly in mice helminth infections are associated with an increase of intestinal short-chain fatty acids scfa110 the end products of dietary carbohy- drates fermentation which has been shown to play an important role in the control of body weight and insulin sensitivity.111taken together helminth-associated alterations in the diversity of the gut microbiome and amount of scfa might mediate the effect of helminths on whole-body ir.

however further studies are needed to confirm these findings and unravel the complex interaction between helminth infections gut microbiome and insulin resistance.6  conclusions and future perspectives although the number of epidemiological studies investigating the im- pact of helminth infections on t2d is still limited results support the notion that helminths may have beneficial effects on the development of t2d.

indeed areas where helminths are endemic have been associated with a reduced prevalence of immuno- pathologies such as th2-mediated allergic diseases reviewed in63334 and th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.3536these observations regarding the importance of regulatory cells led to the revised hygiene hypothesis which states that the expo- sure to pathogens bacteria viruses and helminths is critical for es- tablishing immunoregulatory cells to prevent inappropriate responses to innocuous substances.

in obesity the activation state but not the number of kupffer cells kc in the liver changes7879 promoting the expression of inflammatory genes78 as well as the production of inflammatory mediators which leads to an increased ir in the liver.79 nash might also be initiated by the abdominal at- associated increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the portal circulation.53 in contrast skeletal muscles may not be the site where inflammation is initiated but the target of inflammation- induced ir.53 an increased expression of inflammatory markers within skeletal muscle was only reported among obese people with t2d but not among obese people without t2d.80 in the pancreatic islets of diabetics increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-1b have been found81 which is a master regulator of islet cell inflammation in t2d.82 this pancreatic islet inflammation is a key step in the develop- ment of t2d as the failure of beta cells to compensate ir will lead to the development of hyperglycaemia and t2d.835  possible helminth- mediated mechanisms associated with improved metabolic homeostasis  immunomodulatory effectsa number of experimental studies have provided evidence for the beneficial effects of helminths and helminth-derived molecules on metabolic homeostasis figure 2 and shed light on the immunomod- ulatory mechanisms that could explain the link between helminths and t2d.

this hypothesis may be used to explain the changes in disease patterns that are seen along with epidemiologi- cal transition.37 with gradual development and subsequent changes in living conditions and diet in developing countries which not only result in limited physical activity and increased consumption of pro- cessed food but also in less exposure to infections and therefore less immune regulation an increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases has been observed.638 however as rural-urban transitions are accompanied by a multitude of complex individual and societal changes it is challenging to prove a causal relationship between de- creased infectious pressure and increased prevalence of inflammatory diseases.3  helminths and type 2 diabetes an inverse association as described above helminth infections have been shown to be asso- ciated with a lower prevalence of immunopathologies such as allergicproporion of children requiring prevenive chemotherapy for sths 2014prevalence of diabetes in adults 2015figure 1 worldwide prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths and diabetes.

effects on gut microbiomeemerging evidence suggests that the composition of gut microbiota plays a role in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated insulin resistanceby affecting energy homeostasis and inflammation.102 moreover a re- cent study reported the impact of human gut microbiome on insu- lin sensitivity.103 therefore alteration of the gut microbiome in the presence of helminth parasites104 has been thought to be one of the possible mechanisms explaining how helminths could influence insulin sensitivity.50 however up to now there have been no studies specifi- cally probing this issue.interestingly whereas less bacterial diversity was commonly observed among obese subjects or diabetics102105 greater bacte- rial diversity was recently reported among subjects infected with schistosoma haematobium106 and sths.107 however these findings were not confirmed by cooper et al.108 who found that t. trichiura infection was not associated with changes in gut microbiota and mixed infection of a. lumbricoides and t. trichiura was even associated with reduced bacterial diversity.
