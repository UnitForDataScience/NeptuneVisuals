The putrescine transport gene potA was increased in Mn2-exposed male mice while potA and potG were decreased in female mice C. Putrescine bio- synthesis genes were also significantly changed by Mn2 exposure in a sex-selective fashion as revealed by altered agmatine deiminase in fe- males and arginine decarboxylase and N-carbamoylputrescine amidase in males C.LPS synthesis and DNA repair genes were specifically enriched in fe- male mice by Mn2 exposureLPS plays an important role in the host inflammation and contrib- utes to the gut-brain interactions  .

Mn ABC transporter genes A and B and Mn oxidation gene C were significantly increased in female mice but decreased in male mice after Mn2 treatment.

The oxidative stress response gene cytochrome c551 peroxidase as well as multiple DNA repair genes was significantly increased in female mice but decreased in male mice under Mn2 exposure C.Genes related to iron homeostasis were altered by Mn2 exposureMn can interact with iron and perturb normal physiological process- es .

At the experimental pe- riod mice were randomly assigned into either the control group or 100 ppm MnCl2 treatment group consumption of Mn is  20 mgkg body weightday n  20 with 5 male mice and 5 female mice per group.

no statistically significant change.consistently decreased in male mice D. Our results again high- light a sex-selective effect of Mn2 on these critical bacterial functional genes.Sex-selective regulation of genes of Mn transportation and oxidationAs an essential trace metal Mn can be absorbed and utilized by many bacteria species .

For example the increase of Mn transpor- tation genes in female mice may enrich Mn2 in gut bacteria thus reducing its toxic effects in the host by limiting Mn adsorption in host cells.

We found that quorum sensing genes were specifically increased in Mn2-exposed male mice only including autoinducer 2 AI-2 kinase LsrK S-ribosylhomocysteine lyase and autoinducer-2 production pro- tein LuxS A. Consequently bacterial genes involved in flagellar motility and chemotaxis were largely increased in male mice B and C. Interestingly multiple metal or drug resistance related genes were significantly increased in Mn2-treated female mice butFig.

Quorum sensing genes specifically increased in Mn2-exposed male mice A. Bacterial genes of flagellar motility B and chemotaxis C increased in Mn2-exposed male mice but significantly decreased in female mice.

Moreover LPS assembly related genes were largely increased in fe- male mice by Mn2 exposure but were either reduced or not signifi- cantly changed in male mice B.

Herein genes involved in putrescine syn- thesis and transportation were changed by Mn2 treatment C. In addition two phenylalanine synthesis genes also have significantly higher abundances in Mn2-treated mice than controls B. Con- sistently at the metabolite level several neurotransmitters or the pre- cursors of neurotransmitter synthesis such as glycine glutamic acid and phenylalanine were perturbed by Mn2 exposure .
