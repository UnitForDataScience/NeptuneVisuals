Given these findings we examined the possible relationship among the gut microbiome sleep quality and cognitive flexibility in a sample of healthy older adults.Methods Thirty-seven participants age 64.59 - 7.54 years provided a stool sample for gut microbial sequencing and completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Stroop Color Word Test as part of a larger project.Results Better sleep quality was associated with better Stroop performance and higher proportions of the gut microbial phyla Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae.

Several nutritional indices were associated with test perfor- mance including daily averages for energy 1519.24 - 912.00 kcal carbohydrate 162.09 - 111.95 g protein 72.19 - 28.77 g fat 66.66 - 46.30 g and sugar intake 91.31 - 63.67 g. Because of the high multicollinearity among these indices all r's  0.71 only the macronutrient that had the strongest relationship with Stroop performance ie carbohydrate intake was included as a covariate in primary analyses.Relationships among sleep quality gut microbiota and cognitive flexibilityPoor sleep quality was associated with poorer performance on the Stroop Word r 0.40 p 0.018 and Color-Word r 0.41 p 0.010 subtests after controlling for hypertension and carbo- hydrate intake while a trend in the same direction was seen for Stroop Color performance r 0.34 p 0.053.

These findings together indicate that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome atypical compositiondiversity may contribute to the cognitive dysfunction associated with chronically poor sleep.The current preliminary study examines the possible association between the gut microbiome composition and sleep quality in healthy older adults and whether sleep quality and microbial phyla are independently associated with a measure of cognitive flexibility.MethodsParticipantsThirty-seven English-speaking participants aged from 50 to 85 years underwent cognitive testing completed questionnaires and provided a stool sample for gut microbiome sequencing.

Participants read aloud color words Stroop Word identified the ink color of rows of X's Stroop Color and identified the ink color of incongruent color words Stroop Color-Word as quickly as possible.

Partial correlations suggested that the relationship between Lentisphaerae and Stroop Color-Word performance was better accounted for by sleep quality sleep quality remained a significant predictor of Color-Word performance inde- pendent of the Lentisphaerae proportion while the relationship between Lentisphaerae and Stroop performance was non-significant.

Verrucomicrobia and sleep quality were not associated with Stroop Word performance independent of one another.Conclusions The current findings suggest a possible relationship among sleep quality composition of the gut microbiome and cognitive flexibility in healthy older adults.

Gut micro- biome composition was represented as the proportion each phylum in the gut microbiota.Statistical analysesTo identify possible confounding variables we examined the relationships among medical conditions macronutrient content and Stroop performance through correlations.

Additional correla- tions were used to assess the associations among PSQI scores Stroop performance and gut microbiome composition.

Finally partial correlations determined whether the association between gut microbiome composition and Stroop test performance was in- dependent of PSQI scores.
