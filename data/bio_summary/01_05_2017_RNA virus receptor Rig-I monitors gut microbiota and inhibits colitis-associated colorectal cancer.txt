Principal component analysis also showed that the gut microbiota of Rig-I-- and wt mice were different Additional file Figure S4b.Furthermore to determine whether the susceptibility of Rig-I-- mice to induced CAC was caused by imbal- anced gut flora we removed most of the bacteria via treating mice with a cocktail of antibiotics Abx.Interestingly Rig-I-- mice were still more susceptible to induced CAC than wt mice although all mice held de- crease tumor number and tumor load than that before Abx intake Fig.

Increasing evidences demonstrate the crucial role of the gut microbiota in carcinogenesis -and several bacterial groups have been identified as CRC- associated bacteria including Bacteroidetes Proteobac- teria and Fusobacterium  Host recognition of various microbial components known as pathogen- associated molecular patterns PAMPs mainly depends on pattern-recognition receptors PRRs such as Toll- like receptors TLR Nod-like receptors NLRs Rig-I- like receptors RLRs and C-type lectin receptors CLRs -Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I Rig-I also known as DDX58 a main member of RLRs is an intracellular viral RNA receptor which specifically recognizes double-stranded viral RNA initiating antiviral innate im- munity In our previous studies we found that Rig-I knock-out Rig-I-- mice were susceptible to colitis which was similar with human IBD accompanied with decreased expression of G protein subunit a-i2 Gai-2 and abnormal T cell activation Rig-I-- mice were also found to be more susceptible to infection with E. coli as compared to wt mice due to decreased phagocyt- osis of bacteria Furthermore Rig-I-- mice were susceptible to spontaneous infection with a commensal bacterium S. xylosus in the skin around eyes and neck accompanied with defects in B cell development specific IgG3 immunoglobulin class switch recombination un- published data and p105 translational inhibition These results indicate that the regulatory functions of Rig-I are strikingly broad.

After mice were treated with the antibiotics for 5 weeks colon cancer was induced in wt or Rig-I-- mice as described above.Sample collection sequencing and bioinformatics analysis for intestinal microbiotaTo obtain well-matched wt and Rig-I-- mice for the com- parison of intestinal microbiota wt and Rig-I-- littermates from a single heterozygous intercross were selected to start homozygous intercross that were housed separately from this point on.

We used samples of off- spring of male mice from the same brood mating with another brood of female mice to avoid the ef- fects of the feeding cage and the female mouse hor- monal cycle  Our study found that the variation of intestinal flora between wt and Rig-I-- mice exactly existed in different ages.

The untreated co- lons were comparable between Rig-I-- and wt mice Add- itional file Figure S3c but Rig-I-- mice loaded more severe dysplasia and adenocarcinoma Fig.

Taken together these results showed that Rig-I loss could promote the progres- sion of induced CAC in mice.Rig-I-- mice displayed intestinal flora disturbanceIntestinal flora has a key role in colorectal carcino- genesis  To evaluate the effect of Rig-I on intes- tinal microbiota regulation we collected stool samples from Rig-I-- and wt mice in different ages.

Most of CRC is associated with colitis inflammation and chronic infec- tion Given that Rig-I-- mice showed a similar phenotype with human colitis and intestinal flora dis- order we speculated that Rig-I-- mice were more sus- ceptible to colorectal cancer.

During the experimental proced- ure Rig-I-- mice showed reduced survival time and higher mortality than wt mice Fig.

Moreover we found that the co- lons of Rig-I-- mice were much shorter and thicker than those of wt mice Additional file Figure S3b.

It was also reported that Gai2-- mice displayed ulcerative colitis and adenocarcinoma of the colon We found Gai2 mRNA was decreased in Rig-I-- intestines Fig.
