Colonization of adult germ-free maternally separated mice lead to anxiety-like behavior and behavioral despair whereas colonization of germ-free non-handled mice did not.It is possible that host factors present in maternally separated but absent in non-handled rats will also determine whether colonization with patient mycobiota leads to visceral hypersensitivity.We showed that mycobiome dysbiosis and immune recognition of fungal antigens play an important role in visceral hypersensitivity in rat.

Fungi are important for water avoidance WA-induced visceral hypersensitivity of maternal separated MS rats.Prevention of water avoidance-induced visceral hypersensitivity in maternal separated rats.

These exper- iments provide strong evidence for a causal role of fungi in the etiology of visceral hypersensitivity and also suggest that relevant differences exist between the mycobiome of non-handled and maternally separated rats.The Fecal Mycobiome of Maternally Separated Rats Differs From Non-handled RatsSimilar to the human mycobiome we addressed the possible differences between groups in our rat model by ITS1-based metabarcoding.

Straindifferences may also be relevant in the mycobiome-specific visceral hypersensitivity shown in our repopulation exper- iments but were not addressed in our mycobiome assessment.The reason for mycobiome dysbiosis in maternally separated rats remains elusive at this stage but may relate to changes in dam-pup interactions in the postnatal period andor altered HPA-axis responsiveness that were described in this model.

Three separate groups of adult maternally separated rats were first subjected to water avoidance stress which caused post-stress visceral hypersensitivity in all groups C. All rats were then treated with a combination of fluconazole and nystatin resulting in amelioration of visceral hypersensitivity.

Both fungicides independently prevented the occurrence of post-stress visceral hypersensitivity compared with vehicle in maternal separated rats A. Non-handled rats were not affected by fungicide treatment.The functional relevance of the gut mycobiome was confirmed in post water avoidance fungal depletion and fecal transplantation experiments setup depicted in B.

We first confirmed a normal visceral sensitivity status of non-handled rats and post water avoidance hypersensitivity in maternally separated rats that was reversed upon fungicide treatment A. Fecal pellets of these rats were then used for mycobiome analysis.

Our current investigations show that the prolonged post-stress pain response phase 2 depends on the presence and recognition via Dectin-1Syk of a unique mycobiome and related uptake of particu- late b-glucans.restoring visceral hypersensitivity in fungicide-treated maternally separated rats.

In rat it was shown that CRF receptor antagonism can prevent acute stress-induced mast cell degranulation and resulting visceral hypersensitivity.In contrast post-stress hypersensitivity to distension although it was also mast cell-dependent could not be reversed by CRF receptor antagonist.Our present data suggest that continued visceral hypersensitivity is driven by cellular recognition of fungal b-glucans that are normally confined to the gut lumen.

The functional relevance of the gut mycobiome was confirmed in fecal trans- plantation experiments adult maternally separated rats were subjected to water avoidance stress to induce visceral hyper- sensitivity then given fungicide and donor cecum content via oral gavage.
