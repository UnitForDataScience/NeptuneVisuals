studies demonstrated that there is an association between tlrs and pathogenesis of hbv infection 11-13. it is known that tlr5 can specifically rec- ognize bacterial flagellin 14. flagellin binding to tlr5 induces myd88-dependent signaling and activates the proinflammatory transcription factor nf-kb in different cells including monocytes and dendritic cells which results in activation of innate immune responses against flagellated bacteria 15. a variety of tlrs agonists can inhibit hbv repli- cation probably as a result of the production of cytokines induced by the tlr signaling 16. these agonists included those of tlrs associated with recognition of different viruses such as tlr3 andas well as those of tlrs associated with recogni- tion of bacteria such as tlr4 and 5 16. a recent prospective study carried out in taiwan found that polymorphism of tlr5 rs5744174 was associated with earlier disappearance of serum hbeag and presence of anti-hbe for 6 months as well as with higher ifn-c production in chronic hbv-infected patients 17. polymorphisms of tlr5 had been reported to be associated with many infections and autoimmune diseases.

polymorphism of tlr5 rs5744174 was found to be associated with increased risk of crohn's disease 19. it was also reported that the snp rs2072493 in tlr5 was associated with anti- tnf outcome of dutch patients with rheumatoid arthritis 20. genetic variation in tlr5 was also related to grave's disease gd in all patients and female subset in chinese cantonese population 21. however data on the relationship between tlr5 gene polymorphisms and hbv-related dis- eases are very limited.

there were no significant differences in gender between controls and patients.polymorphisms of tlr5 and disease progressionfrequency of tlr5 rs5744174 tt genotype was higher in patients with lc than chb p  0.05. after gender stratification the significant differencetable 2. haplotype analysis in controls and patients1p value odds ratio or and 95 confidence intervals ci of group controls vs group chb  lc  hcc.2p value odds ratio or and 95 confidence intervals ci of group chb vs group lc  hcc.table 3. the genotypes and allele frequencies of tlr5 1775ag rs2072493 and 1846tc rs5744174 in patients with chb lc and hcc combined cases and controlswas found in men p  0.018 but not in women p  1.000. since it is generally accepted that patients with hbeag can have a higher replica- tion of viruses and disease activity this group of patients were further analyzed.

it is known that the conserved flagellin domains d0 and d1 are required for the immune activity of flagellin as a pamp 27. tlr5 ectodomain ecd can only interact with the d1 region of flagellin thus induce the receptor activation 28. however the two mutations studied are not connected directly to thetable 6. genotypes of tlr5 rs5744174 and median of hbv dna copy number log n in different age groups of chb patients who were positive for hbeag1copy number log n of hbv dna was decreased with increasing age of patients with tt genotype p  0.03.flagellin d1 regions and are identified to have no effect on receptor activation and structural perturba- tions but might rather play a role in receptor dimer- ization or interaction with the flexible flagellin d0 domain 29. we found that the distribution of tlr5 rs5744174 tt genotype was significantly different in patients with lc and chb and there was a clear dif- ference between genders suggesting that this may be due to the immune response of sex discrepancy.

a web-based program for the goodness of fit of chi-square test v2 test was used to evaluate the hardy-weinberg equilibrium hwe of the studied tlr5 alleles the major allele for each snp of tlr5 is consid- ered the reference allele.

an increased fre- quency of tlr5 rs5744174 tt genotype was found along with the severity of hbv-related disease being from 53.2 in patients with chb to 74.1 in patients with hcc p  0.024 table 4. in con- trast frequencies of tc genotypes were decreased from 41.0 in chb patients 33.3 in lc patients to 18.5 in hcc patients table 4. furthermore significantly higher frequency of haplotype ac was found in patients with chb than those with lc and hcc combined 26.3 vs 16.7 or 95ci 0.561 0.338-0.931 p  0.024 supportingthat frequency of t allele of tlr5 rs5744174 in patients with lc and hcc was higher compared to that in patients with chb.

activation of the tlr pathways have been demon- strated to play a crucial role in innate immunity against bacterial fungal and viral pathogens in humans 22. studies have shown that several tlrs including tlr3 tlr7 tlr8 and tlr9 can rec- ognize viruses 23 24. tlr5 is a receptor for bac- terial derivative flagellin 25. however little is known about impact of tlr5 as well as its genetic variation on viral infections.

recently assessed impacts of gene polymorphisms of tlr2 tlr4 tlr5 and tlr9 on spontaneous hbeag and hbsag seroconversion in chronic hbv- infected patients during a prospective cohort study in taiwan and found that tlr5 rs5744174 and tlr9 rs5743836 promoter area polymorphism were associated with earlier spontaneous hbeag sero- conversion and that tlr4 rs4986790 asp299gly was associated with hbsag seroclearance in these patients.

however a recent study con- ducted in beijing reported that the positivity rate of hbsag in 78 100 adults was 2.24 45.in conclusion the results of this study showedthat genotype tt of tlr5 rs5744174 is over-pre- sented in chinese patients with hbv-related hepa- tocellular carcinoma suggesting a plausible link between tlr5 snps and hbv infection related to the severity of this disease in chinese populations.

further studies are needed to address the biological impact of the studied mutations on different cyto- kine production and tlr5 signaling pathway as well as to investigate the effect of tlr5 polymor- phisms on disease progression of hbv infected patients in different ethnic populations.we thank those who helped collect patients' samples and extract dnas from the samples.fundingthis study was supported by the collaborative innovation center of infectious diseases capital medical university pxm 2015014226000058by beijing key laboratory no bz0089 and by national natural science foundation of china no 81571973.conflict of interestthe authors do not have a commercial or other association that might pose a conflict of interest.ethical approvalthis study was approved by the ethics committee of beijing you'an hospital of capital medical university beijing china.referencesoh is park sh.

the purpose of this study was to explore if genetic variation in tlr5 caninfluence the susceptibility and progression of hbv related diseases among chinese population.methodsstudy populationthe study subjects consisted of 909 chinese individuals during a period of july 2014 to september 2015 including 636 patients with hbv-related liver diseases recruited from beijing you'an hospital of capital medical univer- sity and 273 controls who attended annual physical exami- nation.

genotypes of tlr5 rs2072493 and rs5744174 were determined by pcr-based sequencing.
