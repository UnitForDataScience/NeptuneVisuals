The pioneering bacterial communities that colonize the intestine originate primarily from the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota in the case of vaginal delivery and from the mother's skin microbiota in the case of C-section delivery.

Infant fecal microbiota in both delivery groups did not resemble maternal rectal or vaginal microbiota.

The diversity of the infant gut microbiota increases gradually when solid foods are introduced eventually reaching a stable adult-like microbiota at 2-3 years of age .

observedthat the bacterial composition of meconium samples from vaginally delivered newborns was similar to that of the vaginal microbiota of their mother in contrast meconium from newborns delivered by C-section was most similar to the maternal skin microbiota dominantly composed of Streptococcus spp.

It is possible that a more diverse gut microbiota is more efficient in improving the maturation of the immune system and reducing the risk of chronic immune disorders .A longitudinal study analyzing the gut microbiota of infants from birth to 7 years of age showed that those who became over- weight at 7 years harbored significantly fewer Bifidobacterium sp.

More longitudinal studies evaluating the development of the early gut microbiota and its impact on the development of obesity T1D and food allergy are necessary to confirm whether alterations in the microbiota's composition andor a delay in the colonization process precedes the development of these diseases.Postnatal Gut Dysbiosis Affects the Maturation of the infant's Mucosal immune SystemDecreased levels of intestinal Bacteroides spp.
