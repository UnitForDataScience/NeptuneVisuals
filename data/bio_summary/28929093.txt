The pioneering bacterial communities that colonize the intestine originate primarily from the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota in the case of vaginal delivery and from the mother's skin microbiota in the case of C-section delivery.

Infant fecal microbiota in both delivery groups did not resemble maternal rectal or vaginal microbiota.

The diversity of the infant gut microbiota increases gradually when solid foods are introduced eventually reaching a stable adult-like microbiota at 2-3 years of age .

observedthat the bacterial composition of meconium samples from vaginally delivered newborns was similar to that of the vaginal microbiota of their mother in contrast meconium from newborns delivered by C-section was most similar to the maternal skin microbiota dominantly composed of Streptococcus spp.

It is possible that a more diverse gut microbiota is more efficient in improving the maturation of the immune system and reducing the risk of chronic immune disorders .A longitudinal study analyzing the gut microbiota of infants from birth to 7 years of age showed that those who became over- weight at 7 years harbored significantly fewer Bifidobacterium sp.

More longitudinal studies evaluating the development of the early gut microbiota and its impact on the development of obesity T1D and food allergy are necessary to confirm whether alterations in the microbiota's composition andor a delay in the colonization process precedes the development of these diseases.Postnatal Gut Dysbiosis Affects the Maturation of the infant's Mucosal immune SystemDecreased levels of intestinal Bacteroides spp.

Furthermore as breastfeeding also plays a key role in the establishment of the early gut microbiota following birth the following strategies should also be considered adequate support by trained midwifeslactation experts public health campaigns supportingencouraging breast- feeding restriction on formula hand-out at maternities and the fact that infants stay in their mother's hospital room overnight rather than in a separate nursery.The negative impacts of C-section on later health may be due to the delay in the postnatal establishment of the gut microbiota and subsequent alterations to the maturation of the mucosal immune system.

Although the link between these diseases and delivery mode remains controversial recent studies indicate that the establishment of the gut microbiota is delayed in infants born by C-section during the postnatal period i.e.

Interestingly these effects were more pronounced if this alteration occurred prior to weaning suggesting the presence of a critical period during which an altered gut microbiota can impact the host's health .It is generally accepted that the fetus grows and develops in a sterile environment within the uterus and that its passage through the birth canal during delivery is the baby's first exposure to microorganisms.
