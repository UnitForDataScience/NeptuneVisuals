In particular a Bayesian based method called Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA can be used in such inference There are limited ap- plications of the topic model in biological areas - and it is proven to achieve robust performance with tol- erance to common noise of samples which greatly exists in OTU assignment in metagenomics study So using the topic model to analyze metagenomics data could be an available way to decipher microbial community profiles.By using the topic model MetaTopics is developed to address the aforementioned questions we have raised by inferring the potential microbial community and bacteria interaction with both clustering and classification of the samples and identifying the influence of a latent sub- community on a certain disease status.Methods and implementationTopic model for metagenomics studyTopic model a type of statistical model is originally used in machine learning and natural language process- ing area for latent topics discovery in a particular set of documents The basic idea of this model is that it assumes that each topic consists of the highly correlated words and each document may contain several different topics with a certain probability distribution and the distribution of such potential topics can be inferred by given the set of documents together with their word fre- quency representations.

the topic model originally derived from text community mining The topic model is a computational framework which was originally designed to uncover the hidden thematic structure in document collections The basic idea of this model assumes that each topic consists of highly correlated words and each document contains several different topics with a certain probability distribution and the distribution of such potential topics can be in- ferred by a set of given documents together with their word frequency representations.

Finally 88 and 176 genera were retained for these two datasets re- spectively for the further analysis.Results analysisThe number of topics for the given samples was deter- mined in a data-driven way Perplexity and likelihood were used in MetaTopics for topic number identification By using 5-fold cross-validation 10 topics in oral data- set and 60 in gut dataset were determined using LDA algo- rithm coupled with Gibbs Sampling in MetaTopics As a result one matrix that consists of bacteria occur- ring probability distribution in each topic was visualized in Fig.

Designing computational models to in- vestigate the microbial community profile is a key step to recognize the microbial functions related to their host samples A common scenario in metagenomics study is to clus- ter or classify multiple samples represented by their OTU profiles based on 16S rRNA pyrosequencing.

How- ever normal unsupervised clustering or supervised clas- sification only provide the subdivisions of the samples but fail to decipher the latent microbial community structures their interactions as well as their correlation to specific disease status of such samples.

In addition considering the substantial needs in the analysis of the relationship between each sub-community and a certain disease sta- tus the Quetelet Index QI  is defined to estimatethe relative change of the observation frequency of a specific latent sub-community among all the samples compared to that among the samples with a certain dis- ease status Fig.

Before applying MetaTopics the bacteria which exist in very few samples as well asthe samples with very few bacteria taxons were filtered.

In the application of this model for text processing each document follows a probability dis- tribution over topics and each topic follows a probabil- ity distribution over words.
