The importance of serotonin from the immunological viewpoint is highlighted by the fact that lymphocytes monocytes macrophages and dendritic cells have multiple serotonin receptors 64.Apart from possessing a wide variety of serotonin receptors immune cells produce their own serotonin.

Receptors 5HT2 activate phosholipase C other types of receptors modulate adenylate cyclase activity and thereby change cAMP concentrations receptors 5HT1 4--7 3.3 5NT5A receptors inhibit and several other types of serotonin receptors activate the intracellular adenylate cyclase enzyme.In addition serotonin exerts a non-receptor effect called serotonylation on protein molecules by directly attaching to them.

The stimulatory effect of serotonin on microbial growth rate might be due to the presence of serotonin receptors on their surface that could also bind related compounds such as indole.Of relevance in this context are data on the inhibitory effect of compounds that suppress the re-uptake of serotonin by serotonin-releasing cells and thereby increase its extracellular concentration.

In contrast activating presynaptic serotonin and postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the brain inhibits the immune system 155.Microbial neuroactive peptides apart from affecting the immune system operation can modify animal and human behavior via their effects on the CNS.

The receptors activate the D1 and D5 receptors or conversely inhibit the D2-4 receptors the adenylate cyclase enzyme thereby increasing or decreasing the level of intracellular cyclic adenosinomonophosphate cAMP.

Acetylcholine stimulates the sensory perception of stimuli during the awakening process and regulates REM sleep that is associated with dreaming 109.The effects of acetylcholine are due to its binding to two types of receptors 52 i nicotine receptors that are responsible for tobacco addiction and ii muscarine receptors that bind muscarine contained in the fungus Amanita muscari each type includes several subtypes.

Nicotine receptors nAchRs that are coupled with ion channels for sodium potassium and calcium are subdivided into muscular receptors that are blocked by the poison curare and neuronal hexamethonium-blocked receptors.

The effects of serotonin are due to its binding to seven main receptor types that are called 5HT1--7 receptors 5HT1 include subtypes 5HT1A 5HT1B 5HT1C and 5HT1D receptors 5HT2 subtypes 5HT2A 5HT2B and 5HT2C 88.

Only receptors of the 5HT3 type are associated with ion channels while all other serotonin receptors are coupled with G proteins and act via secondary intracellular messengers.

The mAchR2 and mAchR4 receptors decrease the cAMP level by inhibiting the adenylate cyclase enzyme.Outside the CNS acetylcholine binds to the muscarine receptors of vascular endothelium resulting in releasing nitric oxide and vasodilation 110.Role of acetylcholine in the immune system.
