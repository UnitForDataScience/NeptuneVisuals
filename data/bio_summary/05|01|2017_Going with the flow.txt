at the time it was known that breast cancer was one of the most common cancers to me- tastasize to the brain and marchetti wanted to under- stand the mechanisms causing this outcome.applying a multi-parametric flow cytometry ap- proach marchetti's group uncovered ctcs in patients that were not expressing the common carcinoma epi- thelial cell adhesion molecule these are classified as epcam-negative cells and possessed a gene signa- ture important for brain cancer metastasis 3. further work revealed that these cells promoted breast cancer brain metastasis when injected in xenografts.marchetti suspected that most of the other com- mercially available approaches being used at the time to isolate and characterize ctcs would not have been able to capture specific ctc subpopulations found to be associated with brain cancer brain metastasis.we needed alternative methods to the established approaches for ctc enumeration such as cellsearch and we realized then that a flow cytometry workflow would provide the ideal solution here marchetti re- calls.spurred by their epcam-negative ctc capture marchetti's team became increasingly curious about the roles that other ctcs might be playing in breast cancer metastasis cells that he refers to as flying un- der the radar of detection for many technologies in the way that epcam-negative ctcs had previously.it's critical to note that ctcs are exceedingly rare in blood samples making their isolation that much more challenging.

as such identifying these cells and understanding their roles in metastatic onset could prove critical for detecting the presence of cancer as well as for monitoring disease progression in those patients being treated with specific therapies.in 2015 dario marchetti from the houston methodist research institute in texas and his colleagues reported on the use of flow cytometry to isolate ctc subsets pos- sessing properties related to breast cancer dormancy 2. the idea was to compare ctc populations from pa- tients with breast cancer metastasis to those without metastasis in an effort to identify difference in their cir- culating tumor cell profiles.

still even given the current color limits these latest advances in flow cytometry technology have made it possible for re- searchers to isolate and study very specific cell types and even subsets of cell populations to glean unique information on cell composition and abundance for fields as diverse as immunology and cancer research.singling out cellscirculating tumor cells ctcs are found in the blood- stream and have been implicated to play roles asseeds of fatal cancer metastasis.

add to this the fact that marchetti was now focused on further subdividing ctcs by tumor or- igin and proliferative capacity and it's clear he needed to develop a robust multi-parametric flow cytometry strategy for narrowing down any ctc associations with breast cancer brain metastasis.for his most recent study on breast cancer marchetti employed a multistep approach for hunting unique ctcs.

the next step according to marchetti will be to identify biomarkers associated with breast cancer ctcs that can be used in the detection and monitoring of cancer progression along with therapy decisions and evalua- tion of therapy efficacy.in many ways flow cytometry can be thought of as a re-emerging technology.

when all was done marchetti's team was able to use the data from their ctc isolation and characterization efforts to start dissecting apart the molecular pathways and mechanisms involved in ctc brain organ-homing and thus better understand breast cancer ctc characteristics in relation to brain metastasis onset i.e.
