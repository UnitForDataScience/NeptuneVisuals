The study of small molecules produced by the human microbiota and the identifi- cation of the host receptors that they interact with should help to define the relationship between bacteria and human physiology and provide a resource for the discovery of small-molecule therapeutics.We recently reported on the discovery of commendamide a human microbiota-encoded GPCR-active long-chain N-acyl amide that sug- gests a structural convergence between human signalling molecules and microbiota-encoded metabolites.

Animals and human research participantsPolicy information about studies involving animals when reporting animal research follow the ARRIVE guidelinesDescription of research animals Provide details on animals andor animal-derived materials used in the study.Policy information about studies involving human research participantsDescription of human research participants Describe the covariate-relevant population characteristics of the human research participants.

In all mouse models the observed correlation between hm-NAS gene induction and increased glucose tolerance is similar in magnitude to several studies with small-molecule GPR119 agonists including glyburide an FDA- approved therapeutic for diabetes.DiscussionOur characterization of human microbial N-acyl amides together with other investigations of the human microbiota suggests that host-microbial interactions may rely heavily on simple metabolites built from the same common lipids sugars and peptides that define many human signalling systems for example neurotransmitters7 s E p T E m b E R 2 0 1 7  V O L 5 4 9  N A T U R E  5 1 a 200de150100400400503000300b1501000.1 0.4 1.2 3.6 11 33 100Concentration uM Serinol C181Serinol C162001000306090Time min1202001000306090Time min12050f0NDARCQEGHILKMFPSTWYVN-Acyl amino acidsc864500400300200100gh6154102500030 60 90 120Time min2DMSOHO OHO NHHO OHO N HOHO N HHO OHO OTreatment ControlFigure 5  N-acyl serinols affect GLP-1 secretion in vitro and glucose homeostasis in vivo.

Reference genomes for 111 out of 143 hm-NAS genes were identified Supplementary Table 2.To determine the abundance of hm-NAS genes within microbiomes at specific human body sites hm-NAS genes were queried against HMP whole-metagenome shotgun-sequencing data on a per-body site basis .

The bacterial effectors that we have identified provide mechanistic insights into potential func- tions of the human microbiome and suggest that these GPCR-activesmall molecules and their associated microbial biosynthetic genes have the potential to regulate human physiology.Isolation of commensal N-acyl amidesTo identify N-acyl synthase NAS genes within human microbial genomes the Human Microbiome Project HMP sequence data was searched with BLASTN using 689 NAS genes associated with the N-acyl synthase protein family PFAM13444 ref.

Nonetheless 16S and metagenomic deep-sequencing studies link bacteria containing hm-NAS genes or hm-NAS genes themselves to specific locations in the gastrointestinal tract where the GPCRs of interest are expressed .Similarity of bacterial and human GPCR ligandsHuman microbiota-encoded N-acyl amides bear structural similarity to endogenous GPCR-active ligands .

The PFAM13444 sequences that aligned to a HMP gene expectation E 1 x 10-40 and 70 identity were identified and comprise the human microbial N-acyl synthase hm-NAS gene dataset 143 hm-NAS genes.

To determine the variability and distribution of hm-NAS genes that correspond to specific N-acyl amide families 1-6  in the human microbiome normalized read counts for each hm-NAS gene from each N-acyl amide family were plotted separately per body site as RPKM .

This set included all hm-NAS genes from clades sparsely populated with hm-NAS sequences and representative examples from clades heavily populated with hm-NAS sequences .Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry LC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate extracts derived from Escherichia coli cultures trans- formed with each construct revealed clone-specific peaks in 31 cultures.
