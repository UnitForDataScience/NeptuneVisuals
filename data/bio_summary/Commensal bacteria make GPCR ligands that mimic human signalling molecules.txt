in all mouse models the observed correlation between hm-nas gene induction and increased glucose tolerance is similar in magnitude to several studies with small-molecule gpr119 agonists including glyburide an fda- approved therapeutic for diabetes.discussionour characterization of human microbial n-acyl amides together with other investigations of the human microbiota suggests that host-microbial interactions may rely heavily on simple metabolites built from the same common lipids sugars and peptides that define many human signalling systems for example neurotransmitters7 s e p t e m b e r 2 0 1 7  v o l 5 4 9  n a t u r e  5 1 a 200de150100400400503000300b1501000.1 0.4 1.2 3.6 11 33 100concentration um serinol c181serinol c162001000306090time min1202001000306090time min12050f0ndarcqeghilkmfpstwyvn-acyl amino acidsc864500400300200100gh6154102500030 60 90 120time min2dmsoho oho nhho oho n hoho n hho oho otreatment controlfigure 5  n-acyl serinols affect glp-1 secretion in vitro and glucose homeostasis in vivo.

the study of small molecules produced by the human microbiota and the identifi- cation of the host receptors that they interact with should help to define the relationship between bacteria and human physiology and provide a resource for the discovery of small-molecule therapeutics.we recently reported on the discovery of commendamide a human microbiota-encoded gpcr-active long-chain n-acyl amide that sug- gests a structural convergence between human signalling molecules and microbiota-encoded metabolites.

the bacterial effectors that we have identified provide mechanistic insights into potential func- tions of the human microbiome and suggest that these gpcr-activesmall molecules and their associated microbial biosynthetic genes have the potential to regulate human physiology.isolation of commensal n-acyl amidesto identify n-acyl synthase nas genes within human microbial genomes the human microbiome project hmp sequence data was searched with blastn using 689 nas genes associated with the n-acyl synthase protein family pfam13444 ref.

it is not possible at this time to look for co-localization of gpcr and hm-nas gene expression in specific gastrointestinal niches as neither the hmp nor the human protein atlas are sufficiently comprehensive in their survey of human body sites.

reference genomes for 111 out of 143 hm-nas genes were identified supplementary table 2.to determine the abundance of hm-nas genes within microbiomes at specific human body sites hm-nas genes were queried against hmp whole-metagenome shotgun-sequencing data on a per-body site basis .

to determine the variability and distribution of hm-nas genes that correspond to specific n-acyl amide families 1-6  in the human microbiome normalized read counts for each hm-nas gene from each n-acyl amide family were plotted separately per body site as rpkm .

the normalized count of the reads aligned to each hm-nas gene or its highly similar gene from the hmp non-redundant gene set were scaled 0-1 and colour coded per body site and added as concentric rings around the phylogenetic tree .

for each genome the average per gene read density normalized for gene length was compared to the read density seen for the hm-nas gene.

with numerous possible combinations of amine head groups and acyl tails long-chain n-acyl amides represent a potentially large and functionally diverse class of microbiota-encoded gpcr-active signalling molecules.here we combined bioinformatic analysis of human microbiome sequencing data with targeted gene synthesis heterologous expression and high-throughput gpcr activity screening to identify gpcr-active n-acyl amides encoded by human microbiota.

as our mechanistic understanding of how human microbiota-encoded small molecules effect changes in host physiology grows the potential for using 'microbiome-biosynthetic gene therapy' to treat human disease by complementing small molecule deficiencies5 2  n a t u r e  v o l 5 4 9  7 s e p t e m b e r 2 0 1 7 in native host-microbial interactions with microbiota-derived bio- synthetic genes should increase accordingly.
