One was an in-house protocol targeting the V4-V5 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene whereas the other was targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene and strictly followed the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation guide.29 The V4-V5 library preparation and sequencing were performed at the University of Turku TurkuFinland whereas the V3-V4 library preparation and sequencing were performed at FISABIO Valencia Spain.

In V3-V4 sequencing the subsamples of each original specimen cluster well together despite the DNA extraction method C. In V4-V5 sequencing however some differences can be seen among the extraction methods D. In V3-V4 sequence analysis the rarefaction level was 8 766 reads per sample whereas in V4-V5 sequence analysis the rarefaction level was 15 593 reads per sample.and Lactococcus could only be detected with V4-V5 sequencing.DISCUSSIONThe rapid progression of the NGS methods has revolution- ized the microbiota research as the high-throughput protocols have become more cost effective and thus more readily available.8 9 Still to date surprisingly little attention has been drawn on the general quality control of the NGS- based approaches used in the growing field of human microbiota research even though it is a well-known fact that analysis methods in this study field are highly sensitive and thus prone to biases.

Furthermore semiautomated DNA extraction methods clearly appeared suitable for NGS procedures proposing that application of these methods could importantly reduce hands-on time and human errors without compromising the validity of results.KEY WORDS next-generation sequencing fecal samples sample preprocessing microbial diversityINTRODUCTIONThe human gastrointestinal tract harbors an extensively diverse microbial ecosystem that has an important role in the health and physiologic functions of the host.1 2 For instance gut microbes maintain gut barrier function take part in food digestion and regulate immune functions.2 3 Gut microbiota dysbiosis referring to an aberrant gut microbiota composi- tion has been linked to several diseases and disorders such as obesity diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease.4-6 There- fore the studying of taxonomic-level associations of gut microbiota with different diseases is currently of great interest and gut microbiota composition is an interesting potential future target for clinical diagnostics.7In the past decades molecular techniques targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene or other genetic markers have re- markably advanced the study of microbial communities.8 9 These methods have in a significant degree replaced theADDRESS CORRESPONDENCE TO Anniina Rintala Dept.

The average Shannon indices are significantly higher in the V3-V4 samples than in the V4-V5 samples C.the samples could be attributed to the 16S rDNA primers Table 5.In the bacterial phylum level QIIME reported statistically significant differences between the V3-V4 and V4-V5 sequencing in the abundance of the phyla Lentisphaerae Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Proteobacte- ria and Firmicutes FDR P  0.05 for all the average Lentisphaerae and Bacteroidetes abundances were higher with V4-V5 sequencing whereas the abundances of the other phyla were higher with V3-V4 sequencing.

Results of the V3-V4 sequencing are presented on the left A and C whereas results of the V4-V5 sequencing are presented on the right B and D. With both sequencing methods subsamples of original specimens 3 and 4 cluster together whereas subsamples of specimens 1 and 2 constitute individual clusters A and B.

Furthermore the phylum-level bacterial composition differed signifi- cantly among the subjects in both V3-V4 and V4-V5 sequencing Kruskal-Wallis P  0.01 for all.In the bacterial genus level statistically significant differences could be seen among the DNA extraction methods in the genera Dorea and Coprococcus Kruskal- Wallis FDR adjusted P  0.05 in V3-V4 sequencing Dorea was found more abundant with MP than with other methods Steel-Dwass P  0.05 for all and more abundant with MOB than with QIA and QIAF P  0.05 for both whereas Coprococcus was found more abundant with GXT than with MP and QIA P  0.05 for both.

When V3-V4 and V4-V5 sequencing results are combined each original specimen comprises 2 separate clusters A as the subsamples analyzed with different 16S rDNA sequencing methods clearly cluster separately B. Rarefaction level was 16 741 reads per sample.by using a combination of primers differing from each other in key positions defining bacterial strain specificity.

It is possible that variable copurification of eukaryotic DNA human fungal food or plant origin with different DNA extrac- tion methods has a more prominent effect on the whole- genome sequencing results than on the results from 16S rRNA gene-targeting-based methods.

The DNA concentrations of the extracts were measured fluorometri- cally with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA after which the DNAs were stored at 275degC until 16S rDNA library preparation.16S rRNA Gene SequencingThe microbial 16S rDNA profiles of the 40 DNA extracts were analyzed with 2 distinct MiSeq 16S rRNA gene- sequencing protocols Illumina.
