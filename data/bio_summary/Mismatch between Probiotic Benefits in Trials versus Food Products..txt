therefore strain-specific health benefits could not be inferred for these products.table 3. strains in probiotic food products and reported health effects in populations with a diagnosed non-communicable diseasecondition.manufacturerprobioticdosage testedhealth effects investigated in populations with a diseaseconditionpopulationstrainstraincombinationand product branddosage in food cfuservingin studies cfu dayantioxidant statusdigestive symptomsglycemicinflammationliver damageradiation induced diarrheaserum lipidstype ii diabeticspatients withbifidobacterium lactis bb12  lactobacillusyoplait's yoptimal lucerne's1 x 1096 108-1109x  o x  o x non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseacidophilusla-5organics 1 x 109x x females with irritable bowel syndromegynecological cancerbifidobacterium lactis dn-173 010lactobacillusdanone'sactivia92.5 x 109x patients undergoing radiation therapycasei dn 114-001danone'sdanactive1 x 10102.8 x 1010x x  beneficial effects observed o  studies have investigated this outcome and have found no significant effects   indicates that the research was funded by the dairy industry.

lastly certain benefits may only be found among specific strains of bacteria this includes neurological effects immunological effects endocrinological effects and the production of bioactives .therefore probiotic food products currently in the marketplace may have the potential to offer a variety of different health benefits depending on the specific species and strains of bacteria they contain.

meanwhile in canada products contain a general health claim such as promotes a healthy gut flora but could provide more specific benefits depending on the species and strains they contain .to date the majority of systematic reviews investigating probiotics have focused on the effects of different strains on a single health outcome or the effects of a single strain on different health outcomes.

however not all kefir products contained this dosage and diversity.discussionprobiotic food products in the canadian marketplace contained bacterial strains that were associated with a wide variety of health benefits ranging from enhanced immunity to improved glycemic control in diabetics suggesting that probiotic products could potentially offer health benefits that are not advertised on their labels.

this product may no longer be available in the marketplace note all cited references were deemed to be of high quality according to health canada's quality appraisal tool for intervention studies .table 4. additional probiotic products with undetermined health effects.a products whose specific health effects are undetermined because there is no research on the strainstrain combination in their specific food formatbacterial strains identified in the food database manufacturer and product brandfood typeprobiotic dosage cfu per serving lactobacillus acidohpilus bi-07irresistibles' life smartfrozen fruit and yogurt blendnot indicated lactobacillus acidophilus la-5breuggens yog active cerealcereal with yogurt flakes1 x 109bacillus coagulans gbi-30 6086shasha co's spelt ginger snapscookiesnot indicatedlactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356t lactobacillus helveticus atcc 10797 lactobacillus helveticus atcc 12046 lactobacillus helveticus atcc 15009t lactobacillus kefir atcc 35411t lactobacillus kefir atcc 8007 lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869t lactobacillus brevis atcc 13648lactobacillus kefirgranum lmg 15132t lactobacillus parakefir lmg 15133t lactobacillus kefiranofaciens atcc 43761t leuconostoc mesenteroides atcc 8293t leuconostoc mesenteroides lmg 14531 leuconostoc mesenteroides lmg 6909t leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides atcc 12291t lactococcus lactis subsp.

1-416-978-7235 m.r.l.received 10 february 2017 accepted 6 april 2017 published 19 april 2017abstract probiotic food products contain a variety of different bacterial strains and may offer different health effects.

two studies investigated the impact of these strains on blood lipids and found no effects despite the fact that one study tested a dosage that was lower than found in commercial products and the other tested a dosage that was higher .

all companies that listed species names without strains were contacted to inquire whether strain data could be disclosed.most products contained one or two different strains.

therefore with higher dosages or with trails substantiating the current dosage there is potential for the strains that are already in food products to provide more benefits to the consumer.currently there is only a small volume of literature investigating the health benefits of the probiotic strains used in the canadian food supply.

the objective was to document the prevalence and dosage of probiotic strains in the canadian food supply and to review the literature investigating these strains in order to understand what health benefits these products may offer.

however research has shown that in some cases strain mixtures can be more effective than single strains - as different strains that are targeted toward different ailments can be blended into one preparation enabling cultures to complement each other's health effects and produce synergistic benefits .

in the us products containing probiotics can state that they support the body or maintain general well-being for instance some products state help support your immune system or helps naturally regulate the digestive tract .

the packages were visually inspected and ingredient lists of the 15341 unique products collected in 2013 were searched to identify probiotic-containing products.

however many of the current probiotic dosages in products were lower than the dosages tested in randomized controlled trials.dosagein order to obtain many of the health benefits reported in the randomized controlled trials that were reviewed in this study consumers would need to eat anywhere from two to twenty-five servings of these products each day.
