Meanwhile in Canada products contain a general health claim such as promotes a healthy gut flora but could provide more specific benefits depending on the species and strains they contain .To date the majority of systematic reviews investigating probiotics have focused on the effects of different strains on a single health outcome or the effects of a single strain on different health outcomes.

Lastly certain benefits may only be found among specific strains of bacteria this includes neurological effects immunological effects endocrinological effects and the production of bioactives .Therefore probiotic food products currently in the marketplace may have the potential to offer a variety of different health benefits depending on the specific species and strains of bacteria they contain.

However research has shown that in some cases strain mixtures can be more effective than single strains - as different strains that are targeted toward different ailments can be blended into one preparation enabling cultures to complement each other's health effects and produce synergistic benefits .

All companies that listed species names without strains were contacted to inquire whether strain data could be disclosed.Most products contained one or two different strains.

Additionally since much of the current research was funded by the companies that sell probiotic products and therefore dictated which strains were studied there is a need for further research on a broader range of speciesstrains that is supported by alternate funding bodies.Despite the WHO's recommendation that genus species and strain should be designated on a product's label  nearly half of the brands in this study did not disclose strain information.

The objective was to document the prevalence and dosage of probiotic strains in the Canadian food supply and to review the literature investigating these strains in order to understand what health benefits these products may offer.

Therefore with higher dosages or with trails substantiating the current dosage there is potential for the strains that are already in food products to provide more benefits to the consumer.Currently there is only a small volume of literature investigating the health benefits of the probiotic strains used in the Canadian food supply.

Full-text screening was completed independently by two of the authors of this paper Mary Scourboutakos and Sarah Murphy with consensus required for inclusion or exclusion.Data ExtractionThe following information was extracted from each manuscript information related to the article complete citation plus author country and year of publication the probiotic species and strains tested strain dosage food format population characteristics e.g.
