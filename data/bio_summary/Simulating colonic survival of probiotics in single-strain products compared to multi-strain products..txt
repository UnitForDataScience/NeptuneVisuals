lactis Bl-04 levels were not different between B. lactis Bl-04 HOWARU Restore and L. acidophilus NCFM  B. lactis Bl-04 simulations p  0.05 nor were there differences in B. lactis Bi-07 levels for B. lactis Bi-07 and HOWARU Restore simulations p  0.05.In the supplementary material Figure S1 levels of the tested genus species and strain can be seen in the separate vessels of the respective probiotic com- bination simulations and the control.

A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.ResultsAll of the probiotic strains were detected at elevated levels 1-2 log10 above baseline in the simulation samples to which they had been fed while none of them could be detected above baseline in the simula- tions to which they had not been added .As seen in  when Lactobacillus was quan- tified at genus level an increase was detected for simulations with the HOWARU Restore product p  0.01 L. acidophilus NCFM p  0.02 and the combination of L. acidophilus NCFM  B. lactis Bl-04 p  0.02.

When L. acidophilus was quantified substantial increases were detected in the simulations with HOWARU Restore p  0.02 L. acidophilus NCFM p  0.02 and L. acidophilus NCFM  B. lactis Bl-04 p  0.02 com- pared to the control .

On the other hand quantification of B. lactis Bl-04 was asso- ciated with increased levels in simulations with HOWARU Restore B. lactis Bl-04 and L. acidophilus NCFM  B. lactis Bl-04 compared to the control p  0.05 .

Lactobacillus acidophilus levels were notdifferent for L. acidophilus NCFM HOWARU Restore and L. acidophilus NCFM  B. lactis Bl-04 simulations p  0.05.

acidophilus NCFM L. paracasei Lpc-37 B. lactis Bl-04 and B. lactis Bi-07 with simulations of strain combination products HOWARU Restore and L. acidophilus NCFM  B. lactis Bl-04 it is clear that the levels of single and combination products were not different.

Statistical differences between treatment and control p  0.01 p  0.02 p  0.05.not a target species for the primers used with the Lactobacillus spp.

Similarly quantifica- tion of L. paracasei was observed to lead to substantial increases in simulations with L. paracasei Lpc-37 p  0.03 and HOWARU Restore p  0.0002 compared to the control .

However the assay also indicated an increase in simulations with products containing B. lactis Bl-04 p  0.05 .
