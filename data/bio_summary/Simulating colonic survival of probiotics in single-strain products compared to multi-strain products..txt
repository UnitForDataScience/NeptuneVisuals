lactobacillus acidophilus levels were notdifferent for l. acidophilus ncfm howaru restore and l. acidophilus ncfm  b. lactis bl-04 simulations p  0.05. similarly l. paracasei levels were not different between l. paracasei lpc-37 and howaru restore simulations p  0.05. likewiseb.

a p-value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.resultsall of the probiotic strains were detected at elevated levels 1-2 log10 above baseline in the simulation samples to which they had been fed while none of them could be detected above baseline in the simula- tions to which they had not been added .as seen in  when lactobacillus was quan- tified at genus level an increase was detected for simulations with the howaru restore product p  0.01 l. acidophilus ncfm p  0.02 and the combination of l. acidophilus ncfm  b. lactis bl-04 p  0.02. lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37 inclusion was not observed to lead to an increase in lactobacilli p  0.05 this is due to the fact that l. paracasei ismicrobial ecology in health and disease3figure 1. microbial quantities presented as mean - sem for the pooled vessels v1-v4 from three separate colon simulations.
