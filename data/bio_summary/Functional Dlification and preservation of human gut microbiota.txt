PCA confirms the closer relationship of shorter pre- servation time 3 months with the initial point while only the mixed CPAs DGP were able to sustain a microbiota after 6 months in a similar way to after3 months near-confounded points with D3 .

After 3 and 6 months 3 months and 8 days6 months and 8 days for DP GP and DGP inocula these aliquots were used to inoculate the ECSIM model simulating the gut's environmental conditions .

Each probe signal with a sig- nal-to-noise ratio SNR above 20 was considered positive.Detection and quantification of methanogenic archaeaMethanogenic archaea were assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qPCR using the pri- mers described by Mihajlovski et al.

The results obtained in this study provide evidence that in vitro systems are a valuable means of fulfilling these objectives and that permeating and non- permeating CPAs coupled to cryopreservation can be cumulatively used to promote the viability of microbiota.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Marine Bertoni Amy Hesketh and Gabrielle Mathieux for their valuable technical help.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.FundingThis work was supported by two PhD scholarships one from the French Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur etde la Recherche to NG 2012-MESR and another from the European Union UEthe Auvergne Council to WT FEDER 2011-Auv PPC was funded by a grant from the Universite d'Auvergne UdA 2014-UdA.ORCIDJean-Francois Brugere 2331ReferencesKamada N Seo SU Chen GY et al.
