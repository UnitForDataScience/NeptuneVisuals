The analysis of the binding site of Cgr2 suggests that digoxin binds to the same active site as of the natural substrate fumarate although with lower affinity than the natural substrate fumarate predominantly because of the high number of hydrogen bonds formed by fumarate at the binding site.

Most of the residues present at the binding sites of digoxin and fumarate in Cgr2 remained the same throughout the simulation period and the number of hydrogen bonds and the residues involved in making those hydrogen bonds also show stability.The binding energy calculation for fumarate and digoxin to Cgr2 show that fumarate binds to Cgr2 with high affinity in comparison to digoxin in support of this fumarate also forms more number of hydrogen bonds with Cgr2 in comparison to digoxin.

The docking of Cgr2 with fumarate revealed that Asp349 Asn351 His353 Asn357 and Arg469 were involved in H-bonding and the other residues present in the vicinity of fumarate were Val350 Ile352 Asp354 Ser355 Ser356 Glu376 and Trp377 with the peripheral cut-off of 4 Aas depicted in Figure 2C.

The docking study performed on 1QO8 with fumarate which is a known substrate of flavocytochrome c fumarate reductase Leys et al.

The hydrogen bonds are shown as dash line interacting amino acids residues as stick model and fumarate is shown as ball and stick model.Docking of 1QO8 with fumarate.

The drug digoxin was found to bind Cgr2 at the same binding site as that of fumarate which is the proposed natural substrate.

The binding energy values obtained after pulling of digoxin and fumarate from Cgr2 along Z-axis using 35 and 38 windows were 17.75-2 Kcal mol-1 and 42.17 -2 Kcal mol-1 respectively as shown in Figure 4.DISCUSSIONGut microbes encode a vast reservoir of metabolic enzymes which can potentially modulate the efficacy and pharmacological properties of the orally administered drug molecules through their promiscuous activity.

The most appealinglogical strategy would be to provide a high concentration of fumarate a common and harmless metabolite along with digoxin which would lead to a preferential binding of the former at the binding site of Cgr2 and this may prevent the metabolism of digoxin.
