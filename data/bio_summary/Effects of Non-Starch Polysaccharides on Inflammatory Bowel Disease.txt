For patients with active forms of the diseases especially when ulcers occur diets with low easily fermentable NSPs are recommended which is referred to as a low FODMAP diet .Overall most studies showed that dietary NSPs were associated with beneficial effects of IBD patients and the association were not entirely consistent.

The oral administration of high purity of fucoidan significantly ameliorated colitis-associated symptoms and histological examination showed the obvious reduction of crypt architecture and goblet cells as well as the infiltration of immune cells and oedema.

The administration of A. sinensis polysaccharide AP significantly promoted the proliferation of total spleen cells macrophages and T cells.

Further investigating of the crosstalk between immune cells epithelial cells and gut microorganisms in addition to evaluating the effects of different kinds and different molecular weights of NSPs will lead to well-designed clinical intervention trials and eventually improve the treatment and prevention of IBD.Keywords non-starch polysaccharide NSP inflammatory bowel disease IBD intervention mechanism SCFAs gut microbiota immune system pro-inflammatory cytokinesIntroductionInflammatory bowel disease IBD is mainly characterized by intermittent inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract  which can be subdivided into ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn's disease CD and its incidence has increased considerably over the past few decades .

Further investigation of the crosstalk between the immune cells epithelial cells gut microorganisms and different kinds and molecular weight of NSPs will promote a deeper understanding of their mechanisms and will aid in the development of suitable intervention methods.

In their study they overlooked the difference of UC patients oat bran may be effective for patients with mild symptoms but it may be useless for patients with severe symptoms.

The mixed data may be related to different source of NSPs different molecular weight of NSPs different stages of IBD different dosages different genetic backgrounds etc.

Taking into account the anti-inflammatory immune stimulating prebiotical and healing properties of several of NSPs we think it is necessary to add certain amount of NSPs to the diet in the early stage of IBD and post-hospital IBD patients.

Through these means NSPs can alleviate the symptoms of IBD patients and further decrease the risk of colorectal cancer CRC -.Effects of NSPs on IBDOat Bran GlucanNon-starch polysaccharides were first introduced as a clinical treatment for human UC in 1978 by Davies  in which oat bran was applied.
