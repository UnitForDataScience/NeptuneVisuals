Therefore the current study was designed to assess the role of modulat- ing inflammatory cytokines among elderly patients with constipation by measuring the serum levels of interleukin 1 IL-1 interleukin 6 IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-a.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy design and settingThis is a case-control study performed on 100 partici- pants aged 65 years or higher 50 with constipation and 50 without constipation referred to the gastrointestinal clinic at Rasoul-e-Akram Teaching Hospital in Tehran.

The increase in the serum inflammatory cytokines may cor- relate with changes in the intestinal microbiota profile and consequently constipation.

The inflammatory response to this pathological condition can be mediated by alteration in intestinal microbiota condition.29Reviewing the literature showed no similar stud- ies to our survey with respect to the role of microbiota and stimulation of its secretory functions in relation to constipation.

All measurements were done using a Mindray ELISA reader instrument MR-96A model Germany.Statistical analysisAnalysis of data was performed using SPSS software230 The Role of Cytokines in Geriatric Constipation Table 1 Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects0.160.69n Number of participants SD Standard deviation MMSE Mini-mental State ExaminationTable 2 The mean serum levels of inflammatory modulating cytokines for age subgroups of the participantsversion 16.0.

These conversions may lead to changes in colon metabolic environment with important alterations in the concentration and secre- tory functions of the bowel.7 Some studies reported variations in the gut microbiota between healthy in- dividuals and patients with chronic constipation with increased Clostridia.8 This dysbiosis may be a factor that promotes constipation.

Also the age-related differences in the intestinal micro- biota and constipation was found by measuring the levels of TNF-a IL-1 and IL-6 in plasma samples of the two groups participants with and without constipation.

These changes may be in parallel and empowered by the changes in mucosal permeability and gastric acid secre- tion in the elderly.12Besides it has also been proposed that a close relation exists between the gut microbiota and immune homeo- stasis and the signals related to intestinal microbiota are critical for immune system development as well as im- munoregulation of the secretion of antimicrobial peptides chemokines and cytokines.13-15 However there is still controversy regarding the effect of changes in modulating inflammatory cytokines on constipation.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences with ethic code number1055954.ParticipantsIncluded subjects were old age patients age  65 years with and without functional constipation based on Rome III criteria.16Exclusion criteria were a history of autoimmune disor- ders connective tissue disease irritable bowel syndrome inflammatory bowel disease acute infections thyroid disorder diabetes mellitus cancer dementia Parkinson disease history of consuming antibiotics within the last 3 months history of receiving immunosuppressive and antidepressant drugs and calcium chanel blockers.

Finally Clarke and co-workers34 showed a significant correlation between IL-6 and immune activation pathways.34 It seems that the inflammatory pathways in constipation may be very similar to those explained in irritable bowel syndrome.
