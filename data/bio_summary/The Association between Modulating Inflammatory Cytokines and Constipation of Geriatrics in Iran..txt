thementioned mechanism can explain the close relation between alteration in cytokines secretion mediated by microbiota and inflammatory-based response in consti- pation.26 regarding the increased level of cytokines in inflammatory conditions macrophages produce various cytokines and growth factors as inflammatory reactions.

these changes may be in parallel and empowered by the changes in mucosal permeability and gastric acid secre- tion in the elderly.12besides it has also been proposed that a close relation exists between the gut microbiota and immune homeo- stasis and the signals related to intestinal microbiota are critical for immune system development as well as im- munoregulation of the secretion of antimicrobial peptides chemokines and cytokines.13-15 however there is still controversy regarding the effect of changes in modulating inflammatory cytokines on constipation.

it seems that the serum level of modulating inflammatory cytokines can be affected by the diversity and abundance in the gut microbiota.

also similar analysis of the intestinal mi- crobiota composition and the inflammatory markers demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines elevation in the peripheral blood correlates with modifications in the intestinal microbiota profile.16aging can also decrease the th1th2 ratio and enhance the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including il6 and tnf-a.

228 original article the association between modulating inflammatory cytokines and constipation of geriatrics in iranmarjan mokhtare1 rahele alimoradzadeh2 shahram agah3 hossein mirmiranpour4 niloofar khodabandehloo5 mokhtare et al.229colonic transit and intestinal microbiota so that an increase in transit time can lead to decrease in fecal bacterial capacity.6various studies have shown a reduction in bifido- bacteria and elevations in lactobacilli streptococci enterobacteriaceae and clostridia in the intestinal microflora of elderly people.

therefore the current study was designed to assess the role of modulat- ing inflammatory cytokines among elderly patients with constipation by measuring the serum levels of interleukin 1 il-1 interleukin 6 il-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf-a.materials and methodsstudy design and settingthis is a case-control study performed on 100 partici- pants aged 65 years or higher 50 with constipation and 50 without constipation referred to the gastrointestinal clinic at rasoul-e-akram teaching hospital in tehran.

the increase in the serum inflammatory cytokines may cor- relate with changes in the intestinal microbiota profile and consequently constipation.

however these mechanisms should be assessed further particularly regarding the level of gene expression and molecular medicine.conclusionthe present study demonstrared a significant associa- tion between the serum levels of inflammatory modulating cytokines and age-related constipation in iranian subjects.

it has been claimed that age-related atypically motivated immune response to the factors of intestinal microbiota triggers inflammatory process.16regulation of the inflammatory response to bacteria is affected by toll-like receptors tlrs.

these conversions may lead to changes in colon metabolic environment with important alterations in the concentration and secre- tory functions of the bowel.7 some studies reported variations in the gut microbiota between healthy in- dividuals and patients with chronic constipation with increased clostridia.8 this dysbiosis may be a factor that promotes constipation.

the role of diversity in microbial population and their abundance in gut must be evaluated in further studies.conflict of interestthe authors declare no conflict of interest related to this work.referenceso'toole pw jeffery ib.
