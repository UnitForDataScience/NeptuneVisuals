After a twelve month follow-up the patient remains asymptomatic without Clostridium difficile infection relapses or inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups.Fecal microbiota transplantation is relatively simple to perform well-tolerated safe and effective in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with ulcerative pancolitis as an alternative in case of antibiotic therapy failure.Key words Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.

Although some reports postulate that the coexistence with IBD may require repeated FMT to ensure successful CDI eradication 9 FMT seems to be an untargeted approach to modify the underlying dysbiosis present in IBD 17.In relation to IBD treatment the first cases of FMT transient success date back to 1989 5.

Coimbra PortugalABSTRACTThe use of fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and coexistent inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear.A 61-year-old man with ulcerative pancolitis was diagnosed with a third recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection previously treated with metronidazole vancomycin and fidaxomicin.

The role of Clostridium difficile in IBD pathogenesis as a cause or consequence isAuthor's contributions Marta Gravito-Soares and Elisa Gravito-Soares designed the report collected the patient data performed the fecal micro- biota transplantation and wrote the paper.

The response was excellent resulting in no relapse either of CDI or IBD during 18 months of follow-up.CASE REPORTWe report the case of a 61-year-old Caucasian male with ulcerative proctitis under topic 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy and a 40 pack-year smoking history and no fam- ily history of IBD.

The risk of IBD reactivation is still another worry since a case of transient flare-up of ulcerative colitis after FMT has been reported 11.In our case we performed a FMT to treat the third CDI recurrence and prevent new relapses in an IBD patient through a lower route combining colonoscopy and enema.

Recurrent Clostridium difficile infections The importance of the intestinal microbiota.

Nevertheless very few data about this procedure in recurrent CDI and concomi- tant IBD patients have been reported 6.We report a case of a patient with ulcerative pancoli- tis and three Clostridium difficile recurrences treated with FMT.

This group of patients including IBD patients has an increased risk of CDI and associated complications and this condition should be ruled out in all IBD hospitalized patients witha disease flare-up 2458.
