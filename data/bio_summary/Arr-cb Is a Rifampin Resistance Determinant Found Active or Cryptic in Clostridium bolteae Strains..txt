The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of arr-cb of C. bolteae to confer rifampin resistance.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSusceptibility of C. bolteae to rifampin.

The common region was disrupted 36 bp upstream of the initiation codon by a 107-bp sequence in 90A7 90A9 and 90B3 versus a 283-bp sequence in 90A5 90B7 90B8 and ATCC BAA613 .No DNA sequence related to genes involved in the mobilization or transfer was detected in the environment of arr-cb in the seven C. bolteae genomes analyzed except an ISL3 family insertion sequence integrated just downstream from arr-cb in strain 90A7.

The559-bp spacing sequence which contained a GC-rich stem-loop sequence TATCCGC CTTTGGCGGATA may be responsible for transcription attenuation.To quantify the influence of the two arr-cb regulatory regions specific mRNA for arr-cb was measured by quantitative reverse transcription qRT-PCR in 90A7 90B3 and 90A5.

Thus two independent mecha- nisms can make the probably intrinsic arr-cb gene of C. bolteae cryptic.KEYWORDS rifampin ADP-ribosyltransferase Clostridium bolteae antibiotic resistanceifampin belongs to the first-line drug treatment of tuberculosis leprosy and brucellosis.

C. bolteae 90A5 90A9 90B3 90B7 90B8 and ATCC BAA613 were very susceptible to rifampin MICs 0.006 ugml meanwhile 90A7 was resistant MIC 32 ugml .In silico analysis of rifampin resistance in C. bolteae.

The structure of Arr-ms in complex with rifampin has been determined and compared with that of other ADP-ribosyltransferases leading to identification of the residues contacting both NAD and rifampin .

Cloning of arr-cb from 90A7 in Escherichia coli combined with directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Arr-cb was functional but that a Q127R variant present in 90A9 and 90B3 was inac- tive.

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that arr-cb was silent in the four remaining strains because of defective transcription.

The arr-cb gene encoded a 137-amino-acid protein that displayed similarity to Arr-2 Arr-ms and Arr-sc 51 57 and 55 identity respectively .Four Arr-cb variants differing by a single amino acid change were detected among the seven C. bolteae strains .

Two features were found in the regulatory region of the arr-cb genes.
