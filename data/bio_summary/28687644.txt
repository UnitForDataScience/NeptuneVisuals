the results were used to identify mucin-specific pathways and provided indications for the hierarchal use of sugar sources reflecting the adaptation of a. muciniphila to a mucus-degrading lifestyle.the article includes content that first appeared in the dissertation of n. ottman  in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a ph.d. degree from wageningen university wageningen the netherlands.results and discussionwe have reconstructed a genome-scale constraint-based metabolic model of a. muciniphila based on the complete genome sequence that we previously reported .

moreover the production of eps appears to be induced by glucose and this is likely to be the case when a. muciniphila is no longer located in the protecting mucus layer but has a luminal location where other intestinal bacteria are competing for food-derived substrates such as glucose.of the 12 sulfatases found in the genome of a. muciniphila six were significantly upregulated under the mucin condition along with the sulfate transporter .

more insight on the adaption of a. muciniphila to glucose could be gained by further research on the functions of these proteins.the transcriptome and proteome data were also used to verify the metabolic model of a. muciniphila and its visualization .

nevertheless it remains to be explored what variations exist between a. muciniphila strains and to what extent these might help explain differences between humans in the acquisition and retention of these mucolytic strains in early life or following fecal microbiota transfer.in conclusion the transcriptome and proteome analyses together with the analysis of metabolic end products of a. muciniphila grown under different conditions allowed for the validation of the genome-based metabolic model the predicted pathways and the metabolic end products.

to further study the substrate utilization abilities of a. muciniphila we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model to test amino acid auxotrophy vitamin biosynthesis and sugar-degrading capacities.

the model-supported predictions were val- idated by in vitro experiments which showed a. muciniphila to be able to utilize the mucin-derived monosaccharides fucose galactose and n-acetylglucosamine.

an analysis of whole-transcriptome se- quencing rna-seq comparing the gene expression of a. muciniphila grown on mu- cin with that of the same bacterium grown on glucose confirmed the activity of the genes involved in mucin degradation and revealed most of these to be upregulated in the presence of mucin.

the transcriptional response was confirmed by a pro- teome analysis altogether revealing a hierarchy in the use of sugars and reflecting the adaptation of a. muciniphila to the mucosal environment.

in conclusion these findings provide molecular insights into the lifestyle of a. muciniphila and further confirm its role as a mucin specialist in the gut.importance akkermansia muciniphila is among the most abundant mucosal bacte- ria in humans and in a wide range of other animals.

recently a. muciniphila has at- tracted considerable attention because of its capacity to protect against diet- induced obesity in mouse models.

however the physiology of a. muciniphila has not been studied in detail.

the results provide detailed mo- lecular insight into the mucus-degrading lifestyle of a. muciniphila and further con- firm the role of this mucin specialist in producing propionate and acetate under conditions of the intestinal tract.keywords akkermansia acetate gut microbiota metabolic modeling mucin propionate proteomics transcriptomicsseptember 2017 volume 83 issue 18 e01014-17applied and environmental microbiology 1icrobial community composition and activity in the human intestinal tract are largely dependent on the nutrition sources accessible to the gut microbiota .the availability of diet-derived nutrients changes according to the diet of the host whereas host-derived nutrients such as mucin are constantly available.
