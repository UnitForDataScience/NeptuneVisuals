The 332 SEED functions either have higher abundance in high exposure group and positively correlated with arsenic level in high exposure group or have lower abundance in high exposure group and negatively correlated with arsenic level in high exposure group Fisher combined FDR 0.1.

We examined the association between arsenic exposure from drinking water and the composition of intestinal microbiota in children exposed to low and high arsenic levels during prenatal development and early life.Results16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that children with high arsenic exposure had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria in their stool compared to matched controls with low arsenic exposure.

It was not possible to combining both groups due to the strong underly- ing biomodal distribution in arsenic exposure which was a feature of the recruitment strategy and resulted in heteroscedasticity.Microbial taxonomic composition in high arsenic exposure group and low arsenic exposure group based on 16S rRNA V4 gene region sequencing.

We are interested in bacterial genes that were either 1. enriched in the high arsenic exposure group and positively correlated with arsenic concentration in drink- ing water or 2. had lower abundance in high exposure group and negatively correlated with arsenic level in high exposure group.

Taxonomy assign- ment of the genome revealed that the genome was assigned to E.coli 90 of the ORFs in the genomes were assigned to species E.coli.These results suggest that E. coli is the genome that contributed to the SEED functions enriched among the high arsenic exposure group.These data are consistent with our previous taxonomy analysis  and indicate that E.coli in the Enterobacteriacea family was associated with children exposed to high arsenic exposure during the perinatal and prenatal period compared to matched controls who were exposed to low arsenic exposure during this same developmental window.

A Heatmap showing fold change of 901 different abundant SEED functions between high exposure versus low exposure group and correlation coefficients Spearman with arsenic levels in high exposure group for 332 SEED functions.

Through blastn search against NCBI nucleotide database the two contigs 44.fastq163C75111 and 27.fastq131C431936 that harbor those two different arsenic resistance operons were assigned to E.coli strains FHI98 gi675817476 embLM997367.1 and ST2747 gi595597955gbCP007392.1 respectively 99 sequence identity covering 100 contig sequences  .Finally we conducted an ecological analysis where we compared the two E.coli strain con- tigs found in the Bangladeshi children from both high exposure and low exposure groups with the contigs in the gut microbiome from a European cohort  that does not experience the same level of arsenic exposure as Bangladesh.

We observed that the expression of these two operons was higher among the children with high arsenic exposure compared to matched controls.the study collection analysis interpretation of data or writing the manuscript.Competing interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.Abbreviations MetaHIT Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract FDR False discovery rate KEGG Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes MGS metagenomic species ORFs Open Reading Frames OTU operational taxonomic units PICRUSt Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States MEGAN 4 MEtaGenome Analyzer CARD The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database QIIME Quantitative insights into microbial ecology SOAP Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package.ConclusionsThis preliminary study indicates that arsenic exposure early in life was associated with altered gut microbiota in Bangladeshi children.

Since the gut is colonized imme- diately after birth  it is important to understand the potential for arsenic exposure to affect children's gut microbiota using measures of arsenic exposure near the time of delivery.

We hypothesize that the composition of intestinal microbiota would be different in children who had high arsenic exposure during the perinatal and prenatal period compared to children matched by age sex and residence that had low arsenic exposure at this same developmental time point.ResultsThe mean drinking water arsenic concentration for the high and low exposed groups was218.8 mgL Standard deviation SD 166.1 mgL and 1.7 mgL SD 1.9 mgL respectively.
