reported that gut microbiota regulate host sertotonin biosythesis sev- eral exogenous factors including specific dietary compo- nents and microbiota alter serotonin release however it is not currently known whether the seroto- nergic pathway is altered by the microbiota in infants and thus may be a potential pathway influencing gut immune system development and function.previously we demonstrated that neonatal pigs fed for- mula differed from sow-fed piglets in small intestine morphology and had decreased lymphoid follicle size and germinal centers in peyer's patch and ileum tissue .

to determine the diet contribution to sero- tonin levels observed we measured serotonin in diet samples and noted that soy and milk groups have signifi- cantly more serotonin than sow diet fig.

herein we explore the effects of formula on the colon microbiota and the impact on colon morphology and im- mune response as well as metabolites involved in the serotonin pathway and serotonin metabolism in the colon.methodsanimal housing and feedingthirty-six yorkshireduroc crossbreed piglets 2 days old n  6groupgender were used in this study.

moreover 5hiaa a catabolic product of serotonin level was not altered in distal colon contents and urine and undetectable in serum ruling out the possibility of low serotonin due to increased catabolism of serotonin into 5hiaa in formula-fed piglets.

complementary to human infant studies formula-fed piglets compared to sow-fed piglets differed significantly in diarrhea fre- quency levels of mucosal igg and il-2 lactic acid bac- teriae.coli ratio and counts of colonic clostridium cluster iv and bacteroides vulgatus all of which are consisent with microbiota differences found between hu- man infants fed breast milk or formula.

additional file table s2.predictive functional profiling of neonatal diet driven microbiotaas microbiota shift did not appear to impact the colon morphology or colon membrane protein expression we assessed the functional significance of the microbiota using picrust.

furthermore in serum no significant differ- ences were observed among groups in iaa levels while in urine lower levels of iaa were observed in soy and milk- fed relative to sow-fed piglets additional file figure s4f.discussionthe gut microbiota plays an important role in health and development of infants and diet may be the most import- ant environmental factor on gut bacterial composition.

bacterial diversity can impact the host immune system for example in the pri- mate model  dam-reared rhesus macaques had a dis- tinct colonic microbiota compared to those bottle-fed and disparate immune systems were observed even after weaning from neonatal diet suggesting that initial micro- bial colonization impacts immune system.previously in small intestine we observed a significant morphological changes in formula-fed piglets along with an increased expression of cytokines and decreased ex- pression of anti-inflammatory molecule il-10 mrna and protein.

in addition how tryptamine may differ from serotonin in the activation of cellular signaling pathways and the kyneurine pathway another tryptophan pathway and how this activation im- pacts in these piglets needs further investigation.conclusionsin summary we studied the microbiota composition in dis- tal colon and focused on aromatic amino acid metabolism tryptophan.

of relevance to these results are findings that an exclusively breastfed infants at 3 months of age but notexclusively formula-fed infants showed down-regulation of genes such as klrf1 bpl1 alox5 il-1a and aoc3 that prime mucosal inflammatory responses overall data suggests that formula diet impacts immune response relative to breastfeeding.the microbiota fuctional prediction analyses showed sev- eral pathways that differed significantly between the diet groups.

if reca- pitulates in human infants these early changes in gi and immune system development due to formula feeding could have long-term health consequences.limitationsmany factors other than diet can contribute to the devel- opment of gut microbiota composition such as housing environment maternal proximity pens and mother's diet.

no significant differences in 5-htp and 5hiaa levels were observed among diet groups in distal colon contents additional file figure s4b-d. in addition increased tryptophan and 5htp levels were noted in serum and urine of soy and milk groups add- itional file figure s4b-d suggesting a diet effect in these piglets.

thus to understand tryptophan fate in the distal colon we looked at the serotonin pathway and observed significantly lower levels of serotonin in colon tis- sue of formula-fed piglets.
