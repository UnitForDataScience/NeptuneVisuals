Complementary to human infant studies formula-fed piglets compared to sow-fed piglets differed significantly in diarrhea fre- quency levels of mucosal IgG and IL-2 lactic acid bac- teriaE.coli ratio and counts of colonic Clostridium cluster IV and Bacteroides vulgatus all of which are consisent with microbiota differences found between hu- man infants fed breast milk or formula.

reported that gut microbiota regulate host sertotonin biosythesis Sev- eral exogenous factors including specific dietary compo- nents and microbiota alter serotonin release However it is not currently known whether the seroto- nergic pathway is altered by the microbiota in infants and thus may be a potential pathway influencing gut immune system development and function.Previously we demonstrated that neonatal pigs fed for- mula differed from sow-fed piglets in small intestine morphology and had decreased lymphoid follicle size and germinal centers in Peyer's patch and ileum tissue .

Herein we explore the effects of formula on the colon microbiota and the impact on colon morphology and im- mune response as well as metabolites involved in the serotonin pathway and serotonin metabolism in the colon.MethodsAnimal housing and feedingThirty-six YorkshireDuroc crossbreed piglets 2 days old n  6groupgender were used in this study.

In brief piglets were randomized into three groups i.e.

These piglets were anesthetized with isoflurane blood was collected and then sacrificed by exsanguination.

The data were normalized with total protein and tissue weight.Serotonin metabolites measurementsThe presence and relative abundance of serotonin me- tabolites in serum urine and colon contents of neonatal piglets was determined using an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography UHPLC system coupled to a high-resolution accurate mass spectrometer HRAM.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling NMDS plots of b-diversity revealed no dietary difference at the phylum level however a significant diet effect was observed at the genus level with sow-fed animals discrimi- nated from soy- or milk-fed piglets Fig.

At the phylum level a total of 16 phyla were found in sow-fed but not in soy- or milk-fed piglets Fig.
