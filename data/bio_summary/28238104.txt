Subtilisin was active at nanomolar concentra- tions on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and both subtilisin and chymotrypsin were active on SH-SY5Y cells CaCo-2 human colorectal cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA- MB-231 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells as well as on freshly isolated tissue in which the levels of DCC are much higher than in cancer-derived cell lines.

Increases in the virulence of H. pylori induced by iron deficiency and high- salt consumption produce corresponding increases in can- cer susceptibility.Within the stomach H. pylori cells become adherent to the gastric epithelial cells where they avoid immuno- logical detection and suppress host defence mechanisms locally and then proceed to invade the gastric mucosa.

The mutant cells exhibited corresponding differences in the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 MMP-3 with increased2631expression of the EMT markers Snail ZEB1 and vimentin as well as the stem cell marker CD44 .TGF-b is an important regulator of tissue inflammation but H. pylori Caga-positive cells inhibited TGF-b func- tion via an interaction between Caga and Smad3 .

The Caga pro- tein is exported from the bacterial cells as well as infected gastric epithelial cells in the exosomes thus gaining wide distribution via the vascular circulation and potentially pro- moting carcinogenesis in a range of systemic tissues.Cytolethal distending toxin CDTSome Gram-negative bacteria including species of Heli- cobacter especially those which target the liver such asH.

Cer- tainly the chronic treatment of cells with CDT generates phenotypic changes characteristic of precancerous cells with an increased frequency of mutation chromosomal changes with enhanced genomic instability p38MAPK activation and an increased ability to show anchorage- independent proliferation.
