The corollary of this is that solid emptying is preceded by a lag phase where no emptying occurs followed by linear postlag emptying.

These effects are likely to have resulted from the effect of vagal blockade on weight loss.GASTRIC EMPTYING AND INTERACTION WITH GLYCEMIAThe rate of gastric emptying is subject to modulation by several circulating factors--blood glucose concentrations alter gastric emptying hyperglycemia delays gastric empty- ing while hypoglycemia accelerates gastric emptying.

Table 1 shows a summary of dietary fiber effects on gastric emptying sati- ety glucose homeostasis intestinal hormones and body weight regulation 6.The effect of volume of ingesta on postprandial satietyseems to be greater than that of calories ingested and indeed a gastric balloon inflated to 400-800 mL rapidly induces satiety without altering gastric emptying.

The rate of liquid emptying differs significantly from that of solids and is much more rapid--the emptying half-time time taken to empty 50 being of the order of 20 min as opposed to 120 min 14 Fig.

The final observation to make is that liquid emptying is not completely passive and the emptying rate is decreased by increasing caloric content suggesting an active ability to regulate caloric delivery that is not entirely dependent on particle size and the ability to pass through the pylorus 10.Figure 1--GLP-1 increases gastric fasting and postprandial volume.

However the volume consistency and fat content will affect empty- ing rate so that large fatty meals may empty over periods longer than 4 h. Gastric emptying rather than gastric ac- commodation appears to be the major gastric function de- termining postprandial satiation and satiety.Bilateral truncal vagotomy previously used to treat peptic ulcer results in delayed gastric emptying early satiety and weight loss 18.

While gastric emptying is probably the most significant compo- nent other factors need to be considered.

The systemic rate of appearance of ingested nutrients is largely determined by the rate of delivery of nutrients to the proximal small intestine through the rate of gastric emptying.

While gastric emptying is arguably the most sig- nificant of the myriad processes occurring within the gas- trointestinal tract many other factors are either overlooked or misunderstood.

In summary insoluble fibers demonstrate the strongest associations with decreased risk of diabetes whereas soluble dietary fiber exerts physiological effects on the stomach and small intestine that modulate postprandial glycemic responses through delayed gastric emptying modification of gastrointes- tinal myoelectrical activity and delaying small bowel transit reduced glucose diffusion through the unstirred water layer and reduced accessibility of a-amylase to its substrates due to increased viscosity of gut contents 6.
