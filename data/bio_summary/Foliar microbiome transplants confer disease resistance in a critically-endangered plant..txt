OTUs that were significantly correlated with low-disease samples were then tested as predictors of N. galeopsidis relative abundance and disease severity in a generalized linear model with a binomial family and logistic link function.RESULTSDisease progression and treatment effectivenessThe fungal isolate slurry treatment did not reduce disease severity in either plant species during either experimental round whereas the wild leaf slurry reduced disease severity inP.

The additional control round performed only with P. kaalaensis demonstrated that removing biota from the wild leaf slurry with a 0.2 um filter eliminated the beneficial effects with the unfiltered slurry showing significantly less disease severity than the filtered slurry Binomial GLM P  0.0034.BioinformaticsThe sequencing run returned 2273484 raw forward and reverse reads for analyses.

The low-tech method of spraying plants with a slurry of leaves from healthy wild relatives containing many unculturedunculturable fungal taxa outperformed inoculations of fungal isolates suggesting that biodiversity was important for the functional relevance of the inoculated microbes.The leaf slurry treatment reduced disease severity in plants despite that the very pathogen we were trying to mitigate dominated the sequencing library.

At the conclusion of both experimental rounds we performed a final control round consisting of two treatments a leaf slurry and a leaf slurry filtered through 0.2 um to remove fungi and bacteria to confirm that observed effects were attributable to biota and not to phytochemicals present in the leaf slurry.

We hypothesized that re-establishing endophyte communities within foliar tissues would increase disease resistance and improve out-planting success.We conducted experimental inoculations of fungi obtained from related healthy wild plants in the previous home range of P. kaalaensis and show that pathogen resistance can be conferred by establishing beneficial communities of endophytes in aboveground plant tissues in order to improve endangered plant survival in the wild.METHODSExperimental design and overviewThe experiment tested the disease modification properties of fungal endophyte isolates and uncultured fungi from a slurry of surface-sterilized leaves obtained from wild healthy relative Phyllostegia hirsuta.

Individuals receiving traditionally isolated fungal treatments showed no improvement but those receiving applications of a simple leaf slurry containing an uncultured fungal community showed significant disease reduction to which we partially attribute an increase in the mycoparasitic Pseudozyma aphidis.

Only 18 individuals per species were available at a time so we selected three treatments a slurry of leaves from wild Phyllostegia hirsuta containing uncultivated fungi a slurry of spores from eleven cultured endophyte isolates representing a readily-cultivable subset of the leaf slurry fungi and a sterile water control.We exposed all plants to the N. galeopsidis pathogen and disease severity was observed until plant mortality.

This was surprising given that the P. hirsuta individuals donating to this slurry showed no signs of powdery mildew infection and considering that the wild leaf slurry was the treatment shown to reduce N. galeopsidis disease severity.

galeopsidis arrived in Hawai'i or whether it came with the original ancestor to modernPhyllostegia species.The relative abundance of the mycoparasitic fungus P. aphidis is a plausible explanation for the decrease in disease severity since P. aphidis has previously been shown to beantagonistic against powdery mildews   and to reduce the incidence of plant disease .

those associated with reduced disease severity with the indicspecies R package  on samples grouped by quartile values into bins of disease coverage measured as percent of leaf surface area infected.
