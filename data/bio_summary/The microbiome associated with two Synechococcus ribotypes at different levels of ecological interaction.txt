considering bacteria associated with mw101c3 poterioochromonas caused a strong reduction of bacte- ria affiliated with alkanindiges 178 times reduced in mw101c3p compared to mw101c3 only fol- lowed by hydrogenophaga which were only two times less table s2.

3. permutational multivari- ate analysis of variance suggested that predation was not the main cause of the changes occurring within the communities since it explained only 18 of the variance table 3. the presence of ll was the main factor shaping the beta-diversity of the bacte- rial community 41 while mw101c3 explained only 9 table 3. thus a competitive advantage of the bacteria associated with ll over those associ- ated with mw101c3 seemed to be evident.a different composition of the microbiome associ- ated to synechococcus strains was likely indicating ribotype-dependent functional interplay between the components within the community.

in this study we experimentally promoted different levels of ecological interaction by mixing two synechococcus ribotypes mw101c3 and ll and their associated bacteria with and without a nanoflagellate grazer poterioochromonas sp.

the synechococcus-asso- ciated bacteria were affiliated with gammapro- teobacteria alkanindiges and pseudomonas and flavobacteria flavobacterium in mw101c3 culturestable 2. differences in alpha-diversity chao i depending on the level of complexity of the system where 1 is single culture 2 is either co-culture or under predation and 3 is co-culture and under predation.

bacteria associated with mw101c3 in the single cul- tures were inefficiently grazed.

interestingly whereas pseudomonas related bacteria were not affected by predation in mw101c3 the ll associated pseudomonas were reduced 700 times under predation.
