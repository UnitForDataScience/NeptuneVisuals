In this study we experimentally promoted different levels of ecological interaction by mixing two Synechococcus ribotypes MW101C3 and LL and their associated bacteria with and without a nanoflagellate grazer Poterioochromonas sp.

Cell abundance of Synechococcus ribotypes MW101C3 and LL Syn non-pigmented associated bacteria bacte- ria 105 events mL-1 SD and Poterioochromonas sp.

Interestingly whereas Pseudomonas related bacteria were not affected by predation in MW101C3 the LL associated Pseudomonas were reduced 700 times under predation.

Thus a competitive advantage of the bacteria associated with LL over those associ- ated with MW101C3 seemed to be evident.A different composition of the microbiome associ- ated to Synechococcus strains was likely indicating ribotype-dependent functional interplay between the components within the community.

The different pigment composition of cells belonging to MW101C3 and LL generate specific patterns of autoflorescence red signals in the dot plots of channels FL4 67525 nm vs FL3 670 nm thus allowing for their identification discrimination and cell counting also when they were mixed together in the co-cul- tures Callieri et al.

The presence of LL was the main factor shaping the beta-diversity of the bacte- rial community 41 while MW101C3 explained only 9 Table 3.
