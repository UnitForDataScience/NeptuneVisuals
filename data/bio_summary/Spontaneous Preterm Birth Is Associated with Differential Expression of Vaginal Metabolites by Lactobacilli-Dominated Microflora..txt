Longitudinal analysis of the vaginal microflora in pregnancy suggests that L. crispatus promotes the stability of the normal vaginal microflora and that L. gasseri andor L. iners are more conducive to the occurrence of abnormal vaginal microflora.

Using this division system we observed that among all the samples combined CSTIII L. iners 41.14 was the most abundant followed by CSTI L. crispatus 29.75 CSTII L. gasseri 12.66 CSTV L. jensenii 12.02 CSTIIIV L. iners and L. jensenii 1.9 Streptococcus anginosus 1.26 CST Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Lactobacillus helveticus 1.33 and CSTIV mixed anaerobes 0.63.

Overall using both statistical methods there appears to be a link between CSTI--L. crispatus and L. gasseri and health.Relationship between CST and Vaginal pHIt is well-established that vaginal pH varies in relation to health with a pH of 3-4.5 considered a signature of a healthy vaginal environment and variations upwards a sign of an imbalanced vaginal environment e.g.

In parallel we also set out to assess the metabolite profile and vaginal fluid pH of these patients in the same samples.Collection of SamplesFollowing written informed consent clinical research staff obtained two high vaginal swab HVS samples from the posterior vaginal fornix with dry polystyrene Dacron swabsDeltalab Eurotubo 300263 Fisher Scientific UK from each woman after the passage of a sterile vaginal Cusco's speculum.

2015 the samples from our study population fell into the described CSTs with the highest abundance of CSTIII L. iners 41.14 and CSTI L. crispatus 29.75.Our findings suggest that L. crispatus and potentially L. gasseri might be associated with pregnancies that progress to term and may be health promoting although we acknowledge that larger sample sizes would ideally be needed based on the data gathered here.

In addition a third HVS was sent for routine clinical microbiological culture and sensitivity tests for BV and urinary tract infections.During vaginal fluid sample collection the vaginal pH was also determined from a sample of vaginal discharge obtained by a dry swab which was then smeared on a narrow range pH paper Ph-Fix Macherey-Nagel.DNA ExtractionSwabs were rinsed in 400 ul of PBS Sigma and underwent vortex mixing for 5 min.

Information on L. gasseri is more limited and its potential role in the vaginal microbiota in relation to PTB is unclear at present with suggestions that it is more prevalent in White populations and associated with a more diverse vaginal microbiota Verstraelen et al.

A potential mechanism for this difference might be the increase in lactate in samples dominated by CSTI Figure 6 consistent with several studies indicating that L. crispatus may decrease vaginal pH in vivo by producing high amounts of lactate from glycogen deposits in the vaginal ecosystem Linhares et al.

It is envisaged that in subsequent studies of sufficiently- powered larger sample sizes we will explore our observations in unselected populations of women including those deemed to be at low risk of PTB.In conclusion our data present a picture of the vaginal microbiota that tentatively agrees with the potentially beneficial presence of an L. crispatusgasseri-dominated microbiota CSTIII over other lactobacilli particularly the potentially detrimental L. jensenii CSTV.
