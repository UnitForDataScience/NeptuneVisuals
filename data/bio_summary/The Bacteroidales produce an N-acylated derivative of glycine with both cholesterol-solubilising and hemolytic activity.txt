there is a significant increase in SEAP expression when the CFS from E. coli cultures expressing choA is added to the cell line compared to the CFS of E. coli cultures carrying the pTRC99a vector thus confirming the link between choA and NF-kB activation see Fig.

The gene responsible for halo production on LBC agar named choA was identified as an N-acyltransferase known to produce an acylated glycine molecule called commendamide.

The mutated choA genes were cloned into pTRC99a and expressed in EPI300 cells and plated on LBC agar.

E. coli EPI300 expressing different orthologues of choA were grown on LBC agar at 37 degC for 48 h. An orthologue was scored positive for commendamide production if there was a halo of any size observed around the colony.

B Activity of EPI300 cells expressing choA and mutantderivatives on LBC agar plates.

We also show that commendamide is responsible for the previously described hemolytic activity associated with the choA orthologue in Bacteroides fragilis.
