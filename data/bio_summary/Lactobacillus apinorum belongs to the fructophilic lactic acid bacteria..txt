These data clearly indicated that L. apinorum is the second fructophilic species within the genus Lactobacillus.Key words fructophilic lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus apinorum honeybees genomics reductive evolutionFructophilic lactic acid bacteria FLAB differ from other lactic acid bacteria LAB in that they prefer d-fructose over d-glucose as a growth substrate Growth on d-glucose is usually poor but is dramatically enhanced in the presence of external electron acceptors such as pyruvate oxygen and d-fructose 1 2.

Until now Lactobacillus kunkeei has been the only obligate FLAB species reported in the genus Lactobacillus 1 5.Lactobacillus apinorum was originally isolated from the honey stomach of Apis mellifera The species is phylogenetically closely related to L. kunkeei as evident from the 98.9 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity they share.

These characteristics are identical to those recorded for L. kunkeei and Fructobacillus spp.

Growth characteristics of Lactobacillus apinorum JCM 30765T on glucose circle on fructose square on glucose in the presence of pyruvate triangle and on glucose under aerobic conditions cross.of NADH to NAD when LAB are grown in the presence of oxygen was also determined.

The functional gene content profiles indicated that L. apinorum possesses genomic characteristics similar to those recorded for L. kunkeei and Fructobacillus spp.

The species shares the same habitats as L. kunkeei and Fructobacillus and fructose- rich environments would thus lead fructophilic evolution to inhabitant LAB as suggested in a previous study AcknowLedgemenTsWe are grateful to Ms. Yuna Kanatani Department of Food and Cosmetic Science Tokyo University of Agriculture for her technical assistance in the study of enzyme activities.

Genomic characterization of a fructophilic bee symbiont Lactobacillus kunkeei reveals its niche-specific adaptation.
