FMT for infantile AC treatmentplantation FMT treatment on allergic colitis AC and gut microbiota GM.METHODSWe selected a total of 19 AC infants who suffered from severe diarrheahematochezia did not relieve completely after routine therapy or cannot adhere to the therapy and were free from organ congenital malformations and other contraindications for FMT.

Stools were collected from ten AC infants before and after FMT and GM composition was assessed for infants and donors using 16S rDNA sequencing analysis.RESULTSAfter FMT treatment AC symptoms in 17 infants were relieved within 2 d and no relapse was observed in the next 15 mo.

At the genus level Bacteroides n  6 Escherichia n  8 and Lactobacillus n  4 were enriched in some AC infants after FMT treatment but the relative abundances of Clostridium n  5 Veillonella n  7 Streptococcus n 6 and Klebsiella n  8 decreased dramatically.CONCLUSIONFMT is a safe and effective method for treating pe- diatric patients with AC and restoring GM balance.Key words Pediatric Infantile allergic colitis Fecal microbiota transplantation Gut microbiota Immune reactionc The Authors 2017.

Baldassarre et al8 used probiotics to treat AC infants and found that Lactobacillus GG may relieve symptoms of AC by altering GM composition8.

However to our knowledge FMT has not been used to treat AC infants.Thus we assessed 19 AC infants with severe he- matochezia andor diarrhea who had not acquired complete remission after 2 wk of routine therapy or because the guardians cannot adhere to the routine therapy thoroughly.

The colonoscopic inspection of four AC infants was included in Figure 1.FMT safety and efficacyInfants experienced low-quality sleep and weight loss since the onset of AC but no one was malnourished.

Although the results favor the application of FMT for AC treatment it is still important to clarify whether AC symptoms can be improved in our future studies with larger sample size.

FMT for infantile AC treatmentResearch backgroundAllergic colitis AC which is characterized as hematochezia and severe diarrhea is caused by an intense allergic reaction of the digestive system.

This research could provide important references for the treatment and research of infantile AC with FMT therapy.Research objectivesThe research aimed to detect the safety and efficiency of FMT treatment in ACand compare GM composition before and after FMT treatment in the patients.Research methodsThe procedures of FMT including selection of AC patients and donors were conducted according to the guidelines established by the Institutional Review Board of Tongji Hospital Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Meanwhile the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were decreased 610 and increased 1010 respectively in the AC infants.Research conclusionsThis study documents the positive effect of FMT treatment on infantile AC remission suggesting the potential of FMT in gastrointestinal allergic diseases.
