Similarly a study on Japanese population showed that FUT2 secretor status was associated with colonic-type CD and that abnormal expression of blood type antigens was presented only in colonic CD These findings indicate that the influence of FUT2 gene on CD might be linked to the location of CD.

The behavior of CD was composed of 113 nonstricturing nonpenetrating CD 71 stricturing CD and 91 penetrating CD.Comparison of FUT2 Gene Polymorphisms between UC Patients CD Patients and the Controls.

There were 101 colonic CD 90 ileocolonic CD and 84 ileal CD involved in the study.

Dark color of a square indicates that there is a strong connection between the two SNPs.In CD patients the mutant allele T and genotype ATTT of FUT2 A385T were less prevalent in patients with ileocolonic CD than in colonic CD 41.67 versus 59.41 OR  0.488 and 95 CI  0.324-0.734 63.330.686 resp.

Table In terms of disease behavior of CD nevertheless the frequencies of mutant allele and genotype of FUT2 polymorphisms showed no difference among stric- turing penetrating and nonstricturing and nonpenetrating type of CD data not shown.DiscussionAs a group of chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory disease IBD is mainly composed of UC and CD.

Although one study involving 1503 individuals failed to confirm the association of gut microbiome composition with ABO or secretor status  the influence of FUT2 genotype on the gut microbiota has been highlighted not only in healthy individuals but also in patients with Crohn's disease 19 2.FUT2 A385T and G428A and mutant haplotype TT formed with FUT2 C357T and A385T were increased in the CD patients compared to the controls indicating that loss-of- function of FUT2 gene increased the susceptibility of CD.

In the Chinese Han population FUT2A385T polymorphism is the most common site in the gene which determines the secretion of ABH antigens.In conclusion our study revealed that FUT2 gene poly- morphisms and haplotypes were associated with the suscep- tibility to CD but not UC.Competing InterestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Acknowledgmentsnot significantly different either .

FUT2 gene polymor- phisms of the IBD patients and the controls were explored.Table 3 Haplotypes of FUT2 gene in patients with IBD and the controls.HaplotypesTATTCA Patients with UC 42431411Controls 444313 value  0.020 OR  1.277 and 95 CI  1.036-1.573.law of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by h0.a0p5lotypes exists between UC patients and the controls   genotype frequencies of FUT2 gene in UC patients compared and genotype of FUT2 A385T were significantly increased in OR  1.271.

Besides frequencies of mutant allele and genotype of FUT2 A385T were significantly lower in patients with ileocolonic CD than in those with colonic CD and 0.002 resp.

Table The frequencies of mutant allele and genotype in FUT2 A385T were also lower in patients with ileal CD compared to colonic CD 45.24 versus 59.41 OR  0.564 and 95 CI  0.373-0.854 64.290.724 resp.
