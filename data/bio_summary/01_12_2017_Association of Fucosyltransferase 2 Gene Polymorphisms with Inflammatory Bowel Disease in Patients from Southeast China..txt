at present fut2 gene is considered to be one of the important genetic factors affecting the intestinal flora 19. although one study involving 1503 individuals failed to confirm the association of gut microbiome composition with abo or secretor status  the influence of fut2 genotype on the gut microbiota has been highlighted not only in healthy individuals but also in patients with crohn's disease 19 2.fut2 a385t and g428a and mutant haplotype tt formed with fut2 c357t and a385t were increased in the cd patients compared to the controls indicating that loss-of- function of fut2 gene increased the susceptibility of cd.

similarly a study on japanese population showed that fut2 secretor status was associated with colonic-type cd and that abnormal expression of blood type antigens was presented only in colonic cd these findings indicate that the influence of fut2 gene on cd might be linked to the location of cd.

by stratified analysis we further explored the association of fut2 gene polymorphisms with the clinical features of uc patients and cd patients.

from march 2012 to march 2014 a total of 671 ibd patients including 396 uc patients and 275 cd patients were recruited from the second affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university the first affiliated hospital of wenzhou medical university wenzhou central hospitalwere made by means of endoscope in collaboration with clinical histopathological and radiologic findings accordingswitzerland and amplification primers with a terminalof multiplex pcr amplification were as follows initial denat- uration at 95 c for 5 min and amplification for 35 cycles ata final elongation step at 72 c for 10 min.

in the presence of alpha3n- acetylgalactosamine transferase encoded by gene a or d- galactosyl transferase encoded by gene b h antigen would further become a antigen or b antigen which together compose the abh blood group antigen in vivo appre- ciably abh blood group antigen is regulated by fut2 gene.

in the chinese han population fut2a385t polymorphism is the most common site in the gene which determines the secretion of abh antigens.in conclusion our study revealed that fut2 gene poly- morphisms and haplotypes were associated with the suscep- tibility to cd but not uc.competing intereststhe authors declare that they have no competing interests.acknowledgmentsnot significantly different either .

additionally no significant association was observed between fut2 gene polymorphisms and severity of the disease in uc patients data not shown.4gastroenterology research and practicefigure 1 the linkage disequilibrium patterns of fut2 gene in han population from southeast china.

furthermore it has been revealed that the expression of lewis b decreased progressively from proximal to distal colon and disappeared in rectum we inferred that fut2 gene might increase the predisposition of colonic cd through its potential influence on the intestinal microbiota.however there was no significant difference between the controls and the uc patients in the three fut2 mutant alleles or genotype frequencies all.

there were 101 colonic cd 90 ileocolonic cd and 84 ileal cd involved in the study.
