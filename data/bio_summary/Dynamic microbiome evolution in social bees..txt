G. Sanders A. C. Beichman J. Roman J. J. Scott D. Emerson J. J. McCarthy P. R. GirguisBaleen whales host a unique gut microbiome with similarities to both carnivores and herbivores.

However A. mellifera is but one of more than 775 species of social corbiculate bees--a clade dating to about 80 million years and containing other ecologically important pollinators such as the Eastern honey bee Apis cerana bumble bees tribe Bombini all in genus Bombus and stingless bees tribe Meli- ponini 16.

Previous studies found that diverse bumble bee species harbor gut associates related to those of A. mellifera 14 17-21 sug- gesting that an evolutionarily ancient microbiota is conserved among the eusocial corbiculates.Here we compare the gut microbiomes of honey bees tribe Apini all in genus Apis bumble bees and stingless bees--the three majorgroups of eusocial corbiculates--using samples collected from multiple locations on four continents Fig.

Firm-5 strains also resolve into clusters that reflect higher host-level taxo- nomies for example strains from bumble bees honey bees and the Old World and New World stingless bees group separately albeit with lower support at deeper nodes.In A. mellifera and A. cerana cloned Firm-5 sequences from a single sample fall across a range of phylogenetic positions indicating cohabitation of multiple Firm-5 strains within individual bees fig.

Hence the entire diversityof a host-specific phylotype might be largely represented within a single bee colony regardless of geography at least for A. mellifera and A. cerana.Despite the high degree of observed host specificity the phyloge- netic association between Firm-5 and host bees is not perfectly congruent Fig.

We examined total community size absolute bac- terial abundance as a function of host size length of average worker bee and uncover a positive log-linear relationship in the corbiculates whereby larger bees host more bacteria Fig.

Our results show that as with humans and several other social animals the eusocial corbiculate bees have highly characteristic gut communities whose origins and mainte- nance may be facilitated by their social nature.RESULTSWe examined the gut microbiota of 472 individual adult bees repre- senting 25 species of corbiculates and two outgroup bee species data file S1.
