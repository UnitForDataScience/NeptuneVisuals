The prediction results fully demonstrated that the model of KATZHMDA is feasible and effective for predicting large-scale mi-Here cd denotes the normalized kernel bandwidth based on the new bandwidth parameter c0d nd denotes the number of diseases Entity KDij denotes the Gaussian interaction profile kernel simi- larity between disease di and dj.3.2 Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseasesDisease Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity matrix was constructed based on the assumption that similar diseases would have similar interaction and non-interaction pattern with microbes in the known microbe-disease interaction network.

Here heterogeneous network consists of microbe similarity network based on microbe Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity disease similarity network based on disease Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity and known microbe- disease association network constructed based on recorded associ- ations from HMDAD database.KATHMDA first calculates the number of walks between mi- crobe nodes say mi and disease nodes say dj in the known mi- crobe-disease association network.

As a result KATZHMDA achieved the best prediction performance with aver- age AUCs of 0.8171 and 0.8301 with standard deviation of 0.0051 and 0.0033 when using the 2-fold and 5-fold cross validation see .The model of KATZHMDA has demonstrated its reliable and ef- fective prediction performance in the LOOCV and k-fold cross val- idation.

Motivated by previous works  a logistics function was then implemented to regulate disease-disease similarity.KATZHMDAInspired by the successful application of KATZ measure in the fields of social network prediction  disease-gene association prediction  and lncRNA-disease association pre- diction   we explored the KATZ measure by de- veloping a new computational model for predicting microbe-disease associations see .

We here introduce the symptom-based disease similarity SDM into KATZHMDA model and evaluate the prediction performance of the combined model in the evaluation frameworks of LOOCV and 5-fold cross validation.

After removing the same microbe-disease as- sociations from different evidences we obtained 450 distinct associ- ations which further constructed an adjacency matrix A of size 292 x 39 as the information source.Methods3.1 Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbesBased on the assumption that functionally similar microbes share the similar interaction and non-interaction pattern with diseases the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for microbes was con- structed from known microbe-disease association network  .

However little efforts have been attempted to understand and predict human microbe-disease associations on a large scale until now.Results In this work we constructed a microbe-human disease association network and further de- veloped a novel computational model of KATZ measure for Human Microbe-Disease Association prediction KATZHMDA based on the assumption that functionally similar microbes tend to have similar interaction and non-interaction patterns with noninfectious diseases and vice versa.
