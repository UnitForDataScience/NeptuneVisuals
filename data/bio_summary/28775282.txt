However the effect of arginine on the oral microbiota has yet to be comprehensively delineated in either clinical cohort or in vitro biofilm models that better represent the microbial diversity of oral cavity.

Hence we propose that fluoride and arginine have a potential synergistic effect in maintaining an eco-friendly oral microbial equilibrium in favor of better caries management.Dental caries is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide  and is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenicaciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal bacteria col- onized in the oral cavity-.

In addition numerous cross-sectional studies found that caries-active or -experienced individ- uals exhibited significantly lower ADS activity compared with caries-free individuals- further supporting the hypothesis that alkali-generation by oral bacteria may halt the development of dental caries.Arginine has been incorporated into oral hygiene products for years.

In addition the combinatory use of arginine with fluoride could syn- ergistically suppress the demineralizing capability of saliva-derived oral biofilm.ResultsTreatment with arginine-containing dentifrice alters oral microbial composition.

Since the metabolic activ- ities of oral bacteria are correlated with their cariogenicity-  we holistically examined the acidogenicity and arginolyticurealytic activities of the oral microbiota.

Another limitation of the current study is that the enzymatic assays were carried out on frozenthawed samples which may not accu- rately reflect the instant enzymatic activity of the oral bacteria after arginine treatment.Based on our current findings and previous data in vitro   we propose that arginine has a favorable eco- logical effect on oral microbiome and thus represents a promising approach to caries control.

Here by employing a clinical cohort and a saliva-derived biofilm model we demonstrated that arginine treatment could favorably modulate the oral microbiota of caries-active individuals.

Specifically treatment with arginine-containing dentifrice normalized the oral microbiota of caries-active individuals similar to that of caries-free controls in terms of microbial structure abundance of typical species enzymatic activities of glycolysis and alkali-generation related enzymes and their corresponding transcripts.

Moreover we found that combinatory use of arginine with fluoride could better enrich alkali-generating Streptococcus sanguinis and suppress acidogenicaciduric Streptococcus mutans and thus significantly retard the demineralizing capability of saliva-derived oral biofilm.
