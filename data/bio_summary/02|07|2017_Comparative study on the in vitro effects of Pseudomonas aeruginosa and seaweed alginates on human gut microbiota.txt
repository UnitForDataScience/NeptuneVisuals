O the original fecal samples VI VIS VIA and VIP samples collected after cultured using VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed alginates and VI media plus bacterial alginates respectively.doi10.1371journal.pone.0171576.g004The capacity to stimulate the proliferating of fecal microbiota in samples BSF and TXZ in the bacterial alginate-added group was apparently superior than that of the other groups.

The microbial communities at the genus level were analyzed A. O original fecal samples VI VIS VIA and VIP samples collected after cultured using VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed alginates and VI media plus bacterial alginates respectively.

VI VIS VIA and VIP represent samples collected after cultured using VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed alginates and VI media plus bacterial alginates respectively.

The control group indicates no microbiota was inoculated FB TXZ CXX BSF and WYS represent fecal bacteria from these volunteers that were inoculated in the batch chemostat the letters VI VIS VIA and VIP on the TLC plate represent VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed alginate and VI media plus bacterial alginate respectively.doi10.1371journal.pone.0171576.g002To taxonomically classify the alginate-degrading bacteria A3 and P9 16S rRNA gene uni- versal primers 27F and 1492R were used for PCR amplification and sequencing.

VI VIS VIA and VIP indicate the samples collected after culturing in VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed algi- nates and VI media plus bacterial alginates respectively.

VI VIS VIA and VIP represent the samples collected after culturing in VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed alginates and VI media plus bacterial alginates respec- tively.

VI VIS VIA and VIP represent the samples collected after culturing in VI media VI media plus soluble starch VI media plus seaweed alginates and VI media plus bacterial alginates respec- tively.

VIA culture media of VI plus seaweed alginate VIP culture media of VI plus P. aeruginosa alginate No bacteria were represent in the control A3 and P9 alginate-degrading bacterial strains A3 and P9 were inoculated.

Briefly genomic DNA was extracted by using an OMEGA Bacterial genome DNA extraction kit and the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified by using primers 27F 5'-CAG AGT TTG ATC CTG GCT-3' and 1492R 5'-AGG AGG TGA TCC AGC CGC A-3'.

The concentration of the extracted DNA was determined by using a NanoDrop ND-2000 NanoDrop Technologies USA and its integrity and size were confirmed by performing 1 agar gel electrophoresis.PCR-DGGE analysisTo analyze the microbial communities the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene positions 341 to 534 of the E. coli gene was analyzed using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE as described elsewhere .
