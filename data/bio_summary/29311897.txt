these studies suggest that in ad lps may impair the efficient readout of neuronal genetic information normally required for the homeostatic operation of brain cell function and may contribute to a progressive disruption in the read-out of genetic information.keywords alzheimer's disease ad inflammatory degeneration lipopolysaccharide lps rna pol ii transcription run-on gene transcriptionintroduction--the human gi tract microbiomethe human gastrointestinal gi tract microbiome is comprised of a complex and dynamic community of microbiota consisting predominantly of bacteria with various species of fungi protozoa viruses and other microorganisms making up the balance            .the number of gi tract microbial genes from 1000 different species of anaerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria vastly outnumber human genes by at least one hundred to one            .
