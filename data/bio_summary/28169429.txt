In this quest multidisciplinary teams of researchers have turned their attention to exploring the microbiomes of tradi- tional human populations that is human groups worldwide that are still somewhat unaffected by urbanization and industrialized lifestyles.

GomezLoss of gut microbiome diversity in industrialized societies Alternative views Comment on DOI 10.1002bies.201600145Andres GomezAs more details emerge on the con- nections between the gut microbiome and human health microbiome related research has focused on unraveling the factors that shape this microecosystem.

The find- ings indicate that industrialization and westernized lifestyles have greatly re- duced bacterial diversity in the human gut suggesting that increased sanita- tion and unhealthy diets are connected with these losses.

This pattern has been shown almost unequivocally it mani- fests as a gradient related to degree of industrialization being least evident in hunter gatherer and agriculturalist groups in Africa South America and the south pacific and most evident in urban populations in Europe and the U.S.In this regard Dikongu e and S egurel offer an alternative view on this issue 1 the idea that latitude along with industrialization is a co-driver of the observed worldwide decrease in diversity in the human gut microbiome.

This shows that loss in diversity in the human microbiome responds to complex multifactorial phenomena.

Finally it is still not clear whether or how latitudinal correlates of microbial diversity affect human health.Thus a critical view on the problem also centers on determining what these diversity losses mean for the host from an evolutionary and physiological per- spective.
