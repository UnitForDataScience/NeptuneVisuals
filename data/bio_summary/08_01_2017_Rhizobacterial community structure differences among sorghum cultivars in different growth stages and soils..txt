This study is the first to simultaneously investigate the contributions of plant genotype plant growth stage and soil type in shaping sorghum rhizosphere bacterial community composition.Keywords Sorghum genotypes rhizosphere bacterial community composition 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing strigolactoneReceived 20 April 2017 Accepted 20 July 2017QC FEMS 2017.

When the factors were ex- amined simultaneously both statistical analyses indicated that the factor soil strongly determined the rhizosphere bacterial community composition followed by plant growth stage and cultivar.The variations of soil type and cultivar and their interaction as drivers of rhizosphere bacterial composition over different plant growth stages were examined by two-way PERMANOVA.

culture-dependent and DGGE are rather low resolution com- pared with the next-generation sequencing approach applied in this study.In addition although soil was the major contributor driving bacterial community composition in the sorghum rhizosphere at all evaluated stages of growth an effect of plant genotype on the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community was observed only after day 35.

This analysis aided the identification of the main driver of microbial community structure at each stage of plant growth.The variation of the rhizosphere bacterial community was evaluated together with soil type plant growth stage and culti- var in a global principal component analysis GPCA after nor- malization by MFA which consisted of the ordination of each group of variables and posterior transformation by the first eigenvector.

in the rhizosphere compared with bulk soil.Among the bacterial groups with significant dissimilarity across plant growth stages members of Proteobacteria and Bac- teroidetes showed the highest abundance in the earlier stages of plant growth whereas members of Acidobacteria and Verru- comicrobia showed the highest abundance during the last stage of plant growth.

suggested that a stable core microbiome over plant growth stages could be re- lated to a similar pattern of plant exudates over time whereas dynamic core microbiome members may respond to changes in root exudates over plant development.Cultivar had little effect on sorghum rhizosphere bacte- rial community composition.

In the treatments with VD soil the distinction between the bulk soil and rhizosphere clusters evidenced by Dim 1 and Dim 2 was related to differences in the abundances of Bradyrhi- zobiaceae Burkholderiaceae Oxalobacteraceae Sphingomonadaceae Xanthomonadaceae Planctomycetaceae and unclassified groups at the family level belonging to Acidobacteria subdivisions GP1 GP4 GP6 GP16 Betaproteobacteria Burkholderiales Rhizobiales and Spartobacteria Table S5 Supporting Information.munityA clear cluster distinction was observed for both soils by anal- ysis of the symmetric variation of the rhizosphere bacterial community over time using plant growth stage as the ac- tive factor MFA.
