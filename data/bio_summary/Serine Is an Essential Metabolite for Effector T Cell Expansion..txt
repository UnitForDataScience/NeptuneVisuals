Approximately 30 of the intracellular serine pool was labeled from glucose in mouse Teff cells with 20 of serine carbon being fully labeled m3  A. Glucose-dependent labeling of serine was lower in acti- vated human CD8 T cells constituting 20 of the intracellular serine pool B.

Partially labeled serine isotopomers m1 and m2 were also detected likely due to the inter-conversion of 13C-labeled and unlabeled serine and glycine indicating the bi-directional nature of this metabolic pathway.The majority of intracellular serine did not contain carbon from 13C-glucose m0 suggesting additional routes for serine entry into one-carbon metabolism in Teff cells.

One-carbon units in the THF pool can also be used to generate deoxythymidine monophosphate dTMP or to synthesize methionine A. SITA using U-13C-glucose or U-13C-serine revealed no label- ing of methionine from these carbon sources D. These data indicated that one-carbon units from either de novo synthe- sized serine or extracellular serine contributed to the THF cycle but did not continue into the methionine cycle.Dietary Serine Availability Dictates T Cell Responses In VivoGiven that most of the intracellular serine in activated T cells was taken up from the extracellular environment  we ques- tioned whether extracellular serine availability could impact T cell responses in vivo.

Rapid extracellular serine uptake was observed in Teff cells with 75 of the intracellular serine pool labeled as 13C-serine m3 and reaching steady state within 15 min of culture  C. These data suggest that most of the intracellular serine pool in Teff cells comes from the extracellular environment.

Hu- man CD8 T cells displayed similar reductions in TCR-stimulated proliferation when deprived of serine and glycine Figure S3A.To assess whether serine was required for the continued pro- liferation of activated T cells we expanded T cells in complete medium for 2 days then continued culture in complete medium or switched the cells to medium lacking serine and glycine.

Despite displaying reduced proliferation T cells cultured under serine- free conditions displayed comparable expression of activation markers CD69 CD25 and CD44 D and continued to produce IFN-g at similar levels to T cells grown under full serine conditions E. Thus serine availability affected T cell proliferative capacity without impacting their ability to become activated or acquire effector functions.One possibility for the reduced expansion of antigen-specific T cells under serine-free conditions in vivo is that serine availabil-ity affects the stimulatory capacity of antigen-presenting cells APCs such as dendritic cells DCs.

Teff cells readily metabolized glucose to lactate 13C-Glclactate m3 and the TCA cycle intermediate citrate 13C-Glccitrate m2 regardless of serine and glycine avail- ability G. These data indicated that SGOC metabolism was functioning independently of glucose utilization and cellular bioenergetics in Teff cells yet was required for T cell proliferation even when glucose was abundant.Serine Entry into One-Carbon Metabolism Is a Checkpoint for T Cell ProliferationWe next assessed whether the decrease in T cell proliferation triggered by serine limitation was due to the reduced flux of serine into the one-carbon metabolism pathway.

Contribution of glycine and one-carbon units to the purine ring is shown.CD8 Teff cells were cultured with U-13C- serine for 24 hr and the abundance of unlabeled 12C white and U-13C-serine-labeled 13C black purine ATP and GTP and pyrimidine CTP and UTP nucleotides was determined by LC-MS mean - SEM n  3.MID of U-13C-serine-derived IMP and aden- osine AMP ADP and ATP and guanosine GMP GDP and GTP containing nucleotides for cells treated as in B.Relative abundance of U-13C-serine-labeled GTP and ATP in metabolite extracts from CD8 Teff cells cultured with red or without black RZ-2994 1.25 mM for 24 hr followed by culture with U-13C-serine for an additional 24 hr mean - SEM n  3.MID of U-13C-serine-derived GTP and ATP nucleotides in Teff cells treated as in D.enhanced the proliferation of T cells growing in both control and serineglycine-free conditions C. Culturing T cells with the Shmt inhibitor RZ-2994 reduced T cell proliferation further than serine and glycine deprivation alone D likely due to its ability to block the formation of N5-N10-methylene-THF from both exogenous and glucose-derived serine.

Second the sensitivity of Teff cell prolif-eration to serine deprivation indicates that de novo serine biosynthesis may not be sufficient to generate the serine required for optimal Teff cell proliferation nor are other inputs i.e.
