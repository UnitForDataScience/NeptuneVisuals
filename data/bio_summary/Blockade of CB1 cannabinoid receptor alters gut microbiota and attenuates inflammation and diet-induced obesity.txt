SR141716A treatment in Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD  SR resulted in a significant suppression of adipose tissue fibrosis and consequently further reduction in local adipose tissue inflammation and dysfunction Supplementary Figure 1ab.Lighter fat pad mainly in the epididymal fat pad in SR141716A-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD  SR was associated with smaller liver weight when compared with vehicle-treated Diet-Induced obesity DIO HFD  Vehicle pair-fed Diet -induced Obesity DIO control PFSR and body weight-matched control BWM mice Fig.

Taken together these data indicated that SR141716A intervention treatment in Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD  SR ameliorates the compromised mucosal layer and gut leakage in Diet-Induced Obesity DIO phenotype.Additionally our data showed that there was a significant reduction in lipopolysaccharide LPS levels in the serum of SR141716A-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD SR when compared to vehicle-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO HFD Vehicle pair-fed Diet-Induced Obesity DIO control PFSR and body weight matched-control BWM mice Fig.

To investigate the particular effect of SR141716A on the gut-flora of Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD  SR we conducted studies with pair-fed to SR141716A PFSR and body-weight matched controls to Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice treated with SR141716A HFD  SR. Our data indicated significant enrichment of Akkermansia muciniphila OTUs in Diet-Induced Obesity-treated mice with SR141716A HFD  SR when compared with both pair-fed obese PFSR and body-weight matched BWM controls.

Consistent with previ- ous studies treatment with SR141716A of mice with Diet-induced Obesity DIO HFD  SR transiently reduced calorie intake and induced weight loss when compared with vehicle-treated mice with Diet-Induced Obesity DIO HFD  Vehicle Fig.

The temporary reduction of calorie intake in HFD  SR mice during the first week was diminished by day 9 of treatment reaching similar intake as vehicle-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO group HFD  Vehicle Fig.

To maintain the same body weight in body weight-matched BWM group as SR141716A-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO group HFD  SR their food was restricted to even lower intake level than SR141716A-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO group HFD SR Fig.

The weight loss pattern in pair-fed control PFSR group was similar to HFD SR during the first two weeks of treatment but then pair-fed control PFSR group started to gain weight reaching body weight close to vehicle-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD Vehicle by the end of the treatment Fig.

Correlation between changes in body weight and caloric intake within different groups demonstrated consistent weight loss in SR141716A-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO group HFD SR regardless of its high level of calorie intake close to vehicle-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO group HFD  Vehicle Fig.

Assessing the area of the adipocytes demonstrated sig- nificant shrinkage in adipocytes of the SR141716A-treated Diet-Induced obesity DIO mice HFD  SR when compared to vehicle-treated Diet-Induced Obesity DIO mice HFD  Vehicle pair-fed controls PFSR and body weight-matched controls BWM Fig.

High Fat Diet-fed mice were treated with either SR141716A 10 mgkgday HFD SR or vehicle 0.1 Tween 80 HFD Vehicle by daily oral gavage for 4 weeks starting at week 12.
