Culture-positive samples had a very similar Proteobacteria family profile to the overall PCR- positive samples while culture-negative samples had a slightly lower abundance of Comamona- daceae 19 and somewhat higher abundance of Pseudomonadaceae 19 than the culture positive samples 29 and 12 respectively similar to the trend seen in PCR-negative sam- ples .Microbiome changes over time in a subset of CTs does not correlate with culturability of LegionellaWe compared seven CTs from the same region Pinellas County Florida SE in order to track changes in individual microbial communities over time and .

To better understand the distribution of Legionella and the bacterial community composition in US CTs with no known association with disease we assayed CT water samples taken for routine Legio- nella testing from 196 sites across the US using multiplex PCR Legionella culture and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.Materials  methodsWater sample collectionA subset of water samples submitted to four commercial water testing companies for routine testing were shared with CDC.

All samples and controls were run at least in duplicate.Legionella cultureWater samples that tested positive for Legionella by PCR were processed and plated for culture as previously described .

The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the relative abundance of Proteobacteria Comamonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae in samples with dif- ferent PCR and culture results.ResultsLegionella DNA is prevalent among US cooling tower water samplesA total of 196 CT water samples were received for testing during the summer of 2016.

Initial screening of the CT samples using multiplex PCR indicated the presence of Legionella DNA Lspp Lp or Lp1 in 164 84 samples .

Of the PCR-positive results 39 24 were positive for Lp1 24 15 for Lp but not Lp1 101 62 for Lspp alone and 2 were identified by the internal control to contain contaminants that resulted in PCR-inhibition .Diverse Legionella isolated from PCR-positive cooling tower water samplesThe 164 PCR-positive samples and the 2 PCR-inhibited samples were cultured and resulting Legionella isolates were characterized.

Seventy-nine 47 of these 166 samples including one of the PCR-inhibited samples were culture-positive 41 52 of which were positive for more than one type of Lspp or Lp serogroup isolate .

While we were unable to include CTs from the West North Central region in this study Legionella DNA was detected in CTs from each of the eight regions contributing sam- ples ranging from 50 n  6 in the NW region to 95 n  20 in the SE region .While 47 of all PCR-positive samples n  164 were culture-positive the regional percent- ages of culture-positive samples were more highly variable than PCR-positive results .

Excluding regions with 10 samples NW and SW positive culture results among PCR-posi- tive samples ranged from 17 n  12 in the ENC region to 77 n  39 in the C region.

However samples in which Lspp were not detected by PCR had a much lower aver- age relative abundance of Comamonadaceae 3 and higher average relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae 64 compared to the overall Legionella PCR-positive samples 24 andPhyla and Proteobacteria family profiles related to PCR and culture results.
