Moreover the dispersion of the samples with respect with their centroid  indicated that the increase in the variability became more significant when the indirect influence of kefir was studied.CONCLUSIONThe addition of kefir boosted fermentation in the gut stimulating VFA production shifting it toward propionic fermentation and increasing the maximum potential of fermentation in both fermentation models.

The pH decrease due to the substrate fermentation was more acute in bottles with either live or pasteurized kefir moreover the speed of fermentation was lower in those cases confirming previous studies showing an inverse relation between pH and rate of fermentation  .Hindgut vs. Foregut Fermentation ModelsComposition of LAB AAB and yeast in both foregut and hindgut models differed see  presenting the latter a higher numerical concentration of LAB and a lower of AAB and yeast.

In this experiment we aimed to study the effect that kefir could cause in both fermentation models and whether this effect was due directly to the fermentation of kefir inoculate or indirectly by a change in the resilience of the microbiota permutational analysis of the gathered data indicated a distinctive response in both fermentative models to both direct or indirect effects  and a significant effect of the addition of kefir on the fermentation pattern.

Plates were overlaid to create a microaerophilic environment and incubated at 25C for 2 days.Gas Production Curve FittingAn exponential model was used   to describe the kinetics of the accumulated gas production profilesY  a  b1 - e-ctWhere Y is the accumulated gas produced over time in mL t is time in hours a and b parameters are used to explain the potential of fermentation a b reflects the maximum potential of fermentation and c parameter is the gas production rate constant used to explain the speed of fermentation.Statistical AnalysisKefir extracts effects were analyzed with JMP Pro 11   following a one-way ANOVA considering number of bottles as replicates and treatment as main factor.

Kefir associated bacteria LAB and AAB and yeast concentrations didn't differ from control after 24 h of incubation although a numerical increase was found in AAB and yeast both pH and fermentation potential measured as ab were altered when any of theTABLE 2  Fermentation parameters after 24 h of incubation of a mixed diet in a foregut model of rumen fermentation incubated with kefir CTR unaltered kefir KEF autoclaved kefir AUT or pasteurized kefir PAS.SED means Standard error of the difference between means N 4.

Heat processing of kefir also had influence on the fermentation having PAS bottles a higher molar concentration of VFAs and a lower molar proportion of acetate P  0.05.Dendrograms created with the pairwise distances of the all fermentation data sets  clustered as three main groups defined by CTR AUT and a third mixed group with KEF and PAS.

In terms of fermentation kinetics only the maximum potential of fermentation coefficient a b increased with the inclusion of any type of kefir P  0.01.Multivariate analysis   indicated that CTR samples grouped together with no clear separation observed between the kefir based treatments.

Higher Pseudo-F and higher similarities and lower P-values correspond to greater differences in the fermentation n  4.TABLE 7  Pairwise distances between treatments after 24 h of incubation in the foregut RUM or hindgut HOR model incubated with kefir CTRB unaltered kefir KEFB autoclaved kefir AUTB or pasteurized kefir PASB after subtracting their respective blanks containing only kefir.Permutational analysis of variance was performed using Bray-Curtis distances measurements of fermentation parameters data.

Higher Pseudo-F and higher similarities and lower P-values correspond to greater differences in the fermentation n  4.decrease in pH P  0.05 in CTRB samples and a decrease in the speed of fermentation coefficient c in kefir-based treatments.Permutational ANOVA indicated no differences due to treatment P 0.572 confirming the pairwise comparison among treatments .Comparative analysis between both fermentative models Foregut vs. hindgut is shown in  .

In order to apply this knowledge in practical situations it would be needed to include a dose-response study at in vivo conditions since the feeding of kefir would imply its digestion prior to reaching the hindgut.Kefir changed the fermentation pattern in our foregut model  in terms of metabolite concentration C2C3 ratio and the potential extent of fermentation a b parameter.
