additionally astrocytes are important for brain metabolism as the main site of glycogen storage in the brain astrocytes provide support when the brain is hypoglycemic.

this suggests that microbial effects on microglia are not regulated by bacterial load in general but require greater diversity of the gut microbiota or are conferred by particular microbial species and functions not represented by the minimal community tested.notably gf-associated alterations in microglial morphology abundance and gene expression are normalized by postnatal supple- mentation with short chain fatty acids scfas primary products of bacterial fermentation suggesting that scfa-producing bacte- rial species may restore abnormalities in microglia seen in gf ortable 1 reported alterations in the gut microbiota in neurological and psychiatric disorderspathology typeconditionassociated microbiota changesrefs.autoimmune diseasemultiple sclerosisincreased methanobrevibacter akkermansiadecreased butyricimonasincreased desulfovibroneceaedecreased lachnospiraceae ruminococcaceaeincreased pseudomonas mycoplana haemophilus blautia doreadecreased parabacteroides adlercreutzia prevotellaincreased streptococcus eggerthelladecreased clostridia clusters xiva and iv bacteroidetes faecalibacteriumincreased ruminococcusdecreased bacteroidaceae faecalibacteriumneurodegenerative disordersparkinson's diseaseincreased blautia coprococcus roseburia proteobacteriadecreased faecalibacterium prevotellaceae decreased prevotellaceaeenterobacteriaceae correlate with motor impairmentsalzheimer's diseaseassociation with bacterial and viral infectionneuropsychiatric conditions major depressive disorder decreased bifidobacterium lactobacillusincreased actinomycineae coriobacterineae lactobacillaceae streptococcaceae clostridiales eubacteriaceae lachnospiraceae ruminococcaceae erysipelotrichaceae decreased bacteroidaceae rikenellaceae lachnospiraceae acidaminococcaceae veillonellaceae sutterellaceaeincreased enterobacteriaceae alistipes acidaminococcaceae fusobacteriaceae porphyromonadaceae rikenellaceaedecreased bacteroidaceae erysipelotrichaceae lachnospiraceae prevotellaceae ruminococcaceae and veillonellaceaefaecalibacterium negatively correlated with depressive symptomsanxiety disorderprobiotic administration of b. longum and lactobacillus helveticus decreased anxietyprobiotic administration of lactobacillus casei lactobacillus acidophilus l. rhamnosus lactobacillus bulgaricus bifidobacterium breve b. longum streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium lactis decreased anxietyantibiotic-treated mice.

collectively these data suggest that the gut microbiota affect symptoms relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders through modulation of the host metabolome and neuropeptide production.the host immune system which is dynamically regulated by the gut microbiota is also critical in the development of behavioral pheno- types in mia offspring.

neurotransmitters are of particular interest in light of studies demonstrating that the gut microbiota can modulate its produc- tion and that particular gut microbes can synthesize neu- rotransmitters de novo.

cognitive impairment by antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis analysis of gut microbiota-brain communication.

critical role of gut microbiota in the production of biologically active free catecholamines in the gut lumen of mice.

studies investigating the gut-brain axis demonstrate a critical role for the gut microbiota in orchestrating brain development and behavior and the immune system is emerging as an important regulator of these interactions.intestinal microbes modulate the maturation and function of tissue-resident immune cells in the cns.

in addition there is increasing evidence that the gut microbiota regulate brain develop- ment function and behavior.

given the immunomodulatory properties of the gut microbiota immune cell pathways within and peripheral to the cns have been implicated as important mechanisms mediating microbial modulation of brain function and behavior.

these functional deficits align with the finding that naive adult microglia from gf mice have decreased expression of several genes relevant to interferon responses innate responses to stimulation viral defense and effector processes.while the precise mechanisms by which gut microbes influence brain microglia remain unclear there appears to be specificity of microglial modulation to particular bacterial taxa.

consistent with a role for scfas in mediating effects of gut microbes on brain microglia conventionally colonized mice harboring a deletion in g protein-coupled receptor 43 gpr43 an scfa receptor encoded by free fatty acid receptor 2 ffar2 exhibit abnormalities in microglia that are analogous to those seen in microbiota-depletedmice.

although probiotic treatment did not alter gut microbiota composition it reduced the amount of circulat- ing tnf-a and monocyte accumulation in the brain.
