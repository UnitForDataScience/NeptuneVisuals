Plant species varied in the presence of n-hexanol v2  13.101.000.750.500.250.00Solution microbial genusPERNo YesP  0.02 but species identity did not predict the presence of other volatiles and no apparent relationship was found between bacterial abundance and focal volatiles detected in the field analy- ses Table S4.DiscussionHere we demonstrate that common microbial inhabitants of floral nectar differ in the volatile profiles emitted and can influence acceptability of nectar to a generalist pollinator.

We examined if microbial species differed in variance in volatile composition at each timepoint days 2 and 4 separately using the betadisper function in vegan.To examine which compounds were detected by honey bees we used a t-test to examine if normalized EAG responses were significantly different from zero no detectable response and used a false discovery rate FDR correction to control for multiple comparisons.To examine if microbial species in nectar influenced honey bee proboscis extension PER we used a binomial regression to examine if the proportion of positive responses by honey bees varied among microbial species.

2008 accumulation of volatiles in the freshly sealed container see above for venting pro- cedure to allow for collection of volatiles at the specific timepoint 15 min exposure of fiber to adsorb volatiles 15 min stor- age time of volatiles on fiber  1 min and thermal desorption of volatiles in injector ports 6 min.

Our results provide evidence that nectar-inhabiting microorganisms are common but variable inhabitants of nectar and that different microbial species produce distinct volatile blends detectable in field samples which may influence pollinator detection and preference.Materials and MethodsStudy system and microbial isolationNectar standing crop was collected from 1170 individual flowers of 28 nectar-producing plant species native to California in Octo- ber 2015 and March-June 2016 Supporting Information Table S1.

2013 so the consequences for plant reproduction and microbial dispersal may depend on the specific combination of plant microbe and floral visitor.More generally the finding that microbial volatiles can con- tribute to plant phenotype suggests a novel mechanism of micro- bial influence on ecological interactions between plants and animals.

Moreover we only examined responses of the generalist pollinator A. mellifera in the current study so it is possible that other floral visitors respond either more or less strongly to the presence of microbial volatiles or differ in attraction to specific microbial taxa Davis et al.

Still the experiment as executed allowed us to report that some volatiles produced by floral microbes were also found in the headspace of wild flowers.Statistical analysesTo compare volatile blends among microbial species and days following inoculation peak areas were log-transformed.

Although more research is necessary to fully exam- ine the prevalence magnitude and consequences of microbial contribution to host semiochemicals our results imply that microbial contribution to host volatile signaling may be an important but largely overlooked effect of the microbiome on host phenotype and subsequent ecological interactions.AcknowledgementsWe thank W.
