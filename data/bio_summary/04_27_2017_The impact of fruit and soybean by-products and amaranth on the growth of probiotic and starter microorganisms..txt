When comparing 24 h and 48 h E. coli ATCC 8786 had the lowest growth rates in the first 24 h for all substrates studied except for the supplemented okara medium where populations between 24 h and48 h of incubation did not show a significant difference p  0.05.

On the other hand BB-46 stood out at 48 h for passion fruit and at 24 h for mango orange and acerola and TA-40 did not stand out at 24 h for the passion fruit by-product in which the strain showed growth promotion after 48 h of incubation.Therefore the results of the present study reinforce the fact that thefermentation and the potential modulation of individual strains possi- bly present in the gut microbiota may be influenced by different growth conditions and the availability of nutrients.

perfringens CL strains on phenol red MRS broth supplemented with 1 wv of the A acerola B mango C orange D passion fruit E okara by-products and of F amaranth before 0 h  and after 24 h   and 48 h   of incubation at 37 degC.

However St. thermophilus TA-40 showed the highest growth in the presence of acerola orange and passion fruit by-products when compared to okara and mango by-products and amaranth.DiscussionThe fermentation ability of fifteen bacteria including three starter cultures ten probiotic cultures and two harmful bacteria representa- tive of intestinal microbiota after 24 h and 48 h in modified MRS supplemented with six vegetable substrates acerola mango orange passion fruit by-products okara and amaranth flour were evaluated.

The enumeration of the bacterial populations was performed before 0 h and after 24 h and 48 h of incubation at 37 degC using the appropriate agar media for each microorganism .Statistical analysisThe Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify the data normality and the Bartlett test was used to check assumptions of homoscedasticity.

perfringens ATCC 13124 did not grow significantly in the presence of acerola mango or orange by-products after 24 or 48 h of incubation p  0.05 when compared to the non- supplemented mMRS broth negative control 7.62 log CFUmL and7.68 log CFUmL for 24 h and 48 h respectively data not shown.

illustrates the growth of the strains after 24 h 3A and 48 h 3B of incubation at 37 degC.

Principal Component graph of bacterial growth in the presence of different vegetable substrates after 24 h A and 48 h B of incubation at 37 degC.

Therefore the first two PC explained 88.87 of the variability between by-productsamaranth regarding bacterial growth B.After 24 h of incubation St. thermophilus TH-4 and ST-M6 grewbetter in amaranth flour passion fruit and mango by-products espe- cially when compared to the acerola by-product.

After 48 h of incubation the growth of the strains BB- 46 ST-M6 and TH-4 was higher in the presence of passion fruit orange and mango by-products and amaranth on the right of the map B.
