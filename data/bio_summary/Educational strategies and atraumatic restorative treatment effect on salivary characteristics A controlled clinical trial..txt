The intragroup comparison showed that stim- ulated salivary flow rate did not differ after educational strategy or ART while salivary pH and buffering capacity increased significantly 1 week after educational strategy in both groups and 1 month after educational strategy or ART in GC and GART respectively.At baseline salivary calcium and phosphorus concentrations were lower in GART than GC both in stimulated and unstimulated sa- liva.

In GART a significant decrease in S. mutans count was observed from W0 to W5 that is after educational strategy after 1 month of ART W9 W10 S. mutans count was not different than baseline W0.The intergroup comparison showed that total bacteria count was significantly higher in GC than GART only in W8W9 Mann-Whitney test U  222.000 p  .001 S. mutans count was significantly higher in GART than GC only in W5 t test p  .005 power  0.77.Table 4 shows the percentage of S. mutans in relation to total bac- teria quantified in the three collections.

Although S. mutans count of GART did not differ from GC at baseline the percentages of S. mutans in relation to total bacteria were significantly higher in GART than GC in the sub- sequent collections.4  DISCUSSION The present results showed that preventive measures such as oral health strategy could improve some clinical and salivary parameters pH buffering capacity calcium and phosphorus concentrations related to caries risk even before ART restoration was delivered.

The evaluations were performedin three moments for GC baseline W0 fifth week W5 1 week after educational strategy and between the eighth and ninth weeks W8 W9 1 month after the educational strategy and for GART baseline W0 fifth week W5 1 week after educational strategy and between the ninth and tenth weeks W9W10 1 month after ART restoration.

The only exception was the decrease in calcium concentration in unstimulated saliva of caries-free children although within a level comparable with that showed by GART 1 month after ART restoration as mentioned above.Figures 2a b show the total bacteria quantification of GC and GART respectively in the three collections W0 W5 and W8W9 for GC and W0 W5 and W9W10 for GART.

The oral health strategy improved salivary pH and buffering capacity for both groups 1 week after educational strategy and be- fore ART restoration and 1 month after educational strategy or ART restoration the same parameters showed another improvement.

Oral health educational strategyThe oral health educational interactive strategy was similar for both groups previously standardized for the children's age and language and according to our cultural characteristics it was developed by researchers specialized in Public Health based on previous studiesFIGURE 1 Flowchart of sample selection allocation in groups description of the interventions OHES oral health educational strategy ART atraumatic restorative treatment and the time of performed evaluations in weeks WAngelopoulou Kavvadia Taoufik  Oulis 2015 Bhardwaj et al.

Here lower levels of calcium and phosphorus were found in GART compared toGC furthermore the OHES coupled with ART restoration leads toincrease in calcium and decrease in phosphorus salivary levels in- dicating that the experimental approach may at least temporarily restore the levels of those ions to those compatible with health.Streptococcus mutans has been considered one of the most cario- genic microorganisms because of its features and metabolic activities and therefore the level of these microorganisms in biofilm and saliva is of importance in determining the patient's risk of caries development Carvalho  Bezerra 2003 Hajishengallis Parsaei Klein  Koo 2017 Mattos-Graner Klein  Smith 2014.

These behaviors once es- tablished may persist throughout adulthood.5  CONCLUSIONS The findings showed a significant impact of educational strategies on salivary parameters related to caries risk in both groups of children even before ART restoration was delivered in the caries group.
