metabotype 0 urolithin non-producers metabotype a production of urolithin a as unique final urolithin and metabotype b urolithin b andor isourolithin a are produced besides urolithin a. although production of some intermediary urolithins has been recently attributed to intestinal species from eggerthellaceae family named gordonibacter urolithinfaciens and gordonibacter pamelaeae the identification of the microorganisms responsible for the complete transformation of ea into the final urolithins especially those related to metabotype b are still unknown.

although isolated strains share with g. urolithinfaciens and g. pamelaeae   the ability to produce urolithin c strains cebas 4a1 4a2 4a3 4a4 are able to produce a further dehydroxylation to yield the final metabolite isourolithin a. previous studies identified urolithins a b c and isourolithin a in human urine plasma and target tissues such as the colon and prostate     .

however it is in the present study where one bacterial species is identified as producer of isourolithin a. accordingly other intestinal species are needed for producing urolithins a and b. additional research should be performed to find out if the deficiency of the isolated bacteria described in the present study is the restrictive factor in the formation of isourolithin a in vivo.
