the mean observed richness within the microbial community from mothers with use of penicillin and negative streptococcus screening was 47.6 and the shannon diversity index was 2.42 whereas the observed microbial richness from mothers that received penicillin and were posi- tive for streptococcus screening was 30.8 and the shannon diversity index was 1.86. on the other hand the mean observed richness within the microbial community from mothersa and b. principal coordinates plot pcoa representing clusters of microbial communities from mother's vagina.

we compared vaginal microbial composition in pregnant women experiencing preterm birth at   qiao min fei ou she wu xi qiao qian qiao fax 32 weeks gestation that received intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis with that in controls.methodsmicrobiota in vaginal swabs collected shortly before delivery from gbs positive women that received penicillin intravenously during labor or after premature rupture of membranes was compared to controls.

the center for disease control and prevention cdc recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for all pregnant women that tested positive for gbs colonization except in the instance of cesarean delivery performed before onset of laboron a woman with intact amniotic membranes and for women with preterm delivery with unknown gbs status .while intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent neonatal sepsis the mothers' micro- bial composition is impacted with potential effects on the vaginal microbial milieu during delivery and having possible implications on microbiota transmission to the baby.

microbiota was analyzed by 16s rrna sequencing using the pgm ion torrent to determine the effects of penicillin use during hospitalization and gbs status on its composition.resultspenicillin administration was associated with an altered vaginal microbial community com- position characterized by increased microbial diversity.

the normal human vaginal microbiota seems to contribute to maintaining microbial balance which appears to protect from microbial diseases including bacterial vaginosis  and uri- nary tract infections .

here we aimed to analyze vaginal microbial composition in pregnant women at risk for transmitting gbs receiving intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and compared to control groups using culti- vation-independent 16s rrna sequencing technology.materials and methodsexperiment design and sampling strategypatients were recruited from the neonatology section of hospital de cl'inicas de porto alegre hcpa brazil.

we used appropri- ated statistical methods to deal with small sample sizes however caution is warranted in making inferences on antibiotic usage on vaginal microbiome community shifts since the approach is sufficiently powered only to show big differences.although culture-independent studies comparing the human microbial communities with and without antibiotic disturbance have been carried out  this study is the first to have done so with vaginal samples of pregnant women with and without intrapartum antibiotic.the vaginal sites introitus midpoint and posterior fornix harbor particularly simplemicrobial communities with lowest alpha diversity at the genus level compared to other body habitats like oral skin and gut .

while the vagina of pregnant women under intrapartum antibiotic pro- phylaxis and with positive screening for gbs presented significant differences in microbial composition and diversity.

guidelines for the prevention of early-onset gbs disease recommend culture-based screening of pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestational age to identify women that should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophy- laxis .preterm delivery is an important risk factor for early-onset gbs sepsis with a higher mor- tality compared to full-term infants.

collectively these studies found the vaginal communities of pregnant women to be dominated by lactobacillus species and characterized by lower richness diversity and high stability than in non-pregnant women.indeed high nugent scores used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis were associated with aerococcus anaeroglobus anaerotruncus atopobium coriobacteriaceae dialister eggerthella gardnerella gemella megasphaera mobiluncus parvimonas peptoiphilus prevotella porphyo- monas prevotellaceae ruminococcaceae and snethia in a cohort of 396 north american women made up by asian white black and hispanic ethnic backgrounds .

they found that women treated with antibiotics in the third trimes- ter of pregnancy were more often colonized by escherichia coli than women without antibiotic treatment in the third trimester.
