The Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends antibiotic prophylaxis for all pregnant women that tested positive for GBS colonization except in the instance of cesarean delivery performed before onset of laboron a woman with intact amniotic membranes and for women with preterm delivery with unknown GBS status .While intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent neonatal sepsis the mothers' micro- bial composition is impacted with potential effects on the vaginal microbial milieu during delivery and having possible implications on microbiota transmission to the baby.

The composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women is different from that of non-pregnant women.

Guidelines for the prevention of early-onset GBS disease recommend culture-based screening of pregnant women at 35-37 weeks of gestational age to identify women that should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophy- laxis .Preterm delivery is an important risk factor for early-onset GBS sepsis with a higher mor- tality compared to full-term infants.

Collectively these studies found the vaginal communities of pregnant women to be dominated by Lactobacillus species and characterized by lower richness diversity and high stability than in non-pregnant women.Indeed high Nugent scores used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis were associated with Aerococcus Anaeroglobus Anaerotruncus Atopobium Coriobacteriaceae Dialister Eggerthella Gardnerella Gemella Megasphaera Mobiluncus Parvimonas Peptoiphilus Prevotella Porphyo- monas Prevotellaceae Ruminococcaceae and Snethia in a cohort of 396 North American women made up by Asian white black and Hispanic ethnic backgrounds .

They found that women treated with antibiotics in the third trimes- ter of pregnancy were more often colonized by Escherichia coli than women without antibiotic treatment in the third trimester.

the prevalence of neonatal sepsis might be around 1.9.In conclusion our study showed with a high resolution technique that vaginal communi- ties of healthy pregnant women was dominated by Lactobacillus species and present low genus diversity while Streptococcus colonized women under peripartum penicillin presented a modi- fied vaginal microbiota composition with low abundance of Lactobacillus and altered micro- bial composition.Supporting informationS1 Table.

The vaginal microbiomes vary significantly among women especially in those of different ethnicities .

The Fisher exact test was used for analysis of dichotomous characteristics.ResultsDespite the small number of women sampled in this study we showed that the groups were similar regarding maternal age gestational age birth weight of newborn and maternal comorbidities such as gestational diabetes choriamnionitis pre-eclampsia and urinary tract infection .
