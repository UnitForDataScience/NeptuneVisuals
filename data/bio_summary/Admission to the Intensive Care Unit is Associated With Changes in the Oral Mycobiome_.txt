The char- acterization of the mycobiome will hopefully allow investiga- tors to expedite the discovery testing and validation of novel drug targets.5 These efforts have been hampered by incomplete knowledge although data are emerging from recent molecular characterizations of the oral mycobiome fungal community that highlight the diversity of fungi in this space.

Ghannoum PhD7AbstractA prospective exploratory study was conducted to characterize the oral mycobiome at baseline and determine whether changes occur after admission to the intensive care unit ICU.

The impact of care in the ICU on the oral mycobiome is currently unknown.

The aim of this study was to characterize the changes that occur in the oral mycobiome by comparing the fungal community on admission to the ICU with that at dis- charge from the ICU.MethodsWritten informed consent was obtained from all study partici- pants.

The baseline mycobiome in our study was markedly different from one previously reported that showed Candida spp present in 75 of the cohort Asper- gillus spp in 35 Fusarium spp in 30 and Cryptococcus in 20.6 However the published study included healthy individuals while our investigation included several patients with chronic medical conditions.

Nor- malized abundance of each peak in the electropherogram was calculated with respect to the total peak area since it is not possible to calculate absolute abundances with either the LH- PCR or the MTPS technology.The mycobiome abundance data were divided into indepen- dent mycobiome data matrices and correlation analysis was conducted using R statistical computing software CRAN mir- ror version 2.13.2.ResultsTen participants were enrolled in the study.

The mouth serves as an entry point into the airways and gastrointestinal tract making it possible for fungi to spread into multiple biocompartments.

The length of patient stay in the ICU depends on a number of factors such as the severity and nature of the acute illness responsible for the admission age underlying medical1 Department of Internal Medicine Northeast Ohio Medical University Rootstown OH USA2 Division of Infectious Diseases Akron General Medical Center Akron OHUSA3 Department of Dermatology Center for Medical Mycology University Hospitals Case Medical Center Case Western Reserve University Cleveland OH USA4 OHARAACTG Mycology Unit Department of Dermatology Case WesternReserve University Cleveland OH USA5 Department of Surgery Akron General Medical Center Akron OH USA6 Department of Research Akron General Medical Center Akron OH USA 7 Department of Dermatology Center for Medical Microbiology Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine University Hospitals Case Medical Center Cleveland OH USAReceived October 16 2015 and in revised form November 30 2015.Accepted for publication December 30 2015.Corresponding AuthorRichard R.

The participants were recruited according to a protocol 12039 approved by the Institutional Research Review Board at Akron General Medical Center.Oral rinse samples were obtained from 10 participants who were admitted to the ICU at Akron General Medical Center between February 5 2013 and January 16 2014.

The partici- pants were all from the Akron area and on standard Western diets.
