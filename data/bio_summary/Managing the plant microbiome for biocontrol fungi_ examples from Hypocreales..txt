In particular a diverse community of organisms including fungi archaea and bacteria persistently and pervasively colonizes plant tissues although fungi appear to predominate .

These fungi are primarily drawn from two major clades of fungi Entomophthorales and Ascomy- cota.

In this review we explore the current state of knowledge for Hypocreales fungi used in biological control.

Advances in understanding the field ecology diversity and genetic determinants of host range and virulence of hypocrealean fungi provide the means to improve their efficacy.Addresses1 Sustainable Agricultural Systems Laboratory 10300 Baltimore Ave Bldg 001 Rm 123 Beltsville MD 20705 United States2 USDA-ARS Mycology and Nematology Genetic Diversity and BiologyLaboratory Beltsville MD 20705 United StatesCorresponding author Kepler Ryan M IntroductionIncreases in modern agricultural output have been achieved through a combination of improved genetics for plants and animals under production and external inputs to supplement nutrition or suppress pests.

Biocontrol fungiFigure 1Representative phylogeny of the major families of Hypocreales Niessliaceae not shown.have been employed to suppress populations of a number of different plant pests including insects nematodes and other fungi.

By far the richest source of biocontrol fungi has been the order Hypocreales in the Ascomycota.

The multiple instances of plant pathogenesis in Clavicipitaceae includ- ing ergot fungi infecting cools season grasses are hypoth- esized to have evolved from ancestors infecting Hemip- teran insects .Sexual reproduction features the production of ascospores in an enclosed structure perithecium with a pore at the tip that may be embedded in robust fleshy tissue or produced directly from the substrate.

Thus far several species of Trichoderma are the only species developed as biocontrol agents against fungi responsible for crop failure .

Trichoderma species infect a number of plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes.
