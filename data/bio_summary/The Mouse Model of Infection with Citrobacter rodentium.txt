straight with a 1.25-mm-diameter bulbous tip braintree scientificml syringe sterile covidien monojectadditional reagents and equipment for anesthesia optional see unit 1.4 donovan  brown 2001prepare animalsacclimate 6- to 8-week-old sex-matched mice to the animal facility environment for at least 1 week prior to infection.animals should be acclimated under standard lighting and temperature conditions in individually hepa-filtered cages with sterile bedding and nesting and free access to food and water provided ad libitum.ear tag or tattoo the mice for identification.the day prior to infection weigh the mice and record their initial weight.fast mice giving only water for 8-12 hr before infection.fasting is performed to avoid delivery of the inoculum into a full stomach which could lead to aspiration of the inoculum into the lung and to decrease variability between animals.perform gavagejust before infection fit an animal feeding needle on a 1-ml syringe.gently agitate bacterial inoculum in the tube to mix evenly then fill the syringe with0.2 ml inoculum.

10 ml supernatant in 990 ml pbs up toa 108 dilution.plate 100 ml of each dilution in duplicate on an lb agar plates supplemented with nalidixic acid 50 mgml or macconkey agar plates.

add the appro- priate volume of sterile pbs and then weigh the tubes.for caecum colon mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen use 1 ml pbs in 2-ml tubes.for liver use 2-3 ml pbs in 4.5-ml tubes.disinfect the work surfaces of a class ii biosafety cabinet using 5 lysol followed by 70 ethanol.

100 ml homogenate in 900 ml pbs.the number of dilutions depends on the expected bacterial load within each organ the time post-infection and the susceptibility of the mouse strain to infection.

dead cells and some epithelial cells are in the cell layer at the top of the tube.rinse pellet with 10 ml cold harvest medium and centrifuge 5 min at 450 x g 4degc.discard supernatant and resuspend intraepithelial lymphocytes in 0.5-1 ml complete medium.count viable cells using trypan blue dye exclusion with a hemocytometer and a microscope appendix 3b.

then rinse the beaker with 10 ml harvest medium and wash through the strainer.centrifuge suspension 5 min at 450 x g 4degc.discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 10 ml cold harvest medium.pipet the suspension and filter through a 40-mm cell strainer into the same centrifuge tube.

rinse the strainer with an additional 10 ml cold harvest medium.centrifuge suspension 5 min at 450 x g 4degc.aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 0.5-1 ml cold complete medium.count viable cells using trypan blue dye exclusion with a hemocytometer and a microscope appendix 3b.

wrap plate in aluminum foil to protect from light and incubate for 30 min on ice.wash cells three times with 200 ml ice-cold permeabilization solution centrifuging 5 min at 450 x g 4degc each time.during centrifugation prepare intracellular staining cocktail by mixing the appro- priate dilutions of all antibodies of interest see table 19.15.2 in ice-cold perme- abilization solution.the intracellular staining cocktail should contain fcr blocking reagent anti-cd1632.discard supernatant by inverting plate above a waste tray and add 100 ml intracellular staining cocktail to each well.

allow to cool to 45deg-50degc then pour into petri dishes and store as described for lb agar plates.percoll 37.5 wvprepare a stock solution by mixing 90 ml percoll ge healthcare with 10 ml of10 pbs.

the number of colony-forming units cfu can be predicted accurately during the logarithmic phase.using a pre-established growth curve for liquid culture of c. rodentium see support protocol 2 calculate the concentration of bacteria in cfuml of culture from the od600 nm.calculate the desired number of cfu required to infect mice and transfer the corre- sponding volume of culture to a sterile 14-ml culture tube.the standard dose for c. rodentium via the intragastric route is 108-109 cfu per mouse delivered in a volume of 0.2 ml.centrifuge bacteria for 10 min at 3000 x g 4degc and discard supernatant.wash bacteria twice in 6 ml sterile pbs for 10 min at 3000g and 4degc.

gently pass the needle along the roof of the mouth and into the esophagus and stomach.caution if there is any resistance felt during this procedure remove and then re-insert the feeding needle.slowly inject the inoculum 0.2 ml then carefully withdraw the needle following the same angle used for insertion.observe the mouse for regular breathing pattern for 1 min and then return to its cage.proceed with infection of additional mice.

include a group of mock-infected animals inoculated with 0.2 ml sterile pbs.when all inoculations are complete check mice for normal behavior looking for any sign of labored breathing or distress.

repeat with fresh sterile pbs in a fresh petri dish.weigh the tissue.place tissue in 400 ml complete medium in a 48-well plate.repeat steps 1-5 as needed for additional mice placing each segment of colon into a new well.incubate for 16-24 hr in a cell culture incubator at 37degc 5 co2.collect medium from each well into a sterile 1.5-ml tube.
