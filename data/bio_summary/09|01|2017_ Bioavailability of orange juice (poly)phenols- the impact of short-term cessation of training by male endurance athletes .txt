OJ orange juice LOQ value below the limit of quantification.2 Phenolic content of baseline urine collected 12 h before orange juice intake used on an excretion-per-hour basis to subtract from excretion values intrained and detrained states obtained 0-24 h after supplementation to estimate increases in the phenolic content attributable to orange juice intake.3 Statistically significant higher excretion above baseline after orange juice consumption P  0.05 Wilcoxon's signed-rank test in trained or detrained states.4 Significantly higher excretion of phenolic acid catabolites after orange juice intake following cessation of training for 7 d compared with consumptionduring training P  0.05 Wilcoxon's signed-rank test798PEREIRA-CARO ET AL.TABLE 4Summary of the quantities of total flavanone metabolites and phenolic colonic catabolites excreted in urine 0-24 h after consumption of 500 mL orange juice by 10 endurance-trained athletes in trained and 7-d detrained states1Volunteer1 The juice contained 398 mmol polyphenols including 330 mmol flavanone.

They competed regularly in running events such as marathons and half marathons at regional and national levels.Identification and quantification of polyphenols in OJThe 500 mL OJ consumed by the volunteers in both trials contained hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside 246 mmol hesperetin-7-O- rutinoside-3-O-glucoside 4 mmol naringenin-7-O-rutinoside 62 mmol 4-O-methyl-naringenin-7-O-rutinoside 14 mmol eriodictyol-7-O-rutinoside 4 mmol apigenin-68-C-diglucoside 35 mmol ferulic acid-4-O-glucoside 16 mmol coumaric acid- 4-glucoside 11 mmol sinapic acid-O-hexoside 6 mmol and amine p-sympatol 6 mmol Table 1.

The orange juice contained 330 mmol flavanones 76 mmol naringenin-O-glycosides 250 mmol hesperetin-O-glycosides and 4 mmol eriodictyol-7-O- rutinoside.2 Significant increase in the excretion by the detrained volunteers P  0.05 Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.Our previous OJ feeding study showed that excretion of hesperetin and naringenin metabolites 0-24 h after OJ con- sumption corresponded to 16 intake whereas excretion of phenolic catabolites was equivalent to w88 of polyphenol intake 18.

AFIGURE 1 Excretion of flavanone metabolites 0-5 5-8 8-10 10-24 and 0-24 h after the ingestion of orange juice containing 330 mmol flavanones 76 mmol naringenin-O-glycosides 250 mmol hesperetin-O-glycosides 4 mmol eriodictyol-7-O-rutinoside by endurance-trained volunteers during training trained black bars and after stopping training for 7 d detrained gray bars.

Whereas stopping training for 7 d signifi- cantly increased flavanone metabolite excretion from 4.2 to 5.2 of intake Table 2 a longer period without training would appear to be required to attain the 16 excretion of flavanone metabolites observed when OJ was consumed by volunteers who were not endurance athletes 18.The main flavanone metabolites hesperetin-3-O-glucuronide hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide and hesperetin-3-sulfate Table 2 are absorbed principally in the colon after microbiota-mediated cleavage of the rutinose moiety of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside 13 45.

In a recent OJ feeding study in addition to an w16 urinary recovery of hesperetin and naringenin metabolites the quantity of colon-derived phenolic compounds detected in urine was equivalent to w88 of flavanone intake demonstrating that flavanone bioavailability is much higher than previously perceived 18.In the context of physical training status and flavanone bio-availability it has been reported that after drinking an aronia 5-citrus 95 juice urinary excretion of flavanone metab- olites by triathletes was w5-fold higher than that of more sedentary volunteers 19.

However the increased excretion of 3-3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenylhydracrylic acid by both groups after OJ intake is of interest because it has been proposed as a biomarker of hesperetin intake 14 18.Volunteer variations in excretion of flavanone metabolites and phenolic catabolitesTable 4 summarizes data obtained with the individual volun- teers on the total 0-24-h urinary recovery of metabolites from a 330-mmol intake of flavanones and the phenolic catabolite re- covery from the ingested 398 mmol polyphenolics.

The 1 volunteer who excreted200 mmol of catabolites while training also did so after ces- sation of training volunteer 10 Table 4.DISCUSSIONIn this study of endurance-trained athletes flavanone bio- availability was assessed based on urinary excretion after OJ intake.
