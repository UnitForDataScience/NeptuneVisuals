ingested flavanones begin to be absorbed as phase ii metabolites in the small intestine but w70 of ingested flavanones reach the large in- testine 13 where as well as continuing to be absorbed as phase ii metabolites they are subjected to ring fission by the action of the resident microbiota and broken down to phenolic catabolites 14-16 which enter the circulatory system with a portion un- dergoing phase ii metabolism in colonocytes or hepatocytes be- fore renal excretion 17. in a recent oj feeding study in addition to an w16 urinary recovery of hesperetin and naringenin metabolites the quantity of colon-derived phenolic compounds detected in urine was equivalent to w88 of flavanone intake demonstrating that flavanone bioavailability is much higher than previously perceived 18.in the context of physical training status and flavanone bio-availability it has been reported that after drinking an aronia 5-citrus 95 juice urinary excretion of flavanone metab- olites by triathletes was w5-fold higher than that of more sedentary volunteers 19. exercise training induces several physiologic changes including reduced whole bowel transit time 20 and enhanced muscle blood flow 21 which would be expected to reduce rather than increase flavanone bioavailability.

four of 5 subjects who excreted .200 mmol catabolites also excreted .200 mmol after stopping training for 7 d volunteers 1 2 5 and 6 the ex- ception being volunteer 7. the 1 volunteer who excreted200 mmol of catabolites while training also did so after ces- sation of training volunteer 10 table 4.discussionin this study of endurance-trained athletes flavanone bio- availability was assessed based on urinary excretion after oj intake.

whereas stopping training for 7 d signifi- cantly increased flavanone metabolite excretion from 4.2 to 5.2 of intake table 2 a longer period without training would appear to be required to attain the 16 excretion of flavanone metabolites observed when oj was consumed by volunteers who were not endurance athletes 18.the main flavanone metabolites hesperetin-3-o-glucuronide hesperetin-7-o-glucuronide and hesperetin-3-sulfate table 2 are absorbed principally in the colon after microbiota-mediated cleavage of the rutinose moiety of hesperetin-7-o-rutinoside 13 45. these metabolites at concentrations that can be achieved in vivo have been reported to exert antiatherogenic effects via ameliorating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells modulating the expression of proteins associated with inflammation and suppressing induced inflammation 46 47. they also efficiently reduce the tnf-a-induced migration of human aortic endothelial cells.

this is accompanied and mediated by significant decreases in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 amounts a thrombogenic protein that is involved in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases and in cell migration 48. the importance of the colonic mi- crobiota is further emphasized by the fact that a number of the colon-derived phenolic catabolites that increased significantly after oj intake table 3 also exert potential protective effects in ex vivo and in vitro test systems at physiologic doses 49-52.there are substantial interindividual differences with for in- stance excretion of flavanone metabolites after cessation of training ranging from 6.2 to 50 mmol table 4. intraindividual differences however were much smaller with high excretors producing relatively high amounts of metabolites in both the trained state and after cessation of training volunteers 9 and 10 whereas low excretors maintained this condition after ces- sation of training volunteers 1-3. the interindividual variation in the absorption of oj flavanones 53 54 and in the bio- availability of dietary polyphenols in general is an area of increasing interest because information of variations in the capacity to metabolize these compounds may lead to a better understanding of the beneficial effects of plant bioactive com- pounds against diseases particularly their role in healthy aging and cardiometabolic risk reduction 55.the results of the current study contradict the findings of medina et al.

a total of 202 6 54 mmol was excreted over the 24-h period by the trained group which corresponds to 51 of the 398 mmol polyphenol intake whereas overall phenolic catabolite excre- tion in the detrained condition increased but not significantly to 236 6 74 mmol which is a 59 recovery.excretion of some of the 33 individual phenolic compounds did increase significantly after oj intake by both groups table 3. three of these catabolites namely 3-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy- phenylhydracrylic acid methoxyphenylacetic acid-o-glucu- ronide and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were excreted in amounts after cessation of training that were significantly higher than the amounts excreted before cessation of training.

am j clin nutr 2017106791-800.keywords orange juice flavanones endurance-trained athletes cessation of training urinary metabolites and catabolites biomarkers of hesperetin intakeintroductioncitrus fruits and their juices are the principal dietary source of flavanones 1. population-based data have linked increased citrus fruit consumption to a reduced risk of stroke 2 and some types of cancer 3 4. there is evidence that this is due to high flavanones intake 5 6. orange juice oj is one of the main dietary sources of flavanones with the major components being hesperetin-7-o- rutinoside hesperidin and naringenin-7-o-rutinoside narirutin 1. other studies have found that regular consumption of oj brings about an improvement in vascular function 7 8 inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory responses 9 and has a positive effect on metabolic oxidative and inflammatory bio- markers of health status in normal and overweight subjects 10. furthermore it has been reported that daily consumption of oj containing 300 mg w500 mmol of flavanones for a period of 12 wk enhanced the antioxidant defense system protected against dna damage and lipid peroxidation and reduced blood pres- sure in overweight and obese adults 11. in addition adminis- tration of a flavanone-rich aronia-citrus juice to triathlon athletes for a period of almost 21 wk decreased isoprostane markers of oxidative stress 12.an understanding of the metabolic fate of flavanones in the bodyis a prerequisite for elucidating the mode of action underlying thegp-c was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from andalusian in- stitute of agricultural and fisheries research and training ifapa and the european social funds.

however the increased excretion of 3-3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenylhydracrylic acid by both groups after oj intake is of interest because it has been proposed as a biomarker of hesperetin intake 14 18.volunteer variations in excretion of flavanone metabolites and phenolic catabolitestable 4 summarizes data obtained with the individual volun- teers on the total 0-24-h urinary recovery of metabolites from a 330-mmol intake of flavanones and the phenolic catabolite re- covery from the ingested 398 mmol polyphenolics.

detraining increased mean phenolic catabolite excretion from 202 to 236 mmol but this increase was not statistically significant even though 8 of the individual vol- unteers did show an increase table 4.there was noticeable variation between the volunteers which is reflected in the range of the amounts of metabolites and ca- tabolites shown in table 4. for instance in the trained condition volunteers 1 2 and 3 excreted 4.8-4.9 mmol flavanone metab- olites whereas volunteer 9 excreted 34 mmol and subject 10 excreted 42 mmol.

bioavailability was assessed by the quantitative analy- sis of urinary flavanone metabolites and polyphenol catabolites with the use of high-pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry.results during training 0-24-h urinary excretion of flavanone metabolites mainly hesperetin-3-o-glucuronide hesperetin-3- sulfate naringenin-4-o-glucuronide naringenin-7-o-glucuronide was equivalent to 4.2 of oj flavanone intake.

for instance volunteers 1 2 and 3 excreted 4.8-4.9 mmol flavanone metabolites when training and 6.7-7.5 mmol after cessation of training.
