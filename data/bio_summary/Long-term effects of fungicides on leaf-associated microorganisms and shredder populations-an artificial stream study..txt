Because all components of the mixture were already detected in the same streams over a year's time 20 the detection of fungicide mixtures is common and even the base flow of agriculturally affected streams can contain fungicide sum concentrations in the mgL range 16 this model mixture can be considered field-relevant.

population streams and C the timeline of events in both the conditioning and population streams note that the start of the population assay was set as day 0.

streams were analyzed for each of the size classes 1.3 mm1.6 mm and 2.0 mm only 1 replicate comprising animals from different streams was used for the class 1.0 mm because of the low number of animals in this size class.

2017 SETACKeywords Aquatic hyphomycetesChronic exposureGammarus fossarumLeaf litter breakdownPopulation developmentINTRODUCTIONLeaf litter is a major source of carbon and energy for the food webs in streams with forested catchments 1 and its breakdown is mediated mainly by decomposing microorganisms and detritivorous macroinvertebrate leaf shredders 2.

Second negative effects of these substances on leaf-associated microorganisms and particularly fungal leaf decomposers may indicate detrimental effects on microbial conditioning and thus food quality for shredders 814.The repeated preventive application of fungicides during the growing season may give rise to chronic season-long exposure toward low fungicide sum concentrations 15 that may nonetheless reach the mgL range even in the base flow of agricultural streams 16.

Further we anticipated that the combined action of waterborne toxicity and diet-related effects of fungicides would affect the structure fitness and functioning of Gammarus populations 1318 and effects were assumed to exacerbate over the course of the experiment.MATERIALS AND METHODSStream facilityOur experiment was conducted in the Landau Laboratory Stream Microcosm Facility The system provided 16 independent stainless-steel artificial streams 120 cm 30 cm 20 cm water volume 40 L serving as experimental units.

All streams were situated in a water bath set at 16 8C with a 1212-h lightdark cycle illuminance 90-130 lx.FungicidesStreams either served as fungicide-free controls or were continuously dosed with the model organic fungicide mixture n 8.
