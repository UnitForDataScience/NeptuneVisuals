We compare the taxonomic and functional diversity of GM from faecal sam- ples of six treatment-naEURive TB patients and follow-up the same patients receiving directly observed treatment short-course DOTS regimen one week and one month after the beginning of treatment.

UniFrac analysis confirmed the dysbiosis of GM in TB patients with significantly greater interpersonal variation seen among TB patients than in HCs Fig.

Our results also show a similar anti-correlation trend and in view of the stark loss of appetite seen in TB patients support the theory that reduction in overall food intake may allow selec- tion of Bacteroides in TB patients capable of utilizing host mucus glycans more efficiently.To study the GM of subjects at a finer taxonomic resolu-tion the filtered Illumina-sequencing derived metagenomic reads were aligned to 4097 reference microbial genomes see Supporting Information Additional File S7.

Gut microbiota of TB patients show altered bacterial diversity.PCA of unweighted UniFrac distances from 16S rRNA gene data set showed that TB patients n 5 5 green colour clustered separately from household contacts n 5 5 red colour p value 5 0.015.

Following confirmation by sputum-smear microscopy the patients were put on the DOTS regimen as per the World Health Organization recommended strategy implemented by Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme in India where the patients receive antibiotics isoniazid rifampicin ethambutol and pyrazinamide.

As gut microbiome GM is implicated in the regulation of host immunity and metabolism here we investigate GM alteration in TB patients by 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome shotgun sequencing.
