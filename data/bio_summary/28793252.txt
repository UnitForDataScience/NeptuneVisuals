histicola might colonize the upper gut of HLA-DR3.DQ8 trans- genic mice.Disease-Suppressive Effects of P. histicola Required Viable BacteriaTo determine whether P. histicola suppression of disease required whole bacteria or bacteria-derived soluble factors we investigated the ability of cell-free P. histicola culture super- natant PH-CS to suppress EAE.

histicola Challenge Caused a Shift in the Composition of the Gut MicrobiotaFinally to investigate whether treatment with P. histicola can alter gut microbiota composition fecal samples were collected from pre- naive and post-immunized EAE mice receiving either medium or P. histicola.

histicola suppresses disease through downregulation of pro- inflammatory Th1Th17 response and induction of regulatory CD4FoxP3 regulatory T cells Tregs.RESULTSTreatment with P. histicola Suppressed PLP91-110- Induced EAE in HLA-DR3.DQ8 Transgenic Mice Previously we showed that double-transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR3.DQ8 develop EAE with CNS pathology  .

To address whether coloni- zation with P. histicola alone can modulate the disease we depleted microbial flora of mice using broad-spectrum antibi- otics for 3 weeks  and gavaged with medium or P. histicola.

histicola colonizes naive mice 8-12 weeks old were treated with either medium or P. histicola.

We tested live P. histicola in doses that ranged from 1 3 107 to 1 3 109 CFUsmL and observed a dose-depen- dent effect with optimal suppression at 1 3 108 CFUsmL see Table S2.Treatment with P. histicola Reduced Inflammation and Demyelination in the CNSAnalysis of CNS tissues from medium-challenged HLA- DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice showed severe inflammation and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord compared to theP.

histicola Administration Downregulated PLP91-110- Specific T Cell and Cytokine ResponseTo determine the effect of P. histicola on antigen-specific T cell responses we isolated splenocytes from mice given bacteria or medium and stimulated with the PLP91-110 peptide.P.

To test whether P. histicola could directly induce a Treg population naive HLA-DR3.DQ8 transgenic mice were challenged with 1 3 108 CFUsmL P. histicola or medium on alternate days for seven doses.

Thus P. histicola challenge restored gut microbiota to the pre-immunized state.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a commensal bacterium P. histicola from the human upper gastrointestinal tract that had a systemic suppres- sive effect distant from the small intestine.
