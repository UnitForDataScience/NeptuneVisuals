Among the selected causes are insufficient low exposure to solar radiation21 areduction in the bioavailability of vitamin D in relation to sequestration storage of this fat-soluble vitamin in adipose tissue present in excess in case of obesity.22 This vitamin D deficiency could be linked to inadequate vitamin D intake by food and supplements despite overall high calorific intake.23 In addition a decrease in hepatic production of 25-hydroxy vitamin D due to hepatic steatosis and a decrease in synthesis of vitamin D through the skin may also intervene.1924 A US study showed that individuals with the most severe obesity were those whose ethnicity was African-American and those with low sun exposure appeared to be most at risk of deficiency in vitamin D.19 In this latest study it was highlighted that for each increase of one kgm2 of BMI there was a decrease of 1.3 nanomole l of serum 25 - OHD.19Hyperparathyroidism is also common in obese subjects and although this anomaly may be secondary to vitamin D deficiency an independent association of vitamin D between parathyroid hormone and obesity has been reported.2526 A mechanism of impaired calcium homeosta- sis in obesity has been raised to explain the high levels of PTH.27 These authors have highlighted a shift to the left of the calcium PTH curve in patients with morbid obesity resulting in a lowered threshold of the ''set point'' calcium for PTH response given.27Potential role of vitamin D in obesitySeveral studies reported an association between obesity and vitamin D deficiency.2829 Recently meta-analyses based on cross-sectional and observational studies strongly sug- gested that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was sig- nificantly different between control and obese group.2930Although the cross-sectional studies supported an increase in insulin sensitivity following vitamin D supple- mentation31 the meta-analyses2930 did not show any weight reduction in obese patients.

the rest of the distal jejunum ileum and colon the higher the degree of malabsorption.53-55 The type and degree of vitamin deficiency and minerals are also bound to possible post-operative complications such as problems of bacterial overgrowth food intolerance or vomiting.The duodenum and proximal jejunum are the main sites of absorption of calcium by passive diffusion and on the other hand by the effects of vitamin D. Calcium defi- ciencies are most often the result of intolerance of patients to products containing calcium like milk and milk prod- ucts but is also a result of the short circuit of the duodenum in the RYGB procedure.The main causes determining vitamin D deficiency in patients after bariatric surgery areThe initial vitamin D deficiency prior to any surgical procedure of obese patients already described above.Inadequate vitamin D supplementation during rapid weight loss induced by bariatric surgery.Bile salt deficiency associated with bariatric surgery procedures the absorption of vitamin D requires the presence of bile salts.Malabsorption of vitamin D sometimes due to intes- tinal bacterial overgrowth problems.56The absorption of vitamin D which basically occurs next to the jejunum and ileum can be affected by the delayed blend of nutrients ingested with bile acids and pancreatic enzymes.5758Below we describe the effects of the main procedures of bariatric surgery on the metabolic impact of vitamin D.Most commonly used procedures are currently number 4 gastric ring or AGB the longitudinal gastrec- tomy or sleeve gastrectomy so-called ''vertical sleeve gas- trectomy VSG the procedure of the RYGB the BPD with duodenal switch Figure 1.In the case of an AGB it is usual to observe a weight loss in the order of 20 to 30 of the initial weight of patients59 and a loss in the range of 41 to 54 of excess weight as defined by a BMI greater than ideal i.e.

In addition the use of vitamin supplementation D was higher in the BPD versus RYGP Group.82It has been recently reported that despite the severe vita- min D deficiency following bariatric surgery the vitamin D supplementation proposed by guidelines83 permitted to reach wear optional levels of serum 25 OH D.84How to treat vitamin D deficiencySerum 25-hydroxy vitamin D seems to be routinely checked before surgery.51 However although 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations are lowest in obese or overweight patients or overweight than in subjects of normal or low BMI otherwise comparable current clinical recommendations are based on the same threshold to define deficiency in vitamin D in patients of normal weight and obese subjects.84-86 The National Union of Sickness Assurance decided in January 2014 to not to authorize payment for 25-hydroxy vitamin D dosing in limited indications selected by the high authority of health HAS.

However these surgeries by producing mechanical restriction and or malabsorption syndrome lead to nutritional deficiencies including vitamin D. In this review we aim to 1 discuss the nutritional deficiency of vitamin D in the obese 2 to summarize the different surgical options in bariatric surgery and to present the evidence concerning these procedures and their associated profile in vitamin D post-operative insufficiency 3 to present the different recommendations in clinical practice to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiencies or insufficiencies in patients treated by bariatric surgery and finally to introduce emerging assumptions on the relationship between vitamin D microbiota composition and circulating bile acids.Keywords Vitamin D obesity bone mineral density bariatric surgery bone health endocrinology metabolismExperimental Biology and Medicine 2017 242 1086-1094.

Thus the term malnutrition or state of ''malnutrition high calorie'' has been proposed.1112 It was established that obes- ity altered food absorption metabolism distribution and excretion moreover obesity affects the storage and availabil- ity of metabolic substrates.1213Many studies have been interested in the micronutri- tional status and vitamin intake of obese patients.11-17 The largest study took into consideration the case of 232 patients with morbid obesity status BMI 40 kgm2 evaluated for bariatric surgery.15 In this population 48.7 of patients had a deficiency of vitamin D vitamin B12 and zinc.15 Phosphate deficiency was highlighted in 5 to 10 of the patients however less than 5 of patients were deficient in magnesium.15 Prevalence figures as high as 80 to 90 of vitamin deficiency could be reported the extent of the deficiency ranging from discreet to severe.18 Vitamin D deficiency is one of the most commonly occurring micronu- trients in the obese population.1113-161920 The causes of vitamin D deficiency are multifactorial.

Daily doses of 800 2000 5000 IU were given ran- domly to patients having also an RYGB procedure.104 In this last work 25-hydroxy vitamin D rates increased in all patients supplementations to 2000 and 5000 IU were associated with a greater increase of serum 25-hydroxy vita- min D. However this work included serious limitations small sample n 14 47 variable adherence of a group to another many dropout of study and differences at the beginning of study for the rate of PTH and vitamin D.104 In addition it should be noted that the variability of the required contributions from one individual to another argues for the importance of regular monitoring of the rate of PTH calcium and vitamin D in patients after baria- tric surgery.105106Vitamin D deficiency on one hand and overweight or obesity on the other hand which are two possible causes of low back pain107108 might be prevented to limit the global burden of low back pain which is associated with high dis- ability.109 In addition a non-linear association between vita- min D levels and obesity with mortality has been discussed highlighting the need to manage this situation.Conclusions and perspectiveObese patients are at risk of multiple nutritional deficiencies especially vitamin D deficiency before bariatric surgery.The vitamin D insufficiency is very prevalent in obese subjects.

The availabil- ity of vitamin D stored in the fatty tissues and the mechan- isms that govern its mobilisation to the serum are still poorly elucidated.Bariatric surgery and substantial weight losses asso- ciated with it expose even more obese patients to multiple nutritional deficiencies including vitamin D. Malabsorptive surgical procedures are associated with a higher risk of defi- ciency in vitamin D than those of restrictive surgery.Revise and update recommendations from the 2008 interdisciplinary European guidelines on metabolic and bariatric surgery include 25OH Vit D3 among the labora- tory tests that should be evaluated annually both after food limitations operations and after operations limiting absorp- tion of nutriments.110The latest recommendations of the learned companies of American Endocrinology Obesity and Bariatric Surgery focus on the interest of the measurement of the rate of vita- min D blood before and after bariatric surgery procedure and offer patients should be treated with 3000 IU of vitaminD daily substitution in order to obtain 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels greater than 30 ngml.83Recently a putative role for circulating bile acids and farnesoid-X receptor signaling FXR to the metabolic improvements seen after bariatric operations has been evidenced.111In turn both FXR signaling and modified bile acid homeostasis might be implicated in the drastic change in microbiota composition after bariatric surgery.112 The pre- cise role of the gut microbiome and its associated changes on the vitamin D metabolism after the different bariatric surgery procedures has not yet been studied.

more than 25 kgm2 weight.60 It seems that despite well-documented pre-operative vitamin D deficiency this type of surgery does not disrupt the serum vitamin D levels that remain stable or increase as well as the rate of PTH which remains stable.6162The VSG procedure can show a weight loss in the order of 20 to 30 after two years which equates to a loss of excess weight in the range of 45 to 64.5963-65 In one of the first studies that focused on the phosphocalcic metab- olism in this type of procedure it was shown that if 95 of the patients were vitamin D-deficient and had high levels of PTH in the study prior to surgery in post-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels increased and those of PTH decreased.63 However it should be noted that no information was available in this work concerning the use of supplementation and therapeutic adherence.

For example in a study where an increase of 200 of vitamin D intake was given corresponding to average intakes of 658 IU per day at the beginning of study and 1698 IU per day at 12 months vitamin concentrations remained stable.70 No increase in serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels was noted in a study where the daily intakes of supplementation were in the region of 5000 IU per day.74 If respectively lower vitamin D and higher PTH levels were observed in a study comparing the effects of the RYGB 3 aged over one year post-operative no information on adherence to the supplementation was specified.75The procedure for BPD associated with duodenal switch is responsible for the most weight loss and is usually reserved for patients with very severe morbid obesity BMI 50 kgm2.
