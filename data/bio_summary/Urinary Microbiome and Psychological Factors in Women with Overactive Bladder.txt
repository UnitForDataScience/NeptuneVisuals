The aim of this study was to characterize the female urinary microbiome associated with OAB and investigate the relationships between urinary microbiome and psychological factors.Methods Thirty women with OAB and 25 asymptomatic controls were recruited and asked to finish the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale.

Another study analyzing urinary microbiome collected from women with UUI and asymptomatic controls found that the microbiome from UUI displayed decreased Lactobacillus and increased Gardnerella abundance by sequence analysis and nine genera were more frequently cultured from the UUI cohort by culture techniques Pearce et al.

We identified 20 bacteria with significantly differential relative abundances between OAB microbiome and control microbiome.

Evidence suggests that the axis is a complex bidirectional communication network between the gut microbiome and host by which microbiome can modulate brain function and conversely chronic psychological stress may compound the degree of dysbiosis Bailey et al.

7488. doi Objectives Emerging evidence indicates that alterations to the urinary microbiome are related to lower urinary tract symptoms.

More information concerning the urinary microbiome and psychological factors in OAB is required.

The relationships between the diversity of the urinary microbiome and psychological scores were identified by Pearson's correlation coefficient.Results We found that bacterial diversity Simpson index and richness Chao1 were lower in OAB samples compared to controls P both  0.038.

There were negative correlations between scores on Self-Rating Depression Scale and both richness Chao1 r  -0.458 P  0.011 and diversity Shannon index r  -0.516 P  0.003 of urinary microbiome in OAB group.

Some bacterial genera of OAB women with anxiety or depression were significantly different from those without.Conclusions The aberrant urinary microbiome with decreased diversity and richness may have strong implications in pathogenesis and treatment of OAB.

Psychological conditions were correlated with characteristics of urinary microbiome in women with OAB.
