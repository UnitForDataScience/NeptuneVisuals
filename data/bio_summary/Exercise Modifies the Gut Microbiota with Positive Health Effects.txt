In addition protective functions are performed by the microbiota through com- petition with pathogens for nutrients and receptors and the production of antimicrobial molecules to avoid colonization by pathogens Through ligands from commensal bacteria as lipopolysaccharide LPS the gut microbiota influences the mucosal immune system development and function 22.

K B12 Biotin Folate and Thiamine thus participating in the host metabolism 9 1.Microbiota and DiseasesThe gut microbiota is essential to maintain homeostasis and normal gut physiology Several diseases have been associ- ated with an altered composition of the microbiota such as obesity coronary heart disease diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease -.

These series of evidence demonstrate that nutritional status and exercise influence gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota is asso- ciated with appetite regulating hormones have investigated whether in rats there were differences in the microbial composition when exercise started in the juvenile period or in adulthood.

In addition exercise- altered microbiota could be used to look for new approaches in the treatment of metabolic and inflammatory diseases in which it is well known that the microbiota plays an important role.Competing InterestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' ContributionsVincenzo Monda and Ines Villano are equal contributors.ReferencesS.

Gut microbiota is involved in the barrier functions and in the maintenance of its homeostasis.

Considering the microbiota ability to respond to homeostatic and physiological changes some researchers proposed that it can be seen as an endocrine organ.

Evidence suggests that different factors can determine changes in the gut microbiota.

These changes can be both quantitative and qualitative resulting in variations of the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota which in turn can affect health and different disease processes.

These observations suggest the presence of different host-microbiota correlations Yet the gut ecosystem development and its stability canbe influenced by an existing dynamic balance between intrin- sic and extrinsic factors such as host physiology lifestyle exercise and diet which in turn can impact health For example decreased microbiota diversity and a higher ratio FirmicutesBacteroidetes are associated with obesity type II diabetes and altered blood glucose On the other hand exercise and high fiber diet such as fruits vegeta- bles legumes and whole-wheat grain products increase the microbic diversity .

Recent studies suggest that an increase in exercise can enhance the number of beneficial microbial species and that the microbiota is responsive to the homeostatic and physiological variations due to exercise In this paper we review the recent knowledge of the role played by exercise as an environmental factor in determining changes in the microbial composition and how these effects could provide benefits to health and disease prevention.The Gut Microbiota Composition and DevelopmentThe human gastrointestinal tract GIT is inhabited by 1013- 1014 microorganisms and their genome the microbiome contains a gene set which is about 150 times greater than that of human genome 3.
