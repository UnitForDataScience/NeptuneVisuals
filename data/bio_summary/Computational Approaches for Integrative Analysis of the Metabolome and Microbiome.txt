In comparison analyzing multi-omics data is still in its infancy usually requiring development and application of advanced statistical algorithms to leverage multiple heterogeneous yet interconnected data matrices.

Univariate correlation-based approaches are often used together with other knowledge-based approaches to aid in data interpretation.Multivariate Correlation-Based ApproachesAlthough significantly more complex than univariate methods multivariate approaches can simultaneously consider interactions between and within data matrices.

also applied PA on 16S rRNA microbiome data and metabolomics data to gain an integrated look at the relationship between the microbiome and metabolome.

However analyzing the resulting multi-omics data remains a significant challenge in current microbiome studies.

In this review we provide an overview of different computational approaches that have been used in recent years for integrative analysis of metabolome and microbiome data ranging from statistical correlation analysis to metabolic network-based modeling approaches.

Much work has been done to analyze individual omics data with many powerful bioinformaticsMetabolites 2017 7 62 doitools developed over the past decade to enable metabolome and microbiome profiling -.

In this review we focus specifically on recent progress and applications of different computational strategies for integration of metabolomics in the context of microbiome studies.Metabolomics Data Integration in the MicrobiomeMulti-omics data consists of two or more matrices that share the same sample IDs but contain different biological variables such as genes metabolites or operational taxonomic units OTUs.

A graphical summary of the major types of computational approaches for integrative analysis of multi-omics data.

Due to the high-dimensional nature of omics data dimension-reduction methods have become the predominate methods to perform statistical integration.

For the remainder of this section consider two data matrixes X n x p and Y n x q where n represent the same individuals or samples and p and q represent different sets of omics variables.Dimension-reduction techniques aim to reduce large number of variables into a handful of new components or principal variables with minimal loss of information.
