Accession numbers of in vivo piglet feces and in vitro fermentative medium nucleotide sequences are SAMN05736398-SAMN05736406 and SAMN05736407- SAMN05736412 respectively.ResultsIn vivo and in vitro measurement of pH and redox potentialIn vivo mean values of -283.5 - 23.0 mV and 5.95 - 0.38 n  4 were obtained in the colon of piglets for redox potential and pH respectively.

In vitro results were in accordance with in vivo data with an average value of -288.3 - 8.9 mV for redox potential and a mean pH in the fermentative medium of6.20 - 0.02 when measured during the overall NT experiment from days 7 to 28 with the exception of the Stab phase from days 0 to 7.In vivo and in vitro production of microbial metabolitesPercentages of CO2 H2 and CH4 atmospheric gases were measured daily during each phase of in vitro fermentations in the PigutIVM.

Nevertheless the Pearson correlation coeffi- cients between in vitro and in vivo data were higher than0.95 for all tested populations except for Bacteroides show- ing the relevance of our in vitro model for mimicking the in vivo situation.

The aim of the present study was to validate according to in vivo data in living animals a new in vitro model of the piglet colon the PigutIVM under both control conditions and antibiotic disturbance by the widely used colistin.

Under both control and antibiotic-treated conditions qPCR analyses showed that the main bacterial populations of piglet gut mi- crobiota were similar in vitro and in vivo with Pearson corre- lation coefficient higher than 0.9.

SCFA concentrations were similar in vitro and in vivo and were not modified by colistin.

Compared to in vivo assays in vitro techniques save labor and time offer flexibility and allow a good reproduc- ibility between experiments due to standardized conditions getting rid of inter or intra individual variability.Most of in vitro models that have been developed to date to reproduce the pig colon are simple batch systems Jonathan et al.

Based on in vivo data this model integrates the main biotic and abiotic parameters of the piglet colon namely temperature pH colonic retention time supply of simulated ileal effluents presence of a complex high-den- sity metabolically active microbiota and anaerobiosis self- maintained by microbial fermentations.

This model was vali- dated by comparison with in vivo data with respect to gut microbial composition and activity both under control condi- tions and when colistin an antibiotic widely used to treat piglet colibacillosis diarrhea Kempf et al.
