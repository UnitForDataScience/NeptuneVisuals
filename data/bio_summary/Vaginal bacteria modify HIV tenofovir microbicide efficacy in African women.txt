s8.microbicide gel adherence and tenofovir efficacy in ld and non-ld womengel adherence as assessed by monthly empty applicator returns 22 was similar in both groups 60.0 244 of 407 244407 of ld women compared to 61.4 172280 of non-ld women had 50 gel adherence where 50 of sex acts were covered by two applications of the gel as recommended in the trial table 1. stratifying ld and non-ld women separately on adherence demonstrates that gel adherence 50 was as- sociated with higher efficacy in preventing hiv in ld women than in non-ld women table 1. the efficacy of tenofovir gel in preventing hiv infection in the subgroup of women with 50 adherence was 78 95 ci 29 95 p  0.003 in the ld group but only 26 95 ci -98 73 p  0.558 in the non-ld group.vaginal tenofovir concentrations are lower in non-ld versus ld womentenofovir concentrations n  270 were assessed in a random sample of cvls from hiv-negative women and from the first postinfection visit cvl from hiv seroconvertors.

this study provides evidence linking vaginal bacteria to microbicide efficacy through tenofovir depletion via bacterial metabolism.masymptomatic and can often go undetected using traditional amsel's criteria 15 andor the nugent's score used to diagnose bv 16.bacterial vaginosis is associated with poor re- productive health outcomes and increased hiv infection risk in women 17  by as much as 60 in some meta-analyses of women with bv 18. bv likely increases hiv risk through multiple mechanisms including increased inflammation and target cells as well as vaginal epithelial bar- rier disruption and wound-healing impairment however the mechanisms are not entirely under- stood 13 19 20. given that women from sub- saharan africa have high prevalence rates of bv21 and that hiv prevention strategies are being targeted for women in these areas we inves- tigated whether vaginal microbial communities may affect the efficacy of antiretroviral-based pre- vention technologies especially those that are topically applied to the vaginal surface.characterization of the vaginal microbiome using unbiased metagenomic metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic approaches represents a po- tential paradigm shift in understanding host- microbial interactions at the mucosal surface in vivo.

comparison of l. crispatus-dominant women to all others as a single group l. iners-dominant and non-ld women produced similar findings 50 lower hiv incidence 3.1 versus 6.0 per 100 women- years 95 ci 0.16 to 1.60 p 0.237. similarly within the placebo group the 31 l. crispatus- dominant women compared with non-ld women showed a 48 lower hiv incidence 95 ci 0.12 to 1.27 that was not statistically significant 4.17 versus 7.8 per 100 women-years p  0.387 fig.

because of the potential in- terplay between vaginal bacteria and adherence in topical microbicide efficacy a useful next step could be to evaluate the proportion of non-ld women in other topical microbicide trials of tenofovir conducted in africa such as voice and facts 23 24. these findings may have broader implications for other topical antiretroviral deliv- ery strategies such as vaginal rings for tenofovir- based hiv prevention.the prevalence of lactobacillus dominance in women in caprisa 004 59 was comparable to that observed in self-described black women from a north american study 58 12 but con- siderably lower than that reported in caucasian women 90. however the extent of lactobacillus dominance may differ even within the same country or region.

although not statistically significant women within the non-ld group were marginally younger mean age 23.6 versus 24.1 years p  0.092. within each of the groups of ld and non-ld women the num- ber of individuals assigned to tenofovir gel andplacebo gel was similar table s2.vaginal microbial profiles and tenofovir gel efficacyin the ld group the hiv incidence rate was 61 lower 95 confidence interval ci 0.16 to 0.89 in women assigned to tenofovir gel compared with those assigned to the placebo gel 2.7 versus 6.9 per 100 women-years where 1 woman-year is de- fined as 1 year of study observation of one woman incidence rate ratio irr  0.39 p  0.013 fig.

however because the proportion of women with l. crispatus dominance was similar in women assigned to tenofovir gel and placebo gel 51 versus 49 the hiv incidence differ- ences between these two groups of women are not due to l. crispatus.

although gel adherence was not different between the ld and non-ld groups and time since the last gel application was similar p  0.558 table s1 tenofovir was only detectable in cvl samples in 29.8 34114 of non-ld women compared with 46.2 72156 of ld women p  0.008. genital tenofovir con- centrations were also significantly lower in non- ld upper quartile  24.3 ngml compared with ld women upper quartile  8020 ngmlfig.

tenofovir reduced hiv incidence by 61 p  0.013 in lactobacillus-dominant women but only 18 p  0.644 in women with non-lactobacillus bacteria a threefold difference in efficacy.

we recently used metaproteomics to gain insight into host-bacterial interactions in vaginal microbial dysbiosis 20. this method simultane- ously collects unbiased information on microbial and host proteomes thus providing systems-levelore than 1 million women are infected with hiv annually and the majority of these new infections occur in young wom- en in sub-saharan africa with south africa having among the highest incidence rates 1 2. antiretroviral-based clinical trials in men who have sex with men have consistently dem- onstrated effectiveness in preventing hiv infection 3-5 however studies in women have produced widely varying results.

in this work we used a metaproteomic approach to assess whether vaginal bacteria modulate the efficacy of the topical microbicide tenofovir in pre- venting hiv infection and we also used in vitro systems to determine mechanisms of microbiome influence on tenofovir.vaginal microbial diversity in women using tenofovir or placebo microbicide gelssamples from 688 hiv-negative women that were assigned to either the tenofovir or the placebo-gel arm were analyzed by protein mass spectrometry as outlined in the materials and methods fig.

although the hiv incidence rate of 4.8 per 100 women- years in ld women was 32 lower 95 ci 0.4 to 1.12 than the 7.1 per 100 women-years in non- ld women this was not statistically significant p  0.127 fig.

these data demonstrate that g. vaginalis is capable of decreasing pharmacologically active tenofovir di- phosphate by metabolizing tenofovir before drug uptake by target cells.implications for antiretroviral-based hiv preventionthe efficacy of tenofovir-containing topical micro- bicide to prevent hiv infection varied more than threefold depending on vaginal bacterial profiles tenofovir gel reduced hiv incidence by 61 in ld women but only by 18 in non-ld women.

these efficacy differences between ld and non-ld wom- en were consistently present in the most gel- adherent women 78 versus 26 as well as in the least adherent women 17 versus 4. in vitro studies demonstrated that metabolism of tenofovir occurred by g. vaginalis p. bivia p. amnii and m. mulieris and slightly by e. coli but not by l. iners or l. crispatus indicating a putative mechanism for the observed differences in topi- cal microbicide efficacy.

nevertheless we did observe a nonsignificant trend of reduced hiv incidence with l. crispatus-dominant women compared with women who had non-lactobacillus- dominant profiles regardless of tenofovir or placebo gel assignment.the ecological diversity in the vaginal micro- biome has been previously linked to changes in mucosal immunity in the female genital tract including elevated cytokine levels increased hiv target cells cd4ccr5 t cells as well as epithelial barrier disruption 20 30 31. thus the presence of bv-associated inflammatory bac- teria could have influences at the vaginal mucosa that may add collectively to a multifactorial mech- anism affecting microbicide efficacy.

future studies of the bacterial metaproteome may provide further insights into in vivo microbial systems.we assessed whether ld and non-ld women differed with respect to clinical symptoms asso- ciated with stis and found that reported vaginal symptoms did not differ between ld and non-ld women.
