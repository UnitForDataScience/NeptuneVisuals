The NOB community abundance was also shown to be affected by the pharmaceuticals feeding c. Gene nxrB used to estimate the NOB abundance was detected in the range of 104 gene copies per uL of genomic DNA on phase I and its abundance on phase II and III wasrelatively lower about 103 gene copies per uL of genomic DNA.The bacterial community established within granules plays a crucial role in the biological removal processes which can be disrupted due to the presence of micropollutants e.g.

AGS microbiome changed over time but a core community was maintained probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main biological removal pro- cesses.IntroductionThe aerobic granular sludge AGS technology has been successfully applied for the treatment of industrial and domestic wastewaters  .

Very similar values ranging from 0.79 to0.89 data not shown were found indicating that there was an almostuniform distribution of species abundance within the AGS during the whole operation.AGS bacterial community composition by 454-pyrosequencingThe bacterial community of the AGS-SBR was analyzed by 454 high- throughput pyrosequencing to evaluate whether there were significant shifts in the composition of the bacterial communities throughout bioreactor operation.

Proteobacteriawas dominant in all sampling days 76.2 of relative abundance with a standard deviation of 8.0 except on day-42 in which a relative abundance of 33.5 was observed.

The heat map was built based on each OTU relative abundance and the color intensity increases with relative abundance from 0 to 50.

Abundance of targeted bacterial genes in AGSThe relative abundance of PAO AOB NOB and total bacteria was assessed on different days of each phase to understand the impact of the feeding with pharmaceuticals on the abundance of key microorganisms .

A similar pattern in which the relative abun- dance of Proteobacteria gradually decreased while the abundance of Bacteroidetes members increased during the pharmaceuticals exposure was reported by other authors using AGS technology  .

Among the Bacteroidetes phylum the increase in its abundance observed on day-42 was mainly due to the increase in the relative abundance of members belonging to the Flavobacteriia class.

Due to the capacity of the Flavobacterium genus to overproduce extracellular polymers the high abundance of these members within AGS after the beginning of the feeding with pharmaceuticals could have contributed to cope with the pharmaceuticals toxicity maintaining the granule core strength.

Despite the fact that the abundance of total bacteria was reduced up to 2 log cycles after starting the feeding with the pharmaceuticals fluc- tuations on the abundance of PAO AOB and NOB were less pro- nounced.
