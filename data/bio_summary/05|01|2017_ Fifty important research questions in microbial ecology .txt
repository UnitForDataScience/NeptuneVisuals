Each question may derive a suite of different answers depending on the group of organisms the habitat and the process.What are the mechanisms driving microbial community structure and function and are these conserved across ecosystemsWhat is the relative importance of stochastic vs determina- tive processes in microbial community assemblyHow conserved are microbial functions across different spa- tial and temporal scalesWhat is the relative importance of individual 'species' for the functioning of microbial communitiesHow much functional redundancy is there in microbial communities and how does functional redundancy affect measures of diversity and niche overlapHow often are functional traits of microbes successfully conferred through horizontal gene transferWhat methods can we use to marry microbial diversity with function how do we link transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics6FEMS Microbiology Ecology 2017 Vol.

As antibiotic resistance increases along with our concern about potential impact on both human and animal health there is an increasing drive to find new forms of antibi- otics.Though the remit for this section is relatively broad the questions focus around two main areas i studying the hu- man microbiome to improve the treatment of disease includ- ing the development of personalised medicine and novel an- tibiotics and ii understanding how 'current' antibiotic regimes and farming practices may negatively impact the diversity of the environmental microbiome and food production capacity.How can human microbiome studies improve personalised medicineWhat ecological principles can be applied in the search for new antibiotics and alternativesWhat are the main determinants of waterborne infection outbreaks and what is the best strategy to control these in water distribution systemsWhat are the consequences of antibiotic and pharmaceu- tical use in human medicine on microbial communities in freshwater and soil environmentsTo what extent are microbial species distributions influ- enced by climate and what are the consequences for food security and human healthHow much microbial diversity in the soil has been lost through monoculture and what is the importance of thisIntensive farming may involve high levels of agrochemicals and broad-spectrum antibiotic usage what will be the long- term effects on microbial communitiesHow best can we harness microbial communities to en- hance food productionMicrobial ecology in a changing worldGlobal changes resulting from human activity impact almost ev- ery habitat on earth.

We also con- sider how microbes can be used as a tool for mitigation or biore- mediation of human-induced environmental changes and the ways in which microbes can be included in current evaluations of global change.How can we integrate microbial communities into models of global changeWill ocean acidification temperature increases and rising sea levels lead to changes in microbial diversity or function and what will the cascading effects of this beHow do human activities such as oil and gas drilling influ- ence the sub-surface microbiomesHow will increasing urbanisation affect environmental and host-associated microbial communitiesHow resilient are different microbial functional groups to ecosystem disturbanceCan we manipulate microbial succession in species-poor soils to encourage repopulation by flora and faunaEnvironmental processesMicrobes play a fundamental role in environmental processes and ecosystem services including nutrient cycling and or- ganic matter decomposition Wieder Bonan and Allison et al.

This sec- tion relates to how general ecological principles influence micro- bial evolution and vice versa what this means for global biodi- versity and whether evolutionary principles can be utilised for anthropogenic gain.How can a bacterial 'species' be definedTo what extent is faunal and floral biodiversity influenced by microbial communitiesTo what extent do microbial communities have an equiva- lent to keystone 'species'Does the structure of microbial communities conform to the same ecological rulesprinciples as in other types of com- munitiesHow do fundamental shifts in environmental conditions impact the trajectory of microbial evolutionWhat are the relative selective forces favouring microbial genome expansion or reductionSociety and policyWe need to find ways to apply fundamental biological research to the benefit of society and policy.

Concurrently a deeper understanding is required of human-induced impacts on the global microbiome through urbanisation habitat degradation climate change and the introduction of invasive species amongst others.How do we successfully establish microbial communities used in bioremediationHow important is the rare microbiome in ecosystem func- tion and how does this change with stochastic eventsTo what extent is microbial community diversity and func- tion resilient to short- and long-term perturbationsWhat is the importance of spatial and temporal variation in microbial community structure and function to key envi- ronmental processes and geochemical cyclesHow can we accurately measure microbial biomass in a re- producible mannerWhich mechanisms do extremophiles use for survival and how can they be exploitedFunctional diversityEcologists are increasingly turning their attention to classifying species based on their activity function within an ecosystem rather than their genotype Crowther et al.

Many questions relating to this area were discussed at the workshop and here we present four additional questions that were devel- oped at the meeting that relate to societal and policy-based as- pects of microbial ecology.How can we best address supply and demand of informa- tion about microbial ecology between researchers clini- cians policy makers and practitionersHow can we best use social and traditional mass media for early identification of emerging threats to animal and plant healthHow can we develop an open access data repository or in- tegrate existing databases to create a centralised and stan- dardised method for data and methods sharing in microbial ecologyHow can we replace fear-based regulation with risk-based regulation specifically with regard to the use of microbes in bioremediation and bioaugmentationDISCUSSIONHere we present 50 important research questions across a num- ber of themes relating to the field of microbial ecology.

Although not exhaustive the questions presented are intended to stimulate discussion and provide focus for researchers funders and policy makers informing the future research agenda in microbial ecology.Keywords environmental processes evolutionary processes functional diversity host-microbiome interactions priority setting research agendaINTRODUCTIONIn recent years there has been an explosion in microbial ecolog- ical research which is reflected in broad-scale research projects such as the Human Microbiome Project and the Earth Micro- biome Project as well as in the peer-reviewed literature e.g.

In total 34 participants from 20 insti- tutions attended and contributed to the development of the 50 questions listed below with the majority listed as authors on this paper.QuestionsPrior to the workshop attendees were asked to submit questions via an online form that they thought most closely met the fol- lowing briefWe are aiming to identify 50 questions that if answered will make a considerable difference to the use of microbial ecology by practitioners and policy makers or to the fundamentals of the field of microbial ecology.
