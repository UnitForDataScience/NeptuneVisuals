Our RRMS patients were classified into two subgroups on the basis of the presence or absence of disease activity at a 2-year follow-up patients with no evidence of disease activity RRMSNEDA n  9 and patients with evidence of disease activity RRMSEDA n  10.Gut mucosal immunity in MSOur multiparametric FACS analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the frequencies of intestinal CD4 T cells in RRMS patients compared to those in HCs P  0.01 whereas the frequency of total CD3 T cells and that of CD8 T cells were comparable between the two groups Fig.

Mucosal immune cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were FACS-analyzed for immunological profiling of the following TH cell subsets IL-17ACD4 TH17 cells IFN-gCD4 TH1 cells and IL-22 TH22 cells.

Our observation that increased TH17 cell frequency is present in the small intestinal mucosa but not in peripheral blood of RRMS patients further underlies the similarities between pathogenic TH17 cell differentiation in humans and in animal models of MS.The acquisition of an IL-22 phenotype by TH17 cells increased their effector function and proinflammatory properties 26 27 and a recent study demonstrated that the presence of IL-22 TH17 cells correlates with high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients 28.

Disease activity in RRMS is correlated with periodic activation of myelin- specific T cells but the mechanisms that regulate the aggressiveness of those self-reactive T cells are still largely unknown.T helper 17 TH17 cells are key players in MS pathogenesis and acquisition of interleukin-17 IL-17-secreting phenotype by myelin- specific T cells enhances their pathogenicity.

The higher frequency of TH17 cells in RRMS patients was detected in the small intestinal mucosa but not in the peripheral blood where TH17 cells were poorly represented in both RRMS patients and HCs Fig.

Our data show that in RRMS patients there is a selective expansion of effector TH17 cells in the small intestinal mu- cosa that is linked with specific microbiota modifications.RESULTSStudy design Small intestinal tissue and peripheral blood samples were collected from 36 individuals including 19 RRMS patients and 17 HC subjects details of the study population are illustrated in Table 1.

The increase was limited exclu- sively to the TH17 cell subset and the frequencies of other effector TH cell subsets such as TH1 cells and TH22 cells were comparable between the RRMS and HC groups Fig.

Al- though further investigation is needed to formally demonstrate that the TH17 cells residing in the small intestine of RRMS patients are myelin- specific the selective TH17 cell expansion in RRMSEDA patients with disease activity suggests that similar to what is observed in mice with EAE the gut environment enhances pathogenicity of self-reactive T cells by driving them toward a TH17 cell phenotype.

In anti-MOG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein T cell receptor transgenic mice that de- velop spontaneous EAE the expansion of myelin reactive TH17 cells was detected in T cells residing in the intestinal wall lamina propria T cells and in Peyer's patches but not in peripheral organs such as spleen and lymph nodes 4.

We also conducted a correlative statistical analysis linking intestinal TH17 cell percentage to age EDSS score disability score and disease duration but foundnostatisticallysignificantassociationbetweentheseparametersfig.S3.Correlation between microbiota modifications increased TH17 cell frequency and disease activity in RRMSNext we wanted to highlight the mechanism responsible for increased TH17 cell frequency in the small intestine of RRMS patients.
