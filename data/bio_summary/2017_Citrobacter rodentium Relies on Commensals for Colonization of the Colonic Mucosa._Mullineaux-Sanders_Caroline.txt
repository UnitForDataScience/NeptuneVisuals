rodentium in the AIBP State Is AvirulentWe next examined the infectivity of C. rodentium after 20 Kan treatments 26 DPI by co-housing mice harboring AIBP C. rodentium with naive untreated mice untreated mice infected with C. rodentium for 7 days were used as a control.

rodentium in the AIBP State Are Non-infectiousIn vivo BLI of control and AIBP-donor mice and co-housed naive untreated recipient mice at 2 4 and 7 days post co- habitation DPC showing AIBP C. rodentium is not transmissible.Scanning electron microscopy of mouse fibroblasts infected with C. rodentium isolated from feces of control or AIBP mice.

Mean values - SEM n  5 mice.In vivo BLI of representative mice showing dimming of the ICC690 BL signal over time demonstrating ler downregulation in the AIBP state.See also Figure S2.Figure 3Kan Treatment Displaces C. rodentium from the Colonic MucosaICC180-infected mice were given a single Kan 1000 mgkg or water treatment at 6 DPI and harvested 24 hr later.Quantification of C. rodentium CFUs in the stool.Quantification of tissue-associated C. rodentium CFUs revealing significantly elevated bacterial load in the cecal contents and decreased CFUs in the distal colons of Kan-treated mice.

Transplantation of the gut microbiota from C57BL6 mice to lethally susceptible C3HHeOuJ mice prevented mortality Ghosh et al.

rodentium the tissue-associated colonic CFUs of Kan-treated 1000 mgkg mice were determined water-treated mice were used as a control.

2012 germ- free mice persistently shed C. rodentium at high titers E. Whereas the BL signal in ICC690- infected mice was dim 2 DPI and bright 8 DPI a diminishing signal was seen at 12 and 14 DPI  F. A bright signal from the control ICC1370 was seen at 14 DPI F with similar CFUs to ICC690 shed in the stool E. These results suggest that cues from the host can upregulate ler gene expression during early C. rodentium infection in vivo.

Germ-free mice were born in the Weizmann Institute germ-free facility and routinely monitored for sterility on the day of inoculation germ-free mice were transferred into sterile iso-cages Hecht et al.

Germ-free mice were given a regular chow diet ad libitum and infected with C. rodentium as described above.Co-housing ExperimentsAn AIBP donor mouse 26 DPI with ICC180 post-20 Kan 1000 mgkgday treatments was co-housed with naive untreated recipient mice.

Significance was determined by a paired two-tailed Student's t test.In vivo and ex vivo BLI of ICC180-infected mice treated with Van or Met showing C. rodentium remain associated with the colonic mucosa.Total gut transit time of uninfected mice 24 hr following a single Kan 1000 mgkg Van Met or water treatment showing no significant differences in gut motility.

Bioluminescent and kanamycin Kan-resistant C. rodentium persisted avirulently in the cecal lumen of mice continuously treated with Kan. A single Kan treatment was sufficient to displace C. rodentium from the colonic mucosa a phenomenon not observed following treatment with vancomycin Van or metronidazole Met.
