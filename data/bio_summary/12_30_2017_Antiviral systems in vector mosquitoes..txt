However it also indicates a number of remaining challenges and questions that must be addressed to fully elucidate the interactions of arboviruses with their mosquito hostsConsidering that there are differences in vector competence between different mosquitoes which immune systems cause the differences in susceptibility resistance and tolerance be- tween different mosquitoesAs mosquitoes are equipped with several types of immune machinery that detect and restrict invading arboviruses and maintain a delicate balance how do mosquito immune path- ways interact with each otherRegarding population replacement control strategies how can we enhance the antiviral ability of mosquitoes so that they can clear arboviruses in vivo and spread virus resistance genes within the mosquito population in the wildWhat are the mechanisms underlying the production of virus genome-derived piRNAs and degradation of viruses via the piRNA pathway in mosquitoes and do arbovirus-evasion mechanisms also involve the piRNA pathwayAs the expression of many mosquito miRNAs is undoubtedly influenced by arbovirus infection does alteration of miRNA expression play a role in mosquito-arbovirus interactions and if so what mechanisms or target genes are involved in this processHave mosquitoes evolved other unknown systemic or tissue- specific pathways or defence systems for combating arbovirus infectionConcluding remarksMosquito-arbovirus interactions can be viewed as an arms racebetween two armies.

In nature infection of mosquitoes is established through following steps  A female mosquito acquires a blood meal from a mammalian carrier of the virusInitiation of infection by arbovirus-infected blood occurs in the midgutThe virus begins to undergo epidemic diffusion within the midgut epitheliumAfter replication and overcoming the midgut escape barrier the arbovirus escapes into the haemolymph and spreads via the haemolymph circulation to other tissuesSecondary amplification of the virus occurs in other tissues such as fat bodies muscles and salivary glandsThe virus infects and overcomes the final tissue barrier of sali- vary glandsHorizontal transmission occurs via release of the virus to an uninfected vertebrate host with the help of salivary gland pep- tide mixtures.Therefore the mosquito midgut haemocoel and salivary glands are the three major regions that are important for virus replication or spreading and serve as the antiviral battlefield in the mosquito.The antiviral machineries in the midgutThe midgut an organ that involved in the rapid digestion of the blood meal and absorption of nutrients is the entrance for arbo- viruses and the initial barrier to prevent viral dissemination.

Knocking-down negative regulators Cactus and Caspar of the Toll and IMD pathways significantly increases the number of LDs in the midgut of A. aegypti suggesting that LDs may act as antiviral effectors and as downstream factors in the Toll and IMD pathways .Thus although much bioinformatic and experimental evidenceindicates that innate immune signalling pathways are involved in vector-borne virus immune responses how these pathways are activated by the virus and the specific immune factors involvedremain to be further studied.RNA interference and antiviral immunityRNA interference mediated by small RNAs is a major pathway in the mosquito's fight against arboviruses.

Interestingly high expression of the key JAKSTAT pathway factors Dome and Hop does not affect infection by ZIKV or Chikungunya virus CHIKV suggesting that the antiviral activity of the JAKSTAT pathways may be specific .Taken together the studies discussed above imply that the Toll IMD and JAKSTAT pathways contribute to defence against viral infection in mosquitoes.

This review describes the advances made in understanding various aspects of mosquito antiviral immune molecular mechanisms in detail and explores some of the unresolved issues related to the mosquito immune system.c 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionMosquitoes are one of the most dangerous animals in the world and act as natural vectors of numerous pathogens including Plas- modia Filaria Japanese encephalitis virus Dengue virus DENV and Zika virus ZIKV.

The mosquito infection rate virus titre and diffusion efficiency increased signifi- cantly while the mosquito mortality rate also increased verifying that the RNAi pathway plays an important role in preventing mosquitoes from significant virus-induced physiological damage.

Numerous studies have shown that symbiotic Wolbachia in mosquito cells and Aedes has inhibitory effects on the replication and spread of DENV ZIKV and CHIKV .At present the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus block- ing in the mosquito vector is still unclear but there are many hypotheses.First Wolbachia can enhance the immunity of mosquitoes as a vaccine.

showed that Half of the 24 isolated bacte- ria significant decreased the infectivity of the La Crosse virus in Vero cells .However scientists also found that bacterial infection in gut canchange the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the virus.

In contrast silencing of PIAS protein inhibitor of activated STAT a negative regulatory factor in the JAKStat pathway enhances mosquito resistance to DENV  .Studies have shown that in Culex mosquito cells infected with WNV the JAKSTAT pathway is activated inducing the interferon analogue Vago to inhibit virus replication both intrinsically and in adjacent cells.

CspP bacterium from the midgut of field-derived Aedes aegypti that exerts broad-spectrum anti- pathogen activity against Plasmodium and Dengue virus .These results indicate that the mosquito gut microbiota is an integral part of the mosquito midgut immune system.
