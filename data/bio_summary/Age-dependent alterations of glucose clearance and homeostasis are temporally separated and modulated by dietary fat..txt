we assessed glucose homeostasis and glucose clearance at week 8 12 16 24 31 and 39 and performed an insulin tolerance test at week 40. we further analyzed correlations between the gut microbiota and key metabolic parameters.interestingly alterations in glucose homeostasis and glucose clearance were temporally separated while 16s ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing revealed that gut microbial alterations formed correlation clusters with fat mass and either glucose homeostasis or glucose clearance but rarely both.

importantly effective glucose clearance was maintained in fod- and even increased in lfd-fed mice whereas sod-fed mice rapidly developed impaired glucose clearance followed by a gradual improvement from week 8 to week 39. all groups had similar responses to insulin 40 weeks post diet initiation despite severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in sod-fed mice.we conclude that age-related alterations in glucose regulation may occur in both lean and obese mice and are modulated by dietary fat as indicated by the sustained metabolic homeostasis observed in mice fed o3-polyunsaturated fatty acids.c 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.keywords obesity inflammation high-fat diet gut microbiota aging insulin resistance glucose regulationintroductionobesity is associated with a range of metabolic disorders collectively termed the metabolic syndrome .

blood glucose was measured at time points 15 30 60 90 and 120 min post glucose delivery.moreover before glucose challenge a 20-ml sample of fasting blood was taken from the tail vein into edta-coated minivettes saarstedt for fasting insulin measurements and in week 8 and 39 post diet initiation an assessment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion gsis was carried out concomitantly with the gtt.

sod- fed mice had generally higher blood glucose than their lfd- and fod- fed counterparts f. fasting insulin levels followed a similar pattern with the exception that fod-fed mice exhibited lower levels than lfd-fed mice in week 8 g. integrating these data using the homa-ir index h revealed severe impairment of glucose homeostasis in sod-fed mice seemingly worsening until week 24. of note sod-fed mice tended to improve slightly after week 24 though remaining compromised compared to both lfd- and fod-fed mice.sod- and lfd-fed mice exhibit enhanced glucose clearance over timeanalyses of the gtts revealed remarkable similarity between fod- and lfd-fed mice from week 8 until week 24 while sod-fed mice displayed increasingly impaired glycemic control a-d. at week 31 e and even more so at week 39 f differences between diets were less pronounced.

gsis increased for all diet groups between week 8 and week 39 j-l. for lfd-fed mice this was only evident at 15 min postchallenge whereas fod- and sod-fed mice had increased insulin secretion at all measured time points post glucose challenge.all groups respond equally to insulin challenge while the counterregulatory glucose response is enhanced in sod-fed micesince the increase in insulin secretion did not affect the glucose response curve in fod-fed mice and did not fully ameliorate glucoseintolerance in sod-fed mice we suspected a degree of ir in these groups.

itt data demonstrated increased blood glucose levels in sod-fed mice at all measured time points a. however when analyzed incrementally all groups appeared to have similar initial responses to insulin albeit sod-fed mice returned faster towards homeostatic blood glucose levels than did lfd- and fod-fed mice b. to investigate this further we analyzed the first 30 min and the last 90 min separately c hence separating insulin responsiveness from the counterregulatory glucose response .

of note only sutterella was inversely correlated with fat mass and was found to be abundant in lfd-fed mice but not in either hfhs-fed group d.discussionwe fed mice either lfd or one of two different hfhs diets and thoroughly analyzed the temporal development of two facets of glucose regulation glucose clearance gtt iauc versus glucose homeostasis homa-ir.

yet our data provide insights to the metabolic trajectory of long-term mouse experiments which contrast general findings in man where glucose intolerance is closely related to aging  and hence aid in refining future study designs and increase clinical transferability.in conclusion our findings indicate that age-related alterations in glucose regulation are uncoupled from obesity and modulated by dietary fat as illustrated by increased glucose clearance of both lfd- and sod-fed mice and the remarkably consistent homa-ir and iauc gtt responses observed in fod-fed mice.supplementary data to this article can be found online at .financial supportthis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sector.conflicts of interestnone.acknowledgmentswe would like to thank mohammed-samir belmaati and kauther alatar university of copenhagen denmark for technical assistance and lise madsen national institute for nutrition and seafoodresearch norway for valuable scientific discussion related to the manuscript.referencessarafidis pa nilsson pm.

this was due to changes in glucose response curves of lfd- and sod-fed mice p.005 and p.030 respectively two-way anova whereas fod-fed mice displayed remarkably consistent glucose levels throughout the study p.362.

we next analyzed the iauc of the gtts to investigate the effect of glucose challenges dissociated from differences in basal blood glucose levels g-i.

the observed improvement in homa-ir coincided with a plateaued weight development suggesting interdependency between glucose homeo- stasis and weight gain but surprisingly not between glucose homeostasis and obesity per se.

this could be explained either by the observed diminished expression of the glucose transporter slc5a1 specifically in jejunum of fod-fed mice hence curtailing intestinal glucose uptake or by increasing the insulin secretory capacity as observed here and previously reported for obob and dbdb mice fed o3-pufa enriched diets.the molecular mechanism behind the glucoregulatory response ofobese sod-fed mice remains elusive but we speculate that loss of liver function may be a contributing event.

with the exception of butyrivibrio not a single genus correlated with both homa-ir and gtt iauc supporting our notion that glucose clearance and glucose homeostasis are independently regulated.

protection from intestinal inflammation by butyrivibrio in sod-fed mice and by o3-pufas in fod-fed mice could accordingly contribute to maintain peripheral insulin sensitivity in hfhs-fed mice in this study.intriguingly the observed alterations in glucose regulation did not seem to be specific to mice that are metabolically stressed early in life or to mice that are fed hfd as both lfd- and sod-fed mice improved glucose clearance over time.
