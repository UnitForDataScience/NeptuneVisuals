We further analyzed correlations between the gut microbiota and key metabolic parameters.Interestingly alterations in glucose homeostasis and glucose clearance were temporally separated while 16S ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing revealed that gut microbial alterations formed correlation clusters with fat mass and either glucose homeostasis or glucose clearance but rarely both.

Blood glucose was measured at time points 15 30 60 90 and 120 min post glucose delivery.Moreover before glucose challenge a 20-ml sample of fasting blood was taken from the tail vein into EDTA-coated minivettes Saarstedt for fasting insulin measurements and in week 8 and 39 post diet initiation an assessment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion GSIS was carried out concomitantly with the GTT.

GSIS increased for all diet groups between week 8 and week 39 J-L. For LFD-fed mice this was only evident at 15 min postchallenge whereas FOD- and SOD-fed mice had increased insulin secretion at all measured time points post glucose challenge.All groups respond equally to insulin challenge while the counterregulatory glucose response is enhanced in SOD-fed miceSince the increase in insulin secretion did not affect the glucose response curve in FOD-fed mice and did not fully ameliorate glucoseintolerance in SOD-fed mice we suspected a degree of IR in these groups.

Of note only Sutterella was inversely correlated with fat mass and was found to be abundant in LFD-fed mice but not in either HFHS-fed group D.DiscussionWe fed mice either LFD or one of two different HFHS diets and thoroughly analyzed the temporal development of two facets of glucose regulation glucose clearance GTT iAUC versus glucose homeostasis HOMA-IR.

Yet our data provide insights to the metabolic trajectory of long-term mouse experiments which contrast general findings in man where glucose intolerance is closely related to aging  and hence aid in refining future study designs and increase clinical transferability.In conclusion our findings indicate that age-related alterations in glucose regulation are uncoupled from obesity and modulated by dietary fat as illustrated by increased glucose clearance of both LFD- and SOD-fed mice and the remarkably consistent HOMA-IR and iAUC GTT responses observed in FOD-fed mice.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at .Financial supportThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not-for-profit sector.Conflicts of interestNone.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Mohammed-Samir Belmaati and Kauther Alatar University of Copenhagen Denmark for technical assistance and Lise Madsen National Institute for Nutrition and SeafoodResearch Norway for valuable scientific discussion related to the manuscript.ReferencesSarafidis PA Nilsson PM.

We assessed glucose homeostasis and glucose clearance at week 8 12 16 24 31 and 39 and performed an insulin tolerance test at week 40.

Importantly effective glucose clearance was maintained in FOD- and even increased in LFD-fed mice whereas SOD-fed mice rapidly developed impaired glucose clearance followed by a gradual improvement from week 8 to week 39.

SOD- fed mice had generally higher blood glucose than their LFD- and FOD- fed counterparts F. Fasting insulin levels followed a similar pattern with the exception that FOD-fed mice exhibited lower levels than LFD-fed mice in week 8 G. Integrating these data using the HOMA-IR index H revealed severe impairment of glucose homeostasis in SOD-fed mice seemingly worsening until week 24.

This was due to changes in glucose response curves of LFD- and SOD-fed mice P.005 and P.030 respectively two-way ANOVA whereas FOD-fed mice displayed remarkably consistent glucose levels throughout the study P.362.
