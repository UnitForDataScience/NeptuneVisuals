Taken together these findings suggest that Resv treatment may either improve or prevent the decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity and this likely contributes to the ability of the exercising muscle to use O2 for contraction during exercise.DISCUSSIONWe have previously shown that Resv treatment of mice with established HF increases lifespan and lessens the severity of the HF phenotype by reducing cardiac fibrosis improvingcardiac energy metabolism and enhancing diastolic cardiac function 54.

Because our previous study showed that Resv improved car- diac diastolic function in mice with HF it is possible that heart rate was increased to a greater extent during exercise inResv-treated mice which may also contribute to the increase in exercise treadmill running capacity.To investigate the potential physiological and molecular mechanisms that could be responsible for this significant ex- ercise benefit of Resv we first investigated the effects of HF and Resv on whole body energy metabolism.

Therefore it is possible that improved vascular function may contribute to the beneficial effects of Resv on exercise capacity in HF mice by improving substrate and O2 supply to skeletal muscle.Overall we conclude that HF leads to significant alterations in whole body metabolism and that Resv is able to improve systemic metabolic rate and alter substrate utilization in mice with established HF.

In contrast levels of ADP-stimulated V. O2 were increased in skeletal muscle fibers from HF mice treated with Resv comparedwith HF mice treated without Resv Fig.

Together these findings provide additional physiological mechanistic insight into how Resv may improve glucose uti- lization and mitochondrial oxidative capacity in HF.Given that exercise intolerance in HF has been stronglylinked to mitochondrial and oxidative impairment in skeletal muscle 70 and that Resv has been shown to increase mito- chondrial number andor function 4 27 we isolated skeletal muscle fibers from all three groups of mice and measured ratesof ex vivo V. O2.

Although we have not fully investigated the role of sirtuins in this study this may be a potential mechanism of action by which Resv acts to increase oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle from mice with HF and is worthy of future investigation.Our data are largely consistent with studies in patients with HF where abnormal skeletal muscle metabolism is character- ized by reduced oxidative metabolism with an earlier shift to glycolytic metabolism utilization of high-energy phosphocre- atine PCr early intracellular acidification and delayed PCr recovery after exercise 6 35.

This has led to the emergence of the concept that intrinsic impairments in skeletal muscle structure function and metabolism are key factors in the development of exercise intolerance in HF patients 6.Numerous studies in animals and humans with HF have shown several skeletal muscle abnormalities including changes in fiber type composition reduced capillary density muscle atrophy and mitochondrial dysfunction 70.

Consistent with this we showed thatphosphorylation status of IRS-1 and Akt under 6-h-fasted conditions in soleus muscle were reduced in TAC mice com- pared with sham and that Resv treatment increased phosphor- ylation levels of these proteins suggesting that Resv improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in mice with HF.

Based on these previ- ous findings we investigated whether Resv treatment would be able to improve exercise tolerance and physical activity in mice with pressure overload-induced HF and attempted to identify how the skeletal muscle may directly contribute to these effects.Herein we show that HF leads to significant impairments in systemic metabolic rate and an increased reliance on fatty acid utilization over glucose.

Because HF is considered an insulin-resistant state 1 we examined whether phosphorylation of proteins involved in the insulin signaling cascade was altered in skeletal muscle from mice with HF that were fasted 6 h. We show that phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its downstream target Akt Ser473 was reduced in TAC mice compared with sham and that this was restored with Resv treatment Fig.
