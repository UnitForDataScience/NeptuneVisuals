Other reports indicate that glucose transport into hepatocytes is enhanced by the increased expression of GLUT2 fol- lowing exposure to either BPA cypermethrin 50 mgkg of body weight per day atrazine 100 mgkg of body weight per day 17a-ethinyl oestradiol 1 mgkg of body weight per day or cadmium 3-10 mgl in adult mice37100101.Metabolomics data published in the past few years have demonstrated that perinatal exposure to BPA 0.25-25 mgkg of body weight per day disrupts energy metabolism102103.

MDCs including BPA 10-100mgkg of body weight per day and PFOA 0.01-5 mgkg of body weight per day increase levels of leptin70111133 and BPA decreases adiponectin secretion in vitro BPA 0.1-1 nM134 and lev- els of adiponectin in mice offspring after in utero expo- sure BPA 5-5000 mgkg of body weight per day46.

Chronic exposure of preg- nant mice to TBBPA 150 mgkg of body weight per day or acute perinatal treatment of their newborns 2.1 gkg of body weight in a single injection inhibits the transcriptional activity of TSH-releasing hormone and melanocortin receptor 4 MC4R in the hypothalamus54.

In this regard perinatal expo- sure to BPA in rhesus monkeys 400 mgkg of body weight per day and prairie voles 5 mgkg to 50 mgkg of body weight per day leads to a change in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons a surro- gate marker of dopaminergic neurons in brain regions that are related to addictive behaviour and hedonic feed- ing5960.

Similar alterations have been reportedNATURE REVIEWS  ENDOCRINOLOGYVOLUME 13  SEPTEMBER 2017  539REVIEWS for atrazine 5-250 mgkg of body weight per day and PFOS 0.5-6 mgkg of body weight per day6162.

Similarly gestational exposure to PFOA 5 mgkg of body weight per day resulted in decreased body weight in offspring at postnatal day 1.

The most common MDCs identified to date include diethylstilbestrol DES persistent organic pollutants POPs including 2378-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs dichloro- diphenyltrichloroethane DDT and its metabolites per- fluorooctane sulfonate PFOS perfluorooctanoic acid PFOA and tetrabromobisphenol A TBBPA BOX 1 and the non-persistent MDCs bisphenol A BPA and phthalates mainly bis2-ethylhexyl phthalate DEHPBOX 2.In this Review we identify the essential elements of the complex energy balance equation required to construct a simplified model describing how MDCs alter energy homeostasis.

Other MDCs such as the pesticide malathion 200 mgkg of body weight per day also decrease expression of Gck in adult rats113.

The plasticizer tributyl citrate 10 mM increases cholesterol uptake in human and murine intestinal cells after upregulation of cholesterol transporters via the pregnane X receptor23 whereas in adult mice this agent increases plasma lev- els of cholesterol after oral administration 10 mgkg of body weight per day23.MDCs might indirectly affect appetite and weight after disruption of the intestinal immune system and the associated colonic inflammation24.
