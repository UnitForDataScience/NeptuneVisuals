The overnight cultures were diluted 1100 grown to early log phase and subsequently treated with 5 mgml mitomycin C. The induced cultures were maintained at 37C for 5 h. Cells were centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min and the phage-containing supernatant was sterilized using a 0.2 mm fil- ter.

A The induction of SIVET strain EDL 933 K11604 and cIind1 mutant derivative of the SIVET strain K11607 was measured by incubating with Tetrahymena NP1 at 30C gray bars or 37C black bars for 2 h. Tetrahymena was then harvested washed lysed and the released bacteria were grown in LB for an additional 4 h. The induction in- dex was measured by plating the cultures on kanamycin and chloramphenicol plates and counting the number of CFU n  3.

The indiscrimi- nate feeding by phagocytic protozoa may result in accumulation of different bacteria within a single protozoan phagosome.

The accumulation and concentration within the phagosome creates an opportunity for gene transfer to take place between bacteria.

The presence of Stx- encoding prophage enhanced the fitness of E. coli by increasing their survival in the food vacuoles of a protozoan predator T. pyriformis Steinberg and Levin .

The mCherry-encoding vector was obtained from Clontech.

The cells were grown for 3 days at 30 or 37C.

The cells were harvested by centrifuga- tion at 5000 g for 5 min then washed three times with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and suspended in M9 plus 0.08 sodium citrate in a volume sufficient to give 104 cellsml.Uptake of labeled bacteria by TetrahymenaBacterial cultures expressing GFP or mCherry fluorescent pro- teins were grown to saturation 108ml at 37C in Luria broth LB supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.

The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g washed three times with M9 plus 0.08 sodium citrate and resuspended in M9 plus 0.08 sodium citrate.

The mixed microbial cultures microcosms were created by mixing bacteria expressing GFP and mCherry fluo- rescent proteins in a 11 ratio.
