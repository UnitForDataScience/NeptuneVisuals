primary infections of root canals are caused by microorganisms colonizingthe pulptissue whereas microorganisms that can survive against biochemicaldisinfectant materials or invade the canal through the coronal leakage of the root canal filling are present in secondary infected canals.29 in addition the resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobial chemical agents and root canal irrigants with broad antibacterial activity can lead to secondary infections therefore these organisms can persist more frequently in the root canal following incomplete root canal preparation and obturation.30despite the importance of culture-based methods in the surveillance of microbial diversity profiles for primary and secondary endodontic infections it is possible that some microorganisms present in the root canal infections could be lost during surveillance particularly if the microbial count is low.27 therefore it is recommended that an alternative and sensitive non-culture-based method should be used.collectively the results of this study suggest that future surveys from multiple dental clinics along with modern and advanced molecular assays are needed to provide aclearviewof the microbiotainthe endodonticinfections and lead to a better prognosis for root canal retreatments.

it was concluded that v. parvula and e. faecalis was most frequently found in primary and secondary endodontic infections respectively.keywords endodontic infections facultative anaerobic bacteria infected root canal obligate anaerobic bacteria 16s rrna gene sequencingintroductionendodontic disease is caused by the presence of a polymicrobial consortium within the root canal system.1 the available evidence has successfully demonstrated the role of etiological agents of endodontic origin in the initiation of periapical inflammation.23the microorganisms in particular gram-negative predominantly anaerobic bacteria that are able to initially colonize the dental pulp tissue cause primary infection whereas those present in the treated root canal system are the etiological agents responsible for secondary infections.4on the basis of the results of previous studies the microbial communities in primary endodontic infections are more diverse than those in secondary endodontic infections.567 moreover variation in the microorganisms isolated in several studies is likely a result of differences in the sampling techniques laboratory procedures and diagnostic approaches.8the therapy for infectedrootcanals aims to identify the existing microbiota in endodontic infections and to disrupt and eliminate the microbiota in the root canal system particularly for primary and secondary endodontic infections.4understanding the microbiota composition in the infected root canal is essential for improving the treatment strategies to control infections andeliminate the pathogenic agents as well as to prevent reinfection and periapical lesions.9the type and frequency of microbial agents involved in the genesis of endodontic diseases depend on several factors such as geographic location socioeconomic status dietary habits and oral hygiene status.10 to the best of our knowledge no study in iran has explored this topic to date.

lysakowska et al.28 reported that enterococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals with secondary infections.the findings of these studies confirm thepolymicrobial nature of endodontic infections and reveal that the diversity of the microbiota number and species not only of primary endodontic infections but also of secondary infections is widely researched to date.2425262728 the microorganisms related to the primary andsecondary endodontic infections differed because of the changes in ecology of the root canal system.

after the removal of existing restorations and caries with sterile high-speed and low-speed burs and removal of the supragingival plaque by scaling and cleansing with pumice the tooth and the surrounding field were disinfected with 30 hydrogen peroxide for 30 s followed by 2.5 sodium hypochlorite solution for an additional 30 s. subsequently the disinfectant was inactivated with sterile 5 sodium thiosulphate to avoid interference with microbiological analysis.after preparation of the access to the root canal using sterile burs without water spray the root canal was enlarged using a hand k-type file dentsply maillefer ballaigues switzerland with minimal instrumentation where possible and a sterile paper point was placed in the full length of the canal for 60s.

to ensure viable sample acquisition in cases where the root canal was dry a small amount of sterile normal saline was applied into the canal.

therefore in the present study we investigated the microorganisms associatedwiththe primary andsecondaryendodontic infections via culture methods biochemical tests and molecular approaches in an iranian population.methodologypatient selectionpatients who visited a private dental clinic in tehran iran for root canal treatment and nonsurgical endodontic retreatment were considered for this study.

the results of this study showedthatthe majority of species found in primary root canal infections belonged to obligate gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.

several investigations have revealed the presence of microbial diversity in root canal infections which matched with the results of the present study.

comprehensive analysis of secondary dental root canal infections a combination of culture and culture-independent approaches reveals new insights.
