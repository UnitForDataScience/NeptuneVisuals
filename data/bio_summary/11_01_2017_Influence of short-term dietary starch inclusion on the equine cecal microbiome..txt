The increased retention time of digesta in horses fed solely forage compared with horses fed con-centrate may facilitate the growth of a more complex and rich bacterial community.Cecal MicrobiomeTaxonomic classification of equine cecal bacteria in living animals fed controlled diets has been evaluated in few studies Hansen et al.

Ruminants fed a high-con- centrate diet had lower diversity and richness measures compared with those animals fed solely hay Fernando et al.

2010 also observed greater diversity and richness in the rumen of steers fed coastal bermudag- rass compared with steers fed a wheat diet.Several studies have investigated richness and di- versity of microbial communities in equine fecal sam- ples with low animal numbers Shepherd et al.

Although no treat- ment effects were observed between horses fed HS and horses fed LS in the present study diversity and richness decreased in the first 12 h after concentrate feeding and over the short-term 7-d adaption period which is consis- tent with studies performed in ruminants and cannulated horses Pitta et al.

However the rumen tissue-associated bacte- rial community in beef steers fed a concentrate diet and in beef heifers fed hay- or grain-based diets consisted of more Firmicutes than of Bacteroidetes Chen et al.

Verrucomicrobia relative abundances were greater in horses fed LS compared with horses fed HS over the 7-d period and Verrucomicrobia has been identified as an inhabitant of the equine hindgut Costa et al.

Although soy hulls were fed instead of a commercial concentrate Coverdale et al.

Diets consisted of a commercial concentrate Vitality Perform 14 Horse Feed Cargill Animal Nutrition Elk River MN fed at 0.6 LS or 1.2 BWd HS as-fed basis and horses had ad lbitum access to coastal bermudagrass hay Cynodon dactylon.3OTU  operational taxonomic units.fermentable substrate was added into the diet as re- ported by Coverdale et al.

Only 1 study has evaluated and characterized the core microbial community in different segments of the gastrointestinal tract when horses were fed a forage-only diet Dougal et al.

Estimates of diversity and temporal stability of cecal mi- crobiota were lower in horses fed a high nutrient available diet Hansen et al.
