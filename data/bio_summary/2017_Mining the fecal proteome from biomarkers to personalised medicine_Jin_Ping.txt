in this review we will highlight the application of fecal proteomics for develop- ment and translation of biomarkers for gut-related patholo- gies into clinical practice and introduce the concepts of 'big data' and personalized medicine with which fecal proteomics will integrate.the proteomics toolboxa range of sensitive and specific proteomics methods has been developed for the detection and validation of action- able biomarkers as well as the identification of disease- related biological pathways.

fecal proteomics is a key component of a recently commenced large-scale ipop initiative hpop with 1000 volunteers from around the world addressing the poten- tial of fecal assays for informing personalized medicine.five-year viewthe use of fecal proteomics will continue to expand over the next 5 years.

the fecal components can be analysed by proteomics to reveal potential biomarkers disease related signalling pathways and the microbiome.table 1. fecal biomarkers identified for the detection of crc and other diseases.biomarkermethodutilizationreferences ceaslot-blot-elisagastrointestinal tract cancer screeningantitrypsinsds-page and protein immunoblottingbiomarker of clinical relapse in patients with cd ofthe distal ileum crclactoferrinmeasured using elisa in 872 patients before they underwent colorectal endoscopydiagnosis of colorectal diseasesneoplastic conditionselastasea comprehensive computed analysisbiomarker for ibs calprotectinquantitative meta-analysiscd diagnosis and monitoring of ibd eosinophil protein xstatistical analysesbiomarker for ibsalpha-2 macroglobulinstandard immunonephelometrydiagnostic and prognostic biomarker of ibdindividualscadherin-17tissue arrays western blot analysis immunohistochemical stainingdiagnostic marker for adenocarcinomas of the digestive systemlactoferrinsandwich elisabiomarker of inflammation and a sensitive indicator of neutrophil fluxfob fecal occult blood m2pk m2 pyruvate kinase crc colorectal cancer ibs irritable bowel syndrome cd crohn's disease.more accurate molecular analysis to guide individual therapy by identifying patients with different outcome risks such as disease recurrence .

these included murine homologues of crc-asso- ciated proteins ccaps such as hemoglobin haptoglobin hemopexin alpha-2 macroglobulin and cadherin-17 demon- strating the potential of fecal proteomics for detecting bio- markers and establishing a bridge from animal to human studies.the successful studies using murine fecal proteomics encouraged similar studies on human clinical samples .

since many people already pick up after their dog or change babies nappies hopefully compliance will increase.high quality standardised fecal biobanks compatible with proteomics analysis are required.there is a need to normalise fecal samples for their varying size and consistency analogous to use of creatinine for urine analysis or colon related content.chromatographic reproducibility is still rate limiting in sev- eral areas of proteomics.

the use of proteomicstechnology to analyze fecal proteins or peptides termed fecal proteomics provides a noninvasive specific and sensi- tive approach for achieving this .

diasorin a clinical diagnostics company that was the first to automate immunometric stool testing is currently developing a range of clinical fecal assays including elastase calprotectin helicobacter pylori shiga toxins and clostridium difficile a gram-positive spore-forming bacillus that produces two exotoxins toxin a and toxin b. these toxins are responsible for the diarrhea and inflammation seen in infected patients.fecal proteomics for the identification of potential crc biomarkersmost of the gel-based and ms-based methods and almost all the array based methods can be adapted to investigate the fecal proteome.

taken together these studies clearly demonstrate the potential of fecal pro- teomics for crc detection and surveillance.fecal proteomics for the identification of biomarkers for other gut-related diseasesfecal proteomics has also provided insights into other gut pathologies including inflammatory bowel disease ibd such as cd and ulcerative colitis uc celiac disease and cystic fibrosis cf.

mrm has been developed to quantitate potential crc fecal biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of crc in both a mouse model and human fecal samples .the use of dia methods e.g.

in reversed phase arrays the sample of interest is spotted onto the array and then probed with panels of specific antibodies allowing simultaneous quantita- tion of protein expression levels in biological samples .current clinical fecal assaysthe fecal occult blood test fobt that detects blood in the stool is currently the most commonly used screening tool for crc.

fecal chitinase 3-like 1 is a reliable marker as accurate as fecal calprotectin in detecting endoscopic activity in adult patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

as we will discuss later fecal proteomics has the potential for high-throughput mining of biomarkers for a number of gut-related diseases including crc irritable bowel syndrome ibs crohn's cd and celiac disease.

these include assigning protein identification without msms data particularly in complex samples and some concerns about assay reproducibility.typically fecal proteomics has both a discovery and transla- tionalvalidation component in which libraries of potential bio- marker candidates are established on a small number of samples by comparing normal and diseased states followed by quantitative validation of potential biomarkers and biomar- ker panels on a larger number of clinical samples .
