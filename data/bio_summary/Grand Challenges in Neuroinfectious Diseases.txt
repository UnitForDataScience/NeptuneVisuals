In these patients controlling the underlying infection alone may not be suf- ficient but modulation of the immune response may also be necessary.

They may occur as outbreaks in small local- ized regions or spread rapidly over large geographical areas.

They may also have far reaching socioeconomic consequences.

Hence broad spectrum antiviral is necessary that may be effective against a whole class of viral pathogens .UndiaGnOSed inFectiOnSNearly 20-30 of patients with suspected CNS infections in any tertiary care facility never get an etiological diagnosis .

Timely collection and proper handling of samples may in part be the issue.

Lack of easy access to broad panels or deep sequencing to look for known and rare microbial pathogens and lack of expertise to study these infec- tions may be to blame.

This may require collaborations with diagnostic laboratories and input from the Federal Drug Administration in the United States and similar regulatory agencies elsewhere.MicrOBiOMe and endOGenOUS VirUSeSMuch attention in recent years has been given to the microbi- ome in the gut and other mucosal surfaces.

The composition of the microbiome varies in different disease states and it has been suggested that it may drive the pathophysiology of several neuroinflammatory diseases and influence the innate immune responses in neurodegenerative diseases .

Recent studies in patients with multiple sclerosis schizophrenia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have shown activation of these viral elements which may play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases  .

Nodding syndrome may be an autoimmune reaction to the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus.
