the studies have suggested the trans- formation of mefenamic acid to mono-hydroxylated mefenamic acid 3'-hydroxymethylmefenamic acid 3'- carboxymefenamic acid and di-hydroxylated mefenamic acid 3'-hydroxymethyl-5'-hydroxymefenamic acid 3'-hydroxy- methyl-6'-hydroxymefenamic acid hata et al.

the sorption of fluoxetine and mefenamic acid onto biomass had a significant contribution for their removal 6-14. the lowest sorption coefficients were obtained for metoprolol indicating that the sorption onto biomass is poor 3-4 and the contribution of this process to the global removal can be neglected.keywords biodegradation .

partial biodegradation of the compounds while no substantial biodegradation can be expected using nitrite-oxidizing consortium.the sorption onto biomass had a significant contribution 6-14 in the removal of fluoxetine and mefenamic acid the values of the sorption coefficients for fluoxetine were higher than the ones for mefenamic acid in the three consortiums.

mefenamic acid was degraded faster by the attached biomass than the suspended biomass where the nitrification capacity per unit biomass was higher for the attached growth than for the suspended growth and the rate constants obtainedpharmaceuticals to sorb onto biomass and particles.horsing et al.

the values of log kd for mefenamic acid were between 2.56 andmefenamic acid per unit biomass 0.06-0.17 l g-1 -1biomass2.58 slightly lower than 2.7 and for fluoxetine they werecompared to 0-0.04 l g-1 d-1 for activated sludge andslightly higher than 2.7 indicating the potential trend of thesethat the nitrification capacity of the biofilm was lower than the one determined in activated sludge.

the highest biodegradation constant for fluoxetine was obtained using heterotrophic biomass followed by the one using ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing biomass while the highest values of the biodegradation constant for mefenamic acid and metoprolol were determined with ammonium-nitrite- oxidizing consortium.

the lowest sorption coefficients were determined for meto- prolol indicating that the sorption onto biomass is poor 3- 4 and the contribution of this process to the global removal can be neglected.referencesapha 2012 standard methods for the examination of water and waste- water.

the removal by sorption onto suspended solids is an important mechanism for hydrophobic compounds poseidon  the sorption increases with hy- drophobicity as expected considering the higher sorption of nonpolar compounds on sludge rosal et al.
