The relationship between diet and ontogeny of the immune system will also require the knowledge of both trans- generational epigenetic control of immune gene expression as well as life-long epigenetic control of immune genes expression established during the time of first feeding.

Although great progress has been made to define the changes in host immune function understanding the interplay between fish nutrition intestinal microbiome and immune system is only just beginning to emerge.c 2017 The Authors.

Because the ability of fish to resist pathogens and cope with stress depends to a large extent on their nutritional status the need for dietary interventions that would improve fish health has become widely recognised as central to sustainable aquaculture and the future of industry.In fish as in other vertebrates immunity is typically divided intotwo distinct components the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response.

The adaptive immune response also relies on humoral and cellular mechanisms and is characterised by a specific antigen recognition that drives a stron- ger and faster secondary pathogen-specific immune response.

Microarray analysis clearly demonstrated that in the un- infected starved fish compared to the uninfected fed fish there was a clear decrease in many components of the immune system suggesting down-regulation of constitutive immune genes most likely as an energy conserving mechanism.
