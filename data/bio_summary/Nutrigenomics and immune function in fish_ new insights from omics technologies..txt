the relationship between diet and ontogeny of the immune system will also require the knowledge of both trans- generational epigenetic control of immune gene expression as well as life-long epigenetic control of immune genes expression established during the time of first feeding.

although great progress has been made to define the changes in host immune function understanding the interplay between fish nutrition intestinal microbiome and immune system is only just beginning to emerge.c 2017 the authors.

because the ability of fish to resist pathogens and cope with stress depends to a large extent on their nutritional status the need for dietary interventions that would improve fish health has become widely recognised as central to sustainable aquaculture and the future of industry.in fish as in other vertebrates immunity is typically divided intotwo distinct components the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response.

the adaptive immune response also relies on humoral and cellular mechanisms and is characterised by a specific antigen recognition that drives a stron- ger and faster secondary pathogen-specific immune response.

microarray analysis clearly demonstrated that in the un- infected starved fish compared to the uninfected fed fish there was a clear decrease in many components of the immune system suggesting down-regulation of constitutive immune genes most likely as an energy conserving mechanism.

overall the rna-seq showed the majority of transcripts to be down-regulated and within these a core group could be associated with immune function including components of the toll pathway inos lyso- zyme and peptidoglycan recognition protein 6. a number of complement genes were decreased in expression as were che- mokines and interleukins 17 and 22. together these two studies show how transcriptomics reveals the immune components that are affected even by a short-term food withdrawal and as such feeding regimes need to be carefully assessed not only during commercial production but also when laboratory-based chal- lenge experiments are being performed.s.a.m.

this study demonstrated an increased expression of genes associated with immune system in the liver with gene sets enriched for chemokine signalling and natural killer cell mediated toxicity but no disease challenge was performed and the data were not fully interrogated to examine immune function.

importantly the replacement of 66 of fish oil with vegetable oil in the diet of gilthead sea bream had no effects on the gut transcriptome in unchallenged fish but substantially altered the expression of immune genes in infected fish  highlighting the need for testing the novel diets in the context of exposure to pathogens.future perspectivesalthough the interplay between nutrition and immune system is well recognised basic and applied research on the interactions between diet and health in fish is lagging behind the mammalian studies.

other models include intestinal cell culture either primary or stable cell cultures that will help to explore the direct impacts of dietary components or microbial metabolites on intestinal immune capacity.many studies described in this review provide strong evidence for the interplay between nutrition and immunity at the level of innate immune components.

furthermore understanding the link between nutrition and adaptive immune system is essen- tial for developing strategies for oral vaccination and the improvement of antigen uptake and memory.the final future perspective is how these omics technologies can be integrated with the ambition of generating predictive models for diet immune system and health outcomes.
