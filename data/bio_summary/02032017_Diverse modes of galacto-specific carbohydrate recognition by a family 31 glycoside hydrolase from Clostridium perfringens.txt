Spectra on samples containing 100 mM CBM32-1 or 100 mM CBM32-2 were acquired in the absence of and presence of 8 mM GalNAc.

Subsequent quantitative analysis of NMR-based titrations performed with the three CpGH31 CBM32s using GalNAc as a ligand resulted in dissociation constants Kd of 6 - 2 mM 0.9 - 0.4 mM and 0.9 - 0.3 mM for the CpGH31 CBM32-1Gal- NAc CBM32-2GalNAc and CBM32-3GalNAc interactions respectively values consistent with those binding affinities previously reported for CBM32sugar interactions  -.General structural features of the CpGH31 CBM32 modulesThe structural basis of the preference for galacto-configured sugars displayed by the three CpGH31 CBM32 modules was investigated by determining the X-ray crystal structures of apo- CBM32-1 a CBM32-2GalNAc complex and CBM32-3 in apo- and in Gal- and GalNAc- bound forms.

Common among all three sites is the inclusion of one or more aromatic residues positioned to coordinate the b-face of the pyranose ring or to orient the C1 toward the solvent in order to discern terminal sugar moieties from longer glycan chains as well as several polar residues including conserved histidine residues His990 and His1671 in CBM32-1 and CBM32-3 respectively.
