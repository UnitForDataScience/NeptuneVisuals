subsequent quantitative analysis of nmr-based titrations performed with the three cpgh31 cbm32s using galnac as a ligand resulted in dissociation constants kd of 6 - 2 mm 0.9 - 0.4 mm and 0.9 - 0.3 mm for the cpgh31 cbm32-1gal- nac cbm32-2galnac and cbm32-3galnac interactions respectively values consistent with those binding affinities previously reported for cbm32sugar interactions  -.general structural features of the cpgh31 cbm32 modulesthe structural basis of the preference for galacto-configured sugars displayed by the three cpgh31 cbm32 modules was investigated by determining the x-ray crystal structures of apo- cbm32-1 a cbm32-2galnac complex and cbm32-3 in apo- and in gal- and galnac- bound forms.

the resulting gene products contained a non-cleavable n-terminal hexa-histidine tag the small fragment of the topo vector followed by the respective cpgh31 cbm32 sequence cbm32-1 residues 933-1095 cbm32-2 resi- dues 1300-1470 cbm32-3 residues 1640-1785. a cpgh31 cbm32-2 gene fragment encod- ing residues 1323-1470 of cpf1301 was also pcr amplified and subcloned into the ndei and xhoi sites of a pet28a expression vector encoding a cleavable hexa-histidine tag.

common among all three sites is the inclusion of one or more aromatic residues positioned to coordinate the b-face of the pyranose ring or to orient the c1 toward the solvent in order to discern terminal sugar moieties from longer glycan chains as well as several polar residues including conserved histidine residues his990 and his1671 in cbm32-1 and cbm32-3 respectively.

a subset of backbone amide resonances that corresponded to residues primarily grouped to four distinct regions of the cbm32-1 backbone were significantly perturbed upon addition of galnac including gln971 tyr972 ser973 asp975 his990 ser991 gln992 asp993 leu1015 gly1021 asn1022 gly1023 ser1024 ala1087 met1088 and glu1090 .when mapped onto the apo-cbm32-1 structure the four regions formed a contiguous site localized to variable loops located at the apex of the cbm comprising an aromatic residue tyr972 and several polar residues gln971 asp975 ser973 his990 gln992 asp993and asn1022 consistent with previously identified cbm32 carbohydrate-bindings sites  .saturation transfer difference std nmr spectroscopic analysis revealed strong std sig- nals for the apolar a- and b-h3 a- and b-h4 ab-h6 and acetyl group protons whereas the std signals of the h1 protons were attenuated see panel b in .

e comparison of the galnac binding sites of cpgh31 cbm32-1 grey select residues denoted and cpgh31 cbm32-3 magenta residues underlined reveal structural conservation of phe1985 and his990 with tyr1774 and his1671 respectively.

the variable loop regions of a cbm32-1 red b cbm32-2 orange and c cbm32-3 violet contain a similar complement of residues involved in the recognition of galnac green including one or more aromatic residues.

the structural conservation of key residues in the variable loop regions of cbm32-1 and cbm32-3 his990 phe1085 tyr972 and his1671 tyr1774 tyr1674 respectively allowed for galnac to be modeled into the binding site of cbm32-1.
