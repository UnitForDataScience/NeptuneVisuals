lastly we will turn our attention to dirty mice and wild rodents in natural settings.humanized mice rodents which mimic the human immune systemdesigning an immune system with human features within the mouse--generating humanized mice--has recently emerged as an approach to expand the areas where lab mice can be used to model disease.

in addition it will be exciting to see contributions from so far poorly explored model systems.the mice we use in experiments -- who are they and how do they livehere we will briefly cover definitions of nomenclature for referring to different types of mice from laboratory to wild rodents.classical inbred mice are defined as either being produced using at least 20 consecutive generations of sister x brother or parent x offspring matings or traceable to a single ancestral pair in the 20th or subsequent generation.

2016. other options for lab mice such as genetic crosses will be covered in the section humanized mice rodents which mimic the human immune system.we refer to wild rodents including wild mice e.g.

it is also easy to imagine a situation in which genetically modified mice obtained from one breeder or lab and control mice from other sources leads to unintended differences in microbiota composition with resulting influence on the outcome of infection experiments.protozoan infection experiments are influenced by microbiotaone early study pointing to the importance of microbiota for the establishment of a protozoan infection used germ- free mice which were infected with the intestinal parasite g. duodenalis torres et al.

in the following section we move from traditional genetically homogenous and inbred mice to mice manipulated to resemble aspects of the human immune system and then to genetic crosses between inbred and wild-derived mice.

musculus was significantly greater than lab-reared c57bl6 mice such that after immunization with a novel antigen wild- caught mice had higher concentrations of total igg and ige produced higher and more avid concentrations of antigen- specific igg and had greater activation of t helper cells macrophages and dendritic cells than lab-reared mice.
