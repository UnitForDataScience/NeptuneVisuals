Definition of TermsTermDefinitionReferencesStress and adaptationStressadaptation to stressThe term stress as used in biomedical literature was coined byHans Selye in the 1930s who defined it as 'the nonspecific response of the body to any demand for change'Cellular stress responseA set of cellular responses including the downregulation ofprotein synthesis and upregulation of transcription factors involved in defense and repair mechanisms common to all eukaryotes aimed at coping with various forms of stress also known as 'integrated stress response'HormesisBeneficial effects of low levels of stress ''what does not kill us makes us stronger''166141 150121Redox chemistry and biologyOxidative stressAn imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants leading to a disruption of redox signaling and control andor molecular damageReactive speciesCompounds with high chemical reactivity produced enzymatically or nonenzymatically the interaction of reactive species may produce other reactive speciesReactive oxygen species ROSChemically reactive compounds derived from oxygenReactive nitrogen species RNSChemically reactive compounds originating from the reaction ofnitric oxide with oxygen or oxygen-derived compounds Reactive sulfur species RSSAccording to Jacobs et al.

The RSI is a primeval multilevel redox regulatory system whose architecture together with the physicochemical characteristics of its constituents allows efficient sensing and rapid adaptation to environmental changes and various other stressors to enhance fitness and resilience at the local and whole-organism level.Critical Issues To better characterize the RSI-related processes that determine fluxes through specific pathways and enable integration it is necessary to disentangle the chemical biology and activity of reactive species including precursors and reaction products their targets communication systems and effects on cellular organ and whole-organism bioenergetics using system-levelnetwork analyses.Future Directions Understanding the mechanisms through which the RSI operates will enable a better appre- ciation of the possibilities to modulate the entire biological system moreover unveiling molecular signatures that1Cardiovascular Research Laboratory Department of Cardiology Pneumology and Angiology Medical Faculty Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Germany.2Department of Pathology and Medical Biology University Medical Center Groningen University of Groningen Groningen The Netherlands.3Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences University of Reading Reading United Kingdom.4Molecular Immunology and Toxicology National Institute of Oncology Budapest Hungary.5Department of Chemistry Johns Hopkins University Baltimore Maryland.6Department of Clinical Chemistry University of Bern and Calciscon AG Bern Switzerland.7Cancer and Inflammation Program National Cancer Institute National Institutes of Health Frederick Maryland.8Department of Chemistry Sonoma State University Rohnert Park California.9NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Center University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust Southampton United Kingdom.10Indiana University School of Medicine-South Bend South Bend Indiana.11Clinical and Experimental Sciences Faculty of Medicine Southampton General Hospital and Institute for Life Sciences University of Southampton Southampton United Kingdom.a Miriam M.

The reactive species interactome consists of the interaction of reactive species ROS RNS and RSS with one another and with cysteine thiols as redox switches reactions with other functional groups omitted here for the sake of simplicity.

However more often than not administration of antioxidants is ineffective suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying regulatory processes is incomplete.Recent Advances Similar to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species reactive sulfur species are now emerging as important signaling molecules targeting regulatory cysteine redox switches in proteins af- fecting gene regulation ion transport intermediary metabolism and mitochondrial function.

The fol- lowing section places emphasis on the role of sulfur in the evolution of redox metabolic systems how at a later stage O2 replaced some of the roles of sulfur as donor and acceptor of electrons for energy metabolism and signaling and how reac- tive species may have contributed to the evolution of life by enabling environmental sensing metabolic plasticity and cell- cell communication.

The use of multiple reactive species is in alignment with the need to keep the composition of the in- ternal environment Claude Bernard's milieu interieure relatively constant 83.RSI for sensing and metabolic plasticityThe ready availability of energy in a usable form is a fundamental requirement for survival and reproductive suc- cess.

The metabolic plasticity required for this re- sponsiveness in living organisms presumes the ability to se- curely cope with reactive species.

The dynamic and rapid equilibria among RSS and detoxifying systems have probably been one of the most powerful driving forces connecting cellular metabolic capacity with the extracellular milieu allowing cells to find multiple ways to survive and increase their robustness this may have included adaptation to changes in the environment and communication to other cells driving the emergence of symbiotic niches and the development of multicellular organisms.NO was the first among the reactive species to be proposed to have played a key role in intercellular communication and development of Life on Earth 56 well before the need to deal with the adverse consequences of rising atmospheric O2 levels in the form of unintentional cellular ROS generation 56.
