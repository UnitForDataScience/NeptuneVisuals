it has been proposed that an intermediate such as h2o2table 1. definition of termstermdefinitionreferencesstress and adaptationstressadaptation to stressthe term stress as used in biomedical literature was coined byhans selye in the 1930s who defined it as 'the nonspecific response of the body to any demand for change'cellular stress responsea set of cellular responses including the downregulation ofprotein synthesis and upregulation of transcription factors involved in defense and repair mechanisms common to all eukaryotes aimed at coping with various forms of stress also known as 'integrated stress response'hormesisbeneficial effects of low levels of stress ''what does not kill us makes us stronger''166141 150121redox chemistry and biologyoxidative stressan imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of the oxidants leading to a disruption of redox signaling and control andor molecular damagereactive speciescompounds with high chemical reactivity produced enzymatically or nonenzymatically the interaction of reactive species may produce other reactive speciesreactive oxygen species roschemically reactive compounds derived from oxygenreactive nitrogen species rnschemically reactive compounds originating from the reaction ofnitric oxide with oxygen or oxygen-derived compounds reactive sulfur species rssaccording to jacobs et al.

however more often than not administration of antioxidants is ineffective suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying regulatory processes is incomplete.recent advances similar to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species reactive sulfur species are now emerging as important signaling molecules targeting regulatory cysteine redox switches in proteins af- fecting gene regulation ion transport intermediary metabolism and mitochondrial function.

to rationalize the complexity of chemical interactions of reactive species with themselves and their targets and help define their role in systemic metabolic control we here introduce a novel integrative concept defined as the reactive species interactome rsi.

for example no biosynthesis can occur via three primary pathways involving nos enzymes that are dis- tinct with regard to their regulation and location 40 58. the generation of no2 from no is kinetically second order in no and first order in o2 indicating that significant no2 levels at least made via noo2 chemistry can only be produced in compartments possessing high levels of both precursors such as lipid membranes 115. of note nitrogen oxide-modified lipids containing nitrated fatty acids possess potent biological ac- tivities 156. moreover significant generation of onoo- re- quires that both no and o2- be made at the same place rate and time 96. this requirement makes onoo- generation rather difficult possibly protecting cells from inadvertent for- mation and narrowing its action radius.s-nitrosothiol formation can occur in several ways 37 65. one possibility is the reaction of a free thiol with a nitrosating species that is an entity that donates the equiv-explained by i the a-affect in which the electrons of the internal sulfur atom repel those of the external sulfur atom thus enhancing nucleophilic reactivity--a characteristic lacking in rsh and ii the pka of rssh typically being 1-2 units lower than analogous rsh species making the anionic rss- present in greater concentrations than rs- at physio- logical ph.rssh is also a more potent one- and two-electron reduc- tant than rsh.

generation of hydropersulfides from the corresponding thiol represents an oxidation an rssh species is at the same oxidation state as a disulfide rssr and can be mediated by several of the oxidants listedlast and perhaps most intriguing rssh are also electro-philic species whereas rsh are not.

the reactive species interactome consists of the interaction of reactive species ros rns and rss with one another and with cysteine thiols as redox switches reactions with other functional groups omitted here for the sake of simplicity.

however the use of selective antioxidants for redox diseases has not had the effect anticipated suggesting that our current understanding of the underlying pathophysi- ological processes is incomplete 26 176.recently jones and sies proposed that besides the genetic code allowing reproduction and defining heredity there exists a redox codei that identifies the regulatory elements and defines the principles through which biological function is enabled and protected 94. within this concept the en-iin this context the word ''code'' is used to describe a set of principles rather than a carrier of information like in the genetic code.dogenous production of reactive oxygen species ros is a highly regulated enzymatic process which serves the pur- pose of signaling and can lead to modification of cysteine redox switches.

chemical interactions of no with ros form reactive nitrogen species rns and constitute the basis for the for- mation of a multitude of additional oxidative signaling ele- ments 65 including the highly reactive and potentially damaging peroxynitrite onoo-.
