Two different nonparametric analyses were also employed to examine community differences including analysis of similarities ANOSIM and nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance adonis.Statistical analysisParticipants were grouped into the following three categories accord- ing to the degree of MBL found around their dental implantsi severe group n  36 MBL  1 mm ii moderate group n  36 0.5 mm  MBLo1 mm and iii normal group n  28 MBLo0.5 mm.

ANOVA one-way and post hoc least significant difference LSD were performed for multiple comparisons between the three different groups.Po0.05 between severe group and normal group Po0.05 betweenmoderate group and normal group.examined the differences using the observed OTUs the Chao index and the Shannon index and found no significant trends.

The numbers of species unique to each community from the normal moderate and severe groups were three two and four respectively.

All subjects were divided into three groups normal moderate and severe according to their MBL severities.

Porphyromonasgingivalis Treponemadenticola and Streptococcus intermedius were significantly more abundant in the moderate group andor severe group.

Compared with the normal group the relative abundance of species in the genus Treponema was significantly increased Po0.05 in the moderate group.
