Associ- ations have emerged between periodontitis and a growing list of chronic conditions including atherosclerosis diabetes and RA e.Association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal diseaseRA and periodontitis display some pathogenic similarities such as the host immune response leading to soft tissue inflammation with subsequent hard tissue destruction and certain risk factors including smoking and excess weight or obesity although some studies only show associations at specific stages of disease aetiology e. The significant RA risk attributed to the shared epitope HLA-DRb1 SE is well established  but associations of specific human leukocyte antigen HLA molecules with chronic periodontitis are unclear.Multiple studies have shown an epidemiological association between periodontitis and RA and these have been reviewed recently .

Conversely the damage associated with periodontitis is irreversible chronic inflammation within the supporting tissues of the teeth  and the consequent tissue destruction and gingival epithelial migration cause progressive attachment loss and bone loss characterised by periodontal pocket formation andor gingival recession .The most common form of periodontitis is chronic adult periodontitis which is assessed as mild moderate or severeadvanced depending on the extent of BOP periodontal pocket formation radio- graphic bone loss and CAL .

A recent study detected a weak association between ACPA seropositivity and periodontitis but there was none be- tween periodontitis and anti-carP seropositivity  although carbamylated proteins were detected in inflamed gingival tissues and MPO was elevated in periodontitis .Antibodies against proteins modified with malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde adducts MAA were elevated in patients with established RA and were associated with ACPA and RF detection .

The putative association between periodontitis and the development of RA raises the potential of finding novel predictive markers of disease and disease progres- sion and for periodontitis treatment to be included in the future as an adjunct to conventional RA immunotherapy or as part of a preventive strategy.Crown Copyright c 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The link between these conditions was further highlighted in a recent study where patients with periodontitis and arthralgia who later developed RA had higher levels of disease activity and were more likely to receive methotrexate at RA diagnosis compared to patients without periodontitis .Periodontal diseasesPeriodontal diseases are complex polymicrobial conditions resulting from an imbalance between the resident subgingival microbial communities which grow as biofilms adhered to the tooth and tissue surfaces and host responses to them.

Two RA- associated genes that function in Interferon-b IFN-b signalling were highlighted in cases of aggres- sive periodontitis as shared susceptibility factors but the aetiologies of aggressive and chronic peri- odontitis differ and the genetic contribution may be lesser in chronic periodontitis .Microbiology of periodontal diseasesPeriodontal pockets can reach a probing depth of up to 12 mm this stagnant and anaerobic site may harbour up to 108 diverse bacteria .

As periodontitis develops there is a transition from plaque dominated by gram-positive facultatively anaerobic species to communities that are dominated by obligately anaerobic proteolytic gram-negative rods and spirochaetes .Many organisms increase in abundance with the development of periodontitis and newly described potential pathogens are emerging .

Porphyromonas gingivalis may function as a keystone pathogen in chronic periodontitis playing a disproportionately important role by depressing and deregulating local immune responses increasing the virulence of the whole commu- nity and promoting the dysbiosis that is characteristic of periodontitis .

The authors propose this may be a unifying principle underlying the links between inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis and a range of systemic diseases including RA.SummaryMultiple studies have shown an epidemiological association between periodontitis and RA.
