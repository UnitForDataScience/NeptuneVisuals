have revealed that the combination of EGCG and piperine which was used to raise the bioavailability of EGCG show a positive antioxidative potential consecutively on the antioxidant enzymes GPO and SOD in immunohistochemical analysis confirming the notion with only EGCG .

evaluated the chemopreventive and molecular mechanism of dietary administration with AcEGCG which acted as a prodrug of EGCG to improve the biological activity and bioavailability of EGCG and EGCG in DSS-induced colitis in mice .

EGCG which accounts for almost 50 of the total catechins content of green tea extracts makes up to 30 of the dry weight of green tea leaves  and has the strongest chemopreventive potential containing anti-inflammatory anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic effects among the green tea catechins which contain EC EGC and EGCG .

In addition the dose of 0.3 EGCG in the rodent diet corresponds to a daily ingestion of 1.5 g EGCG for individuals with daily requirements of 2000 kcal .

However the detailed mechanisms by which EGCG promotes inflammation in animal models are not clear yet and it is probably related to the antiplatelet and antithrombotic activities of EGCG .

Through esterification with gallate groups flavanols can form EGCG the gallic acid ester of EGC at position 3 approximately half of total green tea catechins  and ECG approximately 13.6 of total green tea catechins  Figure .The catechins mainly comprise catechin EC ECG EGC and EGCG .

It has been found that ECG EGCG and some metabolites of EGCG can strongly inhibit the methylation of EGC .As we can see after GIT application catechins show a low absorption and bioavailability leading to a reduction of the effect on the tissues.

Whereas when pretreated with Ab the GSH content is reduced but after addition of EGCG the content of GSH will be restored again in BV2 cells  indicating that the reduction of EGCG is greater than that of GSH.

The activities of catalase can also be increased by EGCG EC through decreasing ROS malonedialdehyde MDA and protein carbonyls  but the exact mechanisms of EGCG on antioxidant enzymes are still unknown .

However it was previously reported that EGCG could reduce MPO activity indicating the reduction of neutrophil infiltration .In a study to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of EGCG on a DSS-induced murine colitis model by intragastric application which corresponded to applicable forms for humans the MPO was tested to assess the leukocyte infiltration.
