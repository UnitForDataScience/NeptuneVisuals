Here we demonstrate two commercial prebiotics inulin and short-chain fructo-oligosaccharide scFOS when applied onto intestinal epithelia in the absence of microbes directly promote barrier integrity toprevent pathogen-induced barrier disruptions.

Nevertheless the data presented herein with the complementary gut model systems demonstrate that in the absence of a functional microbiome prebiotics do exert direct protective effects on the integrity of the epithelial barrier to mitigate disruption trig- gered by exposure to an enteric microbial pathogen.In summary the findings of this study show that prebiotics modulate host cell signaling to promote epithe- lial barrier integrity by direct effects on the intestinal mucosa.

a Caco-2Bbe1 monolayers n 3 and intestinal organoids n 3 were treated with inulin 10 wv or scFOS 10 wv for the indicated time periods 15-480 min and blotted for phospho-panPKC.b Caco-2Bbe1 monolayers were treated with varying doses 0-15 wv of inulin or scFOS at 15 minutes of exposure n 4. c Inulin 10 wv and scFOS 10 wv induced phosphorylation of PKCd after 15 min exposure in Caco-2Bbe1 cells n 4. d In Caco-2Bbe1 cells pretreated with PKCd inhibitor rottlerin 1 3 and 5 mM 1 h inulin and scFOS showed diminished phospho-panPKC response at 5 mM n 4.

One such strategy is the use of dietary prebiotics which are non-digestible food ingredients that resist absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and are fermented by selected intestinal microbes to stimulate the growth and activities of health-promoting gut microbes including Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria.Fructans are a group of carbohydrates that fall under the definition of prebiotics and include inulin and fruc- tooligosaccharides FOS which are plant-derived polysaccharides comprised of fructose monomers connected via b2-1 glycosidic bonds linked to a terminal glucose residue.

Inulin and scFOS reduce EHEC O157H7-induced barrier disruption in Caco-2Bbe1 monolayers.a Polarized Caco-2Bbe1 monolayers were treated in duplicates with inulin or scFOS 10 wv 16 h prior to infection with EHEC 107 CFU 5 h. Both prebiotics attenuated EHEC-induced decrease in TER and maintained barrier function n 5. b FITC-dextran 10 kDa was added apically to monolayers and signalintensities of translocation were measured from the basolateral culture media and expressed as absolute dextranquantities in nanograms n 5. c Representative immunofluorescent micrographs of ZO-1 organization in Caco-2Bbe1 monolayers n 3.

While both inulin and scFOS induced MAPK signaling in contrast to the effects observed using Caco-2Bbe1 cells the panPKC phosphorylation response to inulin or scFOS was not evident using organoids.Figure 4.

Prebiotics could well elicit differential effects on tissues across various regions of the intestinal tract and thus it is likely that diverse mechanisms of action could be responsible for the barrier function effects seen when using transformed cell lines versus primary intestinal organoids.

d Transwell- grown intestinal organoids were incubated with inulin and scFOS 10 16 h and then challenged with EHEC MOI100 10 h. Both inulin and scFOS increased the TER of EHEC-challenged cells n 5-7. e EHEC challenge was continued for 35 h to induce dextran permeability and signal intensities of translocation were measured from the basolateral culture media and expressed as percentage of EHEC-control n 3.

Taken together these results indicate that PKCd activity is required for the protective effects of inulin and scFOS on epithelial barrier integrity.DiscussionAlthough it is generally recognized that prebiotics affect human health by altering the gut microbiota much less is known about the extent of direct effects on the host mucosal surface.

These results suggest that in the absence of microbiota prebiotics can directly exert barrier protective effects by activating host cell signaling in the intestinal epithelium which represents a novel alternative mechanism of action of prebiotics.The essential role of the gut microbiota in human health and disease has stimulated increasing interest in ther- apeutic strategies to alter microbial composition.
