Patients who had the same type of IBD as their affected family member were considered to have a concordant family history andthose with the other type of IBD were labelled as having a discordant family history.Our primary end point in both CD and UC was severe disease defined as needing IBD-related surgery.

In CD five SNPs were differently distributed between sporadic and familial CD with a p-value  0.01 SupplementaryAny family history close or distant1.48 1.07-2.03 First-degree relative with CD1.82 1.19-2.78Second-degree relative with CD1.17 0.79-1.72 Any relative with UC discordant0.66 0.42-1.02CD Crohn's disease UC ulcerative colitis.aAdjusted for disease location age at diagnosis and duration of disease.affected family member had UC 29 vs 32 years p  0.01 but not CD 30 vs 31 years p  0.70.Complicated Crohn's diseaseOn univariate analysis CD patients with a family history were more likely to have complicated disease 56 vs 48 OR 1.35 95 CI 1.05-1.73.

Among CD patients a positive family history for CD was associated with an increased risk for complicated disease in the presence of an affected family member odds ratio OR 1.48 95 confidence interval CI 1.07-2.03.

In the general population a history of IBD in a first- or second-degree family member increases risk of incident disease 8-fold and 2-fold respectively.Many stud- ies have examined the impact of family history on disease risk but fewer have examined if this history influences disease course in the index patient.

In addition previous studies often failed to examine the impact of proximity of the relationship of the affected family member or concordance for type of IBD.Identifying the impact of family history on the natural his-tory of IBD may also have prognostic implications allowing for risk stratification and prediction of disease-related complications.

In CD this association was noted irrespective of the con- cordance for type of IBD concordant family history 26 vs 28 years p  0.03 discordant family history 25 vs 28 years p  0.02.

In both CD and UC multivariable analysis adjusting for disease behaviour in addition to location age at diag- nosis and disease duration yielded no statistically significant associ- ation between family history and need for IBD-related surgery CD 1.04 95 CI 0.75-1.43 UC 1.10 95 CI 0.67-1.79 suggestingthat the influence of family history on IBD surgery was mediated through effect on age of onset and disease behaviour.

Among those with an involved first-degree relative two families-Lachnospiraeceae and Erysipelotrichaceae species Eubacterum dolichum -were more abundant in those with a family history whereas the genus Streptococcus was less common than in those with sporadic IBD.DiscussionInflammatory bowel diseases are complex and heterogeneous in their natural history and are multifactorial in origin with genetics and consequently family history being a strong risk factor for inci- dent disease.

The proportion with a positive family history in our study is similar to that noted in other studies as is the concordance for type of IBD.A key clinical observation from our study is that a positive family history was associated with stricturing or penetrating CD and an earlier age of diagnosis and through these influences greater need for IBD-related surgery.

which included 71 studies of UC reported that a positive family history was more common in those with a younger age at diagnosis a finding also supported by a cohort from Korea.The effect of family history on disease outcomes has yielded more conflicting results.
