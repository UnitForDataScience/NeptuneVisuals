patients who had the same type of ibd as their affected family member were considered to have a concordant family history andthose with the other type of ibd were labelled as having a discordant family history.our primary end point in both cd and uc was severe disease defined as needing ibd-related surgery.

the association was also stronger when the family history was con- cordant for type of ibd 34 vs 27 p  0.002 than discordant 26 vs 29 p  0.51. in both cd and uc multivariable analysis adjusting for disease behaviour in addition to location age at diag- nosis and disease duration yielded no statistically significant associ- ation between family history and need for ibd-related surgery cd 1.04 95 ci 0.75-1.43 uc 1.10 95 ci 0.67-1.79 suggestingthat the influence of family history on ibd surgery was mediated through effect on age of onset and disease behaviour.

among first-degree relatives the association was stronger when the affected family member was a sibling consistent with previous studies dem- onstrating that siblings are at highest risk to develop ibd owing to being most genetically similar.family history and complicated disease in ibd5familialsporadic4035302520151050overall1st degree2nd degreeconcordantdiscordantfigure 1. likelihood of disease-related surgery among patients with crohn's disease stratified by concordance and proximity of affected family member.20015010050000.0050.01weighted genetic risk score0.015figure 2. comparison of inflammatory bowel disease genetic risk score between familial and sporadic disease.there are limited data on whether having an affected family member influences disease course in the index patient.

in the general population a history of ibd in a first- or second-degree family member increases risk of incident disease 8-fold and 2-fold respectively.many stud- ies have examined the impact of family history on disease risk but fewer have examined if this history influences disease course in the index patient.

in addition previous studies often failed to examine the impact of proximity of the relationship of the affected family member or concordance for type of ibd.identifying the impact of family history on the natural his-tory of ibd may also have prognostic implications allowing for risk stratification and prediction of disease-related complications.

patients with familial ibd had a younger age at diagnosis than those with sporadic ibd both for cd 25.5 vs 28.4 years p  0.0006 and uc 29.4 vs 31.8 years p  0.01. in cd this association was noted irrespective of the con- cordance for type of ibd concordant family history 26 vs 28 years p  0.03 discordant family history 25 vs 28 years p  0.02. however in uc an earlier age of diagnosis was only noted when thecd crohn's disease uc ulcerative colitis ibd inflammatory bowel diseases sd standard deviation.

among those with an involved first-degree relative two families-lachnospiraeceae and erysipelotrichaceae species eubacterum dolichum -were more abundant in those with a family history whereas the genus streptococcus was less common than in those with sporadic ibd.discussioninflammatory bowel diseases are complex and heterogeneous in their natural history and are multifactorial in origin with genetics and consequently family history being a strong risk factor for inci- dent disease.

the proportion with a positive family history in our study is similar to that noted in other studies as is the concordance for type of ibd.a key clinical observation from our study is that a positive family history was associated with stricturing or penetrating cd and an earlier age of diagnosis and through these influences greater need for ibd-related surgery.

which included 71 studies of uc reported that a positive family history was more common in those with a younger age at diagnosis a finding also supported by a cohort from korea.the effect of family history on disease outcomes has yielded more conflicting results.

in contrast to these findings and consistent with our observations of the associ- ation between family history and disease severity two larger stud- ies from korea noted more anti-tnf use and higher risk for cd-related surgery in those with a positive family history com- pared with sporadic disease.

we found that a member of the ruminococcus family was more common in individuals with a family history of cd.

assessment of family history was done by a detailed questionnaire and we were unable to review records of family members to confirm diagnosis or ascertain ibd phenotype in relatives.
