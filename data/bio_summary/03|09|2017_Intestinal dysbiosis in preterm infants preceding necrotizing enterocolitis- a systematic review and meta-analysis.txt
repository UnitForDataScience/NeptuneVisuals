the secondary objective is to explore heterogeneity among studies that might explain inconsistency in the reported results.methodswe performed our systematic review according to the recommended preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses prisma guidelines 23 and meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiologymoose consensus statement 4. we followed previ- ously published methods for the meta-analyses of micro- biome data .inclusion criteriaprospective or retrospective case-control or cohort studies were included if they evaluated the neonatal intestinal microbiome in preterm infants with nec compared to those infants without nec using culture- independent molecular techniques and reported a and b-diversity metrics and microbial profiles.we searched for eligible studies using the cochrane neonatal review group's cnrg search strategy   without language restriction in april 2016. search strategy and databases searched are outlined in additional file data collection and analysesall titles and abstracts identified by our search strategy were screened for relevance by mp and those deemed relevant were retrieved in full and evaluated for inclu- sion eligibility by mp and jn independently.

studies by normann and torraza showed significant increase in proportion of sequences of firmicutes and significant decrease in proportion of sequences of proteobacteria compared to other studies p  0.05we assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias in the 14 included studies by the key components of study design which has been deemed to be more important than assigning quality scores in observational studies the methodological quality of the included observational studies was adequate all studies had appropriate comparison groups reported all our pre- specified outcomes and results were plausible given the study limitations.

ten out of 14 included studies addressed the issue of confounding by matching or stratification to avoid known confoundersaone nec sample was tissue sample and was obtained post-mortembdgge was performed in 23 infants and pyrosequencing was performed in a subset of 12 infants 6 of whom had nec or sepsiscmolecular assessment of stools by dgge was assessed in only 27 infants out of 38 16 infants with nec or sepsis and 11 control infantsinvestigating the role of diet i.e.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.backgroundnecrotizing enterocolitis nec is a catastrophic disease that is a major cause of mortality in preterm infants who survive the first few days after birth nec occurs in 7 of infants born at less than 1500 g and up to 5 of admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit - nec is associated with a high mortality 15-30 and long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity the pathogenesis of nec is not clear and a unifying concept is lacking but microbial dysbiosis formula feed- ing and excessive inflammation have all been implicated -compared to term infants the intestinal micro- biota of preterm infants has fewer bacterial species less diversity and increased proportions of potential patho- gens the microbial dysbiosis hypothesis of nec is supported by the fact that nec cannot be produced in germ free animals   and by an association between early antibiotic use and nec  immune dysregulation in association with microbial dysbiosis including excessive toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 signaling in response to lipopolysaccharide lps - and an exaggerated inflammatory response  have been reported but these are largely animal data.technological advances and availability of new mo- lecular and analytic techniques such as those used in human microbiome project have provided greater resolution in the evaluation of the neonatal intes- tinal microbiome.

as such differences in diversity may serve as a proxy for overrepresentation or underrep- resentation of small number of organisms and are discussed later in the paper.table 1 table of excluded studiesstudyreason for exclusionschwiertz 2003 a study of 29 preterm infants by pcr-dgge analysis of which only one case of nec was observed.no comparison of nec and controls.bjorkstorm 2009 only stool cultures and fecal calprotectin were measured.latuga 2011 a study of eleven elbw infants was excluded as there were no direct comparison of nec and controls.morowitz 2011 community genomic analysis at the strain level in one premature infant was excluded because the study did not compare nec and controls.sharon 2013 time shifts in community genomics was excluded because the study did not compare nec and controls.carlisle 2013 a review was excluded.grishin 2013 a review was excluded.torraza 2013 a review was excluded.taft 2014 description of the microbiome in preterm infants without nec or sepsis and not a comparison of nec with controls.raveh-sadka 2015 not a comparison of nec with controls.results of the meta-analysesnine of 14 studies included in the systematic review pro- vided sequence and clinical metadata for both the nec cases and control patients.

studies evaluating the microbiome in nec and preterm infants lack power and have reported inconsistent results.methods and results our objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analyses of stool microbiome profiles in preterm infants to discern and describe microbial dysbiosis prior to the onset of nec and to explore heterogeneity among studies.

indeed investigators have reported somewhat differing composition and varying phylogenetic divergence multiple hyper- variable regions were sequenced on the same samples simultaneously leading to differential detection of members of prevotella fusobacterium eubacterium enterococcus streptococcus granulicatella bacteroides porphyromonas and treponema  .these studies were performed in different locations and hospitals and recent studies have highlighted the role of geographical differences in the intestinal micro- biota of preterm infants we were unable to explore heterogeneity resulting from differences in dna extrac- tion protocols and sample processing methods due to considerable variation in included studies.

otu richness was significantly different between control infants with and without antibiotics as was sdi between control infants with antibiotics and nec infants with antibiotics additional file fig.

the canadian network study suggested a bimodal distribution for the onset of nec in preterm infants with an early onset and a late onset nec nec occurred later after birth in infants born at younger gestational ages and earlier after birth in infants born at later gestational ages.

this may represent the transition beyond the perinatally acquired microbiome which may be influ- enced by mode of delivery the nicu environment feeding antibiotic exposure or other factors and warrants further study.a patterned progression of the intestinal microbiome has been observed in preterm infants in a study of 922 16s rrna sequence libraries from 58 infants a patterned progression of bacterial classes from bacilli to gammaproteobacteria and then to clostridia was described and by cga 33-36 weeks the communities were well populated by anaerobes we were unable to demonstrate this patterned progression in our meta- analysis due to lack of associated meta-data in some studies.

this may coincide with the proteobacterial bloom preceding nec our observations support the results of studies that report association of prior antibiotic use with increased incidence of nec   though we were not able to take into account various classes of antibiotics which have been reported to be determinants of intra-gut bacter- ial community structure 1. we also sought taxo- nomic differences by mode of delivery cesarean section or vaginal delivery and found no differences in nec infants but observed increased relative abun- dances of firmicutes after cesarean section and increased relative abundances of bacteroides after vaginal delivery in control infants.

most studies on the human micro- biome do not have sufficient power to detect clinically important differences previously reported micro- biome studies on nec in preterm infants may have been underpowered to detect differences and have reported inconsistent results.

we systematically reviewed studies that reported the intestinal microbiome in preterm infants who developed nec in relation to controls and performed a meta-analysis of 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna gene sequence data from eight of the included studies.

significant differences in beta-diversity metrics between nec cases and controls were reported by six studies two of which were fingerprinting-based   and four were based on sequencing small pools of pcr amplification prod- ucts  reported microbial profiles preceding nec in preterm infants were variable across the 14 included studies.
