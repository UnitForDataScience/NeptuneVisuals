Ten out of 14 included studies addressed the issue of confounding by matching or stratification to avoid known confoundersaOne NEC sample was tissue sample and was obtained post-mortembDGGE was performed in 23 infants and pyrosequencing was performed in a subset of 12 infants 6 of whom had NEC or sepsiscMolecular assessment of stools by DGGE was assessed in only 27 infants out of 38 16 infants with NEC or sepsis and 11 control infantsInvestigating the role of diet i.e.

Studies by Normann and Torraza showed significant increase in proportion of sequences of Firmicutes and significant decrease in proportion of sequences of Proteobacteria compared to other studies p  0.05We assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias in the 14 included studies by the key components of study design which has been deemed to be more important than assigning quality scores in observational studies The methodological quality of the included observational studies was adequate All studies had appropriate comparison groups reported all our pre- specified outcomes and results were plausible given the study limitations.

As such differences in diversity may serve as a proxy for overrepresentation or underrep- resentation of small number of organisms and are discussed later in the paper.Table 1 Table of excluded studiesStudyReason for exclusionSchwiertz 2003 A study of 29 preterm infants by PCR-DGGE analysis of which only one case of NEC was observed.No comparison of NEC and controls.Bjorkstorm 2009 Only stool cultures and fecal calprotectin were measured.LaTuga 2011 A study of eleven ELBW infants was excluded as there were no direct comparison of NEC and controls.Morowitz 2011 Community genomic analysis at the strain level in one premature infant was excluded because the study did not compare NEC and controls.Sharon 2013 Time shifts in community genomics was excluded because the study did not compare NEC and controls.Carlisle 2013 A review was excluded.Grishin 2013 A review was excluded.Torraza 2013 A review was excluded.Taft 2014 Description of the microbiome in preterm infants without NEC or sepsis and not a comparison of NEC with controls.Raveh-Sadka 2015 Not a comparison of NEC with controls.Results of the meta-analysesNine of 14 studies included in the systematic review pro- vided sequence and clinical metadata for both the NEC cases and control patients.

We followed previ- ously published methods for the meta-analyses of micro- biome data .Inclusion criteriaProspective or retrospective case-control or cohort studies were included if they evaluated the neonatal intestinal microbiome in preterm infants with NEC compared to those infants without NEC using culture- independent molecular techniques and reported a and b-diversity metrics and microbial profiles.We searched for eligible studies using the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group's CNRG search strategy   without language restriction in April 2016.

Indeed investigators have reported somewhat differing composition and varying phylogenetic divergence multiple hyper- variable regions were sequenced on the same samples simultaneously leading to differential detection of members of Prevotella Fusobacterium Eubacterium Enterococcus Streptococcus Granulicatella Bacteroides Porphyromonas and Treponema  .These studies were performed in different locations and hospitals and recent studies have highlighted the role of geographical differences in the intestinal micro- biota of preterm infants We were unable to explore heterogeneity resulting from differences in DNA extrac- tion protocols and sample processing methods due to considerable variation in included studies.

OTU richness was significantly different between control infants with and without antibiotics as was SDI between control infants with antibiotics and NEC infants with antibiotics Additional file Fig.

The Canadian network study suggested a bimodal distribution for the onset of NEC in preterm infants with an early onset and a late onset NEC NEC occurred later after birth in infants born at younger gestational ages and earlier after birth in infants born at later gestational ages.

Studies evaluating the microbiome in NEC and preterm infants lack power and have reported inconsistent results.Methods and results Our objectives were to perform a systematic review and meta-analyses of stool microbiome profiles in preterm infants to discern and describe microbial dysbiosis prior to the onset of NEC and to explore heterogeneity among studies.
