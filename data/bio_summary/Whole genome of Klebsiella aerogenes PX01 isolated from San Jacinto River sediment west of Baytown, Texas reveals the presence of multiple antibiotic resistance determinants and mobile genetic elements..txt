Data in BriefWhole genome of Klebsiella aerogenes PX01 isolated from San Jacinto River sediment west of Baytown Texas reveals the presence of multiple antibiotic resistance determinants and mobile genetic elementsRupa Iyer Brian Iken Ashish Damaniaa Center for Life Sciences Technology Department of Engineering Technology University of Houston Houston TX USAb Department of Tropical Medicine-Pediatrics Baylor College of Medicine Houston TX USAA B S T R A C T Klebsiella aerogenes is a Gram-negative bacterium of the family Enterobacteriaceae which is widely distributed in water air and soil.

Hospital outbreaks due to K. aerogenes is often related to the acquisition of novel antibiotic resistance determinants through mobile genetic elements as well as constitutive b-lactamase overexpression .The genome of Klebsiella aerogenes PX01 includes a circular bacterial chromosome with a GC content of 65.09 consists of 5224354 bp and a single plasmid of 38598 bp.

Here we report the draft genome sequence chromosome and 1 plasmid of K. aerogenes strain PX01 compiled at the scaffold level from 97 contigs totaling 5262952 bp.

K. aerogenes PX01 was isolated from sediment along the northern face of Burnet Bay west of Baytown Texas.

aerogenes PX01 genome statistics.Assembly statistics and the Rapid Annotation System Technology RAST server identified the unknown bacterium as Klebsiella aerogenes .

Combined the total genome of PX01 contains approximately 5265 gene sequences 5123 coding sequences including 41 rRNAs and 89 tRNAs.

Secondary sub- systems with over 100 genes identified through RAST are principally survival and stress response oriented and include both cell wall and capsule production as well as antibiotic resistance and virulence.

Subsystem category distribution of major protein coding genes of Enterobacter aerogenes strain PX01 as annotated by the RAST annotation server.

In addition this strain harbors a minimum of 46 prophage related sequences located on the bacterial chromosome suggesting a possible vehicle for lateral transfer to and from this bac- terial strain.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.AcknowledgementsWhole genome sequencing of Enterobacter aerogenes PX01 was funded through NIST G110008 58106.ReferencesB.
