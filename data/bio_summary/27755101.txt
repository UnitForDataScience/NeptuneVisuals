His analysis of 145 US participants 41 untreated individuals with HIV 51 antiretroviral therapyART- treated individuals and 53 uninfected individuals suggests that 1 many of the microbiome alterations that have been documented in association with HIV infection - including a loss of anti-inflammatory bacteria- are also present among uninfected men who have sex with men and practice high-risk behaviors and 2 even controlling for this observation HIV infection is associated with a loss of anti-inflammatory bacteria.

These results suggest 'that gut microbiota could be driving disease progression in HIV-infected individuals and potentially putting high-risk individuals at even greater risk of contracting HIV' says Palmer.Rob Knight Professor University of California San Diego Cofounder American Gut Project observes 'These results show how living with HIV long term changes our microbiome in ways that result in chronic inflammation.

In particular the 'gut microbiota composition of HIV-infected subjects in the US is more similar to that of individuals living in agrarian societies rather than those that eat a western diet.

We also expect that recruitment of individuals in Zimbabwe will lead to enrollment of subjects with more advanced immunodeficiency and AIDS a cohort that is difficult to recruit in the US because of access to ART.
