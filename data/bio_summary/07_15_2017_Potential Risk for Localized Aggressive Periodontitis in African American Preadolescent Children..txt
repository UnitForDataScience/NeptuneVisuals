These findings demonstrated for the first time that AfAm and Hispanic adolescents that carried oral Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans Aa bacteria had a one in five chance of developing serious bone loss at an early age that leads to tooth loss.Polymerase chain reaction PCR has revolutionized the ability to detect specific bacterial species from biologic samples such as from the oral cavity.

The children received anticipatory guidance a professional fluoride treatment customized oral hygiene guidance upon dental examination and oral sample collection.Limited periodontal exams that involved collecting periodontal parameters e.g.

Further study is indicated however the usefulness of PCR in dental practice setting to assess risk may be cost-effective for early diagnosis and prevention of LAgP.Corresponding Author Dr. Noel K.

There is currently limited dental care available to youths in this communityChilders et al.Page 3which requires travelling thirty miles for dental care.

The sequences of the forward and reverse primers were5'-ATGACAGAACACACGGAACAAGCACCG-3'Childers et al.Page 45'-GCAAATGCA ATTAAGCAGCTTATGGAAATTAAAGGTTTGCG-3' respectivelyresulting in a 331-bp amplicon.

Collection analysis and annotation of sequence information derived from microbiome studies was as described by Kumar et al201414.

However the percent of sites with bleeding on probing BOP andChilders et al.Page 5pocket depth PD that was greater than or equal to four mm were significantly greater among Aa carriers Fig.
