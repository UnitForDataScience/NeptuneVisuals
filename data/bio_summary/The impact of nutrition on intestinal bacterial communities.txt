while there is clear evidence for the impact of specific dietary components on the gut microbiota in the short-term we also know that inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition before a dietary intervention can affect responses to dietary change  factors underlying inter-individual microbiota variation are not yet fully understood and may include host genotype early colonisation environmental acquisition disease states and medication but it is becoming increasingly apparent that long-term dietary habits also play a crucial role in creating inter-individual variation in microbiota composition.

examples are ruminococcus bromii a bacterium able to degrade raw starch particles  champanellensis the only human gut bacterium so far show to degrade crystalline cellulose  which produce extra- cellular amylosome and cellulosome complexesfigure 1factors likely to be involved in the impact of dietary fibre intake upon gut microbiota composition in humans.in addition to direct growth stimulation changes in gut transit and microbial metabolites largely via effects on scfa concentrations and gut ph are likely to be involved in mediating shifts on microbiota composition.the activities of primary degraders of such insoluble substrates release energy in the form of breakdown pro- ducts and metabolites that support the growth of other members of the community via cross-feeding .

this is not only because diet composition determines the supply of substrates for microbial growth in the form of dietary residue mainly fibre that reaches the large intestine but also because of impacts on gut transit and the gut environment.

dietary fibre intake increases fermentation and short chain fatty acid produc- tion and also influences gut transit with consequences for absorption and gut ph  .

offered to explain why faecal scfa are reported to increase in response to increased intake of dietary fibre and starch notably in rural african populations 'permissive microbiota'  whereas such an increase was not observed in a dietary intervention in a us population 'restrictive microbiota'  lier urbanized populations do not generally achieve the non-digestible carbohydrate intake levels typical of rural african and amerindian populations  esis implies that the higher overall microbiota diversity reported from rural african and amerindian communities will include many 'keystone species' that are not repre- sented in the gut microbiota of urbanised populations with high levels of antibiotic use and caesarian birth .

better understanding of the metabolic capabilities and host-interactions of dominant members of the gut microbiota will aid our ability to improve human health through diet.addressrowett institute university of aberdeen foresterhill aberdeen uk corresponding author flint harry j introductionmost surveys of gut microbiota composition are based on high throughput analysis of nucleic acid sequences from faecal samples.

second we know remarkably little about the survival of anaerobic gut bacteria outside the gut or their ability to be transmitted between individuals and to recolonize following loss from the microbiota.

however the discovery that many of the dominant gut anaerobes previously classified as 'non- sporing' can in fact form resistant spores under challeng- ing environmental conditions should spark a re-examina- tion of these questions what impact does microbiota composition have on gut metabolitessome metabolic capabilities show very limited phyloge- netic distribution for example methane formation which correlates well with numbers of methanogenic archaea in different human subjects .

a multiplicity of factors may be relevant including genotypes antibiotic use and inoculafrom the environment  but differences in dietary intake are frequently offered as an explanation for such variation in gut microbiota composition.

the availability of carbohydrates as the main energy sources for microbial growth offers opportunities for ben- eficial manipulation of the microbiota and is considered further below.bacterial utilization of nd carbohydrates the spectacular increase in genome sequence information for cultured representatives of thegut microbiota should be of great help in predicting the responses of gut bacteria to dietary factors especially changes in the intake of different non-digestible carbohydrates.

interestingly a recent survey reported that stool consistency which is likely to be related to gut transit was the variable most reliably correlated with inter-individual differences in fae- cal microbiota composition much non-digestible dietary fibre arrives in the large intestine in the form of insoluble complex particles plant fragments starch particles rather than as soluble carbo- hydrate.

total bacterial counts on the left and proportion not accounted for by fish probes on the right are shown in light grey.conclusionsthe finding that dietary changes produce reproducible shifts in the phylogenetic make-up of the gut microbiota across different individuals implies considerable conservation of ecological and nutritional characteristics within phylogenetic groups of bacteria.

nevertheless many of the mechanisms that drive short and long-term dietary effects on the microbiota are likely to be common to both which should make it easier to research them and also to reverse the deleterious effects of poor diets.acknowledgement.. the authors receive support from the scottish government food land and people research programme.references and recommended readingpapers of particular interest published within the period of review have been highlighted asof special interest.. of outstanding interest gut microbiota analysis revealing major differences between africanamerican and rural african volunteers.

such studies vary in the degree of dietary control with some relying only on dietary recommendation and some providing defined supplements to volunteers following their habitual diets.

only a few studies have controlled complete dietary intake over a period of time in human volunteers thus minimizing the influence of background variations in dietary intake  walker et al.
