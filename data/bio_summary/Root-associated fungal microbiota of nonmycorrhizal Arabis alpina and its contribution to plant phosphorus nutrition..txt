The effect of the soil's geographical origin PERMANOVA P  10-4 21 of variance decreased from the bulk soil 67 of variance over the rhizosphere 49 to the root compartment 30 whereas the P-fertilization effect overall was smaller PERMANOVA P  10-4 6.3 of variance and stable across the three compartments 14 13 and 15 of variance in bulk soil rhizosphere and root communities respectively SI Appendix Table S3.

B Relative abundance of the 15 highly conserved root OTUs in each root sample.

However under low-P conditions fungal inoculation significantly increased root length 12 t test P  0.02 and root surface area 19 t test P  0.001 while leaving shoot biomass t test P  0.05 and shoot P concentration t test P  0.05 unchanged SI Appendix Fig.

bulk soil rhizosphere or root compart- ment dropping dramatically in the root Fig.

2B suggesting not only that these taxa were able to cross the selection barrier imposed by the root but also that they reached a higher abundance within the root endosphere implying some degree of adaptation to this niche.

While Helotiales fungi represented 24 of the A. alpina root microbiome they were not commonly found in root microbiomes of the mycorrhizal hosts Agave 20 poplar 18 or sugar cane 19.

3B rather than killing root cells during the infection process coinciding with the root enrichment of the corresponding OTU Fig.

Highly conserved root OTUs 85 prevalence across all root samples are given in Dataset S4.

Roots were precluded from growing into the HC by regularly moving root tips before root ingrowth thus maintaining the physical barrier between both compartments Fig.

Using amplicon sequenc- ing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 we studied the root and rhizosphere fungal communities of A. alpina growing under natural and controlled conditions including low-P soils and identified a set of 15 fungal taxa consistently detected in its roots.
