For the colon digesta the Shannon diversity indices in the ELP group was significantly lower P  0.05 than the LP group and for colon mucosa the Shannon diversity in the ELP group was signifi- cantly lower P  0.05 than the NP and LP groups.

Results indicate that moderate reduction of CP level in diet may strength the bacterial community structure but the ELP group 13.90 CP decreased these effects.Changes of main bacterial counts in intestinal digesta under different CP dietsReal-time PCR quantification revealed that the CP level did not affect the total bacteria counts in the ileum cecum and colon digesta Table .

Cecal p-cresol was linearly increased linear P  0.05 as the CP level decreased Table .These results indicate that moderate reducing dietary CP with supplementary crystalline EAA increased bacterialTable 4Quantification of ammonia and microbial protein in the ileum cecum and colon digesta of pigs fed different CP level diets supplemented with EAA n  8Means in the same row with different letters differ P  0.05MCP microbial crude proteinTable 5Quantification of biogenic amines concentration mmolg in the ileum cecum and colon digesta of pigs fed different CP level diets supplemented with EAA n  8Means in the same row with different letters differ P  0.05ND not detecteddecarboxylation and increased the amines production while the extreme CP level would reduce the microbial activity on protein fermentation.PLS-DA analyzed microbial community and bacterial metabolitesTo assess how the overall bacterial community and metabo- lites were affected by dietary protein level we performed PLS-DA on the bacterial community diversity and counts and metabolites concentration in the ileum cecum and colon Fig.

The higher serum lysine in the pigs fed the ELP diet is indicative of a reduction of the lysine fermentation in this group.

Pigs in the ELP group had lower P  0.05 concentrations of T-SCFA and acetate than pigs fed NP diet and had lower P  0.05 valerate concentration than pigs in other groups.

The ileal ammonia concentration in the ELP groupP  0.05 and the cecal P  0.05 and colonic P  0.05 am- monia concentration in the LP and ELP groups were significantly lower compared to those in the NP group.

Pigs with moderately reduced CP level had increased bacterial di- versity with the Shannon diversity indices for the colon digesta in the LP group and mucosa in the MP and LP groups significantly P  0.05 higher than those in the NP and ELP groups.

As the CP level reduces the Bifidobacterium popula- tion were linearly decreased P  0.05 both in ileum cecum and colon and the ELP group had the lowest Bifidobacterium population in the cecum and colon with its value significantlyElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article doi6 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

The digesta content and intestinal mucosa samples were transferred into sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at -80 degC.DNA extraction PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR analysesThe total DNA in intestine digesta was extracted from 0.3 g fresh intestinal luminal content using the bead-beating and phenol-chloroform extraction method as previously described Zoetendal et al.
