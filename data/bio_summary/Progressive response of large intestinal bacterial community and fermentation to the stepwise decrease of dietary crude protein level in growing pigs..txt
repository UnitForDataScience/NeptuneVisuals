compared to those in the np group pigs in the lp and elp groups significantly increased the concentration of t-scfa p  0.05 and butyrate p  0.05 while de- creased the concentration of propionate p  0.05. pigs in the elp group had higher p  0.05 concentrations of isobutyrate and lower p  0.05 concentration of isovalerate than those in the np and mp groups.in contrast to the ileum the concentrations of t-scfa lin- ear p  0.05 acetate linear p  0.05 propionate lineartable 2quantitative pcr analysis of total bacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes bifidobacterium clostridium cluster iv clostridium cluster xivae.

in cecum the lactobacillus counts showed a significant quadratic change quadratic p  0.05 as the cp level changed with the counts in the elp group lower than in the mp and lp groups 0.05  p  0.10. the bifidobacterium counts were linearlydecreased as the dietary cp level decreased linear p  0.05 with the counts in the elp group significantly lower than the np and lp groups p  0.05. in the colon the counts of clostridium cluster xiva  linear p  0 .

05  and lactobacillus linear p  0.05 were increased linearly as the dietary cp level reduced but no significant differences were observed between groups p  0.05. the counts of bifidobacterium were linearly decreased as the cp level de- creased in colon linear p  0.05 with the lowest value in the elp group p  0.05. however the elp group had signifi- cantly higher counts of e. coli compared with the lp group in colon p  0.05. these results suggest that decreasing dietary cp level from 20.00 to 15.30 had less impact on bacterial counts while the extreme reduction of the cp level to 13.90 led to a reduction of some beneficial bacteria counts such as bifidobacterium and an increase of potential harmful bacteria such as e. coli in the large intestine.scfa profiles in ileum cecum and colon under different cp dietsthe cp level of the diet also affected the microbial meta- bolic profiles.

further the elp group had higher con- centrations of isobutyrate and bcfa than the mp and lp groups p  0.05. similar pattern was observed in the colon with a significant decrease in concentrations of t-scfa and acetate with the dietary cp reduction linear p  0.05. pigs in the elp group had lower p  0.05 concentrations of t-scfa and acetate than pigs fed np diet and had lower p  0.05 valerate concentration than pigs in other groups.

the shannon diversity indices showed quadrat- ic changes both in colon digesta quadratic p  0.05 and mucosa quadratic p  0.05 with the values increased when cp level reduced from 20.00 to 15.30 and then turned to decline with further reduction of cp level.

for the colon digesta the shannon diversity indices in the elp group was significantly lower p  0.05 than the lp group and for colon mucosa the shannon diversity in the elp group was signifi- cantly lower p  0.05 than the np and lp groups.
