Pigs in the ELP group had higher P  0.05 concentrations of isobutyrate and lower P  0.05 concentration of isovalerate than those in the NP and MP groups.In contrast to the ileum the concentrations of T-SCFA lin- ear P  0.05 acetate linear P  0.05 propionate linearTable 2Quantitative PCR analysis of total bacteria Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Bifidobacterium Clostridium cluster IV Clostridium cluster XIVaE.

Total amines quadratic P  0.05 ca- daverine quadratic P  0.05 methylamine quadratic P  0.05 and spermidine quadratic P  0.05 were showed significantly quadratic changes as CP level de- creased from 20.00 to 13.90.

In the ileum decreasing CP levels linearly increased the concentrations of total SCFAs T-SCFA lin- ear P  0.05 acetate linear P  0.05 and butyrate lin- ear P  0.05 Table .

Compared to those in the NP group pigs in the LP and ELP groups significantly increased the concentration of T-SCFA P  0.05 and butyrate P  0.05 while de- creased the concentration of propionate P  0.05.

In the ileum linear P  0.05 cecum linear P  0.05 and colon linear P  0.05 significant linear decreases of ammonia con- centration were observed as the dietary CP level decreased Table .

The ileal ammonia concentration in the ELP groupP  0.05 and the cecal P  0.05 and colonic P  0.05 am- monia concentration in the LP and ELP groups were significantly lower compared to those in the NP group.

Cecal p-cresol was linearly increased linear P  0.05 as the CP level decreased Table .These results indicate that moderate reducing dietary CP with supplementary crystalline EAA increased bacterialTable 4Quantification of ammonia and microbial protein in the ileum cecum and colon digesta of pigs fed different CP level diets supplemented with EAA n  8Means in the same row with different letters differ P  0.05MCP microbial crude proteinTable 5Quantification of biogenic amines concentration mmolg in the ileum cecum and colon digesta of pigs fed different CP level diets supplemented with EAA n  8Means in the same row with different letters differ P  0.05ND not detecteddecarboxylation and increased the amines production while the extreme CP level would reduce the microbial activity on protein fermentation.PLS-DA analyzed microbial community and bacterial metabolitesTo assess how the overall bacterial community and metabo- lites were affected by dietary protein level we performed PLS-DA on the bacterial community diversity and counts and metabolites concentration in the ileum cecum and colon Fig.

For bacterial metabolites as CP level decreased total short-chain fatty acid T-SCFA acetate and butyrate were linearly increased linear P  0.05 in the ileum while all SCFAs except formate in the cecum and T-SCFA and ac- etate in the colon were linearly decreased P  0.05.
