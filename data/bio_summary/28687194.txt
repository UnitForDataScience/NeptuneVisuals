As discussed previously many secreted bacterial factors act in context-dependent mechanisms and depending upon the type and stage of cancer the class of antibiotics prescribed the duration of antibiotic exposure and the initial compo- sition of commensal microorganisms antibiotic use during cancer therapy has the potential to both promote and to inhibit cancer pro- gression.

Fecal transplant experi- ments have demonstrated that transfer of the microbiome from mice fed a high-fat diet was sufficient to increase cancer incidence in recipient animals  providing evidence that diet-induced changes to the composition of commensal microbes is sufficient to influence cancer progression independent of the physiologic manifestations associated with obesity.

While a large-scale retrospective study of over 2 million women found only a slight increase in hazard risk of breast cancer in women using all classes of antibiotics for more than 101 days women prescribed 3 or more courses of tetracyclines over a span of more than 101 days have a sig- nificantly greater risk of breast cancer than women given other types of antibiotics .

Clinically these findings are relevant as human colorectal cancer specimens have significantly reduced levels of RIG-I suggesting that downregulation of this receptor results in dysbiosis and susceptibility to colorectal cancer .

Thus similar to what has been reported in colorectal cancer NOD expression on the tumor epithelium may have a host-protective role in extramucosal cancers such as breast cancer.

In vitro flagellin enhances proliferation and migration of several types of cancer cell lines including multiple myeloma gastric cancer and salivary gland adenocarcinoma .

Polyamines are in- creased in the urine and serum of cancer patients and have been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation .

The widespread use of antibiotics in our society makes this topic relevant in the context of cancer as cancer patients are frequently prescribed prophylactic antibiotics to combat infections associated with chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression.

Alterations in commensal microbe composition resulting from dietary changes may also influence additional bacterial metabolites as highlighted in .Antibiotic-induced dysbiosisAlthough antibiotics have significant health benefits for individuals with microbial infections excessive antibiotic exposure can negatively impact commensal biodiversity and immune function .Table 1Bacteria and associated metabolites that influence cancer and anti-tumor immunity.According to the CDC greater than 5 out of 6 individuals are prescribed antibiotics annually in the United States  often unnecessarily.

Additionally cancer patients are frequently prescribed prophylactic antibiotics due to severe immune suppression and susceptibility to in- fectious diseases.
