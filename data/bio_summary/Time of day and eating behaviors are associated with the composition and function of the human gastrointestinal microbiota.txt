In addition relations were observed between gut microbes and eating behaviors including eating frequency early energy consumption and overnight- fast duration.Conclusions These results indicate that the human gastrointestinal microbiota composition and function vary throughout the day which may be related to the circadian biology of the human body the microbial community itself or human eating behaviors.

The consump- tion of a larger proportion of energy early in the day complements human circadian rhythms for example glucose tolerance and diet- induced thermogenesis are higher in the morning than in the evening 21 22.The aim of this study was to examine the relations between the human gastrointestinal microbiota and 2 closely intertwined elements--time as it relates to biological circadian rhythms and behavior as it relates to time of eating.

OTU operational taxonomic unit.1230KACZMAREK ET AL.may modulate circadian variation in the human gastrointestinal microbiome.The relations reported between the human gut microbiota and time of day highlight several important points in the expanding area of microbiome research.

Time of day and eating behaviors are associated with the composition and function of the human gastrointestinal microbiotaJennifer L Kaczmarek1 Salma MA Musaad2 and Hannah D Holscher1-31Division of Nutritional Sciences 2Family Resiliency Center and 3Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Urbana ILABSTRACTBackground Preclinical research has shown that the gastrointestinal microbiota exhibits circadian rhythms and that the timing of food consumption can affect the composition and function of gut microbes.

Given the rhythmic nature of the gastrointestinal microbiota in preclinical studies we hypothesized that human gastrointestinal microbial abun- dances and metabolites vary throughout the day and are affected by behavioral patterns of eating timing.METHODSParticipantsThe study described herein was a secondary analysis of samples and data collected from the control period 0 g supplemental fiber of a previously completed trial of agave inulin consumption in healthy adults n  28 14 women 23.

Second the human gastrointestinal microbiota has been shown to be affected by age 32 sex 33 BMI 34 35 and dietary fiber intake 5.

Finally propionate was present at higher concentrations with longer overnight-fast duration.DISCUSSIONThe relations between the human gastrointestinal microbiota and health and disease make it a promising target for lifestyle interventions.

Herein we report for the first time to our knowledge a connection between time eating be- haviors and human gastrointestinal microbiota composition and function.FIGURE 1 Associations of short-chain fatty acids with time in the bi- ological model.

For example the murine study used cecal contents immediately harvested from killed mice whereas our study used fecal samples collected from humans within 15 min of passing and concentrations were reported on a dry matter basis.We also report that certain members of the human gastroin-testinal microbiota changed with time.
