Adult gut microbiota composition has been linked to obesity but few studies have addressed the role of gut microbiota in childhood obesity.Objectives The aim of this study is to compare gut microbiota composition in obese and normal-weight children and to associate gut microbiota profiles with amino acid serum levels and obesity-related metabolic traits.Methods Microbial taxa relative abundance was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing in 67 normal-weight and 71 obese children aged 6-12 years.

Interestingly abundance of certain bacterial species have recently been associated with high levels of aro- matic and branched-chain amino acids BCAA 89 both linked to obesity and insulin resistance 10.Information on gut microbiota composition and function in children remains limited 1112 and its as- sociation with amino acid serum levels in childhood obesity is unknown.

However how B. plebeius and Christensenellaceae may affect BMI of the host is unknown.To determine whether the associations of unclassi- fied Christensenellaceae B. plebeius and B. eggerthii abundance and obesity found here are reproducible we analysed the data from unrelated subjects from a large population of adult UK twins where higher Christensenellaceae family abundance was found in lean subjects 21.

eggerthii abundance was significantly higher in obese children whereas B. plebeius and unclassified Christensenellaceae abundance were higher in NW subjects.Previous studies have related higher gut microbial diversity with a healthier metabolic status 67.

Afterwards the presenceabsence of the species whose abundance was found to be associated with obesity was further tested for association with obesity using a chi- squared test with Haldane's correction when appro- priate.

Thus the differential abundance of these three species is not exclusive from Mexican children as it was found to be associ- ated with obesity in adults from another ethnic group.Diet is known to influence gut microbiota composi- tion 3.

Although these correlations have not been previously reported Christensenellaceae family abundance was negatively correlated with isoleucine and valine serum levels in Finnish adults 9.In an attempt to explore the functional role of the gut microbiota in obesity phenotypes and dietary compo- nents we inferred bacterial metabolic pathways.

Abundance of both these species correlated negatively with phenylalanine serum levels a metabolite also found to be associated with obesity in Mexican children.Conclusions The study identified bacterial species associated with obesity metabolic complications and amino acid serum levels in Mexican children.Keywords Amino acids gut microbiota Mexican children obesity.IntroductionObesity is a major health problem worldwide.

Upper panel Relative abundance of unclassified Christensenellaceae and Bacteroides plebeius was higher in NW children while Bacteroides eggerthii abundance was higher in obese children.
