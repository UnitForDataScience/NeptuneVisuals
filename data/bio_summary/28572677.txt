The increased mortality was similar between challenge agents V. diazotrophicus 5.7-fold V. owensii 3.7-fold and there was no significant difference in time-dependent mortality between the two bacterial species Supplementary Fig.

The lack of positive correlation between immunity responses and survival suggests that mechanisms other than host immune activity contribute towards the observed variation in robustness to the bacterial challenge in our experiment.Surprisingly few genes involved in stress responses or immunity were upregulated in low-mortality corals in response to bacterial challenge.

Only one gene was differentially expressed between the V. diazotrophicus and V. owensii treat- ments further justifying pooling of these treatments as a general bacterial challenge.The contrast between control vs. bacteria challenge yielded 288 DEGs at FDR  0.1.

Matz1Disease causes significant coral mortality worldwide however factors responsible for intraspecific variation in disease resistance remain unclear.

The presence of V. owensii and V. diazotrophicus sequences was verified by NCBI BLAST queries E-value cutoff 1e-100 using reference sequences for these strains GenBank accession numbers GU018180and KF691569 respectively.

The full model tested involved abrasion abrasionno abrasion bacteria control V. owensii V. diaz- otrophicus genotype eight categories and the interaction between bacteria and genotype.

Survivorship analyses were performed for each genotype reef abrasion treatment and bacterial challenge using the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function as implemented by survfit in the R package survival.

Dmbt1 expression was positively correlated with survival and mmp expression was negatively associated with survival in our gene expression analysis.

To nevertheless account for variation in mortality associated with abrasion we ran our Cox proportional hazards model with abrasion included as a data stratification variable.Based on the lack of difference between two Vibrio species we simplified our subsequent analyses by consid- ering only two bacteria-related factor levels where corals were either exposed to bacteria n 12 per genotype pooling V. owensii and V. diazotrophicus treatments or not n 6 per genotype.
