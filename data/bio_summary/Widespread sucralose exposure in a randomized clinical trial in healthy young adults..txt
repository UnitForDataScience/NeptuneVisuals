Objectives This study aimed to determine whether individuals who do not report consumption of LCSs can be correctly characterized as unexposed and to investigate whether instructions to avoid LCSs are effective in minimizing exposure.Design Eighteen healthy 18- to 35-y-old nonconsumers 1 food or beverage with LCSsmo enrolled in a 2-wk trial designed to eval- uate the effects of LCSs on the gut microbiota.

This suggests that although LCSs may be a promising tool for weight management in those who are cognitively engaged in lowering caloric intake and in those who have access to the required support and resources to do so the effects of LCSs on obesity-related chronic disease likely differ based on the context of their use.Given the ongoing controversy surrounding the role of LCSs in weight management and chronic disease we recently highlighted several key methodologic issues 4 including the need to cor- rectly categorize LCS exposure of clinical study volunteers and to take this information into account when interpreting study findings.

c 2017 American Society for NutritionWIDESPREAD SUCRALOSE EXPOSURE821Nursing infants have also been found to be exposed to LCSs via breast milk 9 10.We therefore aimed to investigate whether individuals who do not report consumption of LCSs are correctly characterized as unexposed and to evaluate whether providing study partici- pants with strict instructions to avoid dietary LCS sources is effective in ensuring their nonexposure.

This finding builds on our pre- vious report that individuals consume LCSs inadvertently in packaged foods and beverages 7 and also highlights the need to investigate nondietary sources of LCSs such as personal care products when assessing LCS exposure.

At baseline participants were counseled extensively about avoiding LCSs.

This shows that in- structions to avoid LCSs are not effective and that nondietary sour- ces e.g.

However LCS consumption has also been linked to changes in taste preferences and dietary patterns weight gain metabolic abnormalities and chronic diseases in epidemiologic studies 2 and a causal relation between LCSs increased food intake and weight gain is consistently shown in rodent models 3.

Splenda Heartland Consumer Products or Equal Merisant Company often added to tea and coffee as sugar substitutes containing LCSs 5.

However LCSs may be consumed inadvertently in foods and beverages not explicitly labeled as diet or sugar-free 6 7 and their consumption results in higher plasma sweetener con- centrations in children than in adults 8.
