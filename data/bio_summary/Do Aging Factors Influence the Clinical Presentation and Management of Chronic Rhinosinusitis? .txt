it has been well established that the pathophysiology of crs involves to some extent chronic inflammation of the nasal cav- ities1647 with predominance in most caucasian patients of a th2 inflammation.1647 however it is becoming more and more clear that crs fits into a spectrum of various endo- types that are characterized predominantly by molecular markers such as interleukins.13the elderly seem to display a particular endotype differ- ent from those with adult crs20 which is characterized by a possible age-dependent loss of function of eosinophils in the upper and lower airways.20 cho et al35 demonstrated that eosinophilic cationic protein ecp a marker of eosino- philic inflammation quantified from nasal lavages was sig- nificantly reduced in patients aged 60 years compared with younger patients with crs with nasal polyps p .01.35 however when nasal polyp tissue was analyzed to quantify eosinophilic infiltration no difference was found between young and elderly patients.35 this could poten- tially support the idea that even though eosinophils infil- trate polypose tissue they may be less functionally active.

''in crs dysbiosis in the nasal and sinus microbiome is believed to play a role in the development and persistence of disease.16 although limited studies are available microbiome dysbiosis has been characterized by a decreased diversity of micro-organisms6061 with decreases in the phyla actinobacteriaand firmicutes and increases in proteobacteria.62 changes at the species level have identified an overrepresentation of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as s aureus63 and corynebacterium tuberculosteriaticum.60although literature on the aging microbiome of nasal and sinus cavities is limited there is some evidence suggesting interesting parallels with microbiome changes seen in the gut.

while these phenomena have yet to be assessed directly for the upper respiratory tract their possible occurrences in rhinosi- nusitis are suggested by the idea that the upper and lower respiratory tracts are part of a same system.chronic inflammation associated with agingan additional problem that the elderly with crs can face is inflammaging a term coined by the italian gerontologist claudio franceschi which describes the chronic and subcli- nical systemic inflammation associated with aging in the absence of manifest infection.203742 it has been well estab- lished that with advancing age systemic levels of proin- flammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-1b tumor necrosis factor-a and il-6 tend to increase above normal thresholds.3743 this chronic inflammation has been thought to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis neurode- generative diseases and arthritis in the elderly.37 it has also been associated with increasing risk of morbidity and mortal- ity.42 in fact studies of intestinal immunity demonstrated that sustained chronic inflammation could contribute to local cellu- lar damage that in turn promotes the release of proinflamma- tory cytokines creating an ever-increasing inflammation loop.3744 part of this chronic inflammation is attributed to senescent cells45 which also increase in number as part of the immunosenescence process.4546demonstration of the functional importance of these changes in crs remains to be established.

alternately the dysbiotic microbiome may be composed of bacteria better suited to an aging environment characterized by increased inflammation and which may actually serve to potentiate it.

this could be concretely achieved by promot- ing better eating habits such as changing to a mediterranean diet taking probiotics as proposed by nayan et al51 or reducing red meat consumption.70manipulation of the microbiome at the nasal and sinus mucosal level may also be a possible strategy either via selective targeting of pathogenic bacteria or via supplemen- tation with ''healthy'' gram-positive probiotic bacteria.conclusionage-related changes seen in factors involved in the preser- vation of mucosal homeostasis are described in literature.

this may be pos- sible by targeting with an antibody therapy soluble glycoprotein 130 sgp130 which undergoes age-dependent increases and has been associated with decreased levels of s100 proteins.65in the meantime practical strategies to keep epithelial surfaces clear of excess loads of bacteria may include mechanical methods such as irrigation or use of a surfactant solution to break up biofilms.66reduced immunitydecreased immune surveillance supports that bacterial infec- tion as opposed to colonization may have more of an impact in elderly crs.

recently mice studies have shown increased neutrophil inflammation in aged mice suggesting a predominant th1 response.49 however this was not shown in aged human studies where human neutrophil elastase hne a marker of neutrophil activation was no different from that in younger individuals.35 more investigations are needed to clar- ify this concept since successful treatment strategies for crs depend on the predominating type of immunity in these patients.43250 nevertheless a good body of evidence suggests an impaired ability to mount an effective immune response to new pathogens3839 and this could be an important factor in the persistence of crs in the elderly.even though many studies attribute inflammaging and immunosenescence as an intrinsic process of aging recent studies have shown that the above-mentioned phe- nomena could be partly explained by diet and obesity37 the gut microbiome51 and even hormonal dysregula- tion.52 this offers additional targets for adjuvant thera- peutic manipulation.the microbiome and agingin recent years the human microbiome has gained increas- ing attention in the scientific and medical fields.

nasal physiology and pathophysiology of nasal disorders.

one example is the s100 protein family which plays a versatile role in the function and integrity of the epithelial barrier as it has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activity contributes to defense against pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli and fungi30 contri- butes to mucin production and promotes epithelial repair.1630-32 its importance in disease is suggested by the observation that dysfunction in the s100 family of proteins is associated with impaired barrier function and development of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.33 recently tieu et al34 demonstrated that nasal lavages and sinonasal tissue extracts of patients with crs had reduced levels of s100a7 and s100a89 compared with healthy control subjects p .05.28 as part of a similar study a group from chicago fur- ther characterized the levels of s100a89 in healthy elderly who showed a reduced ability to express s100 proteins in an age-dependent manner p  .01.35these changes seen at the molecular level may have functional correlates as changes in the epithelium have been seen at the macroscopic level.

these may be secondary to decreased defenses observed in aging allowing more free- dom for the more opportunistic pathogens to colonize and persist in the nasal cavities of individuals.

more recently the contribution of an altered nasal microbiome to the development of crs has also been proposed.

in a recent study histologic assessment of biopsy samples demonstrated decreases in both mean epithelial thickness and basement membrane thickness in the elderly resulting in increased nasal cavities volumes.36impact of aging on the immune systemthe most described aging-related events affecting immune function in current literature are immunosenescence and development of spontaneous chronic inflammation.
