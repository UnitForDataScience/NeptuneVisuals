While these phenomena have yet to be assessed directly for the upper respiratory tract their possible occurrences in rhinosi- nusitis are suggested by the idea that the upper and lower respiratory tracts are part of a same system.Chronic Inflammation Associated with AgingAn additional problem that the elderly with CRS can face is inflammaging a term coined by the Italian gerontologist Claudio Franceschi which describes the chronic and subcli- nical systemic inflammation associated with aging in the absence of manifest infection.203742 It has been well estab- lished that with advancing age systemic levels of proin- flammatory cytokines such as interleukin IL-1b tumor necrosis factor-a and IL-6 tend to increase above normal thresholds.3743 This chronic inflammation has been thought to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis neurode- generative diseases and arthritis in the elderly.37 It has also been associated with increasing risk of morbidity and mortal- ity.42 In fact studies of intestinal immunity demonstrated that sustained chronic inflammation could contribute to local cellu- lar damage that in turn promotes the release of proinflamma- tory cytokines creating an ever-increasing inflammation loop.3744 Part of this chronic inflammation is attributed to senescent cells45 which also increase in number as part of the immunosenescence process.4546Demonstration of the functional importance of these changes in CRS remains to be established.

It has been well established that the pathophysiology of CRS involves to some extent chronic inflammation of the nasal cav- ities1647 with predominance in most Caucasian patients of a Th2 inflammation.1647 However it is becoming more and more clear that CRS fits into a spectrum of various endo- types that are characterized predominantly by molecular markers such as interleukins.13The elderly seem to display a particular endotype differ- ent from those with adult CRS20 which is characterized by a possible age-dependent loss of function of eosinophils in the upper and lower airways.20 Cho et al35 demonstrated that eosinophilic cationic protein ECP a marker of eosino- philic inflammation quantified from nasal lavages was sig- nificantly reduced in patients aged 60 years compared with younger patients with CRS with nasal polyps P .01.35 However when nasal polyp tissue was analyzed to quantify eosinophilic infiltration no difference was found between young and elderly patients.35 This could poten- tially support the idea that even though eosinophils infil- trate polypose tissue they may be less functionally active.

Prospective studies however are necessary to validate this concept.Keywordschronic rhinosinusitis aging elderly guidelines epithelium S100 proteins microbiome Th2 hyperresponsiveness immu- nosenescence systemic inflammation pathophysiology cor- ticosteroids management future therapiesReceived September 25 2016 revised December 29 2016 acceptedJanuary 10 2017.hronic rhinosinusitis CRS is defined as symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and paranasal cavities for at least 3 consecutive months.1 This inflammatory dis-ease of the upper respiratory airways is prevalent in 12 of the population of North America and Europe2 and represents 1 to 2 of all outpatient physician visits per year.3 In 2016 it was estimated that direct and indirect costs associated with CRS in the United States were estimated at 21 billion.2 This high cost is an indication of the persistent and debilitating nature of CRS which affects quality of life QOL and pro- ductivity of affected individuals24 to a greater degree than other chronic illnesses such as arthritis asthma inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.15 This is especially true for the elderly who often present other comorbidities disabilities and frailty that require more intensive and individualized care as well as more prescriptions.67The elderly represent a growing population in many regions of the world including North America.8 It is pro- jected that by 2050 individuals 65 years and older will rep- resent 20 of the total US population and 25 of the Canadian population.910 Given the importance that this pop- ulation will occupy in the following years the World Health Organization WHO developed the concept of active and healthy aging AHA which would have research priorities to ''assess major determinants of AHA such as chronic noncom- municable diseases and mental health diseases lifestyle work- ing environment''11 and to develop ''strategies for reducing societal and individual costs of an ageing population .

Alternately the dysbiotic microbiome may be composed of bacteria better suited to an aging environment characterized by increased inflammation and which may actually serve to potentiate it.

Major factors influencing chronic rhinosinusitis.Impact of Aging on the Nasal EpitheliumThe nasal epithelium is the first line of defense within the nasal cavities.

''12 Given the clear impact of CRS on QOL and AHA as a noncommunic- able chronic illness it is imperative to address if CRS in the elderly is properly characterized and managed.Knowing that the 3 major factors that influence the develop- ment of CRS--decreased mucosal barrier defenses chronic inflammation and more recently an altered microbiome13-16-- all undergo age-influenced changes over time it is possible that CRS in the elderly represents a distinct entity compared with that in younger patients.

In a recent study histologic assessment of biopsy samples demonstrated decreases in both mean epithelial thickness and basement membrane thickness in the elderly resulting in increased nasal cavities volumes.36Impact of Aging on the Immune SystemThe most described aging-related events affecting immune function in current literature are immunosenescence and development of spontaneous chronic inflammation.

''In CRS dysbiosis in the nasal and sinus microbiome is believed to play a role in the development and persistence of disease.16 Although limited studies are available microbiome dysbiosis has been characterized by a decreased diversity of micro-organisms6061 with decreases in the phyla Actinobacteriaand Firmicutes and increases in Proteobacteria.62 Changes at the species level have identified an overrepresentation of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as S aureus63 and Corynebacterium tuberculosteriaticum.60Although literature on the aging microbiome of nasal and sinus cavities is limited there is some evidence suggesting interesting parallels with microbiome changes seen in the gut.

These may be secondary to decreased defenses observed in aging allowing more free- dom for the more opportunistic pathogens to colonize and persist in the nasal cavities of individuals.
