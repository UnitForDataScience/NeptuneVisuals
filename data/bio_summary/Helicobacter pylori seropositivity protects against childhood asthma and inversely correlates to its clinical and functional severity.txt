Moreover when we compared between asthmatics regarding H. pylori IgG seropositivity we detected higher titres among low social class children p  0.001 high environmental tobacco smok- ing exposure p  0.018 and lower IgE levels p  0.007 as well as less antibiotic intake among H. pylori IgG seropos- itive asthmatics 78.26 in comparison with seronegative ones 95.5 p  0.038 However the study did not report significant statistical differences between H. pylori IgG seropositive and seronegative asthmatics as regards age sex breastfeeding duration and timing of wean- ing p  0.005.

It affects the human gut microbiota --- including H. pylori --- with disturbance of the immune system.Several studies included the number of courses of antibiotics in their analysis the highest risk for asthmawheezing was found in children exposed to more than four courses of antibiotics in the first year of life.Interestingly the relation between H. pylori serum IgG titre and asthma severity revealed a statistical significant inverse relationship between H. pylori serum IgG titre andasthma severity.

pylori may be of importance in the induction of regu- latory T cells which could effectively reduce the possibility of allergic asthma.Inverse associations between H. pylori especially cagA strains with asthma and related allergic disorders were reported especially involving younger indi- viduals and with early life disease onset.Therefore we conducted this study to assess frequency of H. pylori seropositivity among asthmatic children com- pared to healthy controls.

Thus these findings represent further evidence for the role of infection with H. pylori in the pathogenesis of asthma.Previous studies about the association between H. pylori status and asthma risk generate conflicting findings.These studies were conducted in adults mostly small-scale and additionally did not address the modifying roles of age.

Sim- ilarly Zevit et al.found an inverse association of H. pylori with asthma especially early-onset asthma.Environmental tobacco smoke ETS exposure among chil- dren carries a lot of hazards it affects the immune system and predisposes to asthma and the gut microbiota and increases the risk of H. pylori infection.

In addition smoking increases mucus production as much as seven-fold decrease ciliary movement beat fre- quency and transport increase white blood cells production mainly eosinophils and increase mucosal permeability to allergens.As socioeconomic status plays an important role in H. pylori infectioncurrent data documented higher fre- quency of seropositive H. pylori IgG asthmatics among low social class compared to high social class.

In addi- tion another explanation for ''hygiene hypothesis'' is the ''Antigenic competition'' which states that the develop- ment of strong immune responses against antigens from microbial agents could inhibit responses to 'weak' antigens such as auto-antigens and allergens.Owing to the role of household crowding in H. pylori infection the current results found that crowding index was higher among H. pylori IgG seropositive asthmat- ics compared to seronegative ones.

Studies about the role and duration of breastfeeding in H. pylori infec- tion were variable Pearce et al.reported that increased duration of exclusive breastfeeding in infancy may have a long-term protective effect against chronic H. pylori infection this could be due to maternal antibodies the lactoferrin and other protective factors in the human milk.

Moreover regulatory cytokine IL-10 and CD103CD11b- dendritic cells are necessary to successfully protect against asthma in H. pylori-infected mice.In conclusion H. pylori seropositivity protects against childhood asthma and inversely correlates to its clinical and functional severity.Financial supportNone.Conflict of interestNone.Ethical disclosuresConfidentiality of data.

H. pylori is a bacterium which colonises the gastric mucosa of approximately half the world's pop- ulation and is a main cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric adenocarcinoma.
