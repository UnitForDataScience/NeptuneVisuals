However all 14 isolates presented in vitro antagonistic activity against S. Typhimurium Table 2 reinforcing the limitation of the results obtained with in vitro assays and the importance of a gnotobiotic animal model to confirm in vivo an antagonistic effect observed in vitro.Figure 3 shows the faecal population levels of S. Typhi- murium in GF mice previously mono-associated or not control during seven days with three of the 14 selected bacteria - Enterococcus hirae strain 8.2 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain 16.2 and Lactobacillus ruminis strain 18.1 as well as the faecal levels of the mono- associated bacterium.

In the present study the B. thetaiotaomicron 16.2 showed an unusual broad spectrum of antagonistic action inhibiting five indicators in vitro L. monocytogenes S. Typhimurium S. flexneri V. cholera and E. coli as well as S. Typhimurium in the ex vivo assay.

In vitro antagonism against enteropathogenic bacterial indicators as inhibitory zone around 28 bacteria isolated from stool samples from healthy human donors.12shows regarding sensitivity of indicator bacteria S. flexneri and S. Typhimurium were inhibited by 89 of the isolates enteropathogenic E. coli by 82 L. monocytogenes and V. cholerae by 46 C. difficile by 50 and C. perfringens by 32 of the isolates.The isolates 8.2 15.6 16.1 18.1 and 18.4 had the highest inhibitory spectrum acting against 100 of the pathogens while the isolates 8.3 and 19.1 did not inhibit any pathogen.

The study agrees with our results confirming that at least in vitro Gram-positive components of the dominant faecal microbiota generally have a higher potential for antagonism than the Gram-negative ones.After mono-association with 14 bacteria only seven groups showed ex vivo antagonistic activity against S. Typhimurium although all isolates presented antagonistic activity in the in vitro assays.

2006 Gram-positive bacteria isolated from the dominant faecal microbiota of healthy human showed a high frequency of in vitro antagonism against the enteropathogens Shigella sonnei and S. Typhimurium but with some variation among the donors.

2000 studied the inhibitory activity of 14 human strains of Bifidobacterium against S. Typhimurium and showed that only two of them expressed in vitro antagonist activity.
