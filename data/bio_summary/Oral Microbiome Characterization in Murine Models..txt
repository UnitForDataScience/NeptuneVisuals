Incubate for 5 min at room temperature for binding of DNA to beads.Place the tube onto a DynaMag-2 Magnet for 2 min or until beads separate from solution.While keeping the tubes in the magnet carefully remove supernatant.Remove tubes from magnet and dispense 200 ml of 70 ethanol and pipet up and down to mix.Repeat Steps D8 and D9.Remove tubes from magnet and dispense 200 ml of 70 ethanol and pipet up and down to mix.Repeat Steps D8 and D9.While keeping the tubes in the magnet open the tube lids and allow the beads to dry for approximately 5 min making sure that the bead surface does not start to crack as this results in low DNA yield.Remove tubes from the magnet add 40 ml of EB to each tube and mix well by pipetting.Place the tubes back in the magnet and wait for 2 min or until beads clearly separate from solution.Transfer 35 ml of the supernatant to a new DNA low-bind 1.5 ml tube.E.

PCR product clean-up using the Agencourt AMPure XP systemClean work surface with 70 ethanol and then RNase AWAY reagent.Abusleme et al.Page 9Equilibrate AMPure XP Magnetic Particle Solution to room temperature 15-30 min.During that time prepare fresh 70 ethanol aliquot the required amount of EB buffer consider 40 ml per PCR product and have ready a set of DNA low-bind 1.5 ml tubes.Measure the volume of each PCR product.Mix by vortexing the AMPure XP Magnetic Particle Solution to re- suspend any magnetic particles that may have settled.According to the measured PCR product volume add the appropriate amount of bead solution based on the following ratio DNAbeads  10.65.Vortex briefly and carefully keeping the mixture in the bottom of the tubes.

For our samples DNA concentration is usually below this value.Vortex briefly and short spin all reagents.Prepare gel-stain solution GS by adding 12.5 ml of stain ST to gel tube G.Vortex for 10 sec and transfer the GS solution to a spin-filter tube provided in the kit.Centrifuge spin-filter tube at 2400 x g for 15 min.Discard filter.

It is very important that PCR product concentrations and dilutions are accurate in order to obtain approximately equal number of reads per sample.Add 5 ml of each diluted PCR product to a 2.0 ml DNA low-bind tube so samples are pooled in equimolar amounts.

Visually inspect for bubbles or incomplete priming.Pipet 9 ml of GS to other GS wells 3 in the DNA chip.Pipet 5 ml of loading buffer into L well and each sample well 11.Abusleme et al.Page 11Pipet 1 ml of DNA 1K ladder into well L.Pipet 1 ml of DNA into each sample well.

The size of the target DNA should correspond to a single peak at 528 bp.Equilibrate kit reagents to room temperature 15-30 min.While waiting make sure that the DNA concentration of the PCR products doesn't exceed 50 ngml if it is above this value dilute to 50 ngml.
