Analysis of the relationship between BMI and fecal microbiota composition revealed weak negative correlations between BMI and Porphyromonadaceae r  -0.342 Rikenellaceae r  -0.299 Christensenellaceae r  -0.341 and Oxalobacteraceae r  -0.329 as well as a weak positive correlation between BMI and Aerococcaceae r  0.32.Correlation between FFQg data and fecal microbiota compositionSignificant correlations between FFQg data intake of energy and macronutrients and micro- nutrients and fecal microbiota composition occupation ratio of bacteria are shown in .

Sutterellaceae r  -0.292 and Oscillospiraceae r  -0.334 were negatively correlated whereas Fusobacteriaceae r  0.361 and Enterobacteriaceae r  0.321 were positively corre- lated with quercetin concentration in the samples.Correlations among FFQg data BMI and fecal microbiota compositionAnalysis of the relationship between BMI and FFQg data intake of energy and macronutri- ents and micronutrients revealed weak negative correlations between BMI and intake of beta- Quercetin concentration in fecal samples A B. Quercetin was anaerobically incubated with fecal suspensions for 7 h A or 24 h B. N  56.

Niacin r  -0.313 vitamin B6 r  -0.297 vitamin B12 r  -0.266 vitamin D r -0.301 and ratio of animal protein to total protein r  -0.27 were also negatively corre- lated with quercetin concentration.

Niacin r  -0.313 vitamin B6 r  -0.297 vitamin B12 r  -0.266 vitamin D r  -0.301 and ratio of animal protein to total protein r  -0.27 were negatively correlated with quercetin concentration whereas no components were positively correlated.

The abundance of Sutterellaceae r  -0.292 and Oscillos- piraceae r  -0.334 was negatively correlated whereas that of Fusobacteriaceae r  0.361 and Enterobacteriaceae r  0.321 was positively correlated with quercetin concen- tration.

The abundance of Sutterellaceae r  -0.292 and Oscillospira- ceae r  -0.334 was negatively correlated whereas that of Fusobacteriaceae r  0.361 and Enterobacteriaceae r  0.321 was positively correlated with quercetin concentration.

Inter-individual variation in fecal microbiota composition at family level was observed.Correlation between FFQg data and fecal microbiota composition and quercetin concentrationGiven the lack of inter-individual variation in quercetin concentrations following anaerobic incubation of fecal suspensions with quercetin for 24 h we analyzed the relationship between quercetin concentration and FFQg data intake of energy and macronutrients and micronu- trients and fecal microbiota composition after a 7-h incubation period.

These findings highlight the impor- tance of diet on microbiota composition however it is unclear how quercetin metabolism is affected by intestinal microbiota.

Thus members of these two taxa may modulate adiposity and contribute to health maintenance via production of acetic acid.Intestinal microbiota can affect obesity  while diet can influence microbiota commu- nity structure .
