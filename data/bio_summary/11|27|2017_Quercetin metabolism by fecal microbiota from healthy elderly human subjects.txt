these findings highlight the impor- tance of diet on microbiota composition however it is unclear how quercetin metabolism is affected by intestinal microbiota.

thus members of these two taxa may modulate adiposity and contribute to health maintenance via production of acetic acid.intestinal microbiota can affect obesity  while diet can influence microbiota commu- nity structure .

2017 quercetin metabolism by fecal microbiota from healthy elderly human subjects.

this study in- vestigated the relationship between quercetin metabolism gut microbiota composition and dietary intake in elderly japanese subjects.

fecal suspensions from 56 subjects were anaerobically incubated with quercetin and fecal microbiota composi- tion was analyzed by next-generation sequencing.
