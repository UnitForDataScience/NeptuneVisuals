These data suggest that the increase in IL-10-producing MNPs that follows colonization of the gastric mucosa by H. pylori could condition the tissue environment to favor the induction of CD4PD-1 Tr1-like and Foxp3 Treg cell-mediated regulatory responses.IL-10 is required for high levels of H. pylori colonizationTo further evaluate the role of IL-10 during the initial phases of colonization we performed IL-10 neutralization studies in mice infected with H. pylori and compared their response to control mice that received an isotype Ab.

Approximately 10-15 of H. pylori- infected individuals will eventually develop gastroduodenal ulcers and H. pylori carriers have a .2-fold greater risk of de- veloping gastric cancer in the form of B cell lymphoma of MALT lymphoma or adenocarcinoma 3 4.

H. pylori was grown on plates prepared with Difco Columbia agar base BD Biosci- ences supplemented with 7 of laked horse blood Lampire Biological Laboratories and H. pylori selective supplement containing 10 mgl vancomycin 5 mgl trimethoprim 5 mgl amphotericin and 5 mgl polymyxin from Oxoid at 37C under microaerophilic conditions.

These analyses demonstrate the presence of a complex system of myeloid cells in the stomach mucosa that has not been previously described and its composition is signifi- cantly altered due to the loss of PPARg in LysMcre mice.Macrophages accumulate in the gastric mucosa of H. pylori- infected miceWe performed a time-course study spanning the first 7 wk post- infection because the drop in H. pylori loads in LysMcre mice consistently occurs between weeks 2 and 3 postinfection.

To assess how the absence of IL- 10 could affect downstream effector responses we cultured cells obtained from gastric lymph nodes of H. pylori-infected mice that were either treated with IL-10 neutralizing or control Abs and stimulated them ex vivo with inactivated whole H. pylori SS1.

We provide evidence that MNPs can fa- cilitate H. pylori colonization by promoting IL-10 responses.The prevailing theory is that the regulatorysuppressor responses associated with H. pylori gastric infection are induced by DCs 18 19 55 58 and not by macrophages.
