lb are present not only in the central nervous system cns but also in the enteric nervous system ens of the entire gastrointestinal tract corresponding to the clinical notion that the gastrointestinal tract is involved in pd .lewy in his original thesis work in 1913 already identi- fied the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus as a hotspot of brain pathology and braak et al.

however whether the observed changes are primary changes or rather secondary resulting from unidentified effects and whether it is either beneficial or harmful cannot be decided at present.the increase in akkermansia muciniphila which appears to be in certain consistency in regards to the findings of keshavarzian et al.

scheperjans et al.

and unger et al.

pro- inflammatory dysbiosis may even trigger a-syn misfolding or neuronal injury from gut-derived endotoxins  although we did not identify e. coli species associated with pd in our samples the increase in akkermansia might be associated with a yet unexplored disease related impact on mucosal barrier function.extending the results of scheperjans et al.

and unger et al.

on the other side keshavarzian et al.

propionate and in turn favor inflammatory conditions in pd in contrast to scheperjans et al.

constipation but also led to an increase in intestinal barrier leakiness - keshavar- zian et al.

and unger et al.

in turn al- terations in the abundance of different eubaceria might contribute to the pd pathogenesis via metabolic but also direct mucosal pathways.lowered eubacteria family erysipelotrichaceae in mucosal as well as in fecal pd samples were similarly observed in the study of keshavarzian et al.
