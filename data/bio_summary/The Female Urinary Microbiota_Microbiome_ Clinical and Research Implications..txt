For example our research team estab- lished an improved protocol called enhanced quanti- tative urine culture EQUC that dramatically improves detection of clinically relevant urinary mi- crobes.25 Others have established similar approach- es.2426 We recently recommended a streamlined version of EQUC for use in clinical microbiology laboratories that uses the following conditions 0.1 uL urine obtained by transurethral catheter plated onto BAP MacConkey and colistin nalidixic acid CNA agars with incubation of all agars in 5 CO2 for 48 h.28The information from the improved urine culture techniques provides a more complete reporting of the microbes present in an individual's urinary microbiota.

As the collateral consequences of systemic antibiotic use are better understood clinicians and patients alike must become better stewards of antibiotics.Since the mid-1950s the gold standard for detec- tion of uropathogenic microbes has been the stan- dard clinical microbiology urine culture protocol a method originally designed to detect patients with pyelonephritis.38 Unfortunately use of the standard urine culture has been expanded well beyond this original purpose without any empirical evidence that this generalization was valid.

Indeed some E. coli strains are used as probiotics.45Most clinical urine samples are collected from voided urine despite the known risk of contamina- tion from the vulva.

Standard urine culture techniques involve plating of a prespecified aliquot of urine onto culture media.

Thus we recommend the description of below detection limits rather than sterile to describe urine specimens that have no sequenced bacterial DNA.49In the majority of urine samples that provide 16S rRNA sequences a main feature of the FUM is its tendency to be dominated by a single genus most often by Lactobacillus.

In addition there are statistical associations between UUI symptoms and several bacterial species including Actinomyces neuii Act- inotignum schaalii formerly Actinobaculum scha- alii Aerococcus urinae Corynebacterium coyleae Corynebacterium riegelii Oligella urethralis and Streptococcus anginosus.21 Several of these species are considered uropathogens however most would not be detected by standard urine culture high- lighting the need for the improved urine culture techniques described earlier in this paper.

To identify the bacteria present in a mixed sample such as feces or urine the patterns sequences of the detected portions are matched to known sequences.Using 16S rRNA gene and other modern se- quencing techniques researchers have determined the microbial composition of healthy skin12 gastro- intestinal tract3-5 mouth6-8 and vagina.9-12 Multiple clinical correlations have been discovered--the list grows daily.

Urinary microbiome researchers have used 16S rRNA sequencing to detect bacterial DNA in the humanfemale bladder of women without clinical infection regardless of the presence or absence of other uri- nary tract symptoms.20-23 To obtain evidence of live microbes in urines deemed negative by traditional urine culture techniques researchers developed enhanced culture techniques.2124-26 These enhanced techniques described in detail later in this review confirmed that sequenced urinary bacteria are alive and confirmed the presence of a microbial com- munity in the urinary bladders of adult women--the FUM.
