The whole-genome sequences obtained from six Kerala South Indian AH1N1pdm09 clinical isolates from 2009 2014 and 2015 have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers listed in .ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe acknowledge the Department of Biotechnology Government of India and the Kerala State Council for Science Technology and Environment for financial support.REFERENCESCousins S. 2015.

Whole-genome sequencing provides the necessary evidence for understand- ing the origins and genetic variations of viruses for proper implementation of publichealth management including vaccine development .Here we report the whole-genome sequence of six clinical isolates of influenza AH1N1pdm09 isolated from Kerala a state in south India.

Amino acid analysis of all gene segments from the AH1N1pdm09 isolates obtained in 2014 and 2015 identified several new mutations compared to the 2009 AH1N1 pandemic strain.n India starting in the winter of 2014 to 2015 health officials observed a significant increase in the number of H1N1 case fatalities compared to the pandemic period of 2009 to 2010 .

Six isolates were selected for whole-genome sequencing one isolate from 2009 two isolates from 2014 and three isolates from 2015.

All eight influenza gene segments were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using the WHO-CDC Atlanta recommended whole-genome primers .

Similarly the majority of amino acid substitutions observed during the 2009 pandemic period--namely those for PB2-I354L PB1-I397M I435T PA-P224S NS-I123V and NP-Volume 5 Issue 28 e00598-17 1Jones et al.TABLE 1 Accession numbers of whole-genome sequences of AH1N1pdm09 clinical isolatesaPB2 polymerase basic 2 PB1 polymerase basic 1 PA polymerase acidic HA hemagglutinin M matrix NP nucleoprotein NA neuraminidase NS nonstructural.V100I--persisted in the isolates from 2014 to 2015 with the accumulation of several new mutations in PB2-R54K M66I D195N R293K V344M R368R W537L V731I S453T R299K T303S PB1-V113I G154D PA-I621V G684R R266H S522G R559K L649I V100I N321K I330V K361R R362K Ns-G51S and NP- A22T.Accession numbers.
