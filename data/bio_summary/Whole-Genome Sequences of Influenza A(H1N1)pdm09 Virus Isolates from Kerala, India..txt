whole-genome sequencing provides the necessary evidence for understand- ing the origins and genetic variations of viruses for proper implementation of publichealth management including vaccine development .here we report the whole-genome sequence of six clinical isolates of influenza ah1n1pdm09 isolated from kerala a state in south india.

the whole-genome sequences obtained from six kerala south indian ah1n1pdm09 clinical isolates from 2009 2014 and 2015 have been deposited in genbank under the accession numbers listed in .acknowledgmentswe acknowledge the department of biotechnology government of india and the kerala state council for science technology and environment for financial support.referencescousins s. 2015. death toll from swine flu in india exceeds 2500. bmj.

six isolates were selected for whole-genome sequencing one isolate from 2009 two isolates from 2014 and three isolates from 2015. all eight influenza gene segments were amplified by reverse transcription-pcr using the who-cdc atlanta recommended whole-genome primers .

influenza a virus constantly undergoes antigenic evolution and it is important to continually examine the evolutionary changes in the circulating strains each year.
