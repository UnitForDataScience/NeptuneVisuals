the laboratory-based in- cubation method measures som turnover rate throughto examine som turnover rate using the 14c method in alpine grassland of the tp     to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to link som turnover rate in soil profiles based on the 14c method with climatic factors and microbial community composition in alpine grassland of the tp.in the soil profiles som turnover rate decreased by approximately 7-15 times from the 0-5 to 30-40 cm soil depths in alpine grassland .

however further research is needed to investigate how the micro- organisms mediate som turnover under changing climate in alpine grassland of the tp.we hypothesized that som turnover in different soil lay- ers responds to climate conditions differently and emerg- ing climate change may alter som turnover by changing soil microbial communities involved in the process of or- ganic matter decomposition.

the m was changed with a precision of 0.0001 year-1 until the final pmcs2010 value was ap- proximate or equal to the measured value and thus we got the final som turnover rates.if soil 14c was 0 som turnover rate was calculatedaccording to as follows 3m  -11100014c  1where m is som turnover rate year-1 and 11 is 14c thedecay constant 18268 year-1.microbial community analysisthe microbial phospholipid fatty acid plfa method was used to measure microbial biomass using a modified bligh-dyer method .

the liquid c6h6 was measured using a wallac 1220 quantulus ultralow-levelliquid scintillation spectrometer to obtain 14c activity data which was reported as pmc or 14c 14c pmc- 1 .calculation of som turnover ratesom turnover rate could be calculated according to iterative formula as follows 1pmcs1955  mm  112pmcst  pmcst - 1 - m  11pmcst - 1 mpmc0twhere pmcs and pmc0 are the pmc in soil and atmosphere respectively 11 is the 14c decay constant 18268 year-1 and m is som turnover rate year-1.

in this study we measured and collected som turnover by the 14c method in alpine grassland to test climatic effects on som turnover in soil profiles.

to verify our hypothesis som turnover rate reflected by soil 14c activity were measured in this study and collected from published literature to reveal climatic effects on som turnover in soil profiles in alpine grassland of the eastern tp.

replicates were mixed as 1 sample in each soil layer for the study of microbial community composition in 4 soil layers at site q5 and the 5-10 cm layer at other sites.although radiocarbon 14c was applied as a tracer of som turnover rate   the expensive cost of 14c detection and the hostile environ- ment has led to a limited number of studies regarding som turnover in alpine grassland of the tp.

ku370502- ku371826.resultsclimatic effects on som turnover in soil profilesacross all sites in table s1 the som turnover rate de- clined exponentially with soil depth r2  0.58 p  0.001  ranging from approximately 0.02 year-1 at the 0-2 cm depth to nearly 0.0003 year-1 at the 35-40 cm depth.

map ex- clusively impacted the som turnover rates at the 0-10 cm soil depth r  0.40 p  0.048  whereas mat had an indis- tinct effect on the som turnover rate within the 0-40 cm soil depth in our study area p  0.05 .factors influencing soil microbial communitiesat the 0-10 cm soil depth the biomass of bacteria and actinomycetes and the biomass ratio of bacteria to fungi bacteriafungi were greatly correlated with map p  0.05 .

according to the partial correlation most of the climatic effects on the som turnover rate in topsoil relied on the transforma- tion of soil microbial community composition such as the abundance of acidobacteria r  0.77 p  0.05 and bacteriafungi ratio r  0.69 p  0.05 table s2.discussionthere are 3 main methods commonly applied to estimate som turnover rate .

in addition the faster som turnover rate in the gongga mountains   which is much colder and wetter than our study area also indicates the importance of precipitation in mediating som turnover in arid and semiarid regions.

this result verified the inference from a global som turnover model for terrestrial ecosystems  which showed a strong cor- relation between climate conditions and som turnover in topsoil.

therefore a large bacteriafungi ratio could help to explain the accelerating of som turnover rate.considering the functional differences of microbial species microbial species involved in the carbon cycling process may also contribute more to som turnover than irrelevant microbes.

addressing these issues could help us understand factors driving som turnover and provide a sound basis for predicting carbon storage and dynamics under future climate scenarios.som turnover rates usually decline with soil depth .
