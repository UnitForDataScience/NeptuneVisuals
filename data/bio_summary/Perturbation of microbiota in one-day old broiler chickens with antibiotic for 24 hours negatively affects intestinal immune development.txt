An increasing trend of the diversity from day 5 to 14 was observed for both the control and antibiotic treated birds this was expected because inTable 7 Functional annotation clustering DAVID of jejunum results ES  1.3 of the comparison antibiotic versus control on day 5 padj  0.01Down lower in antibiotic treatmentUp higher in antibiotic treatmentaES Enrichment scoreTable 8 Functional annotation clustering DAVID of jejunum results ES  1.3 of the comparison antibiotic versus control on day 14 padj  0.01Down lower in antibiotic treatmentUp higher in antibiotic treatmentES aGeneral TermESGeneral Term2.49positive regulation of biosynthetic processtranscription4.5organelle lumen intracellular2.00epithelium morphogenesisdevelopment2.38transit peptideMitochondrion1.60macromoleculeprotein catabolic process1.84sterolsteroid biosynthesis1.48intracellular organelle lumen1.68Heat shock protein DnaJ1.47blood vessel development1.53RNA recognition motif RNP-11.51translation initiation factor activity1.48negative regulation of lipid storage1.43Multiple Signalling Pathways EPOIGF1IL6TPOIL2PDGFEGF1.39cellular protein localizationtargeting1.32zinc-binding LIM domaina ES Enrichment scoregeneral the whole gut system develops towards a highly diverse and more stable system already partly reflecting the 'adult' type microbiota -.When comparing the antibiotic treated chickens with their respective controls we only observed a numerical increased diversity in the antibiotic group at day 5 that was not notable anymore at day 14.

Whereas increase of diversity in developed stable gut systems is assumed to be associated with improved resilience of that system.When comparing the microbiota composition of the antibiotic treated and control chickens a high overlap was observed for both day 5 and 14.. We expected long-lasting changes based upon previous findings   - however in this experiment the gut microbiota ecosystem apparently developed towards a steady state in 3 days after the antibiotic treatment.The impact of the antibiotic treatment could be ob- served on the bacterial family level where minor changes in average relative contribution ARC oc- curred at day 5 and major changes on day 14.

children who received antibiotics have higher incidence of allergy and asthma -Besides these seemingly negative effects on im- mune development one can imagine that it may also be possible to positively modulate immune development by providing specific diets or feed additives that influenceTable 6 Descriptive statistics of gene expression data of jejunum comparing antibiotic versus control on days 5 and 14ComparisonA5-WA5 abA14-WA14RegulationDown UpDown UpNumber of probespc  0.017171156457354padj  0.05 and logFCd  126651721Number of annotated genespadj  0.01489556182234padj  0.05 and logFC  1181883abAbbreviations WA5 without antibiotic day 5 A5 with antibiotic day 5 WA14without antibiotic day 14 A14 with antibiotic day 14cAdjusted p-value False Discovery Ratedlog Fold Changethe microbial colonization of the gut.

microbial families or species which are involved in early life gut development.Differences in immune cell populations due to the antibiotic treatmentDevelopment of the adaptive immune system in broilers occurs in the first weeks of life - Both CD4 and CD8 cells increase significantly in number in the small intestine from day 1 to 5 and day 5 to 14 whereas the macrophage-like cells only significantly in- crease in number at day 5.

A decreasing trend in diversity was observed from day 1 control to day 5 control p  0.08 whereas no signifi- cant difference between day 1 control to day 5 antibiotic treated p  0.32.

At day 14 the down-regulated genes seemed to be involved in cellular processes whereas the up-regulated genes did not show a coherent picture.ImmunohistochemistryTo investigate whether the differences observed at the gene expression level at day 5 were translated into aTable 5 Statistical testing of family level microbial groups by Wilcoxon signed-rank testWilcoxon signed-rank testaOther is a limitation of the underlying bioinformatics tool to further classify this as a certain familydifference in the number andor identity of immune cells in the gut mucosal tissue we analysed intestinal tissue sec- tions for the presence of macrophage-like cells CD4 and CD8 cells.

In this paper we provide evidence that a 24 h oral antibiotic treatment during early life of broilers has a limited effect on the microbial composition at day 5 after treatment has a sig- nificant effect on the intestinal gene expression profile later in life days 5 and 14 and a significant effect on the number of macrophages day 14 in intestinal mucosal tis- sue.

This shows the generic succession of bacterial families in the chicken gut over time regardless of the antibiotic treatment perturbation.The diversity as measured by the Shannon index showed a decreasing trend from day 1 control to day 5 control or no significant difference between day 1 con- trol to day 5 antibiotic treated.

To find out whether the microbiota and host gene expression were altered by the antibiotic treatment we collected jejunal samples at three time-points day 1 after hatch prior to antibiotic adminis- tration day 5 and day 14.
