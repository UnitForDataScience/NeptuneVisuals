to find out whether the microbiota and host gene expression were altered by the antibiotic treatment we collected jejunal samples at three time-points day 1 after hatch prior to antibiotic adminis- tration day 5 and day 14. from the jejunum the luminal content was taken to perform in depth 16s rrna sequen- cing of the resident microbiota and jejunal tissue was taken to perform genome wide gene expression analyses and to characterize and quantify intestinal immune cells.methodshousing diet and experimental designin this experiment 1-day-old chickens cobb500 both males and females with an average body weight of approximately 42 g at hatch were housed in a floor pen system with litter wood shavings.

a decreasing trend in diversity was observed from day 1 control to day 5 control p  0.08 whereas no signifi- cant difference between day 1 control to day 5 antibiotic treated p  0.32. from day 5 to day 14 an increasing trend in diversity was observed for both the control andantibiotic treated birds p  0.08 and p  0.07 respectively fig.

children who received antibiotics have higher incidence of allergy and asthma -besides these seemingly negative effects on im- mune development one can imagine that it may also be possible to positively modulate immune development by providing specific diets or feed additives that influencetable 6 descriptive statistics of gene expression data of jejunum comparing antibiotic versus control on days 5 and 14comparisona5-wa5 aba14-wa14regulationdown updown upnumber of probespc  0.017171156457354padj  0.05 and logfcd  126651721number of annotated genespadj  0.01489556182234padj  0.05 and logfc  1181883ababbreviations wa5 without antibiotic day 5 a5 with antibiotic day 5 wa14without antibiotic day 14 a14 with antibiotic day 14cadjusted p-value false discovery ratedlog fold changethe microbial colonization of the gut.

for the long term this strategy may result in a reduced immune competence of the birds.when taken both the microbiota and transcriptomics data together the presented data suggest that an anti- biotic treatment during early life only causes limited changes in microbiota diversity andor composition.

the adjacent anterior part approximately 5 cm was used for sampling the jejunal microbiota by extracting the luminal content and directly deposit this into a tube and also snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

body weights showed an increase in time from approximately 130 g at day 5 to 2.3 kg at day 34 table the fcr also increased over time from approximately 0.78 at day 0-5 to about 1.66 at day 0-34 table a fcr below 1 istable 2 body weight g at different time-points comparing antibiotic versus control birdstable 3 feed conversion ratio fcr of different time-slots of antibiotic versus control birdsababbreviations wa without antibiotic a with antibioticstudent's t-testpossible in broilers because the chicks also absorb the yolk sac in the first days of life .microbiota analysesto get generic insight into the microbiota and relative abundances of microbial groups over time we selected the top 9 most abundant bacterial groups 7 defined families over all three time-points in control birds no antibiotics table .

this usage leads to de- creased expression of genes involved in immunological processes at day 5 and subsequently lower number of macrophage-like cells at day 14 in jejunum.this work shows that it is possible to modulate the microbiota via antibiotics with a negative impact on immune development.

this resulted in eight significantly different family groups p  0.05 for day 5 and three significantly different family groups p  0.05 for day 14. however when multiple testing correction was taken into account only three family groups remain for day 5 and for day 14 no family groups were left table .transcriptomic analysesprincipal component analysis pca was performed to get insight into the variability in the jejunal transcripto- mics data taking into account the two treatment and three time-points.

in general the enrichment scores for day 5 were higher compared to those of day 14. at day 5 the dominant terms of the down-regulated genes i.e.

at day 14 the down-regulated genes seemed to be involved in cellular processes whereas the up-regulated genes did not show a coherent picture.immunohistochemistryto investigate whether the differences observed at the gene expression level at day 5 were translated into atable 5 statistical testing of family level microbial groups by wilcoxon signed-rank testwilcoxon signed-rank testaother is a limitation of the underlying bioinformatics tool to further classify this as a certain familydifference in the number andor identity of immune cells in the gut mucosal tissue we analysed intestinal tissue sec- tions for the presence of macrophage-like cells cd4 and cd8 cells.

significant differences were observed between day 1 and 5 for cd4 p  0.01 cd8 p  0.001 and kul01 p  0.001. between day 5 and 14 only cd4 p 0.001 and cd8 p  0.001 were significantly different.

in this paper we provide evidence that a 24 h oral antibiotic treatment during early life of broilers has a limited effect on the microbial composition at day 5 after treatment has a sig- nificant effect on the intestinal gene expression profile later in life days 5 and 14 and a significant effect on the number of macrophages day 14 in intestinal mucosal tis- sue.

this shows the generic succession of bacterial families in the chicken gut over time regardless of the antibiotic treatment perturbation.the diversity as measured by the shannon index showed a decreasing trend from day 1 control to day 5 control or no significant difference between day 1 con- trol to day 5 antibiotic treated.
