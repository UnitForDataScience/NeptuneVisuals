this early stage of diabetes is characterised by the occurrence of the first signs of cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunc- tion associated with changes in myocardial tissue micro- environment in the absence of marked cardiac structural damage collagen accumulation or inflammatory cell infiltrate .immediately after hemodynamic measurements in subgroups of each experimental group the heart was excised and cardiac cells were enzymatically isolated to measure cardiomyocyte mechanical properties and calcium transients.

this might account for a sustained and chronic effect of urolithins at the cardiac level inde- pendent of their acute presence in circulation or even at heart tissue level.limitationsalthough we achieved the primary goal of our study showing that in vivo urolithin administration succeeds in preventing early signs of cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats we acknowledge some limitations of this study.

in a rat model of early diabetes we evaluated whether in vivo administration of urolithin a ua or urolithin b ub the main gut microbiota phenolic metabolites of ellagitannin-rich foods can reduce diabetes- induced microenvironmental changes in myocardial tissue preventing cardiac functional impairment.methods adult wistar rats with streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetes n29 were studied in comparison with 10 control animals.

however the biological effects of in vivo urolithin administration in the setting of diabetes as well as in other pathological conditions remain to be characterized .the present study demonstrates that in vivo urolithin treatment besides reducing the inflammatory state of cardiac tissue can prevent the occurrence of the early signs of cardiac dysfunction as measured at organ and cellular-molecular levels in a rat model of diabetes after 3 weeks of hyperglycaemia.fig.

the improve- ment in myocardial microenvironment had a functional counterpart as documented by the increase in the maximal rate of ventricular pressure rise compared to diabetic group  18 and 31 in ua and ub treated rats respectively and the parallel reduction in the isovolumic contraction time  12. in line with hemodynamic data both urolithins induced a recovery of cardiomyocyte contractility and calcium dynamics leading to a higher re-lengthening rate 21 on average lower re-lengthening times  56 and a more efficient cytosolic calcium clearing  32 in tau values.

the beneficial effects of the two treat- ments could be ascribed primarily to the previously described action of urolithins in counteracting cellular oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine expres- sion  which are intimately linked and constitute early detrimental changes in myocardial tissue of the diabetic heart playing a pivotal role in dcm development.the sulphate and glucuronide metabolites of ua and ub are the main metabolites appearing in circulation after consumption of et-rich foodstuffs .

however no in vivo data are currently available demon- strating the functional counterpart of the positive impact of urolithins on diabetes-induced microenvironmental changes.this paper specifically addresses this issue in order to investigate the effects of urolithin administration on the recovery of cardiac function as measured at organ and cellular levels and on the inflammatory state of myo- cardial tissue in a rat model of early diabetes induced by streptozotocin.

urolithin a ua 38-dihydroxy-urolithin and urolithin b ub 3-hydroxy-urolithin are the main urolithins detected in human biological fluids and tissues after et consump- tion by humans while other urolithins such as urolithin c uc 389-trihydroxy-urolithin and urolithin d ud 3489-tetrahydroxy-urolithin may be found at lower concentrations   .

in the case of ub treatment d3-ub only ub metabolites were found ub-sulphate was the pre- dominant metabolite and was found in all plasma sam- ples from rats treated with ub while ub-glucuronide was present in some but not all samples 49. the pro- file of urolithin metabolites in circulation in the case of the animals treated with ua d3-ua was more complex besides the aglycone form ua and ua-sulphate some metabolites originating from the dehydroxylation of ua forming ub and further phase ii conjugation were iden- tified.
