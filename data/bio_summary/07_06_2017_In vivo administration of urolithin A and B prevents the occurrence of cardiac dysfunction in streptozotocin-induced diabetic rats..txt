This might account for a sustained and chronic effect of urolithins at the cardiac level inde- pendent of their acute presence in circulation or even at heart tissue level.LimitationsAlthough we achieved the primary goal of our study showing that in vivo urolithin administration succeeds in preventing early signs of cardiac dysfunction in diabetic rats we acknowledge some limitations of this study.

Urolithin A UA 38-dihydroxy-urolithin and urolithin B UB 3-hydroxy-urolithin are the main urolithins detected in human biological fluids and tissues after ET consump- tion by humans while other urolithins such as urolithin C UC 389-trihydroxy-urolithin and urolithin D UD 3489-tetrahydroxy-urolithin may be found at lower concentrations   .

The beneficial effects of the two treat- ments could be ascribed primarily to the previously described action of urolithins in counteracting cellular oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine expres- sion  which are intimately linked and constitute early detrimental changes in myocardial tissue of the diabetic heart playing a pivotal role in DCM development.The sulphate and glucuronide metabolites of UA and UB are the main metabolites appearing in circulation after consumption of ET-rich foodstuffs .

The pro- file of urolithin metabolites in circulation in the case of the animals treated with UA D3-UA was more complex besides the aglycone form UA and UA-sulphate some metabolites originating from the dehydroxylation of UA forming UB and further phase II conjugation were iden- tified.

Finally the intracellular molecular mechanisms proposed to explain the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine fractalkine on cardio- myocyte mechanics and calcium dynamics are basically speculative and built on previously reported data.ConclusionsIn conclusion we showed here for the first time that in vivo urolithin administration may be able to prevent the initial inflammatory response of myocardial tissue to hyperglycaemia and the negative impact of the altered diabetic milieu on cardiac performance as measured at cellular and organ levels.

In a rat model of early diabetes we evaluated whether in vivo administration of urolithin A UA or urolithin B UB the main gut microbiota phenolic metabolites of ellagitannin-rich foods can reduce diabetes- induced microenvironmental changes in myocardial tissue preventing cardiac functional impairment.Methods Adult Wistar rats with streptozotocin-induced type-1 diabetes n29 were studied in comparison with 10 control animals.

However the biological effects of in vivo urolithin administration in the setting of diabetes as well as in other pathological conditions remain to be characterized .The present study demonstrates that in vivo urolithin treatment besides reducing the inflammatory state of cardiac tissue can prevent the occurrence of the early signs of cardiac dysfunction as measured at organ and cellular-molecular levels in a rat model of diabetes after 3 weeks of hyperglycaemia.Fig.

Secondly we mainly attributed the cardiac functional recovery observed in urolithin treated diabetic rats to a reduced level of tissue inflammation as sug- gested by the significant reduction of fractalkine levels in myocardial tissue of D3-UA and D3-UB hearts but other potential mechanisms have not been explored and cannot be absolutely ruled out.

This early stage of diabetes is characterised by the occurrence of the first signs of cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunc- tion associated with changes in myocardial tissue micro- environment in the absence of marked cardiac structural damage collagen accumulation or inflammatory cell infiltrate .Immediately after hemodynamic measurements in subgroups of each experimental group the heart was excised and cardiac cells were enzymatically isolated to measure cardiomyocyte mechanical properties and calcium transients.

The urinary excretion of urolithin derivatives was very limited and only UB-sulphate was detected in D3-UB rats Table .The analysis of tissue samples from the four experi- mental groups revealed the presence of urolithins in heart pancreas and liver of both D3-UB and D3-UA rats Fig.
