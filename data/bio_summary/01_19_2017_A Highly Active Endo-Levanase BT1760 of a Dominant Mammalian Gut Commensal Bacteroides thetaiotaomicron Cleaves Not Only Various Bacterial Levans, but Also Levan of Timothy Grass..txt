Levan synthesized from raffinose occurred as the least preferred substrate.To obtain more detailed information on substrate preference of BT1760 kinetic character- istics-Km and kcat-were determined for BT1760 catalysis on six levans omitting the Erwinia herbicola levan .Initial velocities of reducing sugar release by the endo-levanase BT1760 from various levans added at 5 gL.

Here we characterize biochemical properties of BT1760 including the activity of BT1760 on six bacterial levans synthesized by the levansucrase Lsc3 of Pseudomonas syr- ingae pv.

thetaiotaomicron to grow on levan a b-26-linked fructose polymer and proved that the endo-levanase BT1760 BT1760 was indispensable for it.

Cloning of the BT1760 gene heterologous expression and purification of the His-tagged endo-levanase BT1760.

To produce the BT1760 with a C-terminal His6-tag pURI3-BT1760Cter 3965 bp was constructed as follows BT1760 sequence was amplified from pJET-BT1760 with primers BT1760PURI3CterFw 5'TAACTTTAAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGACGAGACTGA CCCCATCTTG3' and BT1760PURI3CterRev 5'GCTATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGATAAGTGCTTACCTGAACGTCTG3'.

BioEdit  and pDRAW32 software  were used to visual- ize the alignments and structure of the genomic loci respectively.Results and DiscussionEndo-levanase BT1760 among glycoside hydrolases analysis of levanase protein sequences and genomic lociHere we analyse and compare the amino acid sequence of BT1760 with sequences of experi- mentally studied and putative endo- and exo-acting fructanases.

The region next to the nucleophile Glu43 in INU2 and Asp62 in BT1760 was poorly conserved between the enzymes YWMNEPNG in INU2 and GFVGDPMP in BT1760 the nucleophiles are desig- nated in bold.

For the location of these predicted catalytic residues of BT1760 see .Multiple sequence alignment of experimentally studied endo-levanases revealed only mod- est identity with BT1760.

With BT1760 sequence as a query we retrieved a protein D4IW69 annotated as levanase invertase with 31.6 identity to BT1760 whilst only 19.3 identity to LevB1 of Bacillus licheni- formis.

Identity of the BT1760 endo-levanase with three exo-acting fructanases of B. thetaio- taomicron BT1759 BT1765 and BT3082 was from 18.7 BT3082 to 20.3 BT1759.We then searched homologues of BT1760 from sequence databases using the BLASTP pro- gram.
