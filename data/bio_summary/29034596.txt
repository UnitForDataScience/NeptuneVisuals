In contrast energy intake in vagotomized mice and cisplatin-treated mice was comparable with that in control mice showing that insulin secretion and gastric emptying inhibition in response toGLP-1 are tightly dependent on a func- tional gut-brain-periphery axis whereas food intake regulation is not.

These results provide new insight into the role of the gut microbiota in maintaining normal metabolic condi- tions by regulating GLP-1 biology.One of the remarkable findings of the study was that GLP-1 unresponsiveness was far more severe in lean diabetic mice fed a high-fat carbohydrate-free diet HFD than in obese diabetic mice fed a high-carbohydrate HFD.

Venn analyses of pathway modules showed that there were 25 common pathways enriched in both the high-carbohydrate HFD-fed and HFD-fed groups and 19 pathway mod- ules uniquely enriched in the HFD-fed mice compared with the high-carbohy- drate HFD-fed mice.

Furthermore it should be noted that the dysbiosis observed in HFD-fed mice was possibly specific to the extreme meal composition applied in that study thus the severe high-fat diet-fed mice with impaired glu-GLP-1 resistance observed in HFD-fedCorresponding author.

However the specific mechanism by which gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice reduces GLP-1R expres- sion in the enteric nervous system remains to be elucidated.

Grasset et al.3 showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice is responsible for the loss of enteric neurons impaired NO production and subsequent GLP-1 resistance.

A specific gut microbiota dysbiosis of type 2 diabetic mice induces GLP-1 resistancethrough an enteric NO-dependent and gut-brain axis mechanism.

They clearly showed that the dysbiosis reduced expression of GLP- 1R and neuronal nitric oxide synthase nNOS in the enteric nervous systemdiabetic mice is not necessarily recapitu- lated in human diabetes.In a previous report it was shown that long-termHFDintakecauseda262J Diabetes Investig Vol.

However HFD-fed mice were resistant not only to GLP-1-induced insulin secretion and gas- tric emptying inhibition but also to GLP- 1-induced suppression of food intake.
