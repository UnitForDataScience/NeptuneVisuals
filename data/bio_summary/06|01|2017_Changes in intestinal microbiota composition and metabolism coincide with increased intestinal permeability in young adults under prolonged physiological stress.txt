Although they speculated that changes in intestinal microbiota composition may have contributed to these findings the au- thors did not assess microbiota composition.The present study used a physically demanding militarytraining exercise as a model for elucidating the effects of physiological and metabolic stress on IP and intestinal micro- biota composition and activity and to identify associations between dietary intake IP inflammation and the intestinal microbiota.

Collectively these findings suggest that changes in intestinal microbiota composition and metabolism may im- pact IP during physiological stress by modulating the avail- ability of amino acid precursors critical to moderating inflam- mation and oxidative stress and of secondary bile acids.Study strengths include the provision of diets of known composition providing a range of macronutrient intakes and the integration of physiological stool microbiota composition and metabolomics data.

However plasma metabolite changes were not correlated with changes in sucralose excre- tion or IL-6 or CRP concentration.Backward stepwise regression was used to identify the strongest predictors of changes in IP.

To examine associations between stool microbiota composition and global metab- olite profiles metabolite PCA ordinations were compared with OTU PCoA ordinations using Procrustes analysis implemented in the R package vegan.A knowledge-based approach was used to better identify microbially derived metabolites by predicting changes in stool metabolite profiles based on changes in stool microbiota composition.

Although potential mechanisms were not directly assessed changes in immune activity intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress and al- tered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and vagal signaling have been postulated as mechanisms through which physical and psychological stress modulate the microbiome 12 34.The increase in Shannon a-diversity and the numerousgenus-level changes in relative abundance demonstrated that changes in microbiota composition were broadly characterized by an increase in abundance of less dominant taxa at the expense of more dominant taxa such as Bacteroides Fig.

Metabolites included two amino acids arginine and cysteine which were predicted to be associated with changes in microbiota composition and are plausible modulators of IP on the basis of known physio- logical functions.
