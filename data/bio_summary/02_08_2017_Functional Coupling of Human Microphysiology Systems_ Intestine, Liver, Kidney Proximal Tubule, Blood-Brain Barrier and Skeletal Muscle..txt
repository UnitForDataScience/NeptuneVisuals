Examples such as these highlight the need to continue research into methods that reduce the dependence on laboratory animals for toxicity testing of environmental chemicals determine efficacy and toxicity in drug development serve as a mimic of human diseases and provide patient-specific guidance in the emerging field of precision medicine.Recent advances in bioengineered materials microfluidic technology and the availability of human primary immortalized and induced pluripotent stem cell iPSC-derived cells are enabling development of human micro- physiological systems MPS sometimes called organs-on-a-chip or human-on-a-chip that use multiple organ-specific human cells to recapitulate many functional and structural properties of a human organ.

Samples were analyzed using an established method for assessing vitamin D3 25-OH vitamin D3 2425-OH2 vitamin D3 4b25-OH2 vitamin D3 and 1a25-OH2 vitamin D3Supplemental Table S4.For treatment in the BBBNVU module the combined intestinalliver-conditioned media was diluted 13 inblank EGM-2 vascular compartment media.Functional Coupling of the Static liver with Skeletal Muscle for Terfenadine Toxicity Testing.

Moreover the ability of lab animal target organ toxicity to predict dose-limiting toxicity in the corresponding human organ varies widely from a low of 30 for human cutaneous toxicity to 50-60 for human hepatotoxicity to a high of 90 for hematological drug toxicity.

Finally an oral administration model of vitamin D3 was chosen to evaluate the liver and kidney metabolic conversion to 1a 25 OH2 vitamin D3 and to evaluate transport of vitamin D3 and its metabolites across the BBB.ResultsThese results are from the collaborative effort of six universities to evaluate the transport and metabolism of three test agents in four independently developed and functionally coupled multicellular MPS organ models as described in 1.

However approximately 6 of the 25-OH vitamin D3 infused into the vascular side of the BBBNVU was found in the neuronal efflux media after 24 h. This would be consistent with the penetration of the 25-OH vitamin D3 through the BBBNVU.Vitamin D3 is a fat soluble vitamin with a cLogP of 7.98 and in the body it is transported from the intes- tine in chylomicrons and systemically by vitamin D binding protein DBP.

In the liver experiments the use of DBP at a stoichiometric ratio of 31 DBP vitamin D3 improved recovery of vitamin D3 from 20 to 57 at 24 h and to 100 at 48 h. In addi- tion the formation and recovery of the 25-OH vitamin D3 metabolite from the system was improved 2-3 fold Supplemental Table S4.Summary of results.

Finally vitamin D3 added to intestinal apical media in micelles was transported without metab- olism across the jejunal monolayer metabolized to 25-OH vitamin D3 by the liver model and penetrated the BBB model parameters all consistent with oral uptake of vitamin D3.

As a preliminary step to solving the challenges of direct coupling of MPS organs in one continuous fluid stream functional coupling provides important information about the optimal functional scaling of each organ module in a coupled system and any issues of media compatibility between modules.In this report we present the results from functional coupling of four human MPS models the human intestine Johns Hopkins University JHUBaylor College of Medicine Baylor the sequentially layered self-assembly liver SQL-SAL University of Pittsburgh UPitt a vascularized or non-vascularized proximal tubule kidney VPTK or PTK University of Washington UWash and an intact blood-brain barrierneurovas- cular unit BBBNVU Vanderbilt University.

summarizes the in vivo uptake and metabolism of vitamin D3 and the transport and clearance of the vitamin D3 metabolites see details in Supplemental Table S4.

In these experiments synthetic micellescontaining 100 mM vitamin D3 were applied to the apical compartment of the differentiated human jejunal enteroids.
