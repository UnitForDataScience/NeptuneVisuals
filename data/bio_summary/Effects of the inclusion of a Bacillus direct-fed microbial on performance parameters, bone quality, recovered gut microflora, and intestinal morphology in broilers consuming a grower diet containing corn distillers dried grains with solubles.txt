chick- ens that received the dfm in the grower-ddgs diet improved performance bone quality parameters and the surface area of absorption in both duodenal and ileal intestinal sections and this could be related to a more efficient utilization of the diet due to the pro- duction of exogenous enzymes by the dfm.
