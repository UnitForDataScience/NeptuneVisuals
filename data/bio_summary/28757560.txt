Finally we focus on the future role of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in the development of even better or new beverages made from apples.Keywords apple cider lactic acid bacteria fermentation organoleptic quality safety improvement microbial diversityIntroductionAlthough styles of cider are extremely diverse and not easy to categorize depending on the type of apple juices used and the degrees of sweetness from extra dry to sweet and alcohol content ranging from 1.2-8 vv cider can be defined as a fermented alcoholic beverage made from apple juice .

One main obstacle to their efficient antimicrobial action would be their potential sensitivity to acidity found in apple products .Control of the Fermentation Process ParametersSpoilage and pathogenic flora in apple juice and by extension in apple fermented beverage can be reduced by physical methods which have already been reviewed  and will not be further discussed.

Historians broadly agree that apple trees existed along the Nile River Delta as early as 1300 BC  and a number of written documents citing alcoholic beverages made from apple and pear date back to ancient times notably from Pliny St. Augustin and Palladius .

detected principally mesophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms on fresh cut apple while coliforms and LAB were isolated on apple flowers .

The organic apple phyllosphere displayed higher numbers of bacteria than the conventional apple phyllosphere.

However both apple juiceand fermented cider contain organic acids mainly malic acid 5 gL in apple juice and lacticacid 3-4 gL in fermented cider generating acidity pH level ranging from 3.0-3.5 and 3.3-4.0 respectively that usually prevents the growth of these pathogens which can survive for only a few hours.

Reports of patulin in cider are likely due to the adjunction of apple juice to produce 'sweet cider' or low-fermented cider .PathogensAs previously mentioned unpasteurized apple cider is historically considered to be a safe product free of microbial pathogens due to its acidic level and to the fermentation process.

yeast strains during apple fermentation results in the production of considerable amounts of esters and alcohols contributing to fruity sensory notes compared with apple musts fermented only with Saccharomyces sp.
