since f-1 is precisely r when g1  d the previous equivalence implies that r  1 if and only if r  1. analogously one can prove that r  1 if and only if r  f-1 1.optimal reproduction numberso far we have obtained two explicit expressions of the basic reproduction number for the gut microbiota model coming from two interpretations of what a birth event is for such a population.

in this case we assume that a decreases with g2 so that r and r can be written as2r ag2g1 g2 lrg2 1 - zg2andr g2 er  md-g1c with zg  satisfying  ag2g1zg2  zg g a. as we did before the criticalpoints of zg2 which coincide with the critical points ofg2 are given as the solutions of d  ag2g1zg2  zg2g2  0dg2g1zg2  dwhich implies using d zg2  0 thatg1atg2  g1zg2  d  0.12 alternatively the critical points of r g2 are given by d  r ag2g1 g2 lor equivalentlydg2er  md-g1c  0g1atg2 - g1  d  0which is not the same as condition  unless zg2  -1 but this is not true in general.

.next we compute the right-hand side of  assuming g1  d. the change of vari-ables 2 a12a21t - 1  y leads to write the integral in  as r  e-ay2 i1y dywhere a  4-a11  0. for this we have using the series expansion for the modifiedbessel function and the lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem  e-ay2 i y dy  r  y2k1e-ay2 dy 14ak11 e- 1 1710k022k1kk  1k04ak  1so the right-hand side of  reduces to ra1 ra11a22-a12a21 r ag1 g2 lr  me 22 e 4a er  ma11er  md-g1c 18which means that if then r  ag1 g2 lg1 d rrmed-g1cnotice on the one hand that the initial condition in system  reflects an exper- imental procedure consisting in giving an initial bacterial dose to the animal under study.

so   rmed-g1cthe alternative reproduction number obtained with the birth events detailed above isgiven by r ag1 g2 lr if g1 d and r  if g1  d.er  md-g1c10finally we can check that  1 if and only if  1 and the same respectively when1 and  1. indeed recall that 21 z where z is the only solution of r- ag1 z zg2 lfz er  mg1 zdc  1 within the interval -dg1 0 see sect.

moreover fz  1 is transformed intoz  -ag1  dg2 - g1 a  jag1  dg2 - g1 a2  4g1g2da8so l  21 - z  l is the largest real spectral value and then it is the spectral radius r. actually it is an eigenvalue with associated eigenfunctionvx  b r exp -  ag1z  zg2 x cu xag1z  dg1z  dcvx and b i 0 .in summary the basic reproduction number for the gut microbiota model  is explicitly given by2r  1 - z9with z  0 defined in .

thus the critical points of rg1 coincide with the critical points of r g1 and it is the case that g1 is a local maximum of rg1 if and only if it is a local maximum of  g1 see fig.

in this case u  2g1u  u tg1u - av  dub  v    2g2v  m  v    cv  g2v  av - du  and the next-generation operator is formally given by 2g100   g1  d-a0-1g1  bm-1  02g2 0000-dcx  g2  a00-cdlr  mwhere dl stands for the evaluation operator at the point x l. in the expressions above we consider m as a closed linear operator on the banach lattice x l10 ll10 l r with domain d l10 l v b w 110 l r cv0 rb .

therefore if g1  d so that r   1 then necessarily z  -1 0 which implies r  1. otherwise i.e.

on the other hand the critical points of r g1 satisfy d  r ag1 g2 ldg1er  mdg1-g1c  0which reduce precisely to condition .

left.interestingly the previous equivalence does not hold if instead of g1 we analyse the effects of g2 in r and r .

this means that both reproduction num- bers and   are increasing in r g1 g2 a l and decreasing in m d c. therefore in absence of trade-offs between ecological parameters of the model a competition between types of bacteria would evolve to ever-increasing or ever-decreasing values of any single parameter of the model.

if g1  d then the spectral bound of m is negative and the next-generation operator becomes 000   -g1  d-a0-1g1bm-10000cdl 0-dcx - g2  a0.00r  mclearly due to the birth part b the operator g1 can only have eigenvectors which are multiples of 0 0 1. by performing a calculation similar to the one in the previoussection we obtain that the eigenvalue associated with0 0 1is r  ag1 g2 l .

to this end we consider2r ag1 g2 lrg1 1 - zg1andr g1 er  mdg1-g1c with zg  satisfying ag1zg1  zg g a. the critical points of zg are given implicitly as the solutions of d ag1zg1 zg1g2  0dg1 g1zg1  dg1which implies using d zg1  0 that g1 is a critical point of zg1 if and only ifd dg1dg1g1  0.11since r is increasing with z see  the above equation also gives a characterization of the critical points of rg1.

in fact one hasbst tcvl sdsandbetbt.0it can be checked that if g1  d then the solutions of system  diverge expo- nentially fast at a rate g1 - d  0. in particular for large values of t  bst is of the order etg1-d. thus the limit in  becomes infinite and the equality r  holds as desired.

b is then defined as a bounded linear operator on x and bm-1 turns out to be a positive bounded linear operator on x .throughout the rest of the paper we avoid the degenerate case g1d0 and we assume g1  0 or d  0 as well as c  0r  0 and b  0.basic reproduction numberwe are going to compute the basic reproduction number which is interpreted here as the expected number of newborns produced by each bacterium in the long run.
