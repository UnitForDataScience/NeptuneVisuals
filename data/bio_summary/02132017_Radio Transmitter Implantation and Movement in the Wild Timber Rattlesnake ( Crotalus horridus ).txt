We performed 71 transmitter implantation surgeries 24 of these were transmitter replacement surgeries in previously implant- ed snakes 20 snakes had two surgeries two had three.Before surgery a regional block was performed with mepivacaine Carbocaine-V 20mgmL Pfizer-Pharmacia  Upjohn Com-pany New York New York USA 2-6 mgkg subcutaneously divided between three inter- costal spaces 20 cm cranial to the cloaca at the implantation site Wellehan et al.

Distance traveled for each snake did not differ before or after surgery or between weeks 1 and 2 postsurgery indicating that the transmitter implantation did not alter snake movement.Key words Crotalus horridus GIS melox-icam NSAID radio transmitter.Use of radiotelemetry devices in ecologic studies provides insight into wildlife biology and behavior but transmitter application or implantation can be associated with fitness costs including increased energy expenditure Godfrey et al.

Snakes received three postsurgical injections of meloxicam Metacam 5 mgmL Boeh- ringer Ingelheim Fort Dodge Iowa USA 0.2 mgkg and enrofloxacin Baytril 22.7 mgmL Bayer Healthcare LLC Shawnee Mission Kansas USA 5-10 mgkg intramuscularly every 24 h. Both injections were adjacent to the dorsal spinous processes in the anterior half of the snake but caudal to the restraining tube.Snakes were released at their original capture locations after 2-5 d of postsurgical monitoring and tracked 2-3 times weekly until they returned to their hibernacula in the fall.
