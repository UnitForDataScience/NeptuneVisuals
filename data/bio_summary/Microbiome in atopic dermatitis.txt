Targeted treatment options to normalize skin and intestinal microbiome in AD are under investigation.Keywords atopic dermatitis microbiome staphylococci skin intestine antimicrobial peptidesIntroductionOn skin and mucous membranes intestine airways microbial genomes outnumber those of the human host by a factor of 100.

Thereby bacteria-derived molecules such as short-chain fatty acids may influence human epigenomic pathways.12 This article reviews the role of the human microbiome in atopic dermatitis AD.ADAD is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting 20 of children.

Chitosan-coated long-sleeve pyjama tops and pants worn overnight for 8 weeks improved the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index from baseline in 43.8 of patients whereas only 16.5 improved with the uncoated pyja- mas.A significant decrease in coagulase-negative Staphylococci was observed on the skin with the chitosan-coated product.48Another open trial investigated the effect of ZnO fab- rics on AD severity in adult patients.
