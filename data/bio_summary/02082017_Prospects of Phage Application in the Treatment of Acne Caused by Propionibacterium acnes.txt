This system which has also been found in P. acnes may cause phage ineffectiveness Bruggemann and Lood 2013.Another limitation associated with the application of P. acnes phages is the high homogeneity within P. acnes phages which may be beneficial with the use of phage formulations of broad activity and application of available ready to use phages of limited activity avoiding phage typing.

Currently there are data regarding isolation of P. acnes phages and there have been numerous studies on phage killing of P. acnes but no data are available on phage application specifically in acne treatment.

The effect of P. acnes phages' homogeneity may limit the efficacy of the phage therapy.The term pseudolysogeny for P. acnes phages was first mentioned in 2011 by Lood and Collin 2011.

However more detailed studies are first needed to understand phage functioning in the skin microbiome and the possibility to use phages to combat P. acnes.Keywords Propionibacterium acnes phages experimental phage therapy treatment of infections antibiotic resistance topical applicationINTRODUCTIONWe are entering the post-antibiotic era infections formerly easy to cure are becoming difficult to treat as both increasing frequency of treatment failure and increasing severity of infections have been observed Jassim and Limoges 2014 WHO 2014.

One phage strain may dominate in the P. acnes phage population.

2012 found in phage genomes regions that encode phage endolysin which is conserved in all tested P. acnes phages.

Also P. acnes proved to have CRISPR elements and its role in the phage resistance results from the correlation between these elements and spacer matches with the phage genomes as suggested by Marinelli et al.

In this review we have summarized the current knowledge on the phages active against P. acnes described so far and their potential application in the treatment of acne associated with P. acnes.

The presence of specific phylotypes of P. acnes is thought to be associated with the disease rather than the abundance of P. acnes Tomida et al.

Another sequencing analysis suggested that acquired DNA sequences of P. acnes and its immune elements were important in determining the virulence of P. acnes and these elements should be the therapeutic target Fitz-Gibbon et al.
