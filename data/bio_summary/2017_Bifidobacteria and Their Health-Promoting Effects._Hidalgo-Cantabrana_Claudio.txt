A recent phylogenetic analysis of bifidobacteria based on a robust reconstruction of the phylogeny of mem- bers of this genus based on 48 genome sequences has shown that there are seven phylogenetic groups within the genus Bifidobacterium adolescentis group Bifido- bacterium asteroides group Bifidobacterium boum group Bifidobacterium longum group Bifidobacterium bifidum group Bifidobacterium pseudolongum group and Bifidobacterium pullorum group .

A re- cent study reported an H. pylori eradication rate of 32.5 in adults after 10 days of administration of the commercial mix of probiotic VSL3 which includes several probiotic bifidobacteria as mentioned above .Colorectal CancerProbiotics have also been used to modifymodulate the microbiota of patients toward a healthy microbiota in those cases in which alterations of microbiota popula- tions are associated with disease.

bifidum group B. bifidum strains and B. adolescentis group Bifidobacterium catenulatum Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and B. adolescentis strains are often found in the human intestinal microbiota and most probiotic bifidobacteria belong to these species.BIFIDOBACTERIA AS MEMBERS OF THE HUMAN INTESTINAL MICROBIOTABifidobacterium Species Evolution with Age Distribution in the Bowel and Interindividual VariabilityBifidobacteria are among the dominant bacterial popu- lations in the gastrointestinal tract GIT of humans.

Until now there have been no clear relationships between type of diet Western Asian Mediterranean and the enrichment in the gut of particular Bifidobacterium species but differences have been reported between different human groups and countries  .A recent bifidobacterial diversity study based on se- quence analysis of PCR amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene from infant stools from different geographical origins reinforced the notion of bifidobacteria as being a pre- dominant component of the infant gut microbiota which may undoubtedly influence the development of the immune system and physiology of the infant .Correlations with Other Members of the Microbiota and Cross Talk Interactions Bifidobacterium-mediated health benefits are the result of a complex dynamic interplay established among bifidobacteria other members of the gut microbiota and the human host.

In fact in B. bifidum PRL2010 pilus expression occurred in vitro but it was strongly upregulated following co- culture with other bifidobacterial and Lactobacillus strains .Further evidence of the existence of a bifidobacterial-gut microbiota cross talk has been provided by the fact that individuals with different gut microbiota composi- tion appear to respond differently to Bifidobacterium supplementation .
