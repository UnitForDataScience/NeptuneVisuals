polyp extracts and standards of known polyp content 0-10 um that also went through the gitc extraction procedure were incubated 1 h at 37 degc with 250 um adenosine diphosphate adp 50 mm hepes ph 7.5 50 mm ammonium sulfate 5 mm mgcl2 in the presence or absence of 50 nm e. coli ppk.

1a a drug that has been used to treat patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis uc for over 70 years34.kinetic studies using purified e. coli ppk confirmed that mesalamine inhibits ppk in vitro by increasing the michaelis constant km of ppk for adenosine triphosphate atp and lowering its inhibitory constant ki for substrate inhibition by atp fig.

in brief samples were resuspended in 100 mm tris ph 8.5 2 mm edta and two volumes of lysis buffer 200 mm naoh 1 sds were added vigorously vortexed and incubated for 10 min.

bacteria lacking ppk are defective in virulence biofilm formation persistence and oxidative stress response12 making ppk a potentially powerful antimicrobial drug target.

because polyp regulates its own production by inducing the transcription of rpos the gene encoding the general stress response sigma factor rpos that also controls ppk expression6 we tested transcript levels of rpos and ppk in wild-type uropathogenic escherichia coli upec upon nutrient shift in the absence and presence of mesalamine.

values obtained from samples digested in the absence of ppk were subtracted from the values of samples digested in the presence of ppk to calculate the amount of polyp in each sample.

the aqueous phase was transferred to another tube and the organic layer was back extracted with 1 volume 100 mm tris-hcl ph 8.5 2 mm edta.
