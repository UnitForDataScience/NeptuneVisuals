This mixture was applied 1 min at 3000g to silica membrane spin columns Econospin Epoch Life Science and rinsed twice with 0.75 ml NW Buffer 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 50 mM NaCl 5 mM EDTA 50 ethanol.

PolyP extracts and standards of known polyP content 0-10 uM that also went through the GITC extraction procedure were incubated 1 h at 37 degC with 250 uM adenosine diphosphate ADP 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 50 mM ammonium sulfate 5 mM MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 50 nM E. coli PPK.

In brief samples were resuspended in 100 mM Tris pH 8.5 2 mM EDTA and two volumes of lysis buffer 200 mM NaOH 1 SDS were added vigorously vortexed and incubated for 10 min.

PolyP extracts were incubated for 1 h at 37 degC with 250 uM ultrapure ADP 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 50 mM ammonium sulfate 5 mM MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 50 nM E. coli PPK.Detection of ATP.

The aqueous phase was transferred to another tube and the organic layer was back extracted with 1 volume 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 2 mM EDTA.

To reduce the background ATP signal samples were incubated 120 volume 40 mM Hepes pH 7.5 76 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 U ml-1 apyrase for 20 min at 30 degC.

Stocks 100 mM of mesalamine and other potential inhibitors were prepared in dimethylsulfoxide DMSO diluted in DMSO and used immediately.Protein purificationC-terminally His6-tagged PPK from E. coli MG1655 and N-terminally His6-tagged PPX from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were purified as previously described2.Bacterial strains and growth conditionsAll strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

V. cholerae El Tor C6706lacZ and its ppk1-TnFGL3kan derivative were from the defined transposon insertion collection of Cameron et al.15 and were provided by Victor DiRita University of Michigan.Unless specified otherwise UPEC P. aeruginosa and V. cholera were grown aerobically at 37 degC in lysogenic broth LB or potassium morpholinopropanesulfonate MOPS minimal medium Teknova containing 0.2 glucose 1.32 mM potassium phosphate and 10 uM thiamine.
