Earlier studies on expanded antibiotic prophylaxis for cesarean births showed reductions in postoperative endometritis and wound infection with azithromycin given after cordCommentclamp.910 This dosing schedule might retain most if not all of the maternal benefit while reducing neonatal antibiotic exposure because azithromycin is transported rapidly across the placenta maintains high uterine concentrations and has a 72 h half-life.11Although surgical prophylaxis primarily reduces the bioburden sufficiently to allow the immune system to clear remaining bacteria contaminating surgical sites treatment regimens eradicate already established infections.12 Azithromycin targets genital tract microbes such as mycoplasma and ureaplasma that are commonly linked to post-partum infections.1 The azithromycin prophylactic dose used by Tita and colleagues 500 mg given once intravenously is equivalent to 1 g of oral therapy with respect to bioavailability and is an effective treatment for almost all genital tract infections.
