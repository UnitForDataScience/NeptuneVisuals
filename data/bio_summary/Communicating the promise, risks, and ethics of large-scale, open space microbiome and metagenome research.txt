Concerns regarding po- tential public panic and financial and other damages to the city that may be caused by sampling transportation systems may thereby detract city officials from approving microbiome surveys.However public officials should be made aware that sampling the transport system can help monitor and fight the spread of pathogenic microorganisms particu- larly during seasonal outbreaks and develop strategies that the public can adopt to improve travelers' health alleviate their concerns and promote the use of public transport.

In modern cities gaining infor- mation about microbial populations will enhance cities' efforts to improve public health We thereby sug- gest that microbiome studies will ultimately improve cit- ies' reputation via the public's perception of greater public health monitoring.Research efforts targeted at the indoor environment where most people spend  90 of their time have sig- nificant potential to improve public health.

Keeping a live blog of the web- site designed for the broader audience would allow the team to announce upcoming steps and also share the ex- perience of interacting with the public Such a platform will allow the researchers to promote the study on social media Facebook and YouTube as well as on various forums and encourage dialog between re- searchers participants and the general public We note that several guidelines for public engagement are already in place.

While the public has shown an interest in projects aiming to chart the gut microbiome of humansor animals and even test the microbiome be- havior in space there remain concerns that micro- biome mapping of the open space environment would raise major public concerns reservations from using public facilities and social unrest.

The concerns identified and explained here and the recommendations for public engagement can be used as guidelines and benefit microbiome and metagenome research.The most common concerns associated with the public impact of microbiome research Ostracizing sensitive populationsSince the earliest human microbiome project in 1683 when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek scraped gritty matter from between his teeth and visualized bacteria research on human-associated microorganisms has focused on pathogens and the environments that allowed them to flourish  linking the presence of microorganisms and human contact with pathogenicity .Microbiome studies are typically targeted at least in part at quantifying microbial biodiversity.

For example the National Institute for Health and safety has a documentrecommending different types of masks based on the potential hazard and professional judgment Disparaging cities and public sitesSimilar to as discussed above the public's association be- tween microbiology and disease may result in a negative association for microbiome sampling sites.

This was first recog- nized by Dr. John Snow after the cholera outbreak in 1854 in central London which took the lives of more than 500 people and after which there was a new found awareness that cholera and other pathogens could be spread through the drinking water For these rea- sons water facilities in the UK and many other countries are constantly monitored and tested for pathogens toxins or other forms of contamination to limit poten- tial public health impact Such monitoring however generally excludes sewage conveyance and treatment systems that are known to contain human and animal pathogens - More- over not all public water sources around the globe are being monitored regularly or at all.

Disruption in the gut micro- flora may cause irritable bowel disease IBD character- ized by a continuous inflammatory process in the gut even after the primary pathogen has been eradicated Further investigations into how to stabilize and perhaps diversify our microenvironment may improve our quality of life Bacteria are also notoriously associated with dirt dis- eases and a general state of uncleanliness and struggling with the poor public relations of bacteria can be ex- pected to hinder public microbiome initiatives at various levels.

These studies though limited in size offer a new angle to consider chronic illnesses and encourage a public's re- consideration of the value of bacteria and invite further research in this field.RecommendationsBased on our long-term experience with public engage- ment we make several recommendations that can enhance the accessibility and transparency of micro- biome research.

This may also yield fruitful collaborations as science can be linked with politics to increase the public outreach An example of public engagement could be delivering short tutorials for school children on the importance of washing hands and improving the overall hygiene in schools.
