manipulated the fly gut microbiota and carried out behavioural and chemosensory assays that showed that the composition of the host microbiota can influence not only microbial acquisition but also nutritional preferences.

these findings support the notion that the gut microbiota can modify host responses.moreover the data suggest that microbial acquisition and foraging decisions are driven by chemosensory responses.original article chun-nin wong a. et al.
