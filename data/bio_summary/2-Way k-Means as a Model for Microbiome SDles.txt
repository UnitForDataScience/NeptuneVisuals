We showed that while most of the sampleslie in six clusters four well-defined clusters and two sub- clusters.

The Human Micro- biome Project and its derivatives such as the Human Vaginal Microbiome Project have collected and thus analyzed large numbers of samples towards elucidating the structure and composition of microbiota across physiological and pathological states.Similar to variation in microbial genomes across different human individuals variants along the nuclear genomes have been summarized by a small number of dimensions How- ever in contrast to analyses of microbiome samples analyses of inherited genetic variation standardly assume and observe samples to be spread across a continuum in the reduced space rather than be clustered Samples in between clusters are interpreted as originating from intermediate locales along ageographic cline or as representing different levels of a mixture between cluster-specific populations.In this paper we formally tackle the problem of cluster- ing while allowing elements to belong to two clusters.

Aside from the top four OTUs separating the data into discrete clusters obscures how therest of the OTUs can be characterized.By using each data point's cluster-pair assignment we further separate the data into k2 - k clusters.

Microbiome sequencing allows defining clusters of samples with shared composition.

This paper addresses unsupervised learning of 2-way clusters.

We construct a model that generalizes k-means clustering by allowing data points to be assigned to a point in the space along the line between two assigned clusters Each cluster is still modeled as a Gaussian with uniform spherical covari- ances the key difference is the presence of a parameter u  0 1 for each 2-way-assigned data point xi which deter-mines the proportional assignment of xi between its twocluster representatives.

xi is drawn from a Gaussian distribution whose parameters are ui-weighted averages of two representative clusters.

Specifically xi N xi mijj' S such that mijj'  uimj  1 - ui mj' and S  Rdxd is the given uniform spherical covariance matrix.The inference problem involves the inputs of data X andnumber of clusters k seeking output of the generative model parameters that is the vectors of assignments C  c1 ... cn and weights U  u1 ... un .Generalized k-Means.

This corresponds with the fol- lowing objectiveis respectively true 2-way cluster assignment of xi center of cluster j and 2-way weighting for xi between clusters j j' .
