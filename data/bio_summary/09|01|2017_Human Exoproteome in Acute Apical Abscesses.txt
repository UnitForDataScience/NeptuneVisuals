such as hemoglobin and albumin were abundant in some samples.

Proteins involved in cellular processes and meta- bolism were the most common followed by proteins related to the immune system Table 1.A total of 78 different proteins associated with the immune system were identified and the most frequent ones were immunoglobulins S100 proteins complement proteins and 4 distinct types of heat shock proteins HSPs.

The occurrence of components of the adaptive immune response can be explained by the fact that abscesses are often a result of acute exacerbation of previously chronic apical periodontitis lesions in which components of both innate and adaptive immune responses have been found to coexist 16.S100 proteins were another common finding in this study.

Conclusions The human exoproteome included a wide variety of proteins related to cellular processes metabolism and immune response.

J Endod 2017431479-1485Key WordsAcute apical abscess endodontic infection exopro- teome immune defensendodonticinfections are polymicrobial in nature and are the primary cause of apical periodontitis 1 2.

Each identified pro- tein should have at least 1 peptide sequence not shared with any other protein ie unique peptides.The identified human proteins were categorized according to their biological function into cellular processes and metabolism circulatory system extracellular matrix immune system and otherunknown as previously described 15.

Moreover many pro- teins associated with the immune defense against bacteria were found in the pus samples indicating an active protective response against bacte- ria invading the periapical tissues.As expected many PMN-related proteins were identified.

PMNs play an important role in the innate immune response to bacterial infection and in abscess formation.

NETs play an impor- tant role in the innate immune response against a wide range of gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria via degradation of their virulence factors and killing 20 21.
