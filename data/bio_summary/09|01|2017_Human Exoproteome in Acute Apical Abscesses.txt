apical periodontitis lesions have been shown to contain immunoglobulin gs with specificity against several bacterial species associated with endodontic infections 23. immune antigen-antibody complexes are 3-fold more abundant in patients with apical abscesses than in healthy patients 24. immu- noglobulins play important roles in the defense against pathogens including neutralization and clearance of virulence factors opsoniza- tion and activation of the complement system via the classical pathway 25. the occurrence of components of the adaptive immune response can be explained by the fact that abscesses are often a result of acute exacerbation of previously chronic apical periodontitis lesions in which components of both innate and adaptive immune responses have been found to coexist 16.s100 proteins were another common finding in this study.

proteins involved in cellular processes and meta- bolism were the most common followed by proteins related to the immune system table 1.a total of 78 different proteins associated with the immune system were identified and the most frequent ones were immunoglobulins s100 proteins complement proteins and 4 distinct types of heat shock proteins hsps.

nets play an impor- tant role in the innate immune response against a wide range of gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria via degradation of their virulence factors and killing 20 21. in addition to their involvement in microbial killing some factors released by pmns and detected in this study such as myeloperoxidases elastase and gelatinase may cause damage to the adjacent tissues and contribute to the abscess pathogenesis 22.table 1. the number of distinct human proteins identified in acute apical abscessesbiological functionproteinscellular processmetabolism151immune system78extracellular matrix2circulatory system21otherunknown51total303proteins involved in the adaptive immune response were also identified in abscess samples.

immune system proteins were also very frequent and included immuno- globulins s100 proteins complement proteins and heat shock proteins.

conclusions the human exoproteome included a wide variety of proteins related to cellular processes metabolism and immune response.

j endod 2017431479-1485key wordsacute apical abscess endodontic infection exopro- teome immune defensendodonticinfections are polymicrobial in nature and are the primary cause of apical periodontitis 1 2. an acute apical abscess is a severe manifestation of apical periodontitis and one of the most common and severe dental infections 3. this type of abscess is characterized by an extrara- dicular infection resulting from the massive egressionof bacteria and their products from the necrotic root canal to the apical periodontal tissues.

proteins were identified when they presented at least 1 unique peptide with a false discovery rate of less than 1. each identified pro- tein should have at least 1 peptide sequence not shared with any other protein ie unique peptides.the identified human proteins were categorized according to their biological function into cellular processes and metabolism circulatory system extracellular matrix immune system and otherunknown as previously described 15. data were deposited and are publicly avail- able at peptide atlas resultsafter grouping repeated proteins 303 distinct human proteins were identified in the exoproteome analysis of the 14 acute apical abscess samples.

moreover many pro- teins associated with the immune defense against bacteria were found in the pus samples indicating an active protective response against bacte- ria invading the periapical tissues.as expected many pmn-related proteins were identified.

pmns play an important role in the innate immune response to bacterial infection and in abscess formation.

s100 proteins are regarded as alarmins they are released to the extracellular milieu after infection or tissue damage and act as danger signals that may serve as markers of destructive tissue processes 26. alarmins interact with receptors expressed by host defense cells to stimulate the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses triggering inflammation 27 28. to the best of our knowledge these alarmins had never been previously detected in apical abscesses.an important antibacterial response of the host is iron sequestra- tion at the site of infection 29. iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogens therefore depriving bacteria of this factor is an important antibacterial strategy 30. some proteins involved in iron sequestration were found in the abscesses examined including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin lactoferrin and transferrin.

the complement system is a network of interacting soluble and cell surface-associated molecules that play an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses to infection 34. this system is involved in chemotaxis opsonization and lysis of pathogens via formation of a membrane attack complex.

additionally highly abundant peptides may mask the detection of low-abundance peptides 40. therefore irrespective of the numerous important proteins identified in this study the possibility exists that the diversity of proteins involved in abscesses may still have been underestimated.in conclusion analysis of the human exoproteome in acute apical abscesses indicates a large diversity of proteins primarily involved in cellular processes metabolism and immune response.
