Pathophysiological mechanisms shared between GI dysfunction and IAHShocked patients with IAH IAP  12 mm Hg were found to have a higher rate of acute kidney injury AKI than those without IAH 23 and this finding was thought to be attribut- able to a decreased abdominal perfusion pressure APP  MAP - IAP in such patients.The pathophysiological mechanisms shared between GI dysfunction and IAH are shown in Figure 2.The following mechanisms linking IAP and GI function are discussed in detail further onThe effect of increasing intra-abdominal volume on the development of IAH.Effects of IAH on systemic blood flow and vascular re- sistance.The effect of IAH on splanchnic organ perfusion.Abdominal lymph flow in critically ill patients with IAH.Intestinal blood flow and enteral nutrition.Effects of IAH on tissue perfusion and microcirculation.The effect of vasopressors on splanchnic perfusion in the setting of IAH.The effect of IAH and critical illness on gut microbiome and gut permeability.Intestinal oedema formation in critically ill patients and in patients with IAH.Bowel distension and IAH.the effect of increAsing intrA-AbdominAl volume on the development of iAhIf intra-abdominal volume IAV increases IAP starts to increase as well.

In the 35 of the patients with IAH and GI symptoms the GI symptoms occurred before they developed IAH in 11 IAH occurred before they developed GI symptoms while in 54 both IAH and GI symptoms were noticed simultaneously 12.A higher prevalence of feeding intolerance FI in pa-tients with IAH has been demonstrated in several studies 4 114.

Only 3 of patients with IAH did not have any GI symptoms whereas 36 of patients presented both IAH and at least one GI symptom during their entire ICU stay 12.

IAH has been shown to influence the outcome of critically ill patients whereas the roleofthe GI system inthedevelopment as well as in the outcome of IAH is poorly clarified 8 10-12.The aim of this current review is to describe possible interactions and associations between GI dysfunction and IAP from a pathophysiological and clinical point of view.METHODSMEDLINE and PubMed searches were performed us- ing the search terms 'gastrointestinal symptoms' 'gastro- intestinal dysfunction' 'acute gastrointestinal injury' 'intra--abdominal pressure''intra-abdominal hypertension''intra--abdominal hypertension' 'abdominal perfusion' 'micriobi- ome' 'abdominal compartment syndrome' and 'critically ill' OR 'intensive care' OR 'critical care' OR 'critical illness'.

Frequently studies categorize patients has having IAH without assessing either the degree of IAH its duration or the timeframe of its development.

However promising vasopressin may be in critically ill patients with septic shock the addition of vasopressin has been shown to in- crease the gastric PCO2 gap suggesting possible splanch-nic hypoperfusion 87 88.the effect of iAh And criticAl illness on gut permeAbility And gut microbiomeIn animal experiments IAH has been shown to 1 in- crease oxidative stress and free radicals in the splanchnic region 89 90 2 reduce the number and expression of in- tracellular tight junctions 65 66 3 increase gutpermeabil- ity measured as an increase in the transfer of marked dextran from the intestinal to the portal vein 65 66 4 increase apoptosis activity in the gut 90 5 increase splanchnic neutrophil recruitment 90 and 6 increase portal venous endotoxin levels 65.Histological changes of IAH exposure include the forma- tion of mucosal oedema neutrophil infiltration mitochon- drial swelling and necrosis of the villi 66.IAH causes bacterial translocation in the basis of splanch- nic hypoperfusion and ischemic changes.

As soon as hemodynamic stability is achieved after the resuscitation phase there should be a transition to a more conservative fluid management and a 'late goal directed fluid removal' de-resuscitation 72.Despite the knowledge that increased volumes of fluid resuscitation increases gut oedema and IAH the best type of fluid in critically ill patients with impending or established gut oedema andor IAH is unknown.

More than half of these patients present with IAH grade I and approximately one quarter with IAH grade II 24.

A few studies have shown that GI symptoms occur more often in patients with IAH and that IAH is associated with feeding intolerance.

However IAH has been suggested as a mechanism leading to pre-eclampsia when adaptation to an increase in IAH appears insufficient 24.In adults a cut-off value of 12 mm Hg IAP has been cho-sen as observational data shows that mortality in critically ill patients increases above this threshold 10 11 21.
