however iah has been suggested as a mechanism leading to pre-eclampsia when adaptation to an increase in iah appears insufficient 24.in adults a cut-off value of 12 mm hg iap has been cho-sen as observational data shows that mortality in critically ill patients increases above this threshold 10 11 21. signs of organ dysfunction duration of mechanical ventilation icu length of stay and icu mortality are increased in most studies 10 11 25.figure 2. pathophysiological mechanisms shared between gi dysfunction and iahshocked patients with iah iap  12 mm hg were found to have a higher rate of acute kidney injury aki than those without iah 23 and this finding was thought to be attribut- able to a decreased abdominal perfusion pressure app  map - iap in such patients.the pathophysiological mechanisms shared between gi dysfunction and iah are shown in figure 2.the following mechanisms linking iap and gi function are discussed in detail further onthe effect of increasing intra-abdominal volume on the development of iah.effects of iah on systemic blood flow and vascular re- sistance.the effect of iah on splanchnic organ perfusion.abdominal lymph flow in critically ill patients with iah.intestinal blood flow and enteral nutrition.effects of iah on tissue perfusion and microcirculation.the effect of vasopressors on splanchnic perfusion in the setting of iah.the effect of iah and critical illness on gut microbiome and gut permeability.intestinal oedema formation in critically ill patients and in patients with iah.bowel distension and iah.the effect of increasing intra-abdominal volume on the development of iahif intra-abdominal volume iav increases iap starts to increase as well.

only 3 of patients with iah did not have any gi symptoms whereas 36 of patients presented both iah and at least one gi symptom during their entire icu stay 12. in the 35 of the patients with iah and gi symptoms the gi symptoms occurred before they developed iah in 11 iah occurred before they developed gi symptoms while in 54 both iah and gi symptoms were noticed simultaneously 12.a higher prevalence of feeding intolerance fi in pa-tients with iah has been demonstrated in several studies 4 114. bejarano et al.

the number of colonic microbiome cells has been calculated to be equal to that of human cells with an estimated colonic inner volume of 400 ml and a bacterial density of 1011 bacteria per g 96.the intestinal microbiome is considered to function as a virtual organ responsible for upholding important physi- ological functions including 1 immunological functionsintestinal mucus production 3 upholding permeability via tight junctions and 4 digesting complex plant poly- saccharides into acetate and butyrate an important energy source for colonic epithelial cells 93 97.in comparison to healthy patients the microbiome's composition and function changes in critically ill patients 97. in case of severe changes a dysbiosis occurs a state in which disruption of the local homeostasis causes the microbiome to collapse both in bacterial biomass and in functional output altered protein expression 98. environ- mental factors such as ph iron phosphate and osmolality can change a friend to foe and bacteria from commensal to pathogen 98.the main causes for dysbiosis in critically ill patients are as follows 1 critical illness 2 nutritional changes 3 the use of antibiotics d gut ischemia and perhaps 4 the presence of abdominal hypertension 93 97 98.of note is that around two thirds of critically ill patients receive antibiotics during their icu stay causing collateral damage to the microbiota and promoting the growth of pathogens 99. the consequences of a microbiome failure include the reduction in barrier function through a reduc- tion in mucin production and increased permeability re- duction in tight junctions 93. observational data indicate a strong relationship between previous dysbiosis due to antibiotic exposure and increased occurrence of subse- quent severe sepsis 100.it is thought that by correcting dysbosis and restor- ing a functional microbiome there will be 1 a restored intestinal barrier function tight junction colonic mucin production 2 an improved intestinal immune function iga production suppression of immune cell proliferationa reduction of gut apoptosis and 4 a reduction of patho- gens both in number and function 98.encouraging case reports and observational data of suc- cessful faecal transplant in patients with abdominal sepsis and with clostridium difficile infections supportthe rationale for intervention regarding microbiota 101-103.probiotics are living microbes of human origin that when ingested can colonize the gi tract and provide benefits to the host 104. probiotics are being increasingly investigated in criti- cally ill patients and have also been shown tocorrect dysbiosis and revitalize the microbiome 98. however despite some studies and meta-analyses on probiotics to critically ill patients showing promising results e.g.

iap is the steady state pressure conceived within the abdominal cavity that can be measured via the bladder at end-expiration in the supine position zeroed at the level where the midaxillary line crosses the iliac crest 9. intra-abdominal hypertension iah is defined as a sustained increase of iap equal to or above 12 mm hg 9. iah has been shown to influence the outcome of critically ill patients whereas the roleofthe gi system inthedevelopment as well as in the outcome of iah is poorly clarified 8 10-12.the aim of this current review is to describe possible interactions and associations between gi dysfunction and iap from a pathophysiological and clinical point of view.methodsmedline and pubmed searches were performed us- ing the search terms 'gastrointestinal symptoms' 'gastro- intestinal dysfunction' 'acute gastrointestinal injury' 'intra--abdominal pressure''intra-abdominal hypertension''intra--abdominal hypertension' 'abdominal perfusion' 'micriobi- ome' 'abdominal compartment syndrome' and 'critically ill' or 'intensive care' or 'critical care' or 'critical illness'.

more than half of these patients present with iah grade i and approximately one quarter with iah grade ii 24. most studies confirm the association of iah and poor patient outcome 11. however some au- thors suggest that mortality is not increased by iah when corrected by other confounding factors 19. arguably the degree of iah may only be a marker of disease severity.

moreover the increased abdominal venous pressure in the context of iah causes a venous backflow pressure comparable to venous congestion that occurs in patients with right heart failure and thereby impairs organ perfusion even in the face of a preserved map 36 49.iah causes a dose-related decrease in abdominal blood flow including the mesenteric artery the hepatic artery the portal veins and the renal artery 46 50-54. the threshold of iap causing reductions in regional abdominal blood flow has been shown to vary between 8 and 20 mm hg and probably reflects the different measurement techniques used doppler flow probes transit-time flow probes and subjects studied animals humans 46 53.abdominal lymph flow in critically ill patients with iahthe lymphatic system drains and transports excessive interstitial fluid from the gi system to lymphatic ducts which are further drained via the thoracic duct into the systemic circulation at the angle of the left subclavian and internal jugular veins.

chronic ascites massive fluid resuscitation burns and plays a major role inwhether a patient develops iah or abdominal compartment syndrome acs 9 26-29.when increasing iav three different phases in an ab- dominal pressure-volume curve may be distinguished 1 the reshaping phase where abdominal configuration changes ellipsoid to circular circumference along with a minimal change in iap 2 the stretching phase with elastic elonga- tion of the abdominal wall and diaphragmatic tissue where iap increases in parallel with iav and 3 the pressurizing phase with large increases in iap with relatively small ad- ditional iav 26 27. stretching capacity is dependent not only on abdominal wall structure and compliance but also on the shape elasticity and function of the diaphragm 26. thoraco-abdominal interactions may also play important role in development as well as in the consequences of iap especially in critically ill patients 30. next to reshap- ing and stretching capacity these dynamic changes are dependent on the resting baseline values of iav and iap being different in each patient.

a reduction in splanchnic blood flow leads to the production of vasodilatory me- tabolites.pathophysiological mechanisms connecting gi dysfunction and iahthere is still some debate whether iah per se increases mortality or is just another marker of the severity of the dis- ease 19 20. some of the differences found in the literature regarding the effect on outcome may be explained with the duration and degree of iah being important factors in deter- mining the effect of iap on organ dysfunction and outcome 20 21-23. frequently studies categorize patients has having iah without assessing either the degree of iah its duration or the timeframe of its development.

in dogs vasopressin has been shown to improve renal blood flow only in septic conditions 77. however promising vasopressin may be in critically ill patients with septic shock the addition of vasopressin has been shown to in- crease the gastric pco2 gap suggesting possible splanch-nic hypoperfusion 87 88.the effect of iah and critical illness on gut permeability and gut microbiomein animal experiments iah has been shown to 1 in- crease oxidative stress and free radicals in the splanchnic region 89 90 2 reduce the number and expression of in- tracellular tight junctions 65 66 3 increase gutpermeabil- ity measured as an increase in the transfer of marked dextran from the intestinal to the portal vein 65 66 4 increase apoptosis activity in the gut 90 5 increase splanchnic neutrophil recruitment 90 and 6 increase portal venous endotoxin levels 65.histological changes of iah exposure include the forma- tion of mucosal oedema neutrophil infiltration mitochon- drial swelling and necrosis of the villi 66.iah causes bacterial translocation in the basis of splanch- nic hypoperfusion and ischemic changes.

a reduced citrulline level is associated with critical illness gi dysfunction 115 iah and increased mortality 116. as citrulline concentrations are influenced by renal function the practical value in criticallyill patients is questionable.the intestinal fatty acid binding protein i-fabp is a fast marker of intestinal ischaemiacellular damage 117. i-fabp is largely independent of underlying co-morbidities and may help distinguish sepsis of intestinal origin from other forms of sepsis 118 119.fluid management in iah and gi dysfunctionalthough hypovolemia needs to be corrected at the same time great attention should be paid to avoid fluid overload in both in iah and gi dysfunction.

57 found that endotoxinincreased thoracic lymph flow in anesthetised pigs whereas iah decreased lymph flow irrespective of whether the pigs were septic or not.intestinal blood flow and enteral nutritionin healthy subjects the presence of nutrients in the small intestine augments intestinal blood flow via stimulation of secretion of vasoactive gastrointestinal hormones 17. the magnitude of this increase in intestinal blood flow is dependent on meal size and the rate of nutrient delivery into the small bowel and can increase up to two-fold superior mesenteric artery flow 17. such meal-induced splanchnic blood pooling diverting around 20 of total blood flow to the intestines results in a temporary relative systemic hypovolemia 59. this relative systemic hypovolemia stimulates the baroreceptors to increase sympathetic ac- tivity leading to increase in heart rate and stroke volume thereby augmenting cardiac output 59 but also leading to a vasoconstriction of the skeletal vasculature 17. in shocked patients such food-related increase in splanchnic blood flow may be deleterious due to possible reperfusion injury or stealing bloodoxygen from other vital organs such as the heart and brain 17.it is not clear to what degree and in what situationsenteral nutrition may protect against or on the contrary exacerbate mesenteric ischemia in critically ill patients 17. to some degree the delayed gastric emptying found in such patients diminishes the delivery of nutrient to the small intestine and may attenuate the described reactions 17. on the other hand due to impaired absorption of nutrients in the critically ill undigested carbohydrates and fats may remain in the distal small intestine thereby sustaining the aforementioned reactions for longer periods.

indeed the results suggest that patients with higher apache ii scores are more vulnerable to iap induced fi 114. in many other studies higher severity of illness scores have been re- ported in patients with iah as well as in patients with gi dysfunction and fi 4 19 20.implications for clinical practice and future researchmonitoring of gi function and iapbecause gi function is difficult tomeasureand quantify this topic has been under-investigated and neglected in the past.

recent findings revealed that changes in abdominal tissue metabolism assessed via microdialysis  may occur well before the development of iah-related organ dysfunc-tion 70 71.the effect of vasopressors on splanchnic perfusion in the setting of iahfluid resuscitation may improve blood pressure and cardiac output in patients with iah but may also further increase iap thereby decreasing app and starting a vicious cycle 72. often vasoactive drugs are used to stabilize systemic hemodynamic variables in these patients.

as the gi system is a major space occupant in the abdominal compartment it is important to clarify its role in the development of iah and vice versa.the abdominal compartment is surrounded by the diaphragm spine costal arch abdominal wall and pelvis.
