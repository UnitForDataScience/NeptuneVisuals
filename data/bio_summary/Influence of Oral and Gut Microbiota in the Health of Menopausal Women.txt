in addition changes in periodontal status were found to be associated with variations in sex hormone levels   and the occurrence of periodontitis was reported to be greater in postmenopausal women who did not receive hormone replacement than in premenopausal women  .

therefore from a clinical point of view the roles of sex hormones and hormone therapy in the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection in peri- and postmenopausal women are of great interest.in a cohort study that included 106 women aged 50-58 years hormone replacement therapy led to a decreased number of positive samples showing the periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis prevotella intermedia and t. forsythia from the subgingival plaque  .

multiple studies have suggested that postmenopausal women exhibit increased total fat mass and abdominal fat anddecreased lean body mass compared with those of premenopausal women regardless of aging      .

a cross-sectional study on 60 healthy postmenopausal women found that women with a more diverse gut microbiome and an abundance of four clostridia taxa exhibited an elevated urinary ratio of hydroxylated estrogen metabolites to parent estrogens   which is related to the etiology of breast cancer    .
