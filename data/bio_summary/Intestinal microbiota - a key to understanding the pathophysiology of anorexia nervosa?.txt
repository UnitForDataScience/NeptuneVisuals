All these reports tend to reflect on the fundamental importance of the gut microbiota in maintaining health and normal body weight and probably that is why the interest which initiated research into the role of gut bacteria in obesity quickly covered the opposite pole of disorders focusing lately on the problem of anorexia.Intestinal microbiota - the role in the regulation of body mass in anorexia nervosaBased on the latest reports 46-49 we may suspect that the gut dysbiosis observed in patients with anorexia nervosa significantly affects the course of the illness and any modifications to the intestinal microbiota can become in the near future a helpful therapy for this disorder.Animal studiesIn 2013 a group of Spanish scientists published the results of the research on rats which show significant differences in the composition of gut microbiota in the course of anorexia and significant correlation between the composition of microbiota and the plasma concentration of hormones regulating appetite - leptin and ghrelin 50.

These results confirm the hypothesis that the gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa is significantly different from that observed in healthy subjects.One of the latest research exploring the relationships between gut microbiota and anorexia is the one carried out in 2015 by Kleiman et al.

Comparing the stool samples of 25 women suffer- ing from anorexia nervosa 14 with restrictive type of anorexia and 11 with bulimic type of anorexia with samples of 21 healthy volunteers from the same age group Japanese researchers found significant differences in the composition of microbiota of anorexic patients.

This may suggest the existence of significant differences in the composition of the gut microbiota in the course of anorexia but on the basis of a single study it is difficult to assess how the identified species are specific to anorexia nervosa.

The results of previous studies are very promising and create a solid base for exploration of innovative methods of treatment of anorexia nervosa based on themodification of the gut microbiota.ReferencesPapadopoulos FC Ekbom A Brandt L Ekselius L. Excess mortality causes of death and prog- nostic factors in anorexia nervosa.

Completion of research is planned for October 2016.Another study that indicates an interest in the described subject is currently un- derway in Croatia and is intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of supplementation with the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders in children and adolescents with anorexia 68.Finally also the research analyzing the relationship between the development of anorexia and bacterial antigens influencing the regulation of appetite by molecular mimicry is worth mentioning.

These data suggest a significant effect of the gut microbiota on the regulation of appetite.On the other hand Jesus et al 51. in 2014 described the functioning of intestinal barrier in activity-based anorexia in mice.

The results of these diverse studies confirm the important role of gut microbiota in regulation of body weight and the development of anorexia.Human subjects researchIn 2009 a group of French researchers examined stool samples from 20 obese patients 9 patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and 20 healthy vol- unteers with normal weight in terms of the number of bacteria from groups Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Lactobacillus and archaea Methanobrevibacter smithii 46.

The study characterizes gut microbiota composition of 16 patients with anorexia nervosa at baseline and after treatment completion with weight gain.

49 it is certainly difficult to draw the unambiguous conclusion that gut dysbiosis is a direct cause or effect of observed anorexia nervosa symptoms.
