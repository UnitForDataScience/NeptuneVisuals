The unweighted UniFrac analysis suggests that the microbial communities of the Panchlora gut sections the A. colombica garden and the A. colombica refuse piles are each distinct and that while the microbial communities of the garden and refuse pile each shared highly similar community composition and membership the microbial communities of the Panchlora gut sections were more distinct from one another.

hindgut is similar to that found in the hindgut of a wild cockroach Blattella germanica  which could indicate the existence of a core microbial community in the hindgut of omnivorous cockroaches regardless of diet.

The analysis suggests that while Bacteroidetes may further degrade already partially digested leaf material consumed by their cockroach host Fir- micutes may utilize other bacteria as their primary carbon source perhaps even bacteria con- sumed as part of the leaf-cutter ant garden material.Microbiome of the foregut midgut and hindgutTo determine whether the microbial community of the Panchlora gut changes along the length of the alimentary tract the metagenomes of the foregut midgut and hindgut were evaluated individually .

The host-associated microbial communities of the Panchlora foregut midgut and hindgut are each distinct suggesting that both host-association and the internal environment specific to each gut section influences community composition.ConclusionsMetagenomic investigations of gut microbiomes shed light on the taxonomic diversity and genetic content of gut communities providing the foundation to study how host-associated microorganisms influence host physiology behavior and health.

The metagenomic sequence data also highlighted the presence of well-known anaerobic bacteria inthe hindgut suggesting that oxygen availability influences microbial community composition and contributes to the observed community changes.Analysis of the 16S amplicon libraries generated from the different gut sections corroborate the metagenomic sequencing results illustrating a clear increase in community richness along the alimentary tract.

The bacterial phyla that tend to dominate these microbial communities include Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria  - and the microbial communities of mammalian guts have generally been found to be more diverse than those of invertebrates .

The close proximity of the ant refuse pile an example of a free-living microbial community the leaf-cutter ant garden an example of a host-associated external digestion system   and the Panchlora gut an exampleof a host-associated internal digestion system offers a unique opportunity to examine the dynamics of multiple interacting microbial ecosystems.Materials and methodsWe acknowledge Ministerio de Ambiente de Panama' MiAmbiente and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute STRI for permission to collect material in the Republic of Panama.Cockroach collection and dissectionA total of 485 juvenile Panchlora cockroaches were collected from the external refuse piles of the leaf-cutter ant Atta colombica in Gamboa Panama latitude 9 7' 0 N longitude 79 42' 0 W from 7 to 22 November 2010.

The microbial community diversity of the individual gut sections was compared to previously sequenced microbial communities associated with leaf-cutter ant gardens and refuse piles by using Uni- Frac  and performing both weighted and unweighted calculations.

While the hindgut was dominated by diverse Firmicutes genera including Lactococcus Lactobacillus and Clostridium and Bacteroidetes genera such as Bacteroides and Parabacteroides the hindgut also harbored bacteria commonly found in the guts of ruminant mammals including Fusobacteria Ruminococus Megasphaera and Butyrivibrio -.While all minor members of the Panchlora hindgut many of these genera or related taxa have been identified in other omnivorous cockroaches    and are likely among the diverse community members helping the cockroach to degrade and digest recalcitrant compo- nents of its food source.

The weighted UniFrac analy- ses agree with the 16S amplicon results that suggest juvenile cockroaches consume the garden material most recently deposited on the refuse pile and support the hypothesis that while microorganisms consumed by the cockroach may partially seed the microbial community of the cockroach foregut the microbial community of each gut section is distinct.
