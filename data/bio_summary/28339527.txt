the venn diagram shows the numbers of otus 97 sequence identity that shared or unshared by duodenum jejunum ileum ce- cum and colon respectively depending on the overlaps.similarity in microbial community compositionthe similarity and difference of microbial commu- nity composition in 40 intestinal content samples taken from the 5 gut sections of 8 broiler chickens were shown in the pcoa plot with pc1 accounting for 45.17 of the total variation and pc2 accounting for 20.89. as a result microbial communities of duodenum jejunum ileum and colon formed clusters respectively but there are overlaps among the 4 clusters and microbial com- munities of duodenum jejunum and ileum were more similar while microbial communities of cecum formed adistinct cluster separate from that of other gut sections figure a.the hierarchically clustered heat map analysis associ- ated with the similarity of microbial community compo- sition was performed at the phylum level disclosed the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the gut content of each sample.

as shown in supplementary table 1 the richness of microbiota in cecum was highest and followed by duo- denum colon jejunum ileum while the microbiota in duodenum was more diverse and followed by cecumjejunum colon ileum.microbial community compositionthe rarefaction curves tended to attain the satu- ration plateau showing that the microbiota of the 40 samples were large enough to estimate the phenotype richness and microbial community diversity at the 97 similarity threshold figure .all sequences were classified into 15 phyla al- though 5 phyla were most common  1 firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria actinobac- teria and cyanobacteria figure a. firmicutes accounted for 60 of the reads obtained from duo- denum jejunum ileum and colon significantly higher than that in cecum  40 figure s1.

in our study we ex- amined the microbiota in duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon of broiler chicken supplied with com- mercial diet through 16s rrna gene sequencing.chao1 and shannon indices showed that the gut mi- crobiota of cecum was much more diverse while the microbiota of ileum was of the lowest diversity which was in accordance with the results that microbiota in cecum were more diverse than that in ileum performed in previous studies bjerrum et al.

proteobacte- ria was highest in duodenum 20 and significantly less in jejunum ileum cecum and colon representing less than 10. actinobacteria was most dominant in ileum followed by jejunum duodenum and colon with nearly none in the cecum.

moreover corynebacterium was higher in ileum followed by jejunum duodenum and colon and nearly none was found in cecum figure b supplemen- tary figure 2. individual differences existed between samples from the same gut section supplementary figure 2.shared and unique microbial populationsto investigate the gut microbial community in differ- ent git sections pairwise comparison of microbial sim- ilarity among the 5 chicken gut sections was performed as well as analysis of the common and unique otus was conducted shown in the venn diagram.

all these results could offer some information for the future study on the relationship be- tween intestinal microbiota and broiler chicken growth performance as well as health.key words broiler chicken intestine microbiota composition 16s rrna illumina miseq2017 poultry science 961387-1393 introductionchicken intestinal tract is composed of duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon which are inhabited by various bacteria methanogenic archaea fungi and viruses qu et al.

the number of cyanobac- teria in jejunum was significantly higher than that of ileum duodenum colon and cecum which was dif- ferent from wei and colleagues' study that firmicutes and bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the most predominant phyla in cecum and firmi- cutes was dominant accounting for approximately 78 wei et al.

in the other hand microbiotal composition of duodenum jejunum ileum and colon appeared to share some similarity which agrees with lu et al.

the compre- hensive characterization of normal chicken intestinal microbial communities is a critical precondition to un- derstand and predict the alterations in these communi- ties related to feed physiological state so we conducted this study to elucidate the microbial communities in chicken intestinal tract.a large microbial community inhabits the git and plays an important role in chicken growth and health through enhancing nutrient absorption and strength- ening the immune system choi et al.

statistical analyses were carried out in graohoad prism program version 5.0.1. the differences were consid- ered to be significant at p  0.05. results are presented as means - standard deviation sd.resultsthe microbial complexitya total of 1502554 sequences were obtained from 40 samples with the number of sequences ranging from 16980 to 58026 per individual after filtering for quality and clustered into 85 to 416 otus for each sample resulting in a total of 796 otus for all samples at the 97 sequence similarity value supplementary table 1. the microbial complexity in duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon was estimated on the basis of alpha-diversity indices chao1 index and shannon in- dex.

some papers have reported that the diversity and functions of chicken intestinal microbiota are almost related to the microbiota inhabited in ileum and cecum that the ileum is a main site of nutrient absorption while the ce- cum is mostly a site of fermentation and thatmicrobial communities were more diverse in ceca bjerrum et al.

's results that clostrid- ium bacteroides and lactobacillus were dominated in ilea accounting for 47 to 70 2 to 20 and  4 respectively as well as lu and colleagues' study that the sequences obtained from ileum were related to1392xiao et al.lactobacillus  70 followed by clostridiaceae 11 enterococcus 6.5 and streptococcus 6.5 lu et al.

enterococcus was also the most dominant genus in ileum and colon corynebacterium was higher in ileum followed by je- junum duodenum and colon with nearly none in cecum.

we find that bacteroides is more abundant in cecum while ruminococcus and faecalibacterium are richer in cecum and colon revealing the function of ce- cum and colon by the role of bacteroides ruminococ- cus and faecalibacterium play in the chicken growth and health.small intestine has been reported to function in nu- trient absorption while cecum is primarily involved in fermentation mohd shaufi et al.

firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria actinobac- teria and cyanobacteria were the major microbial groups and firmicutes was the dominant phylum induodenum jejunum ileum and colon accounting for  60 of sequences while bacteroidetes was the domi- nant phylum in cecum 50 of sequences but little in the other four gut sections.
