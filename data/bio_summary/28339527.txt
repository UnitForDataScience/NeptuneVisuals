In our study we ex- amined the microbiota in duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon of broiler chicken supplied with com- mercial diet through 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Chao1 and Shannon indices showed that the gut mi- crobiota of cecum was much more diverse while the microbiota of ileum was of the lowest diversity which was in accordance with the results that microbiota in cecum were more diverse than that in ileum performed in previous studies Bjerrum et al.

As a result microbial communities of duodenum jejunum ileum and colon formed clusters respectively but there are overlaps among the 4 clusters and microbial com- munities of duodenum jejunum and ileum were more similar while microbial communities of cecum formed adistinct cluster separate from that of other gut sections Figure A.The hierarchically clustered heat map analysis associ- ated with the similarity of microbial community compo- sition was performed at the phylum level disclosed the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in the gut content of each sample.

As shown in Supplementary Table 1 the richness of microbiota in cecum was highest and followed by duo- denum colon jejunum ileum while the microbiota in duodenum was more diverse and followed by cecumjejunum colon ileum.Microbial Community CompositionThe rarefaction curves tended to attain the satu- ration plateau showing that the microbiota of the 40 samples were large enough to estimate the phenotype richness and microbial community diversity at the 97 similarity threshold Figure .All sequences were classified into 15 phyla al- though 5 phyla were most common  1 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria Actinobac- teria and Cyanobacteria Figure A. Firmicutes accounted for 60 of the reads obtained from duo- denum jejunum ileum and colon significantly higher than that in cecum  40 Figure S1.

Shared OTUs are those present in at least 30 of each compared chicken gut section samples and unique OTUs were defined as those only present in more than 30 of one chicken gut section samples and absent in the other 4 gut sections.A total of 147 OTUs were shared by the 5 chicken gut sections whereas the number of OTUs only pre- sented in one chicken gut section varied from 5 to115.

All these results could offer some information for the future study on the relationship be- tween intestinal microbiota and broiler chicken growth performance as well as health.Key words broiler chicken intestine microbiota composition 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq2017 Poultry Science 961387-1393 INTRODUCTIONChicken intestinal tract is composed of duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon which are inhabited by various bacteria methanogenic archaea fungi and viruses Qu et al.

The number of Cyanobac- teria in jejunum was significantly higher than that of ileum duodenum colon and cecum which was dif- ferent from Wei and colleagues' study that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most predominant phyla in cecum and Firmi- cutes was dominant accounting for approximately 78 Wei et al.

In the other hand microbiotal composition of duodenum jejunum ileum and colon appeared to share some similarity which agrees with Lu et al.

Heat map analysis suggested the microbiotal composition and abundance were different among the 5 gut locations which might be due to that each of dif- ferent gut locations has its own function for the body and different gut microbes contribute to different gut functions.Lactobacillus has been reported as probiotics for chicken growth performance and weight gain andinvolved in the production of some essential vitamins as well as metabolism and recirculation of intestinal bile acid.

Some papers have reported that the diversity and functions of chicken intestinal microbiota are almost related to the microbiota inhabited in ileum and cecum that the ileum is a main site of nutrient absorption while the ce- cum is mostly a site of fermentation and thatmicrobial communities were more diverse in ceca Bjerrum et al.

Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria Actinobac- teria and Cyanobacteria were the major microbial groups and Firmicutes was the dominant phylum induodenum jejunum ileum and colon accounting for  60 of sequences while Bacteroidetes was the domi- nant phylum in cecum 50 of sequences but little in the other four gut sections.
