Despite this efforts to comprehensively address questions regarding the role of microbes in insect ecology and evolution are hindered by the geographically widespread nature of insect populations and closely related species.We propose to develop the Hawaiian Archipelago as an insect-microbiome model system to tackle fundamental questions in insect evolution that currently elude study.

Legend illustrates host insect species identity.Many insect groups are known to have diverse bacterial microbiomes that reside in the gut but that also contain members occurring in other tissues e.g.

Similarly the Hawaiian Drosophila maintain a fairly diverse microbiome but they contain several species in lower abundance that are uniquely shared between Hawaiian Drosophila and also with Drosophila species worldwide.

obligate bacterial and facultative symbionts found in sap-feeding leafhoppers and seed bugs2 Drosophila  Wekiu bug Drosophila spp.

These bacterial taxa have been identified as core members of the gut microbiomes in non-Hawaiian Drosophila species across the globe and also in other insects including termites and honeybees -.Although the importance of these microbes in Hawaiian Drosophila remain unknown given their widely conserved nature it is plausible that they play important roles in shaping host ecological adaptations.

The discrete origins and knowable phylogenetic history of endemic Hawaiian lineages permits targeted questions of how host-microbiome interactions have evolved through time and influenced host evolution.Given the intrinsic role of microbes in shaping insect ecology and diversity there is surprisingly little known about their role in the diversification of Hawaiian insect fauna.

Although host-microbe interactions are well understood for some insects such as those in the Hemiptera  the extent to which microbes influence insect adaption and diversity more broadly remains poorly understood.To gain a better understanding of how microbes may shape insect evolution we are initiating the Native Hawaiian Insect Microbiome Initiative NHIMI.

Wolbachia is one of the most widespread insect symbionts it infects up to 60 of all arthropod species including endemic Hawaiian insect lineages e.g.

To initiate this effort we have sequenced the bacterial microbiomes of thirteen species representing iconic endemic Hawaiian insect groups.
