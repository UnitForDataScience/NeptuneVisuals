In dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis the microbes protect from gastrointestinal injury while in other models T cell transfer IL-10 KO the T cell response is generated against the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract.35 The experimental IBD models have identified T cells innate cells and the microbiota as key factors that regulate inflammation and disease in the gastro- intestinal tract.The effects of vitamin D on experimental IBD models havebeen reviewed.36 Vitamin D deficient and VDR KO mice develop fulminating forms of several different models of experimental IBD.36 Treating mice with the active form of vitamin D 125OH2D inhibited IBD in murine models of disease.36 The targets of vitamin D in experimental IBD include gastrointestinal epithelial cell barrier function and both the innate and adaptive immune system.36 More recently it has become clear that vitamin D alters the composition of the commensal microbiota probably through regulation of the immune system.36 The mechanisms by which vitamin D regulates experimental IBD include regulation of gut barrierfunction the microbiota and the immune system to maintain gastrointestinal homeostasis.Two studies have examined the effects of UVR in one modelof experimental IBD.

1.4248 125OH2D treatment of T cells induced IL-4 production from Th2 cells.41 Mechanisms whereby UVR could regulate the T cell is via prostaglandin-E2 production and the formation of pyrimidine dimers and urocanic acid production.4950 These UVR induced factors have been shown to induce T reg cells and IL-10 production following UVR exposure of skin.4950 UVR was shown to induce functional T regs in VDR KO mice.51 Independent of vitamin D UVR induced T regs and suppressed antigen specific immune responses in vivo.51 The factors that mediate regulation of T cells following UVR exposure include both vitamin D inde-pendent and dependent effects of UVR Fig.

Genetic manipulation to inhibit regulatory immune responses are common in IBD models such as IL-10 KO.35 IL-10 KO animals develop spontaneous colitis as a result of the lack of regulatory T T reg cells that produce most of the IL-10 in the gastrointestinal tract.35 Transfer of naive T cells to immuno- deficient no T or B cells mice is an IBD model that has identified IFN-g producing Th1 and IL-17 producing Th17 cells as the immunopathologic T cells in experimental IBD.35 Co- transfer of naive T cells with T reg cells that produce IL-10 eliminates disease by suppressing the production of IFN-g and IL-17 by the naive T cells in the immunodeficient recipients.35 Chemical injury models of IBD have identified the important contribution of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system as important contributors to IBD suscepti-bility.35 All of the experimental IBD models are affected by thecommensal microbiota in the animal colonies.

The data suggest that there may be a vitamin D inde- pendent effect of UVR on experimental colitis.3738 Future workshould focus on the effects of UVR in other experimental models of IBD that involve T cells and the utilization of VDR KO mice to determine the UVR induced versus the vitamin D mediated effects of UVR treatments.Vitamin DUVR regulation of T cellsWhile it is clear that innate immune cells the microbiota the gut epithelium and T cells are critical regulators of gastro- intestinal homeostasis this commentary will focus on the effects of vitamin D versus UVR on T cells.

The incidence of ulcerative colitis was 40 higher and Crohn's disease was 80 higher in northern Europe compared to southern Europe.15 Other studies in France and Scotland showed similar results.16 In France a study described a clear north-south gradient for the incidence of Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis.17 This same group later found a correlation between lower UVR exposure and the increased Crohn's disease incidence observed in their earlier study.1718 In the US areas with lower UV exposure had increased incidence of IBD increased hospitalization rates and increased severity of disease.19-21 UV exposure was also associ-ated with the risk of gastrointestinal Clostridium difficileinfection.22 In addition patients with high UV exposure Arizona were 16 less likely to die from C. difficile infection in the hospital than patients with low UV exposure Michigan even when controlling for age gender and comorbidities.22 The above studies did not include vitamin D measurements but did suggest that changes in vitamin D status might account for the effects of UVR on IBD incidence and severity.Vitamin D and IBDThe vitamin D hypothesis suggests that vitamin D status is one of the environmental factors predisposing for the development of IBD.23 The effect of UVR on vitamin D status depends on skin color latitude skin exposure season etc.

The data so far demonstrating an inverse correlation between vitamin D status and IBD severity are stronger for patients with Crohn's disease than for patients with ulcerative colitis.26A prospective study that utilized the Nurses Health study and determined the relationship between 25OHD status and the risk of developing IBD showed a significant inverse risk between 25OHD levels and Crohn's disease but an insigni- ficant inverse association for ulcerative colitis.27 In two different prospective studies in Crohn's disease patients with low 25OHD levels 30 ng ml-1 required more hospitaliz- ations and surgery compared to patients with higher 25OHD levels at entry.2829 One of the two prospective studies included ulcerative colitis patients and showed that low 25OHD levels 30 ng ml-1 resulted in more morbidity and treatment esca- lation over the 5 years of the study follow up for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn's disease.29 Crohn's disease patients inclinical remission had higher 25OHD levels than those with mild or moderate disease and patients who used vitamin D supplements had lower C-reactive protein P  0.07 and CDAI scores P  0.05 than those who did not take supplements.30 The stronger associations of vitamin D onCrohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis could be because of the differences in the etiology of the diseases as evidenced by the unique as well as shared genetic risk factors for the two diseases.31 Vitamin D status is strongly inversely associated with IBD and especially Crohn's disease.There have only been a few clinical interventions done using vitamin D supplementation of Crohn's disease patients.

In a small open label pilot study vitamin D supplementation for 6 months 5000 IU d-1 improved quality of life scores in Crohn's subjects with mild to moderate disease and most of the patients 78 had CDAI scores below 150 indicating clini- cal remission after the 6 month intervention.32 A second small open label study demonstrated a positive effect of vitamin D analog intervention 6 week treatment using 1-alpha hydroxy-vitamin D on CDAI scores.33 Another small double- blind randomized controlled study demonstrated an insigni- ficant P  0.056 decrease in relapse rate with the 12 month vitamin D intervention 1200 IU d-1 as compared toplacebo.34 Each of the three vitamin D interventions in Crohn's disease utilized different vitamin D interventions and different study designs.32-34 There is currently disagreement by the experts as to the effective dose frequency of vitamin D delivery and serum 25OHD status cut offs for health outcomes making it more difficult to determine the effects ofvitamin D supplementation in clinical studies reviewed in ref.

The shared effects of both vitamin D and UVR on T cells includes induction of IL-10 producing T regs and suppression of T cell proliferation and Th1 and Th17 cells that produce IL-17 or IFN-g. UVR suppresses induction of Th2 cells while 125OH2D induces IL-4 production from Th2 cells and iNKT cells.

These studies have been complicated by the fact that UVR exposure of skin results in the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D is produced by UVB radiation of the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to form pre-vitamin D which is isomerized to vitamin D by heat.14 Vitamin D from eitherthe diet or UVR is first hydroxylated at the 25-position to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D 25OHD and then by the 1-alpha hydroxylase to form active vitamin D or 125-dihydroxy- vitamin D 125OH2D.

1.39-41 UVR also results in the inhibition of T cell proliferation and a more global inhibition of T cell produced Th1 Th17 and Th2 IL-4 secreting T cells cytokine responses in effector T cells Fig.
