the data so far demonstrating an inverse correlation between vitamin d status and ibd severity are stronger for patients with crohn's disease than for patients with ulcerative colitis.26a prospective study that utilized the nurses health study and determined the relationship between 25ohd status and the risk of developing ibd showed a significant inverse risk between 25ohd levels and crohn's disease but an insigni- ficant inverse association for ulcerative colitis.27 in two different prospective studies in crohn's disease patients with low 25ohd levels 30 ng ml-1 required more hospitaliz- ations and surgery compared to patients with higher 25ohd levels at entry.2829 one of the two prospective studies included ulcerative colitis patients and showed that low 25ohd levels 30 ng ml-1 resulted in more morbidity and treatment esca- lation over the 5 years of the study follow up for ulcerative colitis as well as crohn's disease.29 crohn's disease patients inclinical remission had higher 25ohd levels than those with mild or moderate disease and patients who used vitamin d supplements had lower c-reactive protein p  0.07 and cdai scores p  0.05 than those who did not take supplements.30 the stronger associations of vitamin d oncrohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis could be because of the differences in the etiology of the diseases as evidenced by the unique as well as shared genetic risk factors for the two diseases.31 vitamin d status is strongly inversely associated with ibd and especially crohn's disease.there have only been a few clinical interventions done using vitamin d supplementation of crohn's disease patients.

in dextran sodium sulfate induced colitis the microbes protect from gastrointestinal injury while in other models t cell transfer il-10 ko the t cell response is generated against the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract.35 the experimental ibd models have identified t cells innate cells and the microbiota as key factors that regulate inflammation and disease in the gastro- intestinal tract.the effects of vitamin d on experimental ibd models havebeen reviewed.36 vitamin d deficient and vdr ko mice develop fulminating forms of several different models of experimental ibd.36 treating mice with the active form of vitamin d 125oh2d inhibited ibd in murine models of disease.36 the targets of vitamin d in experimental ibd include gastrointestinal epithelial cell barrier function and both the innate and adaptive immune system.36 more recently it has become clear that vitamin d alters the composition of the commensal microbiota probably through regulation of the immune system.36 the mechanisms by which vitamin d regulates experimental ibd include regulation of gut barrierfunction the microbiota and the immune system to maintain gastrointestinal homeostasis.two studies have examined the effects of uvr in one modelof experimental ibd.

the incidence of ulcerative colitis was 40 higher and crohn's disease was 80 higher in northern europe compared to southern europe.15 other studies in france and scotland showed similar results.16 in france a study described a clear north-south gradient for the incidence of crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis.17 this same group later found a correlation between lower uvr exposure and the increased crohn's disease incidence observed in their earlier study.1718 in the us areas with lower uv exposure had increased incidence of ibd increased hospitalization rates and increased severity of disease.19-21 uv exposure was also associ-ated with the risk of gastrointestinal clostridium difficileinfection.22 in addition patients with high uv exposure arizona were 16 less likely to die from c. difficile infection in the hospital than patients with low uv exposure michigan even when controlling for age gender and comorbidities.22 the above studies did not include vitamin d measurements but did suggest that changes in vitamin d status might account for the effects of uvr on ibd incidence and severity.vitamin d and ibdthe vitamin d hypothesis suggests that vitamin d status is one of the environmental factors predisposing for the development of ibd.23 the effect of uvr on vitamin d status depends on skin color latitude skin exposure season etc.

1.4248 125oh2d treatment of t cells induced il-4 production from th2 cells.41 mechanisms whereby uvr could regulate the t cell is via prostaglandin-e2 production and the formation of pyrimidine dimers and urocanic acid production.4950 these uvr induced factors have been shown to induce t reg cells and il-10 production following uvr exposure of skin.4950 uvr was shown to induce functional t regs in vdr ko mice.51 independent of vitamin d uvr induced t regs and suppressed antigen specific immune responses in vivo.51 the factors that mediate regulation of t cells following uvr exposure include both vitamin d inde-pendent and dependent effects of uvr fig.

genetic manipulation to inhibit regulatory immune responses are common in ibd models such as il-10 ko.35 il-10 ko animals develop spontaneous colitis as a result of the lack of regulatory t t reg cells that produce most of the il-10 in the gastrointestinal tract.35 transfer of naive t cells to immuno- deficient no t or b cells mice is an ibd model that has identified ifn-g producing th1 and il-17 producing th17 cells as the immunopathologic t cells in experimental ibd.35 co- transfer of naive t cells with t reg cells that produce il-10 eliminates disease by suppressing the production of ifn-g and il-17 by the naive t cells in the immunodeficient recipients.35 chemical injury models of ibd have identified the important contribution of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system as important contributors to ibd suscepti-bility.35 all of the experimental ibd models are affected by thecommensal microbiota in the animal colonies.

the data suggest that there may be a vitamin d inde- pendent effect of uvr on experimental colitis.3738 future workshould focus on the effects of uvr in other experimental models of ibd that involve t cells and the utilization of vdr ko mice to determine the uvr induced versus the vitamin d mediated effects of uvr treatments.vitamin duvr regulation of t cellswhile it is clear that innate immune cells the microbiota the gut epithelium and t cells are critical regulators of gastro- intestinal homeostasis this commentary will focus on the effects of vitamin d versus uvr on t cells.

ibd patients have genetic polymorphisms in multiple genes that control the immune response including several cytokines andcytokine receptor genes.5-7 other genetic polymorphisms exist in ibd patients for receptors that sense pathogens or are pattern recognition receptors like nucleotide oligomerization domain 2.8 mutations in nucleotide oligomerization domain2 has been identified as a critical risk factor in crohn's disease.910 several of the genes linked to ibd susceptibility are important in the regulation of the immune response to microbes.identical twin studies have established an important role of the environment in the development of ibd.

the concordance rate for ulcerative colitis in identical twins is only 20 and 50 in crohn's disease.11 in addition the prevalence of ibd world wide has increased and even countries that previously had a low incidence of ibd have seen increases.12 the incidence of ibd is higher in industrialized countries and in the northern hemisphere ibd is more prevalent in northern versus southern climates.

in the united states 1-1.3 million people have ibd and in europe the incidence of ibd diseases are even higher than in the us.1 treating ibd can be a substantial economic burden in the us the direct cost of living with ibdcenter for immunology and infectious disease department of veterinary and biomedical science the pennsylvania state university university park pa 16802 usa.

there is limited data demonstrating an effect of uvr on experimental ibd but the mechanisms of uvr suppression in ibd have not been defined.

125oh2d inhibited il-17 and induced il-10 production from inktcells.46 there is one study that has looked at the effects of uvron nkt cells and shown that uvr induces nkt cells that sup- press antigen specific responses.47 the uvr nkt cells were cd1d restricted and showed increased il-4 production with uvr treatment but may be distinct from the inkt cells that have been the focus of the vitamin d work.4647 additional work is needed to determine whether the effects of uvr on nkt cells is via the production of 125oh2d and induction of inkt cells fig.

a recent systematic review and meta- analysis was done to determine the association of 25ohd levels uvr exposure geography and ibd.25 the conclusions of the study were that both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients had lower levels of vitamin d and lower levels of 25ohd were associated with higher crohn's disease activity indexes cdai there were too few studies to evaluate ulcerative colitis.25 however because of a lack of adequate data no corre- lations could be made between latitude geography and ibd.25the data linking vitamin d and the propensity to develop ibd have been done without accounting for the possible contributions of uv light to the vitamin d status.

for both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis there are genetic and environmental factors that determine which people develop disease.ibd is more common among biological relatives and about 20 of patients crohn's and colitis foundation of america have a relative with ibd demonstrating the role of genetics in ibd.

there are many experimental models of ibd and while no model perfectly represents human disease these models are important in understanding mechanisms of ibd development.

here we will examine the specific role of uvr and vitamin d on ibd.uvr and ibdthere are only a few studies that have analyzed the effects of uvr on ibd.
