showed that the host genotype Hordeum vulgare had little impact on microbial taxonomical sequences defining here the taxonomic core microbiota but had a great impact on sequences with functional value defined here as the replicators of the functional core microbiota.

The delineation of the functional core microbiota will depend on the physiology and ecology of the plant associated with the core microbiota.

Such decoupling between phylogeny and function which at the scale of a given taxa is likely to concern pangenomic genes that mostly do not belong to the core genome has been evidenced for leaf-associated microbiota .The functional core microbiota could ensue from various evolutionary scenarios A-D in which the evolutionary pathways of plants and microorganisms are more or less tightly connected.

Based on these evolutionary processes functional core microbiota are believed to be beneficial to plants overall.The vital functions of plants evolve together with their phenological stages therefore the functional microbiota is bound to change over time too.

The microbiota is represented schematically by different items corresponding to individuals with different shapes corresponding to different populations the different colors green red and yellow correspond to replicators that are carried by different vehicles colored shapes.Transmission and Stability of the Functional Core MicrobiotaThe fact that similar microbial functional groups are faithfully associated with individuals in various taxa Ulva  bromeliads  humans  suggests that the functional core microbiota recruited by a given host is somehow stable over time.

7Concluding Remarks and Future PerspectivesPlants recruit functional microbiota related to each plant genotype that can be called functional core microbiota.

The core microbiota functions are coded by replicators distributed among microbial vehicles that can vary according to soils so that a functional core microbiota is likely to be associated to a given host whatever the soil.

This so-called functional core microbiota encompasses microbial vehicles carrying replicators genes with essential functions for holobiont i.e.

The transmission pathways of this functional core microbiota vary over plant generations according to environmental constraints and its added value for holobiont fitness.Plants-Microorganisms A Joined Success Story Land colonization by plants has been a formidable undertaking that was made possible with the help of friendly soil mutualistic microbes.

when considering ecological traits functional issues need to receive prime consideration if we are to understand the ecology of the core microbiota and to exploit its potential for plant growth and health.
