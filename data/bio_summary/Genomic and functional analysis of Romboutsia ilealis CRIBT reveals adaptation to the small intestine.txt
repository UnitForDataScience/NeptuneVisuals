Altogether these results might indicate a possible role for R. ilealis CRIBT in intestinal cross-feeding networks by releasing D-fructose during growth on fructans like FOS which can function as growth substrate for other microbes or be directly absorbed by the host.Fucose degradation and its advantagesBesides diet-derived carbohydrates also host-derived carbohydrates are an important source of energy for some microbes.

The overall G  C content of the genome is 27.9 which is in good agreement with a G C content of 28.1 mol previously determined for R. ilealis CRIBT by HPLC methods.With a total of 14 copies of the 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene R. ilealis CRIBT is among the species with the highest number of 16S rRNA gene copies reported up to this date .

The transcriptome of R. ilealis CRIBT grown on FOS was very similar to its transcriptome when grown on glucose a monosaccharide used by the majority of microbes present in the intestinal tract.

ilealis CRIBT was grown in a basal bicarbonate-buffered medium  supplemented with 16 gL yeast extract BD Breda The Netherlands and an amino acids solution as used for the growth of C. difficile .

The metabolic model suggests that this is indeed the case as some of the enzymes produce intermediates which can be consumed by fatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid biosynthesis processes.Altogether the transcriptome of R. ilealis CRIBT grown on FOS was very similar to itstranscriptome when grown on glucose  with only 18 genes significantly upregulated during growth in the presence of FOS compared to glucose .

The significance of this gene cluster for carbohydrate utilization is not known however several enzymes could be identified in the genome of R. ilealis CRIBT that use different forms of iron as cofactor for example the hydrogenases involved in hydrogen metabolism  several ferredoxins and the L-threonine dehydratase CRIB-426 that was significantly upregulated during growth on L-fucose.

The absence of a fructose-specific transporter which could be identified in close relatives that are able to grow on D-fructose might explain the fructose accumulation during growth of R. ilealis CRIBT on FOS.Differential gene expression analysis demonstrated the apparent FOS-induced upregulation of two separate gene clusters that were predicted to be involved in sucrose transport and degradation.

The observed accumulation of fructose during growth of R. ilealis CRIBT on FOS supports the hypothesis of extracellular degradation.

Sulfite reduction by R. ilealis CRIBT and close relatives has been previously demonstrated in vitro  and increased growth yield and metabolite production was observed in the presence of sulfite for R. ilealis CRIBT .
