Together these findings suggest that nonhematopoietic APCs can be key stimulators of alloreactive CD4 T cells while hematopoietic APCs can prime pathogenic CD8 T cell and both pathogenic and protective CD4 T cell responses in MHC- matched allo-HCT.

The differential regulation and microanatomical localization of MHC class II in intestinal epithelial cells underlying lamina propria myofibro- blasts and other cell types may be critical in determining tolerogenic versus inflammatory CD4 T cell priming during homeostasis and in intestinal GVHD.Sites of T Cell Priming in Graft-Versus-Host DiseaseWhere alloreactive T cells first get primed in GVHD remains debated.

Histor- ically T cells have been considered the dominant cellular subset mediating graft rejection and GVHD and most efforts to prevent or treat these complications have focused on interventions that target T cell reactivity.

Thus although there is no doubt that T cells are essential in alloimmunity T cell function is influenced by interactions with a complex microenvironment and by the unique conditions induced by transplantation procedures.In this review we discuss recent advances in the field that have identified new cellular subsetsand new molecular pathways that regulate alloimmunity with an impact on both graft rejection and GVHD.

These mechanisms as well as the nature and distribution of alloantigens determine how alloreactive T cells get activated and mediate the immune complications of transplantation.Nature of AlloantigensDuring microbial infections naive T cells encounter peptide antigens loaded on major histocom- patibility complex MHC molecules.

Individual cellular subsets have variable capacities to provide these signals to T cells but hematopoietic conventional den- dritic cells cDCs appear to be the critical professional APCs that prime naive T cells in SLOs in response to most infections.

CD8 T cells recognize endogenous molecules presented on MHC class I while CD4 T cells recognize exogenous molecules processed after uptake of extracellular pathogens and presented on MHC class II.

Similar to microbial antigens mHAs are recognized by rare T cell clones with T cell receptors cognate to processed mHA loaded on MHC molecules.

In mouse models potent alloimmune responses can also be driven by virally encoded endogenous mHAs that act as superantigens 9 although the role of similar mechanisms in human transplantation is unknown.Antigen-Presenting Cells in Graft-Versus-Host DiseaseUnlike most responses to pathogens in which specialized hematopoietic APCs prime T cells in allo-HCT both recipient hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells have independently been shown to be sufficient to prime alloreactive T cell responses in distinct mouse GVHD models 10 11.

After T cells are initially primed by recipient cells donor CD103 cDCs seed the gut capturing alloantigens and becoming activated by innate inflammatory signals before migrating to mesenteric lymph nodes driving a potent positive feedback loop of T cell alloactivation through the provision of recipient alloantigen IL-12 IL-6 and CD40 costimulatory signals 14 15.
