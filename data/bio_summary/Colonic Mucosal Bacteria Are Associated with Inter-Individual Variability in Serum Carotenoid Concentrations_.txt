The correla- tions of the relative abundance of bacterial taxa with con- centrations of carotenoids in colonic biopsy samples expressed as in picograms per milligram protein were much weaker vs that that with serum carotenoids as shown in B available at .Bacterial Predictors of Serum Carotenoid Levels Regression analyses were performed to determine whether the abundance of specific bacterial populations is associated with inter-individual variability in serum carotenoid concen- trations after accounting for demographic factors previously identified to be associated with carotenoids.

The bacterial community in the colon could contribute to the bioaccessibility of carotenoids by completing digestion of plant cells walls and by modulating intestinal permeability.Objective To evaluate whether colonic bacterial composition is associated with serumand colon carotenoid concentrations.Design The study was a randomized dietary intervention trial in healthy individuals who were at increased risk of colon cancer.

The significant predictors of total serum carotenoids were di- etary intakes of total carotenoids per 1000 kcal BMI serum cholesterol levels smoking and the relative abundance of OTUs that were classified as Bacteroides Roseburia and a genus of the Lachnospiraceae family .

The bacterial commu- nity in the colonic mucosa however was resistant to change after dietary intervention with either a Mediterranean diet or Healthy Eating diet each of which doubled fruit and vegetable intakes.Conclusions The colonic mucosal bacterial community was associated with serumcarotenoid concentrations at baseline but was not appreciably changed by dietary intervention.J Acad Nutr Diet.

The homeostasis model of assess- ment for insulin resistance was calculated from fasting C-peptide and glucose using an online calculator from the University of Oxford The HOMA Calculator version 2.2.

The correlations of the relative abundance of these taxa was opposite in direction with HDL and serum carotenoids vs that with the aforementioned measures that are indicative of adverse metabolic health  available at .

The relative abundance of each was lower in the highest tertile of serum carotenoids  making it difficult to discern a functional role for these observations.
