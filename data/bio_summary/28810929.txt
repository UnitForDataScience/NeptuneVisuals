these re- sults suggest that the increase in tfh cell response in middle-aged kbxn mice was not due to enhancement of tfh cell proliferation or differentiation.excessive accumulation of effector and effector memory tfh cells in middle-aged kbxn micesince we did not observe increased tfh cell proliferation or differentiation in the middle-aged mice we next ad- dressed whether the soaring tfh response in middle- aged mice was elicited by an accumulation of active and or memory tfh cells.

these data indicate that a strong tfh and gc b cell response occurs with age and some specific gut microbiota such as sfb can elevate the young tfh and gc immune compartment to mimic the increase in tfh and gc response in middle-aged mice.tfh cell proliferation and differentiation in young and middle-aged kbxn micewe next asked what contributed to the robust tfh re- sponse in the middle-aged mice.

sfb a potent stimulus for inducing tfh differentiation fails to promote tfh differentiation in middle-aged kbxn mice suggesting that most of the middle-aged tfh cells with an effector phenotype are tfh effector memory cells induced at an earlier age.

for example in young kbxn mice we have previously reported that sfb promote non-tfh cells differentiating into tfh cells in pps by upregulating bcl-6 expression in non-tfh cells in pps on the other hand sfb colonization does not upregulate bcl-6 expression in non-tfh cells in pps in middle-aged kbxn mice.a strong tfh response can still be observed in sfb- middle-aged kbxn mice suggesting that commensals other than sfb may substitute for sfb in promoting the tfh response during the aging process which results in a strong accumulation of tfh cells despite the lack of sfb.

sfb colonization a potent stimulus for in- ducing tfh differentiation fails to promote tfh differen- tiation in the middle-aged group which suggests that most of the middle-aged tfh cells with an effector phenotype cd62llocd44hi are tfh effector memory cells induced at an earlier age.

although a soaring tfh cell population accompanied by robust germinal center b cell responses were found in middle-aged mice there was decreased cycling of tfh cells and sfb only induced the non-tfh cells to upregulate bcl-6 the tfh master transcription factor in the young but not the middle-aged group.

c. because bcl-6 is the master regulator of tfh cells and controls the expression and function of many tfh cell molecules together with the robust gc b cell response in the middle-aged group these data suggest that middle-aged tfh cells are func- tionally competent.

thus the significant increase in tfh cells in middle-aged mice is contributed by the ac- cumulation of tfh cells of an effector phenotype.discussiondespite progress in understanding loss of immune func- tion in tfh cells and gc b cells with age much less is known about age-associated changes in these cell types in an autoimmune setting.

this has been shown to be beneficial in aging t cell studies as it eliminates change in the t cell repertoire an important variable that com- plicates the interpretation of aging t cell function in contrast to the abundant gut-luminal commensals mucosa-associated commensal species such as seg- mented filamentous bacteria sfb represent a minor but important part of the commensal community as they can powerfully modulate host immunity -our previous studies have shown that sfb-induced tfh and th17 cells contribute significantly to autoantibody production in young kbxn mice and a lack of either t effector cell type strongly ameliorates autoantibody pro- duction and autoimmune arthritis development here we reveal that despite both tfh and th17 cells hav- ing been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune arthritis in most of the studies using young adult mice in experimental settings there is a clearly age-associated accumulation of tfh but not th17 cells in the middle-aged group compared to their young counterparts.

secondly our previous data showed that tfh cells are required for autoantibody production in kbxn mice by demonstrating that mice receiving cxcr5- deficient krn t cells which have impaired tfh function developed far fewer autoantibodies and less severe dis- ease compared to those that received cxcr5-sufficient krn t cells third a soaring tfh cell population accompanied by a robust gc b cell response was found in middle-aged mice compared to the young group fig.

together these data provide both t-cell-intrinsic and t-cell-extrinsic mechanisms explaining the th17 defect in middle-aged kbxn mice.a robust tfh cell response leads to a strong germinal center gc b cell development in middle-aged kbxn mice we next examined tfh cells a key cell type involved in ab-mediated autoimmune diseases.

in support of this hypothesis we found that middle-aged tfh cells in kbxn mice are rather quiescent demon- strated by their lower proliferation phenotype which po- tentially helps their long-term survival the data presented here together with previous re- ports suggest that the tfh cells accumulated over timeare major contributors to autoantibody production and arthritis development in middle-aged kbxn mice.

it has been proposed that an in- creased ratio of inhibitory tfr cells in aged mice contrib- utes to defective ab production in aging upon antigen immunization however in an autoimmune setting in middle-aged mice we did not observe representation of tfr cells over and above tfh cells that could have bet- ter countered the accumulated tfh population unpub- lished observations.it has been demonstrated that there is an increase inil-17 cd4 t cells in aging mice and one of the reports further demonstrated that memory th17 cells are animportant source of il-17 production in aging mice our findings suggest that there is an overall reduc- tion in th17 cells in middle-aged kbxn mice which also displayed decreased differentiation of il-17- producing cells from naive cd4 t cells compared to the young group.

we have previously reported that tfh and th17 cells can both contribute to autoantibody and arthritis develop- ment in young kbxn mice thus our data from middle-aged kbxn mice suggest that the enormous amount of tfh cells in the middle-aged group is suffi- cient to induce a robust gc b cell response that pro- motes severe arthritis with less help from th17 cells.

t follicular helper tfh cells are a crucial subset of cd4 t cells that helps b cells produce high-affinity and high-titer antibodies - and an excessive tfh cell response can lead to many auto- immune conditions including ra t helper 17 th17 cells a t effector cell type involved in many autoimmune diseases promote both autoantibody pro- duction and inflammation we used a tcr trans- genic tg autoimmune arthritis model kbxn mice to study the effect of age and microbiota on auto- immune tfh and th17 cells.
