A previous study that focused on the differences of Bifidobacteria in the small intestine of the same calves from the present study reported that calves fed HT colostrum displayed a higher prevalence of small intestinal Bifidobacterium at 6 h of life compared with calves fed fresh colostrumwhereas no differences were detected at 12 h among treatment groups in the prevalence of small intestinal Bifidobacterium Malmuthuge et al.

It is speculated that lower concentrations of bCO in theReceived July 20 2017.Accepted September 3 2017.1 Corresponding author gastrointestinal tract of HC calves at 6 h of life could be due to the early establishment of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium in HC calves and their subse- quent metabolism of bCO as a carbon source.

Therefore the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine the effect of the heat treatment of colostrum on the concentration of bCO and 2 to determine the concentrations of bCO in the distal jejunum ileum and colon of neona- tal calves fed heat-treated HT colostrum compared with calves fed fresh colostrum.

It was hypothesized that HT colostrum would have higher concentrations of free bCO when compared with fresh colostrum and as a consequence calves fed HT colostrum would havehigher concentrations of bCO within the intestine com- pared with calves fed fresh colostrum.The experimental procedures were conducted at the Dairy Research and Technology Centre University of Alberta in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care CCAC 1993 and all protocols were approved by the University of Alberta Animal Care and Use Committee for Livestock AUP00001012.

Prior to the study because no previous research has been conducted with regard to the concentrations of oligosaccharides in the intestine of neonatal calves studies regarding the proportion of Bifidobacterium in the small intestine of neonatal calves were used as a variable to determine the amount of biological replicates required to have sufficient power for the experiment.

The average birth BW of FC calves euthanized at 6 and 12 h were 40.9 -3.4 and 39.1 - 1.5 kg respectively and for HC calves euthanized at 6 and 12 h were 47.7 - 3.3 and 41.4- 2.1 kg respectively.

Immediately before euthanasia FC and HC calves eu- thanized at 6 h achieved serum IgG concentrations of9.7 - 0.74 and 9.7 - 0.70 mgmL respectively whereas FC and HC calves euthanized at 12 h achieved 15.8- 1.37 and 12.9 - 1.37 mgmL respectively Kent- Dennis 2014.

Therefore it is suggested that the cleavage of bCO from colostral lipids or proteins may provide reasoning for the increase in the concentration of free bCO in HT colostrum when compared with fresh colostrum.In contrast to our hypothesis although higher con- centrations of bCO were detected in HT colostrum calves fed HT colostrum had a lower concentration of bCO within intestinal regions at 6 h when compared with that of calves fed fresh colostrum.
