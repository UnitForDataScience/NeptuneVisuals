at birth 32 male holstein calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups 1 control calves that did not receive colostrum for the duration of the experiment and were euthanized at 6 h nc n  4 or 12 h nc n  4 2 calves fed fresh colostrum fc and were euthanized at 6 h fc n  6 or 12 h fc n 6 or 3 calves fed heat-treated colostrum hc andeuthanized at 6 h hc n  6 or 12 h hc n  6. all calves were fed 2 l of colostrum within 1 h after birth.

more specifi- cally at 6 h of life fc calves tended to have a higher concentration of dsl p  0.05 and a significantly higher concentration of 6'-sln p  0.02 6'-sl p  0.03 and 3'-sl p  0.01 in the distal jejunum when compared with hc calves figure 2. in the ileum fc calves tended to have a higher concentration of 6'-sln p  0.09 and 6'-sl p  0.06 and a significantly higher concentration of 3'-sl p  0.03 and dsl p 0.04 compared with hc calves.

immediately before euthanasia fc and hc calves eu- thanized at 6 h achieved serum igg concentrations of9.7 - 0.74 and 9.7 - 0.70 mgml respectively whereas fc and hc calves euthanized at 12 h achieved 15.8- 1.37 and 12.9 - 1.37 mgml respectively kent- dennis 2014. calves were euthanized by penetrative captive bolt followed by exsanguination.

2013. a previous study that focused on the differences of bifidobacteria in the small intestine of the same calves from the present study reported that calves fed ht colostrum displayed a higher prevalence of small intestinal bifidobacterium at 6 h of life compared with calves fed fresh colostrumwhereas no differences were detected at 12 h among treatment groups in the prevalence of small intestinal bifidobacterium malmuthuge et al.

it was also determined that fc calves displayed a higher concentration of bco at 6 h of life in the intestine compared with hc calves which may sug-figure 2. the concentration mgg of bovine colostrum oligosaccharides in the intestine of calves fed fresh and heat-treated colostrum.

it is speculated that lower concentrations of bco in thereceived july 20 2017.accepted september 3 2017.1 corresponding author gastrointestinal tract of hc calves at 6 h of life could be due to the early establishment of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium in hc calves and their subse- quent metabolism of bco as a carbon source.

2014 and 25.3 of pre-weaned calves being affected by digestive problems nahms 2011. therefore knowledge regarding how to decrease the prevalence of digestive disorders in pre- weaning calves is necessary to ensure a profitable dairy industry.in an effort to improve neonatal calf gut healthinterest has been increasing in supplementing bovine colostrum or colostrum replacers with gut active carbo-401hydrates derived from yeast mannan-oligosaccharides mos and bacteria bifidobacterium galacto-oligosac- charides brady et al.

therefore the objectives of the present study were to 1 determine the effect of the heat treatment of colostrum on the concentration of bco and 2 to determine the concentrations of bco in the distal jejunum ileum and colon of neona- tal calves fed heat-treated ht colostrum compared with calves fed fresh colostrum.

it was hypothesized that ht colostrum would have higher concentrations of free bco when compared with fresh colostrum and as a consequence calves fed ht colostrum would havehigher concentrations of bco within the intestine com- pared with calves fed fresh colostrum.the experimental procedures were conducted at the dairy research and technology centre university of alberta in accordance with the canadian council of animal care ccac 1993 and all protocols were approved by the university of alberta animal care and use committee for livestock aup00001012.

it was determined that a minimum of 4 biological replicates was required to detect a 20 difference at a power of 80. the average birth bw of fc calves euthanized at 6 and 12 h were 40.9 -3.4 and 39.1 - 1.5 kg respectively and for hc calves euthanized at 6 and 12 h were 47.7 - 3.3 and 41.4- 2.1 kg respectively.

therefore it is suggested that the cleavage of bco from colostral lipids or proteins may provide reasoning for the increase in the concentration of free bco in ht colostrum when compared with fresh colostrum.in contrast to our hypothesis although higher con- centrations of bco were detected in ht colostrum calves fed ht colostrum had a lower concentration of bco within intestinal regions at 6 h when compared with that of calves fed fresh colostrum.

additionally the colon of fc calves tended to have a higher concentra- tion of 6'-sln p  0.09 6'-sl p  0.06 and dslp  0.06 and a significantly higher concentration of 3'-sl p  0.02 compared with hc calves.

yet at 12 h of life no differences were detected in bco within the distal jejunum or ileum among treatments however fc calves had a higher concentration of dsl p  0.04 in the colon when compared with hc calves.

moreover we speculate that no differences in the bifidobacterium prevalence and the concentra- tions of bco at 12 h of life indicates that the high concentration of bco in fc calves at 6 h of life may have been metabolized by bifidobacterium to achieve a similar prevalence this bacterial genus to that of hc calves at 12 h of life.
