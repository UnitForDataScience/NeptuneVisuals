Fourthly the intracellular tail of MUC1 could act downstream by interacting with components of the NF-kB pathway and modulate its activity.Expression and Function in Immune CellsIn addition to healthy epithelial cells and cancer cells transmembrane mucins are expressed by various immune cells 25 100.

In cancer cells polar- ized expression of transmembrane mucins is lost result- ing in the disruption of tight junctions and dissociation of the cancer cells from the adjacent cells 119 Fig.

Knockdown of MUC1 increased the induced NF-kB activation and IL-8 production in stomach epithelial cells while the re- verse effect was observed for knockdown of MUC13 in intestinal epithelial cells 51.

Limited data are available on the function of transmembrane mucins in these cells but it seems like- ly that as in epithelial cells they have immunomodula- tory and signaling functions.

In line with its anti-inflam- matory effects in healthy epithelial cells MUC1 dampens phagocytosis by macrophages 101 and decreases secre- tion of TNF-a and IFN-g after stimulation with LPS or flagellin in dendritic cells DCs.

MUC13 is expressed on hemopoietic cells 25 but its function in these cells remains to be established.

Mu- cins expressed by healthy tissue are differentially glyco- sylated compared to mucins expressed by tumor cells de- rived from the same tissue 10 113 and the density of mucin glycosylation can also vary between normal tissue and cancer cells 114.

In addition shed extracellular do- mains may have more distant effects for example by in- terfering with immune cell homing by blocking E-selectin on endothelial cells see below.So why are transmembrane mucins important onco-genic proteins The available data suggest that transmem- brane mucins can contribute to carcinogenesis both via their glycosylated extracellular domain that may protect cancer cells in harmful conditions and via the intracellu- lar domain that links to pathways that regulate cell dif- ferentiation apoptosis and inflammation.

This is nicely demonstrated by E-selectin-mediat- ed adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells.
