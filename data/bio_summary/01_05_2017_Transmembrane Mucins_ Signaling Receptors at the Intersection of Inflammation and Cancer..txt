fourthly the intracellular tail of muc1 could act downstream by interacting with components of the nf-kb pathway and modulate its activity.expression and function in immune cellsin addition to healthy epithelial cells and cancer cells transmembrane mucins are expressed by various immune cells 25 100. limited data are available on the function of transmembrane mucins in these cells but it seems like- ly that as in epithelial cells they have immunomodula- tory and signaling functions.

e-selectin is normally expressed on the surface of activated endothe- lial cells during inflammation and contains a c-type lectin domain that interacts with sialylated carbohydrates found in high abundance on immune cells 120. similar to im- mune cells cancer cells also express these e-selectin li- gands and induce tumor cell rolling on the endothelium.

binding of muc1 to tlr5 in airway epithelial cells prevents the re- cruitment of myd88 to the intracellular tail thereby in- hibiting signaling and nf-kb activation 47 96. muc1 also inhibits signaling through tlr3 97 and dampens tlr2 and tlr5 signaling in ocular epithelial cells 98. muc1 is part of a feedback loop that downregulates tlr2-induced il-8 and tnf-a production after infec- tion with nontypeable haemophilus influenzae in airway epithelial cells 99. the immunomodulatory effect of muc1 on tlr responses could act at several levels.

glycosyltransferases are differentially expressed in cancer cells resulting in aberrant often re- duced glycosylation of surface glycoproteins 112. mu- cins expressed by healthy tissue are differentially glyco- sylated compared to mucins expressed by tumor cells de- rived from the same tissue 10 113 and the density of mucin glycosylation can also vary between normal tissue and cancer cells 114. the differentially glycosylated mu- cins that are expressed by tumors can be used as cancer markers.

in cancer cells polar- ized expression of transmembrane mucins is lost result- ing in the disruption of tight junctions and dissociation of the cancer cells from the adjacent cells 119 fig.

the muc1-siglec-4a interaction contributes to invasion during pancreatic cancer progression 131. in addition to regulating cell-cell interactions and metas- tasis the dense glycan layer provided by extracellular do- mains of transmembrane mucins protects tumor cells in adverse environments 4. this direct effect of the glyco- sylated mucins is illustrated by overexpression of muc1 that confers resistance to genotoxic anticancer agentsand protects melanoma cells from lysis by cytotox- ic t cells 105.transmembrane mucins other than muc1 also play a role in cell-cell adhesion and metastasis but these inter- actions have not been studied extensively.

h. pylori expresses baba and saba adhesins that bind to lewis b and sialyl- lewis x glycan structures of gastric mucins 64 and h. pylori directly binds to mouse muc1 65. released muc1 extracellular domain can act as a soluble decoy that prevents h. pylori attachment to epithelial cells 66. while both extracellular and intracellular muc1 do- mains can be detected in healthy stomachs the muc1 extracellular domain is not detectable on the apical site of stomach epithelial cells of h. pylori-positive gastritis pa- tients suggesting shedding of the extracellular domain 67. these data may indicate that release of the muc1 extracellular domain is a direct result of h. pylori infec- tion.epithelial muc1 also plays a protective role during infection with the major bacterial foodborne pathogen campylobacter jejuni.

knockdown of muc1 increased the induced nf-kb activation and il-8 production in stomach epithelial cells while the re- verse effect was observed for knockdown of muc13 in intestinal epithelial cells 51. the authors concluded that when muc1 is present a general anti-inflammatory effect is observed while expression of muc13 results in the upregulation proinflammatory pathways.

in line with its anti-inflam- matory effects in healthy epithelial cells muc1 dampens phagocytosis by macrophages 101 and decreases secre- tion of tnf-a and ifn-g after stimulation with lps or flagellin in dendritic cells dcs.

the muc1-mediated regulation of nlrp3 inflam-masome activity is highly specific as nlrp1b nlrc4 and aim2 inflammasomes are not affected by the absence of muc1 100. in addition to macrophages and dcs muc1 is expressed on activated t cells and may be in- volved in release of t cell-lymph node interactions to move to tissue locations 104. it is tempting to speculate that similar to other immune cells t-cell activation might also be regulated by muc1.

muc13 is expressed on hemopoietic cells 25 but its function in these cells remains to be established.

in addition shed extracellular do- mains may have more distant effects for example by in- terfering with immune cell homing by blocking e-selectin on endothelial cells see below.so why are transmembrane mucins important onco-genic proteins the available data suggest that transmem- brane mucins can contribute to carcinogenesis both via their glycosylated extracellular domain that may protect cancer cells in harmful conditions and via the intracellu- lar domain that links to pathways that regulate cell dif- ferentiation apoptosis and inflammation.

this is nicely demonstrated by e-selectin-mediat- ed adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells.

3 a complex of b-catenin and the muc1 cytoplasmic tail can traffic to the nucleus bind to the wnt signaling transcription factor tcf lef and modulate the transcription of genes involved in cell pro- liferation and differentiation.noma cells that grow in suspension capping of muc1 with antibodies reverses cells to adherent growth 122. muc1 clustering can also be achieved by interaction with galectin-3 a galactose-binding lectin the serum levels ofwhich are increased in cancer patients.
