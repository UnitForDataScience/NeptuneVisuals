The bacterial diversity of bacteriomes of both sexes ovaries and testes of P. kaempferi is higher than that of corresponding tissues of M. mongolica and  but the bacterial diversity of bacteriomes of P. kaempferi is significantly higher than that of M. mongolica P0.05 .Based on the Chao 1 index the bacterial richness of ovaries and testes of P. kaempferi is higher than that of bacteriomes of the same gender and the bacterial richness of testes is signif- icantly higher than that of bacteriomes of both sexes P 0.05 and .

NCBI BLAST results for the 16S rRNA-RFLP sequences of the representative clones isolated from the bacteriomes of female M. mongolica.constructed using sequences of the four clones of the novel Rhizobiales bacterium obtained in this study and other known sequences of Rhizobiales from GenBank confirmed that this novel Rhizobiales bacterium is closely related with H. cicadicola .Bacterial composition of the bacteriomes-clone libraries of female P. kaempferi and M. mongolica at the phylum level.Rarefaction analyses of 16S rRNA gene libraries constructed from the bacteriomes of female P. kaempferi and M. mongolica.Localization of dominant bacteria in different tissues detected by diagnostic PCROur diagnostic PCR performed on different tissues of P. kaempferi shows that 1 both S. muel- leri KR911848 and the novel Rhizobiales bacterium KR911840-KR911843 are found in the bacteriomes of both sexes and in the ovaries 2 S. muelleri is also found in the testes and the filter chamber  conical segment of the alimentary canal and 3 Rickettsia sp.
