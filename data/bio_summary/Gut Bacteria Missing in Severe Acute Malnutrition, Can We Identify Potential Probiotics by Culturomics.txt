Proteobacteria were also detected more frequently in kwashiorkor 131589 22 vs. 75486 15 in controls uncorrected two-tailed chi square test p  0.004SD Standard deviation HG species species previously isolated in the human gut species H but not G species previously isolated in humans but not in the gut NH species species not previously isolated in humans.

For the metagenomics results the diversity was estimated by calculating Shannon indexes for all the species aerotolerant and anaerobic species using the following formula H' Jplog2pi where pi is the proportion of each species in thesample which diversity is being estimated Spellerberg and Fedor 2003.

However the difference was significant only for new species mean number of new species found by sample - standarddeviation 1.8 - 1.5 in kwashiorkor vs. 5.0 - 2.6 in controls unpaired two-tailed student's t-test p  0.009 Figure 3 and for previously known species but which had not been previously found in humans 1.5 - 1.2 for kwashiorkor vs. 2.8 - 0.4 for controls two-tailed Mann Whitney test p  0.02 Table 4 suggesting a decreased a-diversity.With metagenomics calculating the mean Shannon Index - SD by group showed that the global a-diversity was decreased in kwashiorkor even if not significantly 3.2 - 0.8 vs. 3.8 - 0.8 in controls two-tailed student's t-test p  0.19 Table 5 consistent with previous studies Subramanian et al.

At the species level significantly enriched species in kwashiorkor Figure 4 included Bacteroides thetaiotaomicronStreptococcus peroris 910 90 in kwashiorkor vs. 15 20 in controls two-tailed Barnard test p  0.009 and S. gallolyticus 710 70 in kwashiorkor vs. 05 0 in controls two-tailed Barnard test p  0.014 Figure 5.Missing Repertoire in Kwashiorkor PatientsSpecies identified by metagenomics and culturomics in kwashiorkor and control patients were compared and 45 species were identified only in control samples Table 7.

As several OTUs matched identical species thetotal number of identified species  the number of unidentifiedOTU was expected to be smaller than the total number of OTUs.Definition of the Hitherto Unknown DiversityAs mentioned above microbial culturomics give an unprecedented opportunity to access and quantify the hitherto unknown microbial diversity.

We defined the hitherto unknown diversity as the number of new species added to the number of species not previously known from the human gut by sample for culturomics analysis and as the number of unidentified OTU for metagenomics analysis.Diversity Assessmentb-diversity Anderson et al.

The species identified by both culturomics and metagenomics for each group of samples were compared and the species specific to healthy children were identified and their biological interest investigated to assess their potential usefulness as probiotics in SAM.Statistical AnalysisFor each quantitative analysis normality was tested using either D'Agostino-Pearson or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for a small number of samples.

A total of 2933416 and 1842831 reads were generated from the 10 kwashiorkor and 5 control samples respectively.Decreased Diversity in Patients with KwashiorkorThe UT ratio the ratio of species found in only one individual on the total number of species in the group see Section Diversity Assessment was significantly lower in the kwashiorkor group indicating a lower b-diversity 151335 45 in kwashiorkor samples vs. 185281 66 in the control group uncorrected two-tailed chi squared test p  3 x 10-7 Table 2.

Forty-five species not known from the human gut were isolated from the kwashiorkor group n  10 including nine new species and nine new genera Table 3 15 are known but had not been previously found in humans and 12 are already known in humans but had not been previously found in the gut.

In our group of five controls we isolated 46 species unknown from the human gut including 26 new species Table 3 among which eight new genera and one new family Neofamiliaceae fam.
