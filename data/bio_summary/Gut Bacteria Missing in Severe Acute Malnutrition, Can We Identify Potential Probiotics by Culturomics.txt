2014. the hitherto unknown diversity assessed was consistently and significantly decreased in kwashiorkor as unidentified otus were lower in the kwashiorkor group figure 3. accordingly at the prokaryotic level only 5 of all reads in the kwashiorkor group were not assigned vs. 26 in control patients percentageof reads unassigned at the prokaryotic level - sd 0.05 - 0.02 for kwashiorkor vs. 0.26 - 0.22 for controls p  0.009.for the purposes of identification of potential probiotic species we considered all of the bacterial species that were identified both by culturomics and metagenomics in the controls samples but not in the kwashiorkor samples.loss of anaerobic species in patients with kwashiorkoranaerobic species are lost in patients with kwashiorkoraccording to the culturomics results both aerotolerant and anaerobic b-diversities were significantly lower in kwashiorkor table 4 but the decrease of anaerobic b-diversity -29 ut ratio 43111 39 in kwashiorkor vs. 76112 68 in controls p  0.00001 was larger than the decrease in aerotolerant b- diversity -16 108224 48 in kwashiorkor vs. 109169 64 in controls p  0.001. the difference was significant  aerotolerant b-diversity anaerobic b-diversity one-sample test for binomial proportion normal-theory method p  10-7. the metagenomics analysis showed a non-significant increased aerotolerant a-diversity shannon index - standard deviation 2.07 - 0.8 in kwashiorkor vs. 1.35 - 0.6 in controls unpaired two-tailed student's t-test p  0.1 table 5 but a significant decreased anaerobic diversity in kwashiorkor 1.05 - 0.98 vs. 3.1 - 1.5 two-tailed mann whitney test p  0.02 table 5. these results confirmed the specific anddrastic decrease in anaerobic diversity found by culturomics.proteobacteria and streptococcus gallolyticus increase in kwashiorkorwith culturomics five bacterial phyla were isolated in kwashiorkor with a majority of firmicutes 208 species followed by 56 proteobacteria 47 actinobacteria 21 bacteroidetestable 2  culturomics highlights an altered diversity in kwashiorkor.table 1  baseline characteristics.all sampleskwashiorkor n  10controls n  5a diversity p-valuekwashiorkor n  10controls n  5p-valueall speciesa151335 45 185281 66212.510-7canaerobic speciesa43111 39 76112 68290.00001c aerotolerant speciesa 108224 48 109169 64160.001cage months mean - sd13.4 - 17.8a25.1 - 7.60.20b sex female36 50a35 600.99coedema10 1000 0weight kg5.2 - 0.812.2 - 1.90.004dheight cm61.2 - 3.889.0 - 8.70.01dwhznr-0.4 - 0.25waznr-0.13 - 1.02haz-4.0 - 1.3a0.5 - 2.00.07dactinobacteriab47335 14 42281 15 10.74cbacteroidetesb21335 6 21281 7 10.55cfirmicutesb208335 62 192281 68 60.1cfusobacteriab3335 0.8 0281 0 -0.8 0.32dproteobacteriab56335 17 25281 9 -80.004ca beta-diversity was assessed using the ut ratio ut uniquetotal.

for the metagenomics results the diversity was estimated by calculating shannon indexes for all the species aerotolerant and anaerobic species using the following formula h' jplog2pi where pi is the proportion of each species in thesample which diversity is being estimated spellerberg and fedor 2003. metagenomics and culturomics results were compared in order to highlight the complementarity between these two methods.

the hitherto unknown diversity assessed by culturomics was dramatically decreased in the kwashiorkor group table 4. however the difference was significant only for new species mean number of new species found by sample - standarddeviation 1.8 - 1.5 in kwashiorkor vs. 5.0 - 2.6 in controls unpaired two-tailed student's t-test p  0.009 figure 3 and for previously known species but which had not been previously found in humans 1.5 - 1.2 for kwashiorkor vs. 2.8 - 0.4 for controls two-tailed mann whitney test p  0.02 table 4 suggesting a decreased a-diversity.with metagenomics calculating the mean shannon index - sd by group showed that the global a-diversity was decreased in kwashiorkor even if not significantly 3.2 - 0.8 vs. 3.8 - 0.8 in controls two-tailed student's t-test p  0.19 table 5 consistent with previous studies subramanian et al.

2002. we defined the hitherto unknown diversity as the number of new species added to the number of species not previously known from the human gut by sample for culturomics analysis and as the number of unidentified otu for metagenomics analysis.diversity assessmentb-diversity anderson et al.

in our group of five controls we isolated 46 species unknown from the human gut including 26 new species table 3 among which eight new genera and one new family neofamiliaceae fam.

a total of 108 genera were isolated including clostridium 46 species bacillus 28 streptococcus 18 staphylococcus 17 enterococcus 13 paenibacillus11 lactobacillus 13 and corynebacterium 9. in control samples only four phyla were isolated firmicutes 192 species actinobacteria 42 proteobacteria 25 and bacteroidetestable 4  comparison of the cultured gut bacterial diversity between children with kwashiorkor and control children.bifidobacterium breve bifidobacterium catenulatum gemella haemolysans hafnia alvei rothia aeria staphylococcus hominisper samplekwashiorkor n  10controls n  5p-valuestreptococcus gallolyticus and streptococcus lutetiensis.

b two-tailed unpaired t-test.the unknown diversity is lower in the gut microbiota of patients with kwashiorkor significantly less new species and nh species isolated per sample of kwashiorkor.table 5  metagenomics evidenced a decreased fecal anaerobic diversity in kwashiorkor.table 6 thus confirming the culturomics results.

in addition as enteric sepsis is a major cause of death in this context identification of missing gut microbes to be tested as probiotics live bacteria that confer a benefit to the host to restore rapidly the healthy gut microbiota and prevent the gut pathogenic invasion is of foremost importance.

it is likely that many of the dna sequences identified by metagenomics come from organisms that are already dead and thus would not be candidates for isolation and multiplication this clearly is not the case with culturomics.the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and the world health organization define probiotics as live micro-organisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host schlundt 2001. we consider that the following characteristics are desirable in a probiotic imitating the neonatal gut microbiota transplantation from the mother to the infant persistently viable in a healthy gut environment do not produce any toxic product particularly lithocholate symbiotic with healthy resident microbiota producing butyrate andor propionate and anti-pathogenic bacteriocins and promotes gut environment characteristic of good health million et al.
