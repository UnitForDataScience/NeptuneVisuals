in the next section we will first discuss the pathophysiology of metabolic syn- drome and then the role that gut microbiota may play.the role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndromethe prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its sequelae has risen to epidemic proportions to become one of the most pressing global health problems of our time.

macrophages highly express pparg fur- ther intertwining inflammation and insulin resis- tance.in vitro studies have shown that statins alsoinduce pparg-mediated transcriptional activity in macrophages beside other anti-inflammatory effects like inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced tnfa tran- scription and the nf-kb pathway implying the effects of statins in metabolic syndrome may in fact be partly anti-inflammatory and mediated through ppary.in conclusion there is a firm base of evidence link- ing the spectrum of metabolic dysfunction seen in metabolic syndrome to inflammation.

moreover this receptor and g protein- coupled receptor 41 grp41 were found in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels where they increase blood pressure in response to microbiota- derived scfas.future perspectives microbiota as therapynow that we have outlined current evidence on gut microbial involvement in the metabolic syndrome we will speculate in this final section on the therapeutic possibilities offered by this promising new field of gut microbiota.although only one small placebo-controlled rct has altered the gut microbiota through fmt and showed causality in the interaction between gut microbiota and metabolic syndrome in humans many studies have shown that gut microbiota play a role in all aspects of the metabolic syndrome includ- ing insulin resistance dyslipidemia atherosclerosis hepatic steatosis and elevated blood pressure.
