Moreover this receptor and G protein- coupled receptor 41 GRP41 were found in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels where they increase blood pressure in response to microbiota- derived SCFAs.Future perspectives Microbiota as therapyNow that we have outlined current evidence on gut microbial involvement in the metabolic syndrome we will speculate in this final section on the therapeutic possibilities offered by this promising new field of gut microbiota.Although only one small placebo-controlled RCT has altered the gut microbiota through FMT and showed causality in the interaction between gut microbiota and metabolic syndrome in humans many studies have shown that gut microbiota play a role in all aspects of the metabolic syndrome includ- ing insulin resistance dyslipidemia atherosclerosis hepatic steatosis and elevated blood pressure.

In the next section we will first discuss the pathophysiology of metabolic syn- drome and then the role that gut microbiota may play.The role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndromeThe prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its sequelae has risen to epidemic proportions to become one of the most pressing global health problems of our time.

Data vali- dating these effects in humans are eagerly awaited.FMT in human metabolic syndromeIn the same period further emphasis was placed on the role of gut microbiota in metabolic disease in humans and on human microbiota variation.

Moreover it is not only the question which microbes should be infused but also how many species or strains are needed to alter the gut microbiota effectively.Studies to date have mainly been limited to genus- and species-com- parisons and have not clarified to which extent donor microbiota colonizes a recipient.Previous findings in non-FMT settings found that newly introduced non-pathological strains are not able to persevere in an established gut ecosystem particularly if the species were already present.We have recently found that effective colonization by donor fecal bacteria engraftment is partly driven by the gut microbial composition of the recipient and differs between met- abolic syndrome subjects.The next step will be a more precise manipulation of the gut microbiota for example by introducing specific microbes to outcom- pete undesirable strains.Finally FMT has logistical challenges and is associ- ated with several risks e.g.

The following sec- tion will briefly review how the microbiome has become connected to the pathophysiology of meta- bolic syndrome and how FMT may aid future therapy.Animal FMT studies in metabolic syndromeExperimental evidence in animals connecting the intestinal microbiota to the metabolic syndrome is widely available.

Macrophages highly express PPARg fur- ther intertwining inflammation and insulin resis- tance.In vitro studies have shown that statins alsoinduce PPARg-mediated transcriptional activity in macrophages beside other anti-inflammatory effects like inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFa tran- scription and the NF-kB pathway implying the effects of statins in metabolic syndrome may in fact be partly anti-inflammatory and mediated through PPARy.In conclusion there is a firm base of evidence link- ing the spectrum of metabolic dysfunction seen in metabolic syndrome to inflammation.

Microbiota and their many meta- bolic products may largely account for the rest.For example DNA of oral microbiota Veillonella and Streptococcus was found in plaques of individuals with atherosclerosis and their abundance correlated with the abundance of these species in the oral cavity.As for gut microbiota Karlsson et al.

In line microbiota transfer from a mouse with a HFD-induced phenotype of insulin- resistance and inflammation reproduced this pheno- type in recipient mice whereas the microbiota from a mouse fed the similar HFD that did not develop insu- lin resistance or inflammation failed to do so.These studies all show microbiota-mediated effects on liver phenotype in mice.
