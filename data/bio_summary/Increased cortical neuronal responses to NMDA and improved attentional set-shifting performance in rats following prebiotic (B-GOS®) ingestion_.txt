in addition the expression of hdac1-4 genes in the cortex were measured to evaluate whether b-goss via acetate affects epigenetic processes.finally plasma and brain acetate cortical glun subunit levels and acc and hdac1-4 mrnas were evaluated in glyceryl triacetate fed rats to further examine the potential involvement of acetate in nmdar modulation.experimental proceduresanimalsadult male sprague dawley rats 250-300 g were housed 3rats cage in standard laboratory conditions 2171 1c lights on 0700- 1900 h with free access to water and standard laboratory chow.

c in b-gos fed rats plasma acetate levels and cortical acc gene expression were increased relative to controls whereas cortical acetate levels remained unaltered.

future work into the mechanisms of b-goss central actions might explore the involvement of other neurotransmitter systems such as gaba which have been implicated in both the mediation of microbiome-gut- brain communication  and the modula- tion of cortical neural activity .it is clear from the current electrophysiological experi- ments that b-goss ingestion elevates cortical nmdar function in rats and from our previous studies this does not seem to be mediated by changes in the concentration of peripheral or central glutamate itself  .

similarly cortical acc mrna abundance increased f120 8.83 p 0.01 following gta supplementation and this was paralleled by an approximately 3-fold elevation of plasma acetate levels f120 13.24 p  0.006 d. no changes in cortical acetate levels were observed in these rats.the intake of b-goss for 3 weeks did not affect hdac 1-4 gene expression in the frontal cortex a. however gta administration elevated both hdac1 f1205.01 p0.049 and hdac2 f1205.09 p0.048 mrnas b. cortical hdac3and hdac4 mrna abundance remained unaltered following gta supplementation.fig.

the current investigation examined the functional correlates of these changes in b-goss-fed rats by measuring cortical neuronal responses to nmda using in vivo nmda micro-iontophoresis electrophysiology and performance in the attentional set-shifting task.

cortical neuronal responses to nmda iontophoresis were greater  30 in b-goss adminis- tered rats compared to non-supplemented controls.

an initial exploration into the mechanisms revealed that rats ingesting b-goss had increased levels of plasma acetate and cortical glun2b subunits and acetyl co-a carboxylase mrna.
