such differences however only affected to a small fraction of the microbiome bacterial strains and thus we believe that our experiments in captivity allow to infer valid conclusions on the way hoopoes acquire their uropygial gland microbiome in the wild.experimental designtwo experimental approaches were used one to restrict the vertical transmission of bacterial communities from females tooffspring and the other to detect possible changes in the microbiome composition of the uropygial secretion of nes- tlings along their stay in the nest after inoculation with alien secretions.in experiment 1 females' access to the uropygial gland was manipulated from the start of laying until they finished brooding fig.

plates were inoculated within the same day of sampling with 5 ml of serial dilutions of the secretions in sterile phosphate buffer saline pbs and cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 degc for 24 h. bacterial load was expressed as number of colony-forming units cfus per microliter of secretion.molecular analysesbacterial dnawas extracted from uropygial secretions with a commercial kit the favorpreptm blood genomic dna extraction kit favorgen.

however the factors affecting the dynamic of colonization of the gland by bacterial symbionts are not known and differences in com- petitive ability of different bacterial strains reaching the uropygial gland are supposed to affect their success colonizing and growing in the uropygial secretion .

these results have important consequences for the under- standing of the dynamic and evolution of the relationships between hoopoes and their uropygial gland symbionts.the detected effects of covering female glands support the influence of female uropygial secretion conforming the microbiome of that of their offspring.

all these results suggest that a mutualism based in by-product cooperation   determines the micro- bial composition of hoopoe uropygial gland microbiome.summarizing hoopoe nestling uropygial glands harbor core microbiomes that to some degree vary in their composi- tion but when experimentally put in contact converge to the same combination of otus.

impeding bird access to their glands by covering them has previously been used with success to test effects of uropygial secretions in several studies    .

all broods were from different females except for two of the same female in 2012 that received two different treatments experimental and control ii which have been considered as independent information in the analyses.sampling protocolincubating females and nestlings were caught by hand and after sampling uropygial secretions see  for sampling method were released again within the nest box.

vertical trans- mission also affects the evolution of the symbiotic relationshiptable 3 results from repeated measures anovas exploring the effects of the experimental inoculation of nestlings glands with own uropygial secretion or that of a foreign nestling nestling type on the change of the microbiome composition after the inoculation experiment repeatedtable 4 results of a general linear model glm exploring the asso- ciation between density of cultivable bacteria in nestling secretions de- pendent variable cfusml and that of females0.069remained statistically significant when removing the interaction.

therefore either environmental conditions shared by nestlings and mother are responsible for the recruitment of this otu in their uropygial secretions or there is transmission from female to offspring by other via different of the female gland.
