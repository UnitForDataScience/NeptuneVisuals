Such differences however only affected to a small fraction of the microbiome bacterial strains and thus we believe that our experiments in captivity allow to infer valid conclusions on the way hoopoes acquire their uropygial gland microbiome in the wild.Experimental DesignTwo experimental approaches were used one to restrict the vertical transmission of bacterial communities from females tooffspring and the other to detect possible changes in the microbiome composition of the uropygial secretion of nes- tlings along their stay in the nest after inoculation with alien secretions.In experiment 1 females' access to the uropygial gland was manipulated from the start of laying until they finished brooding Fig.

Plates were inoculated within the same day of sampling with 5 ml of serial dilutions of the secretions in sterile phosphate buffer saline PBS and cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 degC for 24 h. Bacterial load was expressed as number of colony-forming units CFUs per microliter of secretion.Molecular AnalysesBacterial DNAwas extracted from uropygial secretions with a commercial KIT The FavorPreptm Blood Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Favorgen.

The microbiomes of experimental nestlings cross-inoculated with secretions from a different nest experienced larger changes than those of controlTable 1 Results of a repeated measures ANOVA analyzing the effect of the inoculation of uropygial secretion collected from their own gland or from a nestling of a different nest nestling type on the number of Operational Taxonomic Units OTUs detected in nestling secretions be- fore and 1 week after inoculation R repeated measuresThe model also included the effect of year and the random effect of nest identity nested within study year.

However the factors affecting the dynamic of colonization of the gland by bacterial symbionts are not known and differences in com- petitive ability of different bacterial strains reaching the uropygial gland are supposed to affect their success colonizing and growing in the uropygial secretion .

These results have important consequences for the under- standing of the dynamic and evolution of the relationships between hoopoes and their uropygial gland symbionts.The detected effects of covering female glands support the influence of female uropygial secretion conforming the microbiome of that of their offspring.

All these results suggest that a mutualism based in by-product cooperation   determines the micro- bial composition of hoopoe uropygial gland microbiome.Summarizing hoopoe nestling uropygial glands harbor core microbiomes that to some degree vary in their composi- tion but when experimentally put in contact converge to the same combination of OTUs.

Impeding bird access to their glands by covering them has previously been used with success to test effects of uropygial secretions in several studies    .

All broods were from different females except for two of the same female in 2012 that received two different treatments experimental and control II which have been considered as independent information in the analyses.Sampling ProtocolIncubating females and nestlings were caught by hand and after sampling uropygial secretions see  for sampling method were released again within the nest box.

2 Effect of the experiment inoculating uropygial glands of hoopoe nestlings with secretions from the same nestling control or from a nes- tling of a different nest experimental on richness of the bacterial com- munity hosted in their glandPCo1 and PCo2 scores R1 Wilks  0.194 F2 15  64.4 p  0.0001.

It was higher for secretions harboring OTU306 while presence of OTUs 242 346 and 566 was negatively related to cultiva- ble bacterial density summary of results in Table  analyses in Supplemental Material II.DiscussionExperimental results support for the first time the hypothesis that the microbiome hosted in the uropygial gland of nestling hoopoes is in part transmitted vertically from mother to off- spring but also that nestling microbiomes maintain their abil- ity to incorporate new strains during the entire nesting period.
