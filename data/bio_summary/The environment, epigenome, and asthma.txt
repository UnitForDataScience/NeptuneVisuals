Another animal study contributed to our knowledge of the critical role of DNA methylation in patients with allergic airway disease by showing that global DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-29-deox- ycytidine prevented TH2 skewing and rebalanced TH1TH2 thisstudy also used adoptive transfer experiments to demonstrate that 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine-treated CD41 T cells protect against allergic airway disease.Early studies in human cohorts demonstrated an association of DNA methylation in a few candidate genes in peripheral blood and buccaland nasalcells with asthma phenotypes but did not elucidate the role of DNA methylation in the control of gene expression.

Sensitization to several allergens tree grass house dust mite and ragweed has been associated with changes in DNA methylation in peripheral blood of older adultsand in bronchialepithelial cells of adults in controlled exposure settings.CD41 T cells isolated from ex vivo grass pollen extract-stimulated PBMCs of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis have extensive DNA methylation and gene expression changes compared with control subjects.Decreased DNA methylation in the CD14 promoter has been associated with increased CD14 expression in placentas of mothers living on a farm compared with mothers not living on a farmand the methyl-CpG binding protein Mbd2 has been shown to control TH2 induction by dendritic cells.

Although noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs and long inter- genic noncoding RNAs are sometimes viewed as a part of the ep- igenome because they are involved in regulation of gene expressionthey will not be discussed in the current review and are reviewed elsewhere.ENVIRONMENT AND THE EPIGENOMEAlthough some of the epigenetic marks are heritable eg imprinted loci and genome-wide studies demonstrate a genetic component to interindividual variation in DNA methylation and histone modification profilesepigenetic marks are also strongly influenced by the environment.Epigenetic processes translate environmental exposures associated with disease risk into regulation of chromatin which shapes the identity gene expression profile and activity of specific cell types that partici- pate in disease pathophysiology.Both DNA methylation and histone modifications are mutable and dynamic responding to the environment disease and aging.

When located in a gene promoter DNA methylation typically acts to repress gene transcription.ENHANCER A region of DNA approximately 50 to 1500 bp long that can be bound by certain proteins called activators or transcription factors to increase the likelihood of transcription of that particular gene.EPIGENETICS Changes in a chromosome that affect gene activity and expression.

Hypermethylation of cytosines within CpG islands in gene promoters leads to gene silencing and hypomethylation leads to active transcription.More recent studies have demonstrated that methylation of less CpG-dense regions near islands ''shores''and within gene bodies is also important in regulation of gene expression and alternativeGLOSSARYALTERNARIA Genus of ascomycete fungi that are known to be plant pathogens and common allergens in human subjects and can lead to allergic hypersensitivity and asthma.CpG SITES DNA regions in which a cytosine nucleotide occurs next to a guanine nucleotide separated by only 1 phosphate.

The magnitude of the methylation changes observed in nasal epithelia of these asthmatic children approaches that reported in patients with malignancies.Sixty percent of genes that are differentially expressed in the asthmatic nasal epithelium have significant associations between DNA methylation and gene expression these include asthma genes ALOX15 CAPN14 and POSTN genes involved in inflammation and immunity cell adhesion extracellular matrix obesity and autophagy and epigenetic regulators among others.

A recent publication by another group identified asthma-specific enhancers in primary CD41 T cells marked by gaining the histone H3K4me2 mark during TH2 cell development.In the nasal epithelia of inner-city African American children we identified substantial median 9.5 range 2.6 to 29.5 methylation change methylation changes both in the form of single CpG methylation differentially methylated probes and regions DMRs associated with their disease and changes in gene expression.

The American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine is an official journal of the American Thoracic Society.Finally in vitro experiments have allowed for exploration of how different microbes affect the epigenome immature enterocytes exposed to probiotic and pathogenic bacteria showed more than 200 regions of differential DNA methylation with decreased DNA methylation of genes associated with cytoskeletonactin remodeling and cell adhesion functions after exposure to pathogenic gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella species.

We further explored the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression by using an integrative analysis and identified additional candidates relevant to asthma IL4 and ST2.

Although other tissuescell types might be valuable for studies focused on the immunology of asthma the nasal epithelium is the ideal surrogate tissue for studies of environmental asthma because it is easily accessible in children and adults has substan- tial epigenetic and gene expression changes associated with asthma and appears to be an excellent proxy for the bronchial epithelium.The integrative approach would require the use of systems biology to understand how different elements of the environment in the context of genetic susceptibility interact to lead to changes in the epigenome and transcriptome and ultimately to TH2 cell skewing and specific disease phenotypes.
