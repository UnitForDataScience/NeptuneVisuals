ELISA analysis of tumour homogenates demonstrated significantly higher TNFa levels within tumours of MG-TNFa treated mice compared with controls mice i.v.

Immune competent syngeneic mice were utilised for all studies and downstream local pro-inflammatory effects were apparent following treatment as evidenced byIntravenous administration of MG-Tnfa to tumour bearing mice.

These findings in immune-competent syngeneic BalbC mice contrast with our previous observations in immune-reduced athymic mice MF1nunu where we observed no increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines following IV administration of MG1655 .

A pattern of pro- inflammatory cytokine induction was observed in tumours of treated mice vs. controls.

Health status of all mice was monitored daily for the duration of experiments.

To minimize suffering or distress during invasive procedures imaging and bacterial injection mice were anaesthetised with isoflourane 2.5 mixture with oxygen.Animals and tumour inductionMice were kept at a constant room temperature 22 C with a natural daynight light cycle in a conventional animal colony.

Before experiments the mice were afforded an adaptation period of at least 7 days.

Male C57Bl TRAMPC1 model and female BalbC RENCA and CT26 models mice in good condition without fungal or other infections weighing 16-22 g and of 6-8 weeks of age were included in experiments Harlan Oxfordshire UK.

When tumours reached approximately 100 mm3 in volume mice were randomly divided into experimental groups.In vivo bacterial administrationInocula were prepared by growing MG-Empty and MG-TNFa with or without the integrated p16Slux aerobically in 100 mL LB broth containing either 50 mgmL Kan MG1655 or 50 mg mL  300 mgmL Em MG1655p16Slux.

Following whole-body imaging the mice were euthanized via cervical dislo- cation and the subcutaneous tumours were aseptically removed and imaged.
