Not only immunity and metabo- lism but also traits as diverse as bone density blood-brain barrier integrity and behavior are influenced by the non- pathogenic microbes bacteria and eukaryotes with which animals come into contact.Some effects are seen when examining the differences be- tween microbiologically sterile axenic and conventional animals whereas others are observed between animals with natural variations in the microbiome.

When studying in- tact animals variability comes from many sources including the microbial organisms that associate with the animals being studied.

These measures include rearing animals in identical conditions for several generations prior to the start of an exper- iment co-housing or cross-fostering animals before assigning them to treatments or conducting experiments in which re- plicates are matched pairs from the same litter littermate controls or split-brood designs.

En- vironmentally acquired microbes can also be transferred to offspring or to animals that are housed together.

Fur- thermore some microbiota may have a different phenotypic effect in host animals with different genetic backgrounds and vice versa.

In some cases it may be necessary to standardize the mi- crobiota of the experimental animals--for example by ar- tificially creating a standard microbial mixture similar to but even more rigorously standardized than the Schaedler flora sometimes used in mice or by autoclaving or irra- diating food and water to prevent the introduction of new microbes.

Parallel experiments using axenic animals may also be necessary.
