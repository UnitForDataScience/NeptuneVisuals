The healthy gut microbiota is known to provide defense mech- anisms to gut barrier against invading pathogens and indigenous pathobionts preventing the disruption of homeostasis of the normal microbial ecosystem in an individual .

The use of antibiotics also leads to extreme disturbance in the human gut ecosystem that may provoke other detrimental consequences in gut health .Also the antibiotic administration induces acute disturbance throughout the intestinal micro- biota losing diversity and abundance  .

The specific roles ofMassachusetts United States of America HKSCAbstractTrial designThe aim of this study was to investigate which of the gut microbes respond to probiotic inter- vention as well as study whether they are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in a healthy adult human.

The genera such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria have been mostly circulated in the market based on their health-promoting mechanisms of physical biochemical and immunomodulatory interactions with gut micro- biota and host physiology in the gastrointestinal tract in animal models  .

These claims related to gastro- intestinal symptoms and diseases lack reproducibility and mechanistic evidence in humans.The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in host physiology metabolism immune system and gastrointestinal infectious diseases   influenced by many environmental factors such as host dietary habits aging and antimicrobial drugs leading to considerable differences in its composition among subjects -.

For these reasons microbial community change can be practically measured in diverse experimen- tal conditions.In this study we aimed to investigate gut microbial changes in response to probiotic inter- vention consisted of Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria as well as whether they are associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and subject's phenotypes in an adult human.

Our study illustrates that probiotic intervention modulated the composition of gut microbiota and reduced the abundance of potential pathogens such as Citrobacter and Klebsiella and methanogens like Methanobrevibacter associated with the gastrointestinal symptom in an adult human.Materials and methodsEthics approval statementThis study was performed in accordance with the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Korea SNU IRB No.1507002-012.

One subject Sample No1 declared his use of antibiotics before the after-trial measurement the before-trial measure- ment is not affected.Stool DNA preparation and microbial community analysisIn this study there are three measured outcomes such as abundances of the gut microbiomes derived from feces Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and Survey of gastrointestinal symp- toms.

Such observa- tion also is statistically tested and sex term was found significant in constipation .Except for two gastrointestinal symptoms tendency changes were observed in other symptoms regardless of sex.Metagenome analysis for detecting significantly changed gut- microbiomes' abundances via probiotic interventionMetagenome analysis was performed to explain phenotypic changes based on the community of gut microbiomes.

As a result only WH ratio Bonferroni's adjusted P-value  0.05 was significantly changed of the 11 indexes between before and after trials  and the others steadily remained.Survey analysis to investigate improvement of six gastrointestinal symptoms by probiotic administrationSix gastrointestinal symptoms were measured by questionnaires in both before and after trials.
