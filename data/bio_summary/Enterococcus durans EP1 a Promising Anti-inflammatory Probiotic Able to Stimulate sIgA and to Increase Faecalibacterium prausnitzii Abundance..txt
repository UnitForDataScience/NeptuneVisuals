We presume that the increment of F. prausnitzii in mice treated with E. durans EP1 is involved in the anti-inflammatory effects observed in mice mucosa.cOnclUsiOnEnterococcus durans strain EP1 selected by the evaluation of pro-inflammatoryanti-inflammatory cytokines ratio in PBMC has no virulence factors and has no deleterious effect on mice.

Eur J Clin Nutr 2000 54288-97. doHlivak P Jahnova E Odraska J Ferencik M Ebringer L Mikes Z. Long- term 56-week oral administration of probiotic Enterococcus faecium M-74 decreases the expression of sICAM-1 and monocyte CD54 and increases that of lymphocyte CD49d in humans.

On the other hand EP1 decreased expression of IL-1b IL-6 and IL-8 p  0.05 while EP3 did not affect expression of any tested genes data not shown.Considering all the obtained results the strain E. durans EP1 was selected to evaluate probiotic properties and its in vivo immunomodulatory effect in mice.eP1 resists gastrointestinal conditions without Modifying its adhesion capacity and also inhibits growth of gram-Positive and -negative PathogensThe ability of E. durans EP1 to survive to the simulated gastro- intestinal conditions was assessed.

durans strains showed this profile data not shown.Considering the described results three E. durans strains were selected to perform in vitro studies on PBMC and Caco-2 cell line.E.

durans strains stimulates PbMc and Modulates Proinflammatory Molecules on caco-2 cellsThe three strains of E. durans EP1 EP2 and EP3 chosen after in vitro safety evaluation were cocultured with human PBMC and Caco-2 cells.

Finally one E.durans strain was selected to performed studies in healthy mice in order to analyze mucosal immunomodulatory capacities and its ability to modulate intestinal microbiota.MaTerials anD MeThODsbacterial strains and growth conditionsEnterococcus strains isolated from different sources were used in this work as well as several collection strains all of them all listed in .

Thus E. durans EP1 is not only a good candidate to increases F. prausnitzii in some cases of dysbiosis but can also be interesting in gut inflammatory disorders therapy.Keywords Enterococcus durans probiotic iga Faecalibacterium prausnitzii anti-inflammatoryinTrODUcTiOnEnterococci are an ancient genus of lactic acid bacteria LAB that are highly adapted to living in complex environments and surviving adverse conditions.

No significant changes were observed in any other quantified population not even in A. muciniphila which was perhaps expected to be affected due to the decrease in mucin expression in EP1-treated mice compared with controls.DiscUssiOnEnterococcus strains have been used as long time as effective probiotics but this bacterial group can also harbor pathogenic strains.

Therefore susceptibility to clinically relevant antibiotics of Enterococcus strains isolated from food stuffs is very important for consumer health.Enterococcus faecium is one common species used as probi- otic in animal feed  and concerning its safety the European Food Safety Authority EFSA edited a new guidance documentto differentiate between safe and potentially harmful clini- cal strains based in their susceptibility to ampicillin and the absence of three genetic markers associated with virulence esp hylEfm IS16.
