simpson j. george.the intimate relationship between diet and physiology confers nutrition with considerable potential for the primary prevention management and treatment of human disease.there are sev- eral reasons why this potential has yet to be rea- lised prominent among which is the prevailing practice of focussing on single nutrients both as putative causes of disease and as potential cures rather than considering the interactions among nutrients and other dietary constituents.in this review we begin by framing the challenges posed both to science and clinical practice by the com- plex concatenation of multilevel interactions between nutrients foods and diets.

this is because the com- bined intakes of nutrients and energy are deter- mined both by the extent to which animals can regulate their intakes of multiple nutrients and energy and the relative weighting of different appetite systems when animals are faced with nutritionally imbalanced diets.

in response to these failures there has been pressure to move away from 'reductionist' nutrient-based approaches towards more 'holistic' food-based approaches.rather than abandoning nutrient-based approaches we have instead proposed an integra- tive framework that incorporates nutrients foods and diets within the same model and relates these to physiological and health outcomes across mul- tiple scales.this approach called the geometric framework for nutrition gfn explicitly accounts for the interactions among nutrients within foods and diets and maps the conse- quences of different dietary compositions on mul- tiple measures of physiology and health.introducing the geometric framework for nutritiongfn has its origins in the biological sciences in par- ticular ecological and evolutionary theory.

the nature of those compromises and the extent to which different nutrients are prioritised when confined to an imbalanced diet is a key aspect of the nutritional phenotype as is the animal's post-ingestive capacity to retain limiting nutrients and void excesses.although the animal cannot reach its intake target when confined to an imbalanced diet it can do so if it has access to two or more foods whose rails subtend a region in the nutrient space that includes the target.

the prototypic mediterranean diet has an overall proteincarbo- hydratefat ratio of 154937which has a rela- tively low proteincarbohydrate ratio compared to other diets that have been trialled in nafld with much higher ratios such as the hyperpro- teic diet and ketogenic diets.

theabunderlying mechanisms of macronutrient-specific appetites are increasingly yielding to investigation and involve nutrient-specific modulation of gusta- tory responses nutrient-specific learning central brain circuits responding to specific nutrients and hormonal signals and neuro-hormonal sig- nalling between the gastrointestinal tract liver and brain.protein leverage an example of nutrient- specific prioritisationmany species possess a specific appetite for protein which to varying degrees is prioritised over appetites for carbohydrate and fat and can dominate the regulation of total energy intake.for example mice are able to regulate their intakes of both protein and carbohydrate to a target when offered nutritionally complementary foods but when restricted to single diets differing in the ratio and concentrations of protein carbohydrate and fat food intake is driven most strongly by the concentration of protein in the diet less so by carbohydrate and least of all by fat.

three alternative compromises are shown the blue dot indicates when non-protein intake is prioritised and the subject stops eating once the np target coordinate is reached leading to a deficit in protein intake relative to the target the red dot is where protein is prioritised leading to an excess intake of non-protein energy and total energy to attain the target for protein whereas the grey dot is where calories are maintained at the same level as at the target albeit comprising a lower ratio of p to np than at the target.ultra-processed foods then the result of protein leverage is overconsumption of energy with consequences for obesity and metabolic disease.mapping nutritional outcomes using gfn in the context of the wider food environment nutrient-specific appetites lead to the ingestion of particular amounts and ratios of nutrients which in turn interact with and impact on physiol- ogy and health.

this 'single-nutrient approach' is based on there being a one-to-one relationship between nutrients and diseases asso- ciated with their deficiency or less commonly excess and assumes that providing the appropri- ate dose of the nutrient will either prevent or cure disease.while this approach has had consider- able success in dealing with diseases associated with micronutrient deficiencies it has not been effective when considering chronic diseases asso- ciated with over-nutrition.the fundamental problem with one-nutrient approaches is that they do not consider the inter- actions that occur between the multiple nutrients and other components that comprise foods and diets and which ultimately interact with physiol- ogy.

of complex diets that include the total nutrient mixture diets that approximate the mediterranean diet have the best evidence base for benefit in humans.

likewise in small studies of patients with nafld a mediterranean-type diet 40 fat in the form of mufa  omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa 40 carbohy- drates 20 protein more effectively reduces liver lipid and improves insulin sensitivity in comparison to a low-fat high-carbohydrate diet 30 fats mainly omega-6 pufas 50 carbohy- drate 20 protein.given the promising find- ings to date it would seem reasonable to suggest a mediterranean-type diet for patients with nafld especially as it has been demon- strated to have a beneficial role in reducing all- cause mortality cardiovascular diseases cancer obesity and type 2 diabetes.

in a meta-analysis parker and colleagues noted that omega 3 supplementa- tion was associated with improvements in hepatic steatosis.while the primary analysis of the sub- sequent welcome study of epadha supplemen- tation 4 gday demonstrated no improvement in liver fat by hepatic magnetic resonance spec- troscopy secondary analysis of the data suggested an independent correlation between dha enrich- ment and reductions in liver fat.however subse- quent clinical trialsdo not support a benefit from omega 3 pufas in improving steatohepatitis the harbinger of progressive liver disease.other nutrients that have been linked to nafld include fructose and the micronutrients vitamin d and e. while an association of increased fructose consumption with nafld has been observeda recent well designed trialsuggests that it is the energy content rather than the type of monosaccharide fructose vs. glucose per se that is responsible for the increase in liver fat observed in the setting of high-fructose diets.

grams of protein per gram of diet or the proportion of energy contributed by the nutrient to the combined total of the nutrients included in the graph e.g.

the consequence is that mice on diets containing a reduced concentration of protein con- sume excess energy and become obese most nota- bly on low-protein high-fat diets.

by contrast on high-percentage protein diets mice under- consume total energy and become excessively lean.the phenomenon whereby protein intake is prioritised leading to shifts in total energy intake is called protein leverage.

as distinct from  in which axes indicate intakes of protein and non-protein energy here the nutrient space represents the percentage of total energy in foods meals and diets from protein carbohydrate and fat which together sum to 100. an illustration of how to read the graph is seen for the composition of rice which contains 5 protein 10 fat and 85 carbohydrate.
