The microbial community consists of thousands of species and its structure noticeably varies both among subjects and body parts Levy and Borenstein 2013 Stein et al.

The last section contains an overview of the actual and widespread approaches to such analysis implemented in R packages.Preparing data for statistical analysisCollection of microbiome samples sample preparation and sequencing as well as the pri- mary bioinformatical analysis for taxonomic profiling are complex processes with each step having its own subtleties.

The obtained libraries are subject to DNA sequencing resulting in thousands to tens of millions of short nucleotide sequences reads corresponding to the genomes of all microorganisms and viruses present in a sample.

The resulting reads are subject to quality filtering.

The result of the taxonomical classification for all reads of a sample is a vector of feature abundances.

The result of the taxonomical classification for all reads of a sample is a vector of feature relative abundance values.

The microbial communities are compared via the analysis of these vectors.20  Odintsova et al.Statistical properties of metagenomic dataBasic stepsAs an exhaustive search across all gut microbiotas is not feasible the statistical analysis is based on a representative sample from this entire assembly.

The researcher is in charge for controlling the validity of the outcome.

The absolute value of deviation two-sided test or deviation in certain direction one-sided test may be considered.

The threshold value known as a critical value or a significance level of a test is not fixed absolutely and may vary but it is commonly set to 5 P  0.05 corresponds to significantdifferences.A P-value reflects the chance of type I error - rejecting null hypothesis assuming that it is true 'false discovery'.
