The levels of nucleotide diversity TI for the respective flaA pyrH and recA genes were slightly higher in the phylogroup 1 strains 0.078 to 0.098 than in the phylogroup 2 strains 0.042 to 0.064 which probably reflects the imbalance in the strains analyzed.Mean global omega w values which are equivalent to the ratio of nonsynonymous dN to synonymous dS mutations i.e.

This comprises phy- logroup 1 n  23 and phylogroup 2 n  48 treponeme strains including all rele- vant American Type Culture Collection reference strains.

These three CDSs were selected based on the results obtained from our previous phylogenetic analysis of 20 T. denticola strains .We were able to obtain full-length gene sequence data for flaA recA and pyrH from 36 oral phylogroup 1 and 2 strains by searching the publically accessible nucleotide sequence depositories.

In addition a total of 35 phylogroup 1 and 2 oral treponeme strains from our curated collection were cultivated and full-length gene sequences were successfully obtained for these strains.

This included 23 phy-logroup 1 strains and 48 phylogroup 2 strains listed in .

S1B in the supplemental material ML phylogenetic trees the seven Treponema putidum strains were closely clustered and well separated from T. denticola strains.

S1A in the supplemental material had a different topology with the seven T. putidum strains forming three clades that were intertwined with T. denticola strains.

The T. vincentii ATCC 700013 F0403 N9 strain differed from the other T. vincentii strains in the pyrH ML tree by being more closely related to the other phylogroup 1 strains outside the T. vincentii clade.

All of the T. denticola strains had 16S rRNA genes 1497 bp in length making them distinct from the T. putidum strains which encoded 16S rRNA genes that were 1496 bp in length.

The results are summarized in see also Table S3 in the supplemental material.The proportions of polymorphic sites were equivalent in the 16S rRNA gene se- quences from the respective sets of oral phylogroup 1 strains 2.52 and oral phylo- group 2 strains 2.74.
