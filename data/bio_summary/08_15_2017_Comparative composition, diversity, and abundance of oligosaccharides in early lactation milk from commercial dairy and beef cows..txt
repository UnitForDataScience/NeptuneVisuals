these studies should account for the observation that os products are variable for both os diversity and structural complexity and some products may not be suitable as prebiotics.keywordsoligosaccharides dairy beef milk prebioticsintroductiondiarrhea is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves usda 2010 2012 and there is considerable interest in approaches to reduce this disease.

our hypothesis was that early-lactation beef cows will have a more abundant and diverse os population compared with dairy cows in early lactation.materials and methodsherd selectionfive commercial holstein dairy herds and 5 angus or angus hybrid beef herds were recruited as a convenience sample.

cluster membership was used as a dependent variable in logistic regression proc genmod in sas to assess thesischo et al.page 6association between cluster and animal production type beef or dairy and animal-specific covariates.resultsdescription of study herds and cowssixty-five cows from 10 herds 5 beef n  32 cows and 5 dairy n  33 cows commercial operations in washington state were sampled.

body condition scores for dairy cows ranged from 2.00 to 3.25 with a median of 2.25. body condition scores for beef cows ranged from 3.5 to 8.0 with a median of 5.0. b-hydroxybutyrate for dairy cows ranged from 0.4 to 4.2 mmoll with a mean of 0.99 mmoll bhb in beef cows ranged between 0.1 and 1.1 mmoll with a mean of 0.38 mmoll.

dairy cows had more variability in solids content with a range of 7.6 to 15 whereas solids in beef cows ranged from 11.1 to 14.1. mean milk ph was the same in dairy and beef cows 6.4 and similar variability ranging from 6.1 to 6.8.milk oligosaccharidesa total of 30 os were identified in early-lactation cow milk including 21 distinct os plus 9 isomers with unique retention times table 2. these os were present in all milk samples regardless of production type.

three os with composition 31000 22010 and 41010 composition denoted by the order of monosaccharides hex-glcnac-fuc- neuac-neugc were more prevalent in beef cows than in dairy cows table 2. four os were detected in equivalently low prevalence in beef and dairy cows.

we found no associations of bhb category or milk quality parameters with cluster membership.discussionthe major finding of this study was that although os structures prevalent in early lactation beef and dairy fresh milk were observed in both production types the relative abundance of most components was greater in the beef-dominated os cluster 2 compared with those observed in the dairy-dominated os cluster 1. a previous study comparing dairy breeds jersey vs. holstein-friesian also found qualitative and quantitative differences in os between the breeds sundekilde et al.
