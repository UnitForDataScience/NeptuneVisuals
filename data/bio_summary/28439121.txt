We deliberately kept the taiga and OSTP samples separate even though we expected high amounts of similarity between them in certain aspects when compared to other samples due to evidence of ample distinctive characteristics in the said samples in their parent studies .

Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi were consistently identified in all samples with significant increase in A samples while Bacteroidetes showed higheraverage relative abundance in DWH and I samples Fig.

Other highly specific increases in average relative abundance at the family level as compared to other samples included Microbacteriaceae 19 for A sam- ples Alteromonadaceae 14 Xanthomonadaceae 20 for DWH samples and Moraxellaceae 26 for OSC samples Supplementary Table .Similarity in bacterial community structure and detection of taxonomic biomarkers of oil pol- luted environments.

Phylum Actinobacteria and class Actinobacteria which were detected as biomarkers in the A samples exhibited significant correlations with almost all differentially abundant KOs for A samples including hydrocarbon degrading genes as pcaG phenol-2-monooxygenase bbsH and pcaL data not shown.In OSC samples over-represented taxa Methylobacterium was associated with genes involved in degradation of furfural and other hydrocarbons Supplementary Fig.

Importantly a number of biomarkers identified here for the taiga samples such as Phenylobacterium Sphingomonadaceae Novosphingobium and Rhodococcus were detected as habitat specialists in oil contaminated taiga samples recently by Yang et al..Anaerobic photoautotrophic Ignavibacteriaceae was identified as a biomarker in I samples Table Supplementary Fig.

Acidobacteria was detected in large numbers in all samples with notably decreased mean relative abundances in the OSC OSTPu OSTPm and OSTPd samples Fig.

Additionally Chlorobi was detected in high mean relative abundance only in M and I samples with increased Gemmatimonadetes abundance identified in A C and M samples Fig.

For instance Acidobacterales had a 21 mean relative abundance in I while Burkholderiales had an average relative abundance of 30 across OSTP samples and Caulobacerales had an average relative abundance of 19 in taiga samples Fig.

Additionally Xanthomonadales showed increased mean relative abundance 15-20 in I and DWH samples and Actinomycetales dominated A samples with an average relative abundance of 24 Fig.

While Caulobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae were highly enriched in the taiga samples with an average relative abundance of 19 and 29 respectively Comamonadaceae exhibited a highly elevated mean relative abundance of 30 in the OSTP samples Supplementary Table .
