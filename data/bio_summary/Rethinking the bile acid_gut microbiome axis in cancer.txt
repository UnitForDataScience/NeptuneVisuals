It is evident from the dearth of information in the literature that more research is required to fully realise the potential of microbial based therapies in restoring bile acid homeostasis in cancer cohorts where recurrence of disease is common.While the generation of novel probiotics and microbiota-based strategies could potentiate bile signalling in cancer progression there remains the possibility that control of bile acids from a dietary perspective could decrease susceptibility to cancer.

If potentially metastatic lesions are present in susceptible organs physiological bile acid levels could limit cell invasion cell migration and cell adhesion phenotypes.colon cancer cohorts For liver cancer susceptibility in obese cohorts continuous monitoring of serum and faecal DCA levels could prove effective in predicting obesity associated liver cancer 90.

In this review we contextualise the current state of the art to propose that the bile acid gut microbiome axis can influence cancer progression to the extent that classical in vitro cancer hallmarks of malignancy cell invasion cell migration clonogenicity and cell adhesion are significantly reduced.

We readily acknowledge the existence of a bile acid gut microbiome axis in cancer initiation however in light of recent advances we focus exclusively on the role of bile acids as potentially beneficial molecules in suppressing cancer progression.

These early observations were correlatively affirmed in epidemiological studies that showed associations between bile acids and cancer notably colorectal cancer summarised in 2.

Unlocking the molecular interplay between these factors and their association with elevated bile acidsTable 1 The impact of bile acids on signalling pathways involved in cancer aetiologyexcessive DCA production and cancer progression could shed light on the altered expression of key biochemical messengers e.g.

However reports have shown that bile acids can have therapeutic effects on some cancer cell types eliciting dramatic changes in cancer cell characteristics cell adhesion cell migration and cell invasion.
