Together these analyses argued against a role for Nlrp6 in shaping the gut microbiota composition in non-littermate Nlrp6-- and C57BL 6J cohorts.Separately Housed Nlrp6-- and Nlrp6 Littermates Do Not Show Dysbiosis and Do Not Reproduce the Bacterial Taxa Alterations Observed in Nlrp6-- versusC57BL6J Mice Our above results showed that despite observing abundance dif- ferences in some individual fecal bacterial taxa Nlrp6 deficiency did not alter the overall gut microbial ecology in our Nlrp6-- col- ony.

The results of these extensive analyses dismiss a general causative role of Nlrp6- and ASC-dependent inflammasomes in shaping the gut microbiota composition while illustrating the necessity for care- ful control in evaluating the impact of immunological circuits on the gut microbiota.RESULTSGut Microbiota Variation between Separately Housed Nlrp6-- and Non-littermate C57BL6J Mice Is Defined Mainly by Mother and Cage CovariatesWe first investigated the influence of Nlrp6 deficiency on the gut microbiota in our SPF animal house by performing Illumina MiSeq 16S sequencing on fecal microbiota from non-littermate Nlrp6-- and C57BL6J mice that were separately bred and housed for multiple generations Figure S1 similar to the exper- imental set-up used in previous studies  .

For this purpose we mated Nlrp6-- males with C57BL6J females to generate Nlrp6- mice which after intercrossing yielded littermate offspring with distinct Nlrp6 Nlrp6- and Nlrp6-- genotypes Figure S2.

Housing the respective genotypes in separate cages for 5 weeks Illumina MiSeq 16S analysis at 8-9 weeks of age did not result in differential amounts of fecal Prevotellaceae A. More- over none of the differential representations of individual bacte- rial taxa previously observed in non-littermate C57BL6J and Nlrp6-- mice were reproduced in these Nlrp6 Nlrp6- and Nlrp6-- littermates B Table S2.
