importantly however these analyses failed to reveal a significant impact of nlrp6 genotypes in neither short- nor long-term separately housed littermate cohorts 0 in both cases i. taken together these results demonstrate that the host nlrp6 genotype does not impact on the fecal micro- biota composition of physically separated littermates.prevotellaceaeporphyromonadaceaebacteroidaceaecns15ns43102511.51.00.56nsns4200.00nlrp6 nlrp6- nlrp6--nlrp6 nlrp6- nlrp6--cagemother0.2nlrp6 10.2nlrp6- a0.10.0-0.1-0.2-0.250.000.25axis 1 7950.50nlrp6 2nlrp6 3nlrp6 4nlrp6- 1nlrp6- 2nlrp6- 3 nlrp6- - 1 nlrp6- - 20.10.0-0.1-0.2-0.250.000.25axis 1 7950.50nlrp6- b nlrp6- c nlrp6- d nlrp6- e nlrp6- fprevotellaceaefporphyromonadaceaebacteroidaceaeg84 ns63422100nlrp6 nlrp6--2.01.51.00.50.0nlrp6 nlrp6--6 ns 420nlrp6 nlrp6--h0.10-0.1-0.2nlrp6nlrp6--cagenlrp6 1nlrp6 2nlrp6 -- 1nlrp6 - - 20.10-0.1-0.2nlrp6nlrp6--mothernlrp6- a nlrp6- b nlrp6 - c nlrp6 - dicombined effect size 17.5unexplained effect size 82.516141210864combined effect size 12.45 unexplained effect size 87.55-0.200.20.4axis 1 66.3-0.200.20.42axis 1 66.305 weeks1 yearfigure 2. separate housing of littermates does not reveal a host genetic effect of nlrp6 on the gut microbiota compositiona-d relative abundances of indicated bacterial taxa a and b species diversity shannon index c and unconstrained ordination genus-level pcoa with color coding indicating the different cages left or the different mothers right d of the fecal microbiota composition from nlrp6 nlrp6- and nlrp6-- littermates that were separately housed for 5 weeks.

the results of these extensive analyses dismiss a general causative role of nlrp6- and asc-dependent inflammasomes in shaping the gut microbiota composition while illustrating the necessity for care- ful control in evaluating the impact of immunological circuits on the gut microbiota.resultsgut microbiota variation between separately housed nlrp6-- and non-littermate c57bl6j mice is defined mainly by mother and cage covariateswe first investigated the influence of nlrp6 deficiency on the gut microbiota in our spf animal house by performing illumina miseq 16s sequencing on fecal microbiota from non-littermate nlrp6-- and c57bl6j mice that were separately bred and housed for multiple generations figure s1 similar to the exper- imental set-up used in previous studies  .

together these analyses argued against a role for nlrp6 in shaping the gut microbiota composition in non-littermate nlrp6-- and c57bl 6j cohorts.separately housed nlrp6-- and nlrp6 littermates do not show dysbiosis and do not reproduce the bacterial taxa alterations observed in nlrp6-- versusc57bl6j mice our above results showed that despite observing abundance dif- ferences in some individual fecal bacterial taxa nlrp6 deficiency did not alter the overall gut microbial ecology in our nlrp6-- col- ony.

in conclusion the above results establish that nlrp6 does not shape gut micro-bial ecology and does not alter dss colitis susceptibility in our animal facility.separately housed ex-germ-free pycard- and pycard-- littermates do not show dysbiosis and do not reproduce the bacterial taxa alterations observed in nlrp6-- versus c57bl6j micegiven the above failure to observe microbiota alterations in nlrp6-deficient mice housed in our spf vivarium we extended our studies to mice lacking the inflammasome adaptor asc encoded by pycard in order to assess the impact of general in- flammasome deficiency on the intestinal microbiota.

for this purpose we performed littermate-controlled microbiota profiling of mice in an independent spf animal facility in which pycard- and pycard-- littermates were derived from a germ-free pycard-- ancestor to ensure that the gut microbiota originated solely from a single c57bl6j female figure s4.

however fecal microbiota of offspring mice derived from separately housed nlrp6-- and nlrp6 littermates did not show any alterations even though these f2 nlrp6-- and f2 nlrp6 mice had the opportunity to shape their gut microbiota in the pre-weaning phase in the absence of mice bearing other genotypes.

this analysis showed that together with nlrp6 genotype these additional co-variates explained 23.2 of the fecal microbiota variation e. however only maternal inheritance 12.3 and housing 8.9 made statisti- cally significant individual contributions to the inter-individual variation in the c57bl6j and nlrp6-- fecal microbiota commu- nities f. in contrast host genetic nlrp6 status did not make a statistically significant contribution to this genus-level microbiota variation.

in contrast both the uniform pycard- mothers and the pycard- or pycard-- genotype did not confer significant contributions to the fecal microbiota variation of either the 8 weeks or the 15 weeks separately housed littermates i. akin to our microbiota analyses in nlrp6- deficient mice these results demonstrate that host pycard ge- netic status does not influence the composition of the fecal gut microbiota.

in addition f2 nlrp6 and f2 nlrp6-- mice did not show differences in colon length after sacrificing at day 9 i. together these 16s sequencing and dss colitis observations obtained in identical f2 nlrp6 and f2 nlrp6-- mice showed that lifetime separation of nlrp6 and nlrp6-- mice did not result in gut microbial alter- ations capable of affecting host colitis responses.

however despite the quantitative alterations in these individual bacterial taxa nlrp6-- and c57bl6j feces showed no difference in mi- crobial species diversity c and an unconstrained multi- variate ordination pcoa of genera abundance profiles showed that the fecal microbiota populations did not cluster according to nlrp6 genotype d adonis p value 0.232. these gut ecological analyses indicate that the nlrp6-- mice in our animal facility did not display overall dysbiosis when compared to sepa- rately housed non-littermate c57bl6j mice.

accordingly no differences in species diver- sity could be observed c and genus-level pcoa ordina- tions did not reveal genotype-related clustering of the f2 nlrp6-- and f2 nlrp6 fecal microbial communities d adonis p value 0.077. moreover in this experimental set-up the explanatory effect of the nlrp6 genotype 5.44 on the overall gut microbiota variation was not statistically significant and did not considerably exceed the mother 4.94 or cage 4.22 co-variate contributions e. hence these results show that even after separating distinct nlrp6 genotypes across a generation nlrp6 deficiency does not lead to fecal microbial alterations and does not have a significant impact on the fecal microbiota variation.
