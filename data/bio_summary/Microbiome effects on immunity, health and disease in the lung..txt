SCFAs serve as the primary energy substrate for colonocytes and also aid in main- taining colonic epithelial integrity regulating host energy balance suppressing colonic inflammation and inducing apoptosis in colon cancer cells.The gut microbiota has also been shown to modulate lipid metabolism by promoting lipase activity in adipocytes.Targeted alterations in the gut microbiome could prove beneficial in controlling body mass triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins.Local intestinal immunity is largely regulated by resident microbiota andor microbial metabolitescomponents and fails to develop fully in the absence of normal microbiota.

Similar statistically nonsignificant correlations between host genome and microbiota composition were also observed for other body sites such as the skin.Another study also used the Human Microbiome Project data to show that mitochondrial haplotypes correlated with abun- dances of specific microbiota in faeces.Other factors can also lead to long-term sustained changes in the composition of gut microbiota such as the onset of chronic diseases changes in diet or repeated exposure to environmental insults such as cigarette smoke allergens infections and air pollution 1.Gender-specific differencesin microbiota also occur and could possibly explain differences in the prevalence of metabolic and intestinal inflammatory diseases in men compared with women.

antibiotics steroids could also affect the microbiome substantially.At age 1-2 years the infant gut microbiome changes dramatically although detectable changes in microbiota may occur as early as 6 weeks post birth as these changes are largely shaped by the cessation of breastfeeding and subsequent alterations in diet.

Notably administration of L. rhamnosus before respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice resulted in elevated antiviral responses via TLR3RIG-I activation.Although the role of microbiome in COPD needs to be further investigated early studies have suggested an association between both lung and gut microbiota and the outcomes of disease.THE ROLE OF THE MICROBIOME IN CFCF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmem- brane conductance regulator CFTR protein that affects variousFigure 3 Interaction matrix risk factors for chronic respiratory diseases and associated pathology with microbiome.

Moreover further investigations are warranted to resolve differences in the composition of the gut microbiota in different mouse strains and the influence of their respective microbiota on health and disease.Recently our knowledge of the respiratory microbiome has improved significantly.

Sci Rep 2016 6 1-9.Monteagudo-Mera A Arthur J Jobin C Keku T Bruno-Barcena J Azcarate-Peril M. High purity galacto-oligosaccharides enhance specific Bifidobacterium species and their metabolic activity in the mouse gut microbiome.

Furthermore recent evidence sug- gests that normal ageing profoundly affects the composition of microbiome in both humans and miceand is strongly influenced by BMI 1.Effects of diet and other factors on microbiome composition Thomson and co-workers analysed stool samples from nine infants age 7 days-10.5 months followed weekly for 16 weeks and reported that the infant microbiome was affected by age diet and day-care attendance.

This was in comparison with a diet rich in polyunsaturated lipids in which the genera ActinobacteriaBifidobacterium and Adlercreutzia Lactobacillus Streptococcus Verru- comicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila Alphaproteobacteria and Delta- proteobacteria were increased.Effects of microbiome in health and regulation of host immunity Normal gut microbiota perform a wide range of metabolic activities that benefit the host.

Similar to gut microbiota the 'core' airway microbiota in healthy lungs is predominantly comprised of the phyla Bacteroidetes Firmicutes and Proteobacteria followed by lesser proportions of Actinobacteria.

These findings clearly demonstrate a critical role for normal microbiota as well as its metabolites in shaping and modulating host immune responses not only in intestinal tract but also at other sites such as the lungs.Disruption of either the composition or overall numbers of 'normal' microbiota in both gut and lungs is termed as 'dysbiosis' and may contribute to the development progression or exacerbation of various inflammatory disorders of lungs including asthma COPD and CF.
