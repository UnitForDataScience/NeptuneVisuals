similar statistically nonsignificant correlations between host genome and microbiota composition were also observed for other body sites such as the skin.another study also used the human microbiome project data to show that mitochondrial haplotypes correlated with abun- dances of specific microbiota in faeces.other factors can also lead to long-term sustained changes in the composition of gut microbiota such as the onset of chronic diseases changes in diet or repeated exposure to environmental insults such as cigarette smoke allergens infections and air pollution 1.gender-specific differencesin microbiota also occur and could possibly explain differences in the prevalence of metabolic and intestinal inflammatory diseases in men compared with women.

scfas serve as the primary energy substrate for colonocytes and also aid in main- taining colonic epithelial integrity regulating host energy balance suppressing colonic inflammation and inducing apoptosis in colon cancer cells.the gut microbiota has also been shown to modulate lipid metabolism by promoting lipase activity in adipocytes.targeted alterations in the gut microbiome could prove beneficial in controlling body mass triglycerides and high-density lipoproteins.local intestinal immunity is largely regulated by resident microbiota andor microbial metabolitescomponents and fails to develop fully in the absence of normal microbiota.

moreover further investigations are warranted to resolve differences in the composition of the gut microbiota in different mouse strains and the influence of their respective microbiota on health and disease.recently our knowledge of the respiratory microbiome has improved significantly.

similar to gut microbiota the 'core' airway microbiota in healthy lungs is predominantly comprised of the phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria followed by lesser proportions of actinobacteria.

these findings clearly demonstrate a critical role for normal microbiota as well as its metabolites in shaping and modulating host immune responses not only in intestinal tract but also at other sites such as the lungs.disruption of either the composition or overall numbers of 'normal' microbiota in both gut and lungs is termed as 'dysbiosis' and may contribute to the development progression or exacerbation of various inflammatory disorders of lungs including asthma copd and cf.

lungs or vice versa through the migration of preprogramed lymphoid cells andor inflammatory mediators.using animal models it has been demon- strated that perturbation of the normal gut microbiota in inbred mice may promote fungal overgrowth in the gut and the development of experimental asthma when challenged with fungal spores in later life allergic airway disease which is characterised by increased levels of in eosinophils ige il-5 and il-13 as well as goblet cell metaplasia.

with the rapid technological advances in the field of metagenomics and bioinformatics researchers are now unravelling the effects of both the respiratory and gi microbiota on the immunity of lungs in health and disease.here we review the relationships between the host and the microbiota in chronic respiratory disorders e.g.

establishment of normal microbiota at an early age is critical for the development of appropriate cellular immune responses as colonisation of neonatal mice but not adult gf mice with conventional microbiota from wild- type mice protected the animals from pathological manifestations of ibd and asthma that were associated with the accumulation of mucosal invariant natural killer t cells.

mouse models have been developed that replicate features of acute chronic mild-to-moderate and severe steroid-resistant asthma.3such models have been used to confirm this role for the respiratory microbiota in allergic asthma as increased infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils occurred following ovalbumin administration in gf compared with spf mice which could be reversed with recolonising gf mice with normal microfloraphenotype-specific.in addition to the modulation of immunity by the lung micro- biome perturbations in gi microbiota such as through antibiotic use and poor diet may disrupt mucosal tolerance.

sequenced the total faecal genetic material from 124 european adults and revealed that the gut microbiota is predominantly comprised of bacteria and archaea representative of 41000 distinct species with lesser populations of viruses and eukaryotic microbes.

these 'healthy' gut microbiota are dominated by the phyla bacter- oidetes firmicutes actinobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia with a lesser proportion of fusobacteria.

indeed the prevalence of the genus prevotella which occurs at high levels in the oral cavity is low in healthy lungs.this suggests that oral microbial communities that transgress into lower respiratory tract are selectively eliminated from healthy lungs.it has also been postulated that increases in the abundance of prevotella may induce low-grade inflammation in lungs.establishment of the microbiomethe establishment of the microbiome may commence before an individual is born as nonpathogenic commensal microbes largely resembling the oral microbiota have been detected from placental dna  1. at birth the mode of delivery affects early colonisation in the gut with delivery by caesarean section shown to be significantly associated with lower abundance and diversity of the phyla actinobacteria and bacteroidetes whereas higher abundance anddiversity of firmicutes in the first 3 months of life.

antibiotics steroids could also affect the microbiome substantially.at age 1-2 years the infant gut microbiome changes dramatically although detectable changes in microbiota may occur as early as 6 weeks post birth as these changes are largely shaped by the cessation of breastfeeding and subsequent alterations in diet.
