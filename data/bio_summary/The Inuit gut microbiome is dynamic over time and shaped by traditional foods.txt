within-individual microbial diversity fluctuated more over time in nunavut than in montreal consistent with a more variable and highly individualized diet in nunavut.conclusions together these results shows that the traditional inuit diet and lifestyle has an impact on the composition diversity and stability of the inuit gut microbiome even if the seasonality of the diet is lesspronounced than expected perhaps due to an increasingly westernized diet.keywords gut microbiome inuit traditional diet temporal variation western diet dietary transition 16s rrna gene correspondence 1departement de sciences biologiques universite de montreal 90 vincent-d'indy montreal qc h2v2s9 canadafull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec the authors.

we speculate that these characteristics might make toilet paper samples less susceptible to change in microbiome composition during storage com- pared to whole stool.the traditional inuit diet influences microbiome composition the diversity and composition of the human gut micro- biome varies widely by geography mainly due to differ- ences in diet  while most 'traditional' diets studied to date are high in fiber and high in micro- biome diversity the traditional inuit diet is low in fiber and is associated with similar levels of microbiome di- versity as the western diet here we extended the study of the inuit microbiome over many months of sampling.

we previously investigated the inuit gut microbiome sampled at a single time point and found no detectable differences in overall microbiome community composition attributable to the traditional inuit diet.results to determine whether seasonal changes in the inuit diet might induce more pronounced changes in the microbiome we collected stool and toilet paper samples and dietary information from inuit volunteersliving in resolute bay nunavut canada and compared them to individuals of european descent living in montreal quebec canada consuming a typical western diet.

however we confirmed three taxa previously associated with nunavut bacteroidales pepto- coccus and tm7 and an additional four specifically asso- ciated with a westernized diet in nunavut prevotella sneathia actinomyceteaceae and arcanobacterium.effects of diet on the microbiomebased on dietary surveys we found significant differ- ences in food consumption frequencies in montreal and nunavut.

consistent with the strongeffects of diet an rda run on nunavut samples only showed that diet could explain 17 of variation in com- munity structure adjusted r2  0.169 p  0.004.within-individual temporal variation of the inuit microbiome we expected that the inuit microbiome would vary sea- sonally across 8 months of sampling while the montreal microbiome would not because commercial foods are available all year long.

it is possible that the inuit and western diets and the corre- sponding microbiomes are more distinct at other times of the year due to seasonal variation in the availability of both traditional and store-bought foods.to investigate the temporal dynamics of the inuit gut microbiome we collected approximately monthly micro- biome samples from inuit volunteers from a community in nunavut canada and compared them to a control group from montreal canada consuming a typical western diet.

no significant clustering of microbiomes according to season or month was observed in either nunavut or montreal permanova p  0.05 additional file figure s12 and no particular taxa were significantly associated with sea- sons in either montreal or nunavut lefse p  0.05. however multivariate dispersion among months and seasons were similar in montreal betadisper p  0.05 but not in nunavut betadisper p  0.05. to further in- vestigate this apparent difference in temporal variability between nunavut and montreal we estimated the dis- persion of both alpha diversity and beta diversity com- munity composition within each individual over time fig.

confirming that diet and geography are correlated a partial rda found that only 6.5 of variation in com- munity composition could be explained by diet after controlling for geography adjusted r2  0.064 p  0.001 and only 3 of the variation could be explained by geography after controlling for diet adjusted r2  0.032 p  0.001. the remaining 2 of the variance is explained by the interaction of diet and geography.

therefore the inuit diet is now a mixture of traditional and western foods depending on the individual and the community modulated by food insecurity  .in the canadian territory of nunavut the inuit traditionally divide their year into six seasons  additional file table s1 characterized by different activities and land use.

this suggests that in spite of a transi- tion to an increasingly western diet the traditional inuit diet still has an impact on the microbiome.temporal variation of the inuit microbiomeprevious studies of temporal variations in the microbiome have shown that within-individual differences are usually less pronounced than among-individuals differences  .

this suggests that there are certain times of year when diet or other un- measured lifestyle factors is more variable in nunavut but not in montreal--perhaps due to greater food insecur- ity in nunavut.

a partial rda model was then used to estimate the amount of variation in microbiome community com- position uniquely explained by diet after controlling for geography nunavut or montreal or by geography after controlling for diet.

theincreased consumption of fibrous fruits and vegetables during summer could be responsible for these differences favoring blooms of bacteria specialized in fiber digestion.the inuit of the canadian arctic have traditionally been hunter-gatherers the inuit traditionally consume an animal-rich diet composed of marine and terrestrial mam- mals e.g.
