On the 34th day at 0800 h the control group was infused with bacte- ria-free saline at 26.25 mLkg BW through the ruminal fistula the treatment group was infused with 21 g of oligofructose per kilogram of BW through the ruminal fistula Thoefner et al.

In addition ruminal lactate con-centrations were immediately increased in sheep after oligofructose infusion and the increase in lactate con- centrations occurred concurrently with a decrease in VFA indicating that ruminal lactate played a key role in the occurrence of acute ruminal acidosis and that the systemic impact of acute acidosis might contribute to induce the laminitis Nocek 1997.In the present study our results revealed that the administration of oligofructose strongly altered the composition and structure of the microbiota in the ru- men of sheep as reflected by the clustering of samples using PCoA.

The clinical signs observed in sheep given oligofructose indicate that all animals receiving oligofructose developed laminitis.Ruminal Fermentation ParametersIn the current study diurnal data showed that oli- gofructose-treated sheep had a lower ruminal pH com- pared with the control group P  0.001 Fig.

Ten fistulated sheep were randomly assigned into a control group n  5 and a treatment group n  5.

Starting almost 4 h after oligofructose admin- istration and continuing until the sampling at 24 h the average ruminal pH was below 5.0 in the oligofruc- tose treatment group which was lower than that of the control group.

In line with these reports our data revealed that primary epidermal lamellae became shorter and sharper the cell matrix was degraded and the relative expressions of MMP-9 related to the degradation of5418Li et al.Caporaso J.

The committee reviewed and approved the experiment and all procedures performed in the present study.Animal and Experimental DesignA group of 10 male Hu sheep 30.55 - 0.90 kg BW fitted with permanent ruminal fistulae were used in this experiment.

In the current study the reason the relative expression of MT1-MMP declined in the oligofructose treatment group was not clear and requires further investigation.ConclusionIn conclusion the current study showed that oli- gofructose overload altered ruminal fermentation and microbiota especially causing an increase in the rela- tive abundance of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus and led to lactate accumulation and a lower ruminal pH.
