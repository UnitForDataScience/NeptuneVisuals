Differen- tial diagnosis between intestinal BD and CD remains a challenge for clinicians and both conditions have significant clinical diagnostic and therapeutic overlaps.Abbreviations5-ASA 5-amino-salicylates AAEA Antia-enolase antibody ADA Adalimumab ASCA Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies AZA6-MP Azathioprine6- mercaptopurine BD Behcet disease CD Crohn's disease CDAI Crohn's disease activity index CSs Systemic corticosteroids DAIBD Disease activityindex for intestinal Behcet's disease IBD Inflammatory bowel diseaseIFX Infliximab IL Interleukin ISG International study group TNF-a Tumour necrosis factor-aAcknowledgementsNot applicable.FundingThis review did not receive funding.

Differential diagnosis of intestinal Behcet's disease and Crohn's disease by colonoscopic findings.

Longterm clinical outcomes of Crohn's disease and intestinal Behcet's disease.

The probabilities of sur- gery hospital admission and post-operative recurrence were not significantly different between intestinal BD and CD 44.4 vs. 36.0 69.2 vs. 73.8 and 66.5 vs. 79.1at 10 years p  0.287 0.295 and 0.724 respectively butthe rates of corticosteroid and immunosuppressant use were higher in intestinal BD than in Crohn's disease 59.4 vs. 42.6 and 37.7 vs. 27.1 p  0.001 and0.001 respectively .ConclusionsIntestinal BD and CD are inflammatory diseases with simi- lar multisystem involvement and various extra-intestinal signs and symptoms.

It may be extremely difficult to distinguish intestinal BD from IBD due to similarities in intestinal and extra- intestinal manifestations and pathologic findings.

Previously some clinicians had used Crohn's disease activity index CDAI for evaluating intestinal BD activity.
