our findings suggest that age and sex collectively shape the conjunctival microbiome and may change the immune homeostasis of the ocular surface through alterations of its commensal microbiome.keywords conjunctival microbiome metagenomic shotgun sequencing age and sexncreasing evidence indicates that sex hormones influence ocular surface health.1 immune associated diseases such as ocular allergy and dry eye often are caused by alterations in steroid hormone levels.23 the aging process also significantly impacts the immune system and eye health especially with regard to the t cell compartment.4 moreover it is well known that the risk of ocular surface diseases increases with age and women are more affected than men14 making it clear that there is a strong relationship among age and sex in immune homeostasis of the ocular surface.

no significant difference is detected in the a diversity measured by shannon index mann-whitney u test a b diversity measured by pca analysis of bacterial relative abundance p value calculated from a wilcoxson rank-sum test on samples' projection onto pc1 b and the relative abundance of core conjunctival bacterial species student's t-test c between the left and right eyes of the same volunteer.figure 4. sex-differences in conjunctival microbiome of healthy adults.

importantly three antibiotic- resistance genes encoding class a b-lactamase bl2btemdiscussionthe human ocular surface is colonized by an expansive diverse microbial community as evidenced by previous researches using 16s rrna sequencing and traditional cul- ture-based methods.10-1221-23 the normal microbiota has a protective immunologic role in preventing the proliferation of pathogenic species and alterations in the homeostatic micro- biome may be related to ophthalmic pathologies.781124-26 it is well known that aging alters the human immune system and sex-specific differences also lead to the varied prevalence of immunologic diseases in males and females.4 thus it is important to define the influence of age and sex on ocular surface microbiota in healthy adults.although the effect of age and sex on the ocular surface microbiome has been investigated by previous studies the conclusions are controversial ozkan et al.10 found no effect of age on the microbial a diversity and a higher shannon index in males while a study by zhou et al.11 indicated no effect of sex on the microbial diversity and a significantly higher richness and shannon index in children younger than 10 years.

previous reports have indicated that a sex-steroid imbalance after menopause initiates profound changes in ocular surface microenvironment and predisposes woman to many autoim- mune inflammatory and allergic ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome.27 it is unclear whether the alteration of conjunctival microbiota found in the old female population is the consequence of sex-hormone imbalance or one of the causes leading to microenvironmental changes on the ocular surface.

the ocular surface microbiome was predominated by bacterial species thus the following analysis focused on the bacterial community.

core bacterial species are summarized infigure 4c.age and sex collectively shape the conjunctival microbiomewe next addressed the question of whether aging affects the ocular surface microbiome.

in addition several antibiotic resistance genes were enriched in the conjunctival microbiome of old adults and these genes have been demonstrated to deactivate penicillin and cephalosporin.28 it strongly suggests that the aging processis a risk factor that may change immune homeostasis of the ocular surface through alterations of its commensal micro- biome and lead to the acquirement of bacterial strains with antibiotic resistance.our study has several limitations.

male and female groups differ only in the b diversity of bacterial communities b while no significant difference is observed in shannon diversity index a. c the differences in relative abundance of core conjunctival bacterial species between male and female groups are summarized.data analysisafter quality control by fastqc the sequence reads were preprocessed with removal of human reads by hisat2 v2.0.113 and deconseq14 to obtain clean nonhuman sequences.

significant differences are found in community diversity including a and b diversity of conjunctival microbiome between young age 23-44 and old age 47-84 groups a b. c the differences in relative abundance of core conjunctival bacterial species between young and old groups are shown.process and data analysis.

additionally mounting evidence suggests that diverse commensal microorganisms inhabiting the ocular surface have potent immunoregulatory functions and have an important role in the ocular health and disease pathogenesis.5-8 although the microbiome is known to be affected by age and sex9 the influence of these factors on ocular surface microbiota in healthy individuals remains controversial.

for all boxplots center lines represent the median and the box edges represent the first and the third quartiles.resultsmetagenomic shotgun sequencing analysis reveals diversity in ocular surface microbiota of healthy volunteerswe obtained ocular surface microbiome samples from the inferior bulbar conjunctiva of 48 young age 23-44 as well as 42 old age 47-84 adults at zhongshan ophthalmic center.

2. moreover we exam- ined whether the bacterial community of the ocular surface differed between the left os and right od eyes of the same volunteer the results showed that no significant difference was detected in either a measured by shannon index p0.13 mann-whitney u test fig.

8. taken together the composition and function of ocular surface microbiome as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes change with age in healthy adults.figure 6. the bacterial species with significant differences in relative abundance between old and young groups.

our findings suggested that age and sex collectively shape the conjunctival microbiome and that aging appears to be a stronger factor in reshaping the ocular surface microbiome especially with regard to antibiotic resistance.
