The objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the distribution of species and the occurrence of reduced antimicrobial susceptibility in the B. fragilis group from patients treated at departments with a high level of antibiotic use 2 to determine the prevalence of the carbapenem resistance gene cfiA in B. fragilis in this patient group and 3 to determine the association between previous antibiotic treatment and reduced susceptibility to clindamycin meropenem metroni- dazole and piperacillin-tazobactam in the B. fragilis group in the patient group.

Non-duplicate isolates within a sample were defined as isolates with different species identifica- tion or same species with different susceptibility patterns than other isolates from the same faecal sample.Data sources and statistical analysisData on antibiotic exposure were extracted from the Region Southern Denmark hospital medicine administration database and the Odense Pharmaco-epidemiological Database OPED .

Applying a definition of non- duplicate isolates as isolates with different species identification andor different antimicrobial susceptibility seventy-four patients would have possible duplicates of isolates in our data data not shown.

Median ages were higher for patients with non-susceptible isolates than for patients with susceptible isolates or with samples with no growth of B. fragilis group bacteria.

Patients with a non-susceptible isolate or a sample with no growth of B. fragilis group bacteria displayed a tendency to have a higher Charlson comorbidity scores compared to patients with susceptible isolates .A total of 359 isolates from 122 samples were identified asB.

Isolates with reduced antimicrobial susceptibility and isolates with no growth of B. fragilis group bacteria generally came from patients with a higher Charlson index than susceptible isolates albeit this was a non-significant trend.It was not possible to extract data on antimicrobial exposure from the department of intensive care however it is assumed that treatment with antibiotics at the department of intensive care would be continued as patients were discharged to ordinary wards.

The amount of samples equals the amount of patients in the study.Table 1Characteristics of the patients in the cohort by resistance profile of isolated B. fragilis group bacteria.Charlson index 1-217 2518 3420 27Charlson index 239 5722 4240 53a Non susceptible Patients who had at least one isolate that was intermediate susceptible or resistant.b Susceptible Patients where no isolates were intermediate susceptible or resistant.c No growth Patients where no B. fragilis group bacteria were isolated from faecal sample.antibiotics 28 11 5 and 1 were intermediate susceptible or resistant to clindamycin piperacillin-tazobactam meropenem and metronidazole respectively .Three strains resistant to metronidazole were isolated B. fragilis MIC 8 mgL B. ovatusxylanisolvens MIC 24 mgL and Par- abacteroides distasonis MIC 8 mgL.

Of the tested isolates 134 37 isolates from 69 patients showed reduced susceptibility to one or more of the fourFig.

A study from Iran reported two metronidazole resistant isolates out of 177 isolates 1 .

fragilis group bacteria are able to develop resistance to several antimicrobials and the prevalence of resistance in clinical isolates has increased worldwide over the past decades .
