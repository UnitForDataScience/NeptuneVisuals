This was evidenced by comparing weighted UniFrac distances D5-14 to D0 be- tween treatment groups Figure 2 microbiotas showed a greater change in relative proportion of community members a greater weighted UniFrac distance relative to D0 in Figure 2 after 5 to 14 days of treatment with prednisolone than after 5 to 14 days of gavage with water P  0.05.After 5 to 14 days of treatment only the overall microbial composition of prednisolone-treated mice differed from con- trol mice who received 5 to 14 days of water using weighted UniFrac distance P  0.001.

feces were collected at day 0 before treatment initiation and at day 5 and 14 of treatment.

Combined IS associa- tion of prednisolone MMF and tacrolimus.was shared between mice who received the combined IS treat- ment and mice who received prednisolone alone the ileal mi- crobiota of these 2 groups were not more similar to each other than other treatment groups at the community level.All IS Drugs Except MMF Alter C-Type Lectin Expression in the IleumInnate antimicrobial defenses and in particular the expres- sion of C-type lectins are important in controlling the micro- biota at the intestinal mucosal surface.5 Based on this we examined whether these antimicrobials might be altered after IS drug treatment which could impact microbiota composi- tion.

Also note that before treatment or water initiation D0 the proportion of several bacterial families significantly differed between the first and the second replicate.at day 0 between groups and between the individuals of a same treatment group.

In each treatment group the first column represents the fecal count before IS treatment the second column the second day posttreatment and the third column the seventh day posttreatment.

More recently microbiota was used as a signature to distin- guish rejecting and nonrejecting rat liver recipients.9Fricke et al10 looked at the impact of kidney transplantation including immunosuppressive IS treatment on oral urinary and fecal microbiotas at 1 and 6 months posttransplantation.

Because many parameters other than IS treatment can influence gut microbiota after solid organ transplantation in humans a mouse model was used with 4 IS drugs administered separately or in combination.

Fecal pellets were collected at day 0 before IS drug treatment at 2 5 7 and 14 days after IS drug initiation.

The overall community changed in all treatment groups and in the control group at days 5-14 full circles in Figure 1relative to day 0 empty circles except in the combined IS group as indicated by AMOVA and corrected for multiple comparisons P  0.05 using both unweighted UniFrac dis- tances which considers the presence or absence of OTUs and weighted UniFrac distance which considers the relative abundance of OTUs.

However it is important to note that fecal microbiota composition prior to treatment was significantly different in the 2 replicates of the experiment.
