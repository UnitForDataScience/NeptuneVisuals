Such a scenario has also been observed in other B. bifidum strains thus reinforcing a specific ecological role exploited by the members of this bifidobacterial taxon .Recently other bifidobacterial cross-feeding strategies toward utilization of fucose have been discovered involving various B. bifidum as well as B. kashiwahonense and B. breve or B. longum subsp.

Hydrolysis of complex sugars by specific bifidobacterial strains produces simple glycans that are utilized directly by the same bifidobacterial cells andor are metabolized by other bacterial cells belonging to different strainsspecies through cross-feeding or resource-sharing activities.derived oligomers of this substrate when cultivated with Bacteroides ovatus owing to the extracellular xylan-degrading activity of B. ovatus thereby allowing efficient uptake of the produced xylo-oligosaccharides by a dedicated ABC transporter encoded by many bifido- bacterial species .Among the bifidobacterial communities that reside in the gut of infants or adults certain bifidobacterial species such as B. breve possess assimilation capabilities for a wide range of carbohydrates which include both dietary and host-derived glycans .The pan-genome of B. breve indeed highlights extensive but sometimes variable genetic capabilities with regard to the metabolism of carbohydrates including among others ribose and sucrose as well as the plant-derived polysaccharides starch galactan and cellodextrin .Despite its extensive carbohydrate-processing abilities B. breve is not able to directly access mucin or HMOs as carbon sources though it can utilize host-derived monooligosaccharides once they become available through hydrolytic activities of other bifidobacteria present in the human gut microbiota see below in this review .

Recently additional cross-feeding activities have been observed between a set of bifidobacterial strains B. bifidum PRL2010 B. breve 12L B. adolescentis 22L and B. thermophilum JCM7017 when cultivated on plant-derived glycans such as starch and xylan .

longum B. adolescentis and B. catenulatum suggests an adaptation of these bifidobacterial species to avegetarian or omnivorous dietconsistent with a more generalist ecological behavior.

However stachyose can only be partly degraded by members of this GH13 family.By contrast glycobiomes of certain bifidobacterial species such as B. bifidum and B. longum subsp.

In this context in silico analyses of genome sequences of Bifidobacterium subspecies revealed that the presence of genes encoding the starchstarch-derivative-degrading enzymes mentioned above is not a conserved feature among human gut bifidobacterial strains but is largely confined to specific taxa and strains such as B. adolescentis  and B. breve .

Notably the acquisition of these enzymes was predicted to have occurred during the early stages of B. adolescentis speciation indicating that the preference for starch metabolism already existed in immediate B. adoles- centis ancestors .By contrast the uptake system and the intracellular machinery required to metabolize alpha- 14-malto-oligosaccharides and alpha-16-isomalto-oligosaccharides GH1331 was shown to be ubiquitously present in bifidobacteria .Dietary fibres may encompass xylan and xylo-oligosaccharides which can be accessed by members of the gut microbiota in different ways.

The subsequent fermentative metabolism of these carbohydrates also produces metabolic end products such as acetate and lactate which in turn may act as substrates for other microbial gut colonizers in particular the butyrate-producing enteric bacteria .Specific cases of cross-feeding activities among members of bifidobacterial communities have experimentally been demonstrated to occur between the infant-type bifidobacterial strains B. bifidum PRL2010 and B. breve UCC2003 when these microorganisms are grown on sialyl lactose as the only carbon source .

infantis ATCC15697 B. adolescentis 22L and B. breve 12L further confirmed the existence of cross-feeding activities between various bifidobacterial strains in the mammalian gut .

This makes sense in the context of vertical transfer of bifidobacterial species from mother to offspring which includes adult-type members such as B. adolescentis .Early events in bacterial inoculationcolonization of the mammalian gut represent an intriguing example of microbe-host coevolution where members of the gut microbiota of adult mammals are specifically transmitted to their newborn.
