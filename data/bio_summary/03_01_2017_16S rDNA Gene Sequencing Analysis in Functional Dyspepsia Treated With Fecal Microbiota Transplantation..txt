LETTERS TO THE EDITOROn the Pathogenesis of Central Liver Nodules in Alagille Syndromelhammad et al 1 described central hyperplastic liver nodules in Alagille syndrome patients and Rougemont et al 2 proposed that vascular anomalies lead to the development of central liver nodules with intact bile ducts while bile duct integrity isaffected in the peripheral liver.Based on our findings in the explant liver of an Alagille syndrome patient we proposed that defects in postnatal bile duct branching and elongation lead to bile duct paucity in the peripheral liver while normal bile ducts are present in the central portion 3.

Our hypothesis was supported in an animal model 4.Although bile duct paucity causes cholate statis in the liver periphery intact bile ducts in the central portion prevent the accumulation of hepatotoxic bile salts 3.
