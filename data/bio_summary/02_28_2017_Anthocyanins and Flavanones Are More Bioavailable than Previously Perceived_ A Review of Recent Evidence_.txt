the data obtained were compared with the in vivo urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites after oj intake as outlined in the previous paragraph to produce the proposed catabolic routes that are illustrated in figures 7 and 8.in vitro naringenin is likely to undergo ring fission producing 3-41-hydroxyphenylpropionicacid which is dehydroxylated and converted mainly to 3-phenylpropionic acid which in vivo could potentially contribute to the urinary pool of hippuric acid figure 7. colonic ring fission of hesperetin produces dihydro-isoferulic acid 3-31-hydroxy-41-methoxyphenylpropionic acid which is demethylated producing dihydrocaffeic acid 3-3141-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid.

furthermore anthocyanin gut-derived catabolites such as protocatechuic acid vanillic acid syringic acid 35-methoxy- 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and gallic acid 345-trihydroxybenzoic acid de ferrars et al.

this via successive dehydroxylations is in turn converted to 3-31-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid which could be further converted to the respective urinary pools of 31-hydroxyhippuric acid and hippuric acid figure 8. in vitro degradation of hesperetin alsocoumaric acid-4'-o- glucuronide4'-hydroxycinnamic acidferulic acid-4'- sulfatehoohohhoococh3ohhoococh3oglcuaohh3c nnarigeninferulic acidferulic acid-4'-o-hohglucuronidep-sympatolohohhooc3-4'-hydroxyphenyl- propionic acidh2nohp-octopaminephenylacetic acidohcoh4'-hydroxyphenyl- 2-hydroxy- acetaldehydebenzoic acid4-hydroxybenzoic acid3-methoxy-4-hydroxy- benzoic acidhoocohhhoocnofigure 7catalyzed by mammalian enzymesmicrobiota-mediated conversionsring fission potential intermediateproposed pathways for the metabolism of naringenin and ferulic acid released by cleavage of naringenin-7-o-rutinoside and ferulic acid-41-o-glucoside after the consumption of orange juice by humans.

in vitro fecal incubations with ferulic acid indicate this is feasible as the hydroxycinnamate wasconverted principally to dihydroferulic acid 31-methoxy-41-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid andits demethoxy-derivative 3-41-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid along with smaller amounts of their phenylacetic acid counterparts pereira-caro et al.

2009 indicate that caffeic acid is converted to ferulic acid isoferulic acid and their phase ii metabolites via enterocyte-based meth-ylation and sulfationglucuronidation steps as illustrated in figure 3. although urinary excretion of caffeic acid-31-sulfate increased after raspberry consumption table 1 free caffeic acid was not detected in either plasma or urine arguably as a consequence of a rapid rate of turnover.

41-hydroxyhippuric acid is a product of hepatic glycination of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and was observed in the rasp-berry feeding study to have a cmax of 1.0 h figure 3. this suggests that caffeic acid derived from cyanidin undergoes conversion to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in the upper gi tract rather than being a product of the colonic microbiota.

2011 also incubated raspberry anthocyanins in vitro under anaerobic conditions with human fecal slurries and found the first catabolic step included cleavage of the sugar moiety with subsequent degradation of cyanidin resulting in the accumulation of catechol resorcinol pyrogallol 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 34-dihydroxybenzoic acid protocatechuic acid3-31-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 3-3141-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid dihydrocaffeicacid.

there is evidence for the formation of many additional products including 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid other hydroxy-methoxy isomers of benzoic acid and phase ii metabolites of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and hydroxy- and dihydroxycinnamic acid.

2016. protocatechuic and ferulic acid are probably more commonly investigated as they are found naturally in the diet are present in some traditional herbal medicines and are relatively inexpensive to purchase kakkar  bais 2014 ou  kwok 2004. protocatechuic acid 34-dihydroxybenzoic acid has recently received significant attention in the literature even though it has a relatively low abundance and half-life compared with ferulic acid.

after ingestion of raspberries an increased urinary excretion of 41- hydroxymandelic acid hippuric acid and 41-hydroxyhippuric acid was observed and these metabo- lites were not identified in fecal incubations suggesting they are products of mammalian enzymes.

the elevated excretion of hippuric acid formed by hepatic glycination of benzoic acid is likely to be at least partially a consequence of cyanidin degradation but to what extent is difficult to determine because of person-to-person variation and the high background80406030402020100020400153001020051000120804004000300020001000000612182406121824time htime hfigure 2pharmacokinetic profiles of phenolic compounds in plasma following raspberry consumption.
