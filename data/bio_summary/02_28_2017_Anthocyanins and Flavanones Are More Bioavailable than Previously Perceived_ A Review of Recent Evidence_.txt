Furthermore anthocyanin gut-derived catabolites such as protocatechuic acid vanillic acid syringic acid 35-methoxy- 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and gallic acid 345-trihydroxybenzoic acid de Ferrars et al.

In vitro fecal incubations with ferulic acid indicate this is feasible as the hydroxycinnamate wasconverted principally to dihydroferulic acid 31-methoxy-41-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid andits demethoxy-derivative 3-41-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid along with smaller amounts of their phenylacetic acid counterparts Pereira-Caro et al.

2011 also incubated raspberry anthocyanins in vitro under anaerobic conditions with human fecal slurries and found the first catabolic step included cleavage of the sugar moiety with subsequent degradation of cyanidin resulting in the accumulation of catechol resorcinol pyrogallol 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 34-dihydroxybenzoic acid protocatechuic acid3-31-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 3-3141-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid dihydrocaffeicacid.

There is evidence for the formation of many additional products including 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid other hydroxy-methoxy isomers of benzoic acid and phase II metabolites of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and hydroxy- and dihydroxycinnamic acid.

Colonic ring fission of hesperetin produces dihydro-isoferulic acid 3-31-hydroxy-41-methoxyphenylpropionic acid which is demethylated producing dihydrocaffeic acid 3-3141-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid.

This via successive dehydroxylations is in turn converted to 3-31-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid which could be further converted to the respective urinary pools of 31-hydroxyhippuric acid and hippuric acid Figure 8.

2009 indicate that caffeic acid is converted to ferulic acid isoferulic acid and their phase II metabolites via enterocyte-based meth-ylation and sulfationglucuronidation steps as illustrated in Figure 3.

After ingestion of raspberries an increased urinary excretion of 41- hydroxymandelic acid hippuric acid and 41-hydroxyhippuric acid was observed and these metabo- lites were not identified in fecal incubations suggesting they are products of mammalian enzymes.
