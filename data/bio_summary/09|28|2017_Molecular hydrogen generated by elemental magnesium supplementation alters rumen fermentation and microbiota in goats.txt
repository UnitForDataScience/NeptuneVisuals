given that dh2 and gh2 have been shown not to be at equilibrium in vitro and in vivo and that the form of h2 available to microbes is dh2 rather than gh2 we propose that the role of h2 on fermentation needs further examination by studying the effect of dh2 addition.our first hypothesis for this study using goats as the experi-table 1. ingredients and chemical composition of the basal diet offered to goats gkg dmitemsdietdietary ingredient gkg dm foragerice straw300concentratesoyabeans54maize304wheat bran290caco35fat11nacl5urea11premix20chemical composition gkg dmdm960organic matter912ash883crude protein150starch262neutral detergent fibre312acid detergent fibre186diethyl ether extract350gross energy mjkg182mental ruminant model was that dh2 could be increased through supplementing elemental mg to the diet as elemental mg would react with water in rumen fluid releasing h2mg  2 h2o - mgoh2 h .

ruminal dh2 was negatively correlated with acetate molar percentage and fungal copy numbers p  005 and positively correlated with propionate molar percentage and methanogen copy numbers p  005. in summary elemental mg supplementation increased ruminal dh2 concentration which inhibited rumen fermentation enhanced methanogenesis and seemed to shift fermentation pathways from acetate to propionate and altered microbiota by decreasing fungi and increasing methanogens.key words elemental magnesium fermentation pathways dissolved hydrogen methane rumen microbiotavolatile fatty acids vfa carbon dioxide co2 and molecular h h2 are produced during carbohydrate fermentation by bacteria protozoa and fungi in the rumen.

lower dh2facilitatesin feed intake and digestibility in goats fed diets supplemented with elemental mg and mgoh2 but elevated dh2 resulting from elemental mg supplementation decreased total vfa concentration in the rumen which suggests that fermentation might have been impaired by elevated rumen dh2.

this suggests that ruminal dh2 might have exceeded the capacity of methanogens to take up h2 in the treatment with elemental mg supplementation so that methanogenic population and activity might have been limiting for ch4 generation in the rumen.in summary goats adapted to elevated ruminal dh2 gener-ated by elemental mg supplementation had lower rumen total vfa concentration copy number of fungi and greater propio- nate molar percentage and ch4 emissions when compared with goats fed the control diet supplemented with mgoh2.

in our study we found that elemental mg supplementation increased dch4 concentration the copy number of methanogens and ch4 emissions indicating that increased dh2 generated by elemental mg supplementation promoted ch4 production in the rumen of goats.

the elemental mg and mg oh2 supplements were mixed with the concentrate fraction immediately before feeding to avoid the reaction with water in the environment and the concentrate fraction containing the elemental mg and mgoh2 supplements was eaten completely within approximately 1 h. during the initial 10 d of adaptation to diets feed was offered ad libitum targeting 5  refusals.
