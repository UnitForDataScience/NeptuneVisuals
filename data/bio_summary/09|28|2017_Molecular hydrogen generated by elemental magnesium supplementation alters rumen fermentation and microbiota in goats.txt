When this highest dH2 point was removed the Pearson's correlation coefficient between dH2 and dCH4 was 0486 P  003 data not shown.Elemental Mg supplementation decreased total VFA molar concentration -116  P  0001 acetate molar percentage -380  P  0001 the acetate to propionate ratio -118  P  003 and RNH2 -421  P  003 and increased propio- nate molar percentage 116  P  0001 3.

The elemental Mg and Mg OH2 supplements were mixed with the concentrate fraction immediately before feeding to avoid the reaction with water in the environment and the concentrate fraction containing the elemental Mg and MgOH2 supplements was eaten completely within approximately 1 h. During the initial 10 d of adaptation to diets feed was offered ad libitum targeting 5  refusals.

Lower dH2facilitatesin feed intake and digestibility in goats fed diets supplemented with elemental Mg and MgOH2 but elevated dH2 resulting from elemental Mg supplementation decreased total VFA concentration in the rumen which suggests that fermentation might have been impaired by elevated rumen dH2.

In our study we found that elemental Mg supplementation increased dCH4 concentration the copy number of methanogens and CH4 emissions indicating that increased dH2 generated by elemental Mg supplementation promoted CH4 production in the rumen of goats.

This suggests that ruminal dH2 might have exceeded the capacity of methanogens to take up H2 in the treatment with elemental Mg supplementation so that methanogenic population and activity might have been limiting for CH4 generation in the rumen.In summary goats adapted to elevated ruminal dH2 gener-ated by elemental Mg supplementation had lower rumen total VFA concentration copy number of fungi and greater propio- nate molar percentage and CH4 emissions when compared with goats fed the control diet supplemented with MgOH2.

The SPSS 12.0 software was used for the statistical analyses.ResultsAlthough no differences were observed for feed intake and digestibility between both treatments elemental Mg supple- mentation increased CH4 emissions expressed as gd 117  P  003 and as gkg OM intake 987  P  003 2.
