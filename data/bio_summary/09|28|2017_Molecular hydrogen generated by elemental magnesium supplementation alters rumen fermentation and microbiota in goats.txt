The elemental Mg and Mg OH2 supplements were mixed with the concentrate fraction immediately before feeding to avoid the reaction with water in the environment and the concentrate fraction containing the elemental Mg and MgOH2 supplements was eaten completely within approximately 1 h. During the initial 10 d of adaptation to diets feed was offered ad libitum targeting 5  refusals.

Elemental Mg sup- plementation decreased the abundance of Bacteroidaceae P  003 and increased the abundance of Veillonellaceae P  006 and Succiniclasticum P  0009 5.b 3.02.52.01.51.00.5DiscussionH2 is produced during the reaction of elemental Mg with water Mg  2H2O - MgOH2  H2.

Lower dH2facilitatesin feed intake and digestibility in goats fed diets supplemented with elemental Mg and MgOH2 but elevated dH2 resulting from elemental Mg supplementation decreased total VFA concentration in the rumen which suggests that fermentation might have been impaired by elevated rumen dH2.

In our study we found that elemental Mg supplementation increased dCH4 concentration the copy number of methanogens and CH4 emissions indicating that increased dH2 generated by elemental Mg supplementation promoted CH4 production in the rumen of goats.

This suggests that ruminal dH2 might have exceeded the capacity of methanogens to take up H2 in the treatment with elemental Mg supplementation so that methanogenic population and activity might have been limiting for CH4 generation in the rumen.In summary goats adapted to elevated ruminal dH2 gener-ated by elemental Mg supplementation had lower rumen total VFA concentration copy number of fungi and greater propio- nate molar percentage and CH4 emissions when compared with goats fed the control diet supplemented with MgOH2.

Two treatments were formulated with equal dietary Mg content basal diet plus 145  DM basis MgOH2 powder 99  purity Beijing Taizejiaye Technology Development Co. Ltd for the control group and basal diet with 060  DM basis elemental Mg powder 99  purity Beijing Taizejiaye Technology Development Co. Ltd for the hypothesised elevated dH2 group.

In summary elemental Mg supplementation increased ruminal dH2 concentration which inhibited rumen fermentation enhanced methanogenesis and seemed to shift fermentation pathways from acetate to propionate and altered microbiota by decreasing fungi and increasing methanogens.Key words Elemental magnesium Fermentation pathways Dissolved hydrogen Methane Rumen microbiotaVolatile fatty acids VFA carbon dioxide CO2 and molecular H H2 are produced during carbohydrate fermentation by bacteria protozoa and fungi in the rumen.
