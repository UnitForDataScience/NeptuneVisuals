Plots are based on the first three principal coordinates which explain 11.5 PC1 5.16 PC2 and 3.98 PC3 of the variance in microbial composition and do not cluster by quartile-- supporting a lack of association between microbial markers and these psychiatric measures in healthy individuals.doi10.1371journal.pone.0170208.g002that there is a striking lack of correlation between microbial community composition and the measurements we have gathered from this human cohort.To further visualize the associations in our data set we generated principal coordinate plots using unweighted UniFrac distances and colored these plots by quartiles of the main psychiat- ric measures of interest BAI BDI EDE-Q total PSS .

The regression of PC1 and PC2 against each of the psychiatric measures and other participant variables did not indicate any significant linear relationships after FDR correction.DiscussionOur results provide evidence for a lack of association in physically and psychologically healthy adult females between microbial markers of gut composition and diversity and a collection of psychiatric measures including anxiety depression eating-related thoughts and behaviors stress and personality.

Bacterial composition and diversity were characterized by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and associations were examined using Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient in conjunction with Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate procedure.ResultsWe found no significant associations between microbial markers of gut composition and diversity and scores on psychiatric measures of anxiety depression eating-related thoughts and behaviors stress or personality in a large cohort of healthy adult females.P30DK03498 awarded to Dr. Carroll.

Studies involving GF mouse models or clinical populations pres- ent extreme cases of psychopathology which may not reflect microbial mechanisms in a healthy human population.This study was the first specifically to examine associations between composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and psychiatric measures in healthy females and our results do not reveal associations between the intestinal microbiota and low levels of symp- tomatology in a healthy population.

R scripts are available at .The diversity of the intestinal microbiota was characterized by the Shannon diversity index  .Statistical AnalysisAssociations between psychiatric and microbial measures were examined using Kendall's tau-b correlation coefficient in conjunction with Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate FDR procedure to correct for multiple comparisons .

Mixed evidence has emerged from investigations comparing the intestinal microbiotas of individuals with major depressive disor- der to healthy controls with one study failing to find significant between-group differences in microbial diversity or taxonomic composition  while the other found increased diversity and significant taxonomic differences at the phylum family and genus levels .

Composition and diversity of the intestinal micro- biota may also be associated with temperament in young children but how such links may evolve during the development of adult personality is unclear .Prebiotic and probiotic supplementation has emerged in human clinical studies as potential means for altering mood but connecting post-intervention changes in mood to differences in microbial composition or diversity is lacking.
