Here we present the draft genome sequence of S. saprophyticus DPC5671 which will allow a full safety assess-ment and further analysis on its role in cheese ripening.The draft genome of S. saprophyticus DPC5671 was sequenced using paired-end 454 pyrosequencing to a coverage of 23X.

The S. saprophyticus DPC5671 genome was found to have a predicted coding sequence CDS for adhesion with similarities examined with the BlastP Web server to uafA in S. saprophyticus ATCC 15305 with 39 of query cover and 97 of protein identity.The availability of the genome sequence of DPC5671 will allow its role in flavor development in cheese ripening to be studied.Accession numbers.

S. saprophyticus is a common Gram- positive bacterium detected on the surface of smear-ripened cheese and other fer- mented foods.taphylococci are Gram-positive catalase-positive bacteria with halotolerance that enables their growth in salted fermented food.

S. saprophyticus is a species frequently detected on the surface of smear-ripened cheese and other fermented foods .

The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Data- base CARD software  was used to determine the presence of genes potentially involved in antibiotic resistance and the presence of known staphylococcal virulence factors was analyzed using the BlastP Web server .The draft genome of S. saprophyticus DPC5671 includes 2676318 bp with an average GC content of 33.1.

Overall the genome of S. saprophyticus DPC5671 shows high similarity tosaprophyticus ATCC 15305 in genome size GC content and gene synteny .S.

Previous studies showed an involvement of S. saprophyticus in urinary tract infections showing a specific adhesin uafA to be associated with adherence to the eukaryotic cell in the urinary tract .

The draft genome was manually analyzed using the ARTEMIS genome browser  and comparative analysis with the genome of S. sapro- phyticus ATCC 15305  was performed using the Artemis Comparison Tool ACT .

saprophyticus DPC5671 is coagulase negative nonhemolytic and does not appear to produce any toxins associated with Staphylococcus aureus.
