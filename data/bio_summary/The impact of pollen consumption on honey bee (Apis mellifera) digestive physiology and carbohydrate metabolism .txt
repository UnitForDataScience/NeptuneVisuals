our findings document previously uncharacterized modulation of honey bee digestive physiology by pollen consumption as well as the potential relative contributions of host bacterial and pollen gh activities to carbohydrate metabolism.methods honey bees and experimental setupexperiments were conducted in july 2016 at the usda--ars carl hayden honey bee research center tucson ari- zona usa.

2014.-glucosidase ec 3.2.1.21 and -galactosidase 3.2.1.23 originate in secretory head glands and have been purified from the midgut peng 1980 pontoh  low 2002. in addition to carbohydrate digestion these enzymes may con- vert dietary -glycosides into biologically active aglycone forms that cause systemic alterations in honey bee geneexpression mao schuler  berenbaum 2013 2015. plant phenolic glycosides are prevalent dietary components incorporating glucose galactose xylose arabinose and mannose residues bravo 1998 pyrzynska  biesaga 2009. host enzyme-inaccessible glycosidic linkages might be cleaved by hindgut bacteria and the resulting aglycone further metabolized by both host and microbiota filannino di cagno addante pontonio  gobbetti 2016.despite considerable interest in improving honey bee nutrition little is known about the metabolism of recalcitrant dietary carbohydrates and glycosides that are major constituents of pollen biomass.

1998. peptide mass analysis indicated that the -glucosidase isolated from the honey bee head was the same as those isolated from the crop and midgut pontoh  low 2002. our findings are consistent with the production of-glucosidase in the hypopharnygeal glands where it is secreted into the mouth during feeding to be later shared with other individuals or transferred to the midgut.figure 4 glycoside hydrolase activities in axenic cultures of characteristic bacteria isolated from honey bee hindgut homogenates.

these findings collectively indicate that diet age and colony context influence honey bee gut microbiota composition however interactions among these factors are likely complex and will require more detailed investigations to elucidate.our findings expand on previously reported carbon source utilization experiments and indicate that the honey bee gut microbiota is capable of hydrolyzing sugars that are prevalent in pollen biomass thus liberating them from larger carbohydrates.
