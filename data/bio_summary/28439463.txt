Overall our results support the concept that the native microbiota in each individual cat or dog is unique and that this microbiota show highly individualized patterns of variation over time and during the course of prebiotic administration.In addition to confirming the uniqueness of fecal microbiota in individual cats and dogs this study also confirms previous observations about the minimal effects of low prebiotic dosages on the gut microbiota of healthy cats   and dogs    .

Fecal samples were collected by the owners at two time points before prebiotic administration 8 days and 1 day before initiation of prebiotic administration and again at two time points after initiation of prebiotic administration days 8 and 16 after initiation of prebiotic administration see for a timeline of our experimental design.

Similarly to trial 1 fecal samples were collected at two time points before prebiotic administration 8 days and 1 day before initiation of prebiotic administration and at two time points after initiation of prebiotic administration days 8 and 16 after initiation of prebiotic administration .QuestionnaireAll pet owners trials 1 and 2 were provided with a questionnaire to record the following parameters during the study period acceptance of the prebiotic attitude appetite drinking behavior defecation frequency borborygmus flatulence as well as volume consistencyand color of feces .

Lastly in this study we only evaluated the bacterial microbiota but the fungal microbiota does indeed deserve investigation .In summary there is a potential beneficial effect of prebiotics to improve gut health in cats and dogs and this effect may be mediated by changes in the gut microbiota  .

during prebiotic administration  which is noteworthy given the historical association of prebiotics with increased abundances of lactic acid bacteria.The LEfSe method showed that an unknown member of the family Veillonellaceae orderClostridiales within Firmicutes was significantly increased during prebiotic administration and also that an unknown member of Gammaproteobacteria was decreased during prebiotic administration .

Also similar to what was observed in cats a predictive approach to investigate the functional microbiome did not reveal any significant difference between the period before and during prebiotic administration in the dogs enrolled in trial 1 .Trial 2--dogs onlyTrial 2 was designed to explore the possibility that an increase in prebiotic content would result in relevant changes in the fecal microbiota with a focus on canine patients.

Interestingly one dog in trial 2 dog number 7 D7 had near 0 Bifidobacterium at both time points before prebiotic administration an increase to 8.4 on day 8 after initiation of prebiotic administration and a further increase to 25.9 on day 16 after initiation of prebiotic administration .

This same dog D7 trial 2 also had a massive increase of Lactobacillaceae from 1 before and on day 8 after initiation of prebioticadministration to 35.2 on day 16 after initiation and Turicibacteraceae from 0 before prebiotic administration to 49 and 15 on days 8 and 16 after initiation of prebiotic administration respectively .The LEfSe method showed a lower abundance of Dorea family Clostridiaceae and also higher abundances of Megamonas and other unknown members of Veillonellaceae class Negativicutes within the Firmicutes during prebiotic administration .

Exclusion criteria included abnormal serum parameters that could indicate subclinical abnormalities.Trial 1 cats and dogsClinically healthy client-owned and non-obese cats n  12 and dogs n  12 were enrolled .

This discussion and the data generated by this current study may be relevant to guide other studies addressing the effect of products containing prebiotics offered to cats and dogs.Our study evaluated a product that together with other prebiotic formulations are currently marketed to all breeds of cats and dogs of all ages sizes and clinical conditions.
