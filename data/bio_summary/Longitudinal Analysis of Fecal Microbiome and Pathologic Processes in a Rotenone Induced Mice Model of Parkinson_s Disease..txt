16S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiome showed rotenone-treated mice exhibited fecal microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an overall decrease in bacterial diversity and a significant change of microbiota composition notably members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with an increase in FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio after 3 weeks of rotenone treatment.

Novel therapeutic options aimed at modifying the gut microbiota composition might postpone the onset and following cascade of neurodegeneration.Keywords fecal microbiota 16S rRNA gene sequencing rotenone inflammation Parkinson's diseaseINTRODUCTIONParkinson's disease PD is a neurodegenerative disorder estimated to affect more than 1 of the over-65 population.

In addition study of the gut microbiota in individuals with PD occurs primarily after disease is already manifest limiting the ability to investigate changes in the microbiota that occur early in the disease process.

Notwithstanding such information is crucial to better understand the relationship between the microbiota and the pathogenesis of PD and thus improve its prevention diagnosis and treatment.In order to examine the association between fecal microbiota and PD we characterized the succession change of fecalmicrobiota with an ideal model of PD by oral rather than systemic administration of rotenone which is more likely to recapitulate the exposure to pesticide that may occur in normal life Klingelhoefer and Reichmann 2015 from a longitudinal study.

We found fecal microbiota dysbiosis preceded the major motor dysfunction and central nervous system CNS pathology in rotenone induced PD mice model which indicated fecal microbiota perturbation might contribute to rotenone toxicity in the initiation of PD.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal ExperimentsMale C57BL6 mice aged between 8 and 9 weeks were purchased from Shanghai SiLaike SLAC Laboratory Animal Company Shanghai China.

The microbiota at 3 weeks clustered in the upper-left part of the plot 4 out of 5 mice at 4 weeks clustered in the lower left part of the plot while the fecal microbiota of before rotenone treatment and at weeks 1 and 2 clustered in the upper-right part of the ordination and could not be divided into separated clusters Figure 5C.

Given the important roles of the gut microbiota in regulating normal physiological functions environmental toxicant-induced functional perturbations of the gut microbiota may lead to or exacerbate their toxicity.

9441.doi Recent studies reported an association between gut microbiota composition and Parkinson's disease PD.

The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of fecal microbiota using an oral rotenone model of PD from a longitudinal study over a period of 4 weeks.

Moreover rotenone-induced gastrointestinal and motor dysfunctions were observed to be robustly correlated with changes in the composition of fecal microbiota.
