The abundance of denitrifier nirS genes in the post-fumigation samples H1 L1 H2 L2 was significantly P  0.05 higher than CK samples although the differences between groups were not significant P  0.05 c. The qPCR data suggested that CP fumigation caused an increase abundance of denitrifiers with nirS gene.

The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea AOA were significantly inhibited yet the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria AOB significantly increased and denitrification was significantly promoted.

The levels of statistically significance relative to the control are represented by asterisks  p  0.05  p  0.01 p  0.001.suggesting that CP fumigation caused a long-term decrease in soil microbial diversity.Effect of chloropicrin on soil bacterial community composition and shifts in predominant bacterial membersAn Unweighted Pair-group Method with Arithmetic MeanUPGMA clustering dendrogram  was used to assess the samples collected before and after CP fumigation and samples that were obtained at the same time were grouped together.

These results indicate that the 16S rRNA gene sequence database was sufficient to capture the di- versity of the bacterial communities.After fumigation with CP these diversity indices namely observed species Shannon Chao1 and ACE decreased significantly P  0.05 in the second set of samples collected after fumigation especially in H2 samples .

Microbial diversity decreased significantly after fumigation with CP in agreement with the results of previous studies  .Under the stress of the fumigation agent the inherent balance in the indigenous microbial community was altered and different predominant bacterial groups emerged.

In addition although a vacuum period   was not observed in this study the shift in predominant bacterial flora following fumigation indicated that the post- fumigation soil environment was more conducive to the coloniza- tion of new species including some probiotic species which are often used in agricultural production.The results of the current study are in agreement to previousstudies showing that CP significantly inhibits nitrification   and promotes denitrification .

the abundance of four representative denitrification genes significantly increased after fumigation with CP while the abundance of narG showed a transient decrease after fumigation.

Following fumigation with CP Acinetobacter Staph- ylococcus and Nocardioides were significantly decreased while other genera shown in were significantly increased at different time points.

The degradation of environmental pollution by microor- ganisms is also affected for example the extension of residue period of herbicides in soil after CP fumigation has been reported .
