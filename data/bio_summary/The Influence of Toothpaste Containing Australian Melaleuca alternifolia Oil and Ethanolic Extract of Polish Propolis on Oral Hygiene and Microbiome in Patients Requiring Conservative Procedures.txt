group ii the placebo group patients were classified as average hygiene on the first examination.

in total 19 of patients in the control group were described as having quite good hygiene which fell to 12 upon the third examination.a statistically significant reduction of msbi was observed after 7 and 28 days of using the toothpaste with eep and tto in the study group as compared to the value upon the initial visit t1.

conducted on a group of patients with use of a toothpaste with 3 ethanolic extract of propolis showed an improvement in api although without marked statistical significance.

tea tree oil of australian origin fulfilling the iso 47302004 requirements was used in production of the active toothpaste together with polish propolis from apiaries located in north-western poland produced by apis mellifera bees fulfilling the polish standard for propolis concentrate pn-a-77627.patientsclinical examinations were carried out between july 2015 and march 2016 in private dental clinic comfortmed katowice poland responsible for comprehensive dental care of examined patients.

improvement in the api could have been associated with the low average age of the patients 12.4 years old since younger patients with orthodontic restorations can have trouble maintaining proper oral hygiene.

this might be caused by the difference in the number of patients in the groups examined or by worse discipline among the patients.

the hygiene regimen is more comprehensive and strictly adhered to in surgical patients than in patients undergoing conservative treatment.

demonstrated significant qualitative and quantitative differences in oral microflora of patients who used the 3 eep gel for everyday oral care as compared to patients using the gel without eep.

on the first visit the mean oral hygiene in patients of the study group was classified as average oral hygiene whereas after the study the mean api value indicated the optimal hygiene condition.

the vast majority of patients in the control group had average oral hygiene and quite good oral hygiene.
