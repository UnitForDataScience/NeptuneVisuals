The vast majority of patients in the control group had average oral hygiene and quite good oral hygiene.

On the first visit the mean oral hygiene in patients of the study group was classified as average oral hygiene whereas after the study the mean API value indicated the optimal hygiene condition.

demonstrated significant qualitative and quantitative differences in oral microflora of patients who used the 3 EEP gel for everyday oral care as compared to patients using the gel without EEP.

The study group received the toothpaste with TTO and EEP while the control group received the same toothpaste but without TTO and EEP.

The number of Streptococcus mitis isolates decreased in the study group and increased by 43.75 in the control group between the first T1 and third T3 examination.

The increase in the control group was from 4 to 8.Statistically significant differences in the OHI-s value were also observed in the study group which was using the active toothpaste.
