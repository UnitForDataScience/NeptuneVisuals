Thus altricial birds have higher potential for parental influence on gut microbiota through salivary transfer and a longer period of nest occupa- tion whereas precocial parents have little direct influence on their offspring's microbiota aside from exposure to bacteria on feathers during brooding and leading young to brood-rearing areas.In addition to uncertainty about the timing of initial recruit- ment of microbiota the early successional dynamics of the avian gut microbiota are unclear.

We conclude that guts of shorebird chicks are likely void of microbiota prior to hatch but that stable gut microbiome establishes as early as 3 days of age probably from environmental inocula.Keywords 16S rRNA gene bacteria Calidris gut microbiota qPCR precocial youngINTRODUCTIONGut microbiota contribute to maintaining organismal health through nutrient uptake Leser and Molbak  detoxification of digestive byproducts Kohl  energy and fat metabolism Velagapudi et al.

We evaluated whether precocial chicks from three species of arctic-breeding shorebirds acquire gut microbiota before or after hatching and then documented the rate and compositional dynamics of accumulation of gut microbiota.

Thus maternal effects strongly control theinitial composition of gut microbiota in mammalian offspring Stevens and Hume .It remains unclear whether birds can acquire gut microbiota while inside the egg and how microbial communities accumu- late after initial recruitment.

Our objec- tives were to i test the 'head start' and 'sterile egg' hypothe- ses and determine if precocial chicks of arctic shorebirds recruit gut microbiota before or after hatching and ii assess succes- sional trajectories in the gut microbiota of shorebird chicks af- ter hatching.

An inocula- tion route via diet was supported by our ordination results which showed that the microbiota of young chicks were more similar to the environmental microbiota in community composition than old chicks.A rapid increase in the microbial abundance within the first 3 days after hatching may be enhanced by the supply of yolk to the chick gastrointestinal tract.

Mammals acquire gut microbiota during birth but timing of gut microbial recruitment in birds is unknown.

Contrary to earlier reports of microbial recruitment before hatching in chickens quantitative PCR and Illumina sequence data indicated negligible microbiota in the guts of shorebird embryos before hatching.

Environmental exposure early in life can shape the gut microbiota and aid in defending against pathogens while the immune system is immature Bar-Shira Sklan and Friedman .
