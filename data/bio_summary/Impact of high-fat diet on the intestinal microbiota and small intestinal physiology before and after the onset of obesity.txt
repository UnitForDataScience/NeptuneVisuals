in general consumption of hfd decreases the overall microbiota diversity and the abundance of bacteroidetes and ver- rucomicrobia and increases the abundance of firmicutes and pro- teobacteria e. although the mechanisms by which hfd causes these changes are poorly understood they seem to be rapid occurring within 24 h and to occur along the entire length of the intestine .in summary these studies suggest that hfd and obesity are associated at least at phylum level with similar changes in the intestinal microbiota composition.

in the next sections modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition by hfd and its impact on small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity will be discussed in detail.effect of high fat diet on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before the onset of obesity and its metabolic complicationsvery few studies have described the impact of hfd on micro- biota profile and small intestinal physiology before the onset of hfd-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications i.e.

interestingly a reduction in clostridia class was found in patients suffering from colitis  an inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by a defective mucosal barrier and increased intes- tinal permeability .effect of high fat diet on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complicationsthe majority of studies describing the impact of hfd on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology were performed after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications insulin resistance hyperglycemia systemic inflammation andor dyslipi- demia .

further research is needed in order to unravel the mechanisms by which these compounds reverse hfd effects on the microbiota and host physiology.conclusions and perspectivesmodulation of the intestinal microbiota by hfd has a major impact on both immunological and metabolic functions of the host.

additionally the study of hfd effects on the profile of small intestinal microbiota rather than in colonic microbiota and its impact on the physiology of intestinal stem cells rather than in differentiated ecs would also be important areas to explore.

taking this into consideration the aim of this contribution is to review the impact of hfd on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications.

one hypothesis is the polarized expression of prrs by intestinal ecs at either apical or basolateral membrane e.the gut microbiota is a complex microbial community inhabit- ing the gastrointestinal tract that includes 100 trillion bacteria and archaea distributed over more than 1000 species .

in fact it has been demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota has a vast positive impact on host intestinal physiology by 1 stimulating innate im- mune response  2 inducing proliferation and renewal of in- testinal ecs  3 preventing the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms  4 metabolizing non-digestible carbohy- drates leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate which can be used as an energy source by the host 5 synthesizing vitamins  and 6 metabolizing xenobiotics .

the human intestinal microbiota is dominated by two bacterial phyla firmicutes 60e80 and bacteroidetes 20e40 .

small proportions  1 of other bacterial phyla are also present including actinobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia and one archaea phylum euryarchaeota e. although there is considerable similarity between both human and rodent intestinal microbiota at the phylum level at lower taxonomic ranks there are significant differences e.g.

for this reason both diversity and abun- dance of microbiota is different along the length of the intestine and even along the length of the crypt-villus unit going from 103 bacteriag in the duodenum to 104 bacteriag in the jejunum to 107 bacteriag in the ileum and to 1012 bacteriag in the colon .

human and animal studies have shown that both hfd and obesity are associated with changes in intestinal microbiota and that this community has a major impact on both immunological and metabolic functions of the host e. hfd have been reported to reduce the levels of gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria and to increase lps concen- trations in colonic epithelia.
