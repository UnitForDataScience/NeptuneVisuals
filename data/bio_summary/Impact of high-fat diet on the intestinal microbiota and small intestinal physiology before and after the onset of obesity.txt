an increase in permeability a decrease in mucus layer thickness and an increase in pro-inflammatory cyto- kines secretion with subsequent development of systemic inflammation obesity insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes e. Since the effect of HFD on intestinal microbiota and their impact on the colon physiology have already been well described we aimed to review the current knowledge about HFD-induced changes on microbiota profile before and after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications and how this impacts small intestinal physiology where both digestion and absorption of fats occur .Changes in intestinal microbiota associated with HFD and obesityStudies in mice and humans have shown that obesity is asso- ciated with changes in microbiota's diversity and abundance obesity-associated dysbiosis at intestinal level reviewed by Refs.

In general consumption of HFD decreases the overall microbiota diversity and the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Ver- rucomicrobia and increases the abundance of Firmicutes and Pro- teobacteria e. Although the mechanisms by which HFD causes these changes are poorly understood they seem to be rapid occurring within 24 h and to occur along the entire length of the intestine .In summary these studies suggest that HFD and obesity are associated at least at phylum level with similar changes in the intestinal microbiota composition.

In the next sections modulation of the intestinal microbiota composition by HFD and its impact on small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity will be discussed in detail.Effect of high fat diet on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before the onset of obesity and its metabolic complicationsVery few studies have described the impact of HFD on micro- biota profile and small intestinal physiology before the onset of HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic complications i.e.

Interestingly a reduction in Clostridia class was found in patients suffering from colitis  an inflammatory bowel diseases characterized by a defective mucosal barrier and increased intes- tinal permeability .Effect of high fat diet on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complicationsThe majority of studies describing the impact of HFD on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology were performed after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications insulin resistance hyperglycemia systemic inflammation andor dyslipi- demia .

Further research is needed in order to unravel the mechanisms by which these compounds reverse HFD effects on the microbiota and host physiology.Conclusions and perspectivesModulation of the intestinal microbiota by HFD has a major impact on both immunological and metabolic functions of the host.

Additionally the study of HFD effects on the profile of small intestinal microbiota rather than in colonic microbiota and its impact on the physiology of intestinal stem cells rather than in differentiated ECs would also be important areas to explore.

Taking this into consideration the aim of this contribution is to review the impact of HFD on microbiota profile and small intestinal physiology before and after the onset of obesity and its metabolic complications.

One hypothesis is the polarized expression of PRRs by intestinal ECs at either apical or basolateral membrane e.The gut microbiota is a complex microbial community inhabit- ing the gastrointestinal tract that includes 100 trillion bacteria and archaea distributed over more than 1000 species .
