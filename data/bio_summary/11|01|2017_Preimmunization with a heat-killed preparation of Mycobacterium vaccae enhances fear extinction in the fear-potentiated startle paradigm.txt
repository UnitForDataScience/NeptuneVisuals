Post hoc pairwise com- parisons revealed increased slc6a4 mRNA expression in rats exposed to FPS among vehicle-treated rats in the rMnR at7.496 mm and in the MnRv at 7.664 mm from bregma G H. Among M. vaccae-immunized rats FPS increased slc6a4 mRNA expression in the MnRv H.There were no effects of FPS M. vaccae or interactions in other subregions of the DR MnR PMRF or B9.Slc22a3 mRNA expressionAnalysis of slc22a3 mRNA expression using linear mixed model analysis revealed an M. vaccae x FPS interaction F1427.5  4.4 p  0.05 as well as FPS x raphe subregion F1291.0  2.4 p  0.05 FPS x rostrocaudal level within subregion F76356.7  2.0 p  0.01 and M. vaccae x rostrocaudal level within subregion interactions F76356.7  2.0 p  0.01  Table S4.

Thus in the current study we found results supporting the idea that slc6a4 mRNA expression increases in a stress-sensitive manner .One of the most profound changes found in this study was the decrease in slc22a3 mRNA expression within the DRD and DRV fol- lowing FPS exposure in M. vaccae-immunized rats relative to either M. vaccae-immunized home cage control rats or vehicle- treated rats exposed to FPS.

Specifically among rats exposed to FPS slc22a3 mRNA expres- sion was lower in M. vaccae-immunized rats compared to vehicle- treated rats throughout the DRD and DRV subregions associated with anxiety and fear responses that innervate the basolateral amygdala  .

Home cage controls were also studied in order to determine the effects of M. vaccae immunization on serotonin-related gene expression in the brain in rats with or with- out exposure to the FPS paradigm.Materials and methodsAnimalsAdult male Sprague Dawleyr rats Strain code 400 CrlSD Charles River Wilmington MA USA weighing 72-111 g 27- 32 days old upon arrival were pair-housed in standard polycar- bonate rat cages 26 cm width 47.6 cm length 20.3 cm height Alternative Design Siloam Springs AR USA containing an approx- imately 2.5 cm-deep layer of bedding Cat.

One-half of the rats were assigned to the FPS protocol A whereas the remaining rats were assigned to a home cage control condition B.

Among M. vaccae-immunized rats those exposed to FPS had decreased htr1a mRNA expression levels compared to home cage controls within the rostral part of the DRD whereas more caudally in the DRD this effect was reversed with increased htr1a mRNA expression levels in rats exposed to FPS compared to home cage controls.

Similar effects of M. vaccae increasing htr1a mRNA expression among rats exposed to FPS were observed within the DRC M. vaccae main effect F142.9  4.4 p  0.05 E Table S2 PMRF M. vaccae main effect F137.6  5.0 p  0.05 F Table S2 and rMnR M. vaccae x FPS x rostrocau- dal level interaction F333.0  4.3 p  0.05 G Table S2.An M. vaccae x rostrocaudal level interaction was identified within the DRI F456.5  2.7 p  0.05 D Table S2 specifi- cally among rats exposed to FPS M. vaccae decreased htr1a mRNA expression but only at 8.672 mm from bregma.Finally linear mixed model analysis revealed an overall FPS effect within the B9 subregion F141.0  5.0 p  0.05 K Table S2.

vaccae-immunized rats FPS decreased slc22a3 mRNA expression at multiple rostrocaudal levels.There were no effects of FPS M. vaccae or interactions in other subregions of the DR MnR or in the PMRF.DiscussionImmunization of adult male rats with a heat-killed preparation of the immunoregulatory bacterium M. vaccae enhanced between-session fear extinction in the FPS model.

This finding is somewhat surprising given that M. vaccae immu- nized rats showed reduced fear expression by the end of each extinction session C. It would be expected that at the start of the subsequent session of fear extinction that the percent FPS would be lower than the previous day   but instead M. vaccae immunized rats showed large recov- eries of percent FPS.
