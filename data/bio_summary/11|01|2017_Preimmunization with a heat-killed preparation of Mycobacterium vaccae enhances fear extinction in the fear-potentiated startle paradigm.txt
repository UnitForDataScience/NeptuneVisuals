post hoc pairwise com- parisons revealed increased slc6a4 mrna expression in rats exposed to fps among vehicle-treated rats in the rmnr at7.496 mm and in the mnrv at 7.664 mm from bregma g h. among m. vaccae-immunized rats fps increased slc6a4 mrna expression in the mnrv h.there were no effects of fps m. vaccae or interactions in other subregions of the dr mnr pmrf or b9.slc22a3 mrna expressionanalysis of slc22a3 mrna expression using linear mixed model analysis revealed an m. vaccae x fps interaction f1427.5  4.4 p  0.05 as well as fps x raphe subregion f1291.0  2.4 p  0.05 fps x rostrocaudal level within subregion f76356.7  2.0 p  0.01 and m. vaccae x rostrocaudal level within subregion interactions f76356.7  2.0 p  0.01  table s4.

thus in the current study we found results supporting the idea that slc6a4 mrna expression increases in a stress-sensitive manner .one of the most profound changes found in this study was the decrease in slc22a3 mrna expression within the drd and drv fol- lowing fps exposure in m. vaccae-immunized rats relative to either m. vaccae-immunized home cage control rats or vehicle- treated rats exposed to fps.

specifically among rats exposed to fps slc22a3 mrna expres- sion was lower in m. vaccae-immunized rats compared to vehicle- treated rats throughout the drd and drv subregions associated with anxiety and fear responses that innervate the basolateral amygdala  .

rats were tested on days 1 and 2 for baseline acoustic startle received fear conditioning on days 3 and 4 and underwent fear extinction training on days 5-10. rats were euthanized on day 11 and brain tissue was sectioned for analysis of mrna expres- sion for genes important in control of brain serotonergic signaling including tph2 htr1a slc6a4 and slc22a3 throughout the brainstem dorsal and median raphe nuclei.

home cage controls were also studied in order to determine the effects of m. vaccae immunization on serotonin-related gene expression in the brain in rats with or with- out exposure to the fps paradigm.materials and methodsanimalsadult male sprague dawleyr rats strain code 400 crlsd charles river wilmington ma usa weighing 72-111 g 27- 32 days old upon arrival were pair-housed in standard polycar- bonate rat cages 26 cm width 47.6 cm length 20.3 cm height alternative design siloam springs ar usa containing an approx- imately 2.5 cm-deep layer of bedding cat.

among m. vaccae-immunized rats those exposed to fps had decreased htr1a mrna expression levels compared to home cage controls within the rostral part of the drd whereas more caudally in the drd this effect was reversed with increased htr1a mrna expression levels in rats exposed to fps compared to home cage controls.
