For the purpose of this study sociodemographic health and physical activity question- naires as well as food frequency questionnaire were78M E T A B O L I S M C L I N I C A L A N D E X P E R I M E N T A L 6 9  2 0 1 7  7 6 - 8 6 considered.

Further inflam- matory markers whose p-value was lower than 0.20 in univariate analysis were added one-to-one to the regression models and were interpreted as explanatory variable.Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Pack- age for the Social Sciences SPSS version 23 IBM Armonk NY and R for microbiota analyses.M E T A B O L I S M C L I N I C A L A N D E X P E R I M E N T A L 6 9  2 0 1 7  7 6 - 8 679ResultsThe sample was composed of 90.7 of women with a mean age of 24.9 - 5.8 years and mean BMI of 23.6 - 4.7 kgm2.

As a matter of fact several studies have reported that 25OHD plays a significant role in the immune system relating higher serum levels as well as higher consumption with lower low-M E T A B O L I S M C L I N I C A L A N D E X P E R I M E N T A L 6 9  2 0 1 7  7 6 - 8 683grade inflammation .

Both genera have been related to adequate BMI and glucose homeostasis as well as84M E T A B O L I S M C L I N I C A L A N D E X P E R I M E N T A L 6 9  2 0 1 7  7 6 - 8 6 butyrate production and anti-inflammatory actions .

A high-quality data collection should support these associations.Facing the importance of the intestinal immune system to respond to microbial stimuli and the immune modulatory role of vitamin D we hypothesized that vitamin D status is associated with gut microbiota via low-grade inflammation.
