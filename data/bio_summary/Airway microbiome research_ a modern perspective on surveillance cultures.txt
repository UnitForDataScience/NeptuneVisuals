Alterations in the pulmonary microbiome and increased microbial loads might also be a cause for dysbiosis induced VAP pneumonia developing by selective pressure on the existing microbiome towards the selection of aAnnals of Translational Medicine Vol 5 No 22 November 2017Page 5 of 7single bacterial species that continues to cause pneumonia but there is currently no evidence for this statement in ventilated patients.Implications for preventionPrevention of VAP mainly focuses on the prevention of immigration of bacteria into the lung.

We conclude that there is still a strong need for more in-depth analyses of the changes in the microbial composition of the pulmonary microbiome during mechanical ventilation and with the development of VAP.Keywords Ventilator-associated pneumonia VAP microbiome preventionSubmitted Jul 10 2017.

However in patients who developed VAP Pseudomonadales including Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species increased to a greater extent than in patients that did not develop VAP.

Accepted for publication Jul 21 2017. doi 10.21037atm.2017.08.05View this article at Ventilator-associated pneumonia VAPThe incidence of VAP is estimated to be around 10 in a high risk population of critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h 1.

The optimal strategy to decrease the impact of VAP is three-folded I prevent when possible II early and targeted treatment when pneumonia develops and III withholding antibiotics from those patients that develop symptoms but are not infected.Over the last decade major improvements have been made in the prevention of VAP with great cost-effectiveness 4.

This was irrespective of the development of colonization in the control group which suggests that an increase in opportunistic bacteria such as Pseudomonas is associated with VAP even if another pathogen is causing the pneumonia 19.Elimination is also hampered in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients.

Indeed one study comparing patients that developed VAT to those that developed VAP found that the complement response was severely hampered in thosepatients progressing to pneumonia 22.

Longitudinal studies with daily cultures of endotracheal aspirates suggest that in the majority of the patients the trachea is colonized with causative pathogen at least 1-2 days before pneumonia develops 3839.

Intubated patients developing tracheobronchitis or pneumonia have distinctive complement system gene expression signatures in the pre-infection period A pilot study.

Positive-end expiratory pressure reduces incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in nonhypoxemic patients.
