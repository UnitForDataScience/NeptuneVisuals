Notably 7 of the RF-selected features showedadditional significant associations with BMI including the posi- tively related PS 381 at mz 800.5850 ESI RT  5.20 min and negatively associated LysoPC 181 at mz 506.3249 ESI- RT  1.39 min TG 629 at mz 967.8174 ESI RT  7.97 min andLysoPC 182 at mz 504.3093 ESI- RT  1.12 min Fig.

Only 7.36 of the features differed significantly between T2D patients and prediabetic individuals representing 58 features present in higher abundance and 59 features present in lower abundance in T2D patients compared with prediabetic individuals 42.79 98229 of the lipid features detected at higher levels in T2D patients than in NGT individuals overlapped with metabolites detected at higher levels in predia- betic than in NGT individuals.

A P-value of less than 0.05 was regarded as significant.Additional filesAdditional file 1 phenotypic and clinical information for 293 en- rolled subjects.Additional file 2 batch numbers and run orders for biological samples and quality controls.Additional file 3 detailed list of total detected plasma fea- tures.Additional file 4 principal component analysis of plasma lipid profiling from biological samples and quality controls.

For instance the ions atmz 496.35 RT  1.31 min mz 524.38 RT  1.81 min and mz758.58 RT  6.30 min may be suggested as lysophosphatidyl- choline 160H lysophosphatidylcholine 180H and lysophosphatidylcholine 160182H respectively  the ions at mz 780.56 RT  5.15 min and mz 782.57 RT  5.33 min as lysophosphatidylcholine 365H and lysophosphatidyl- choline 341Na and ions at mz 369.35 RT  8.47 min as cholesterol-H2OH a cholestadiene cation generated from cholesteryl esters .

By comparing mass spectra of precursor ions using Progenesis QI 2.0 2 RF-selected negative features namely mz 508.3404 RT  1.7 min and mz 508.3406 RT  1.83 min with different retention times but al- most identical mz values were both annotated as LysoPC 180.

Increased D-3- hydroxybutyric acid level has also been suggested as an early biomarker of insulin resistance which may be linked to mito- chondrial dysfunction and the resultant oxidative stress .Both T2D and prediabetes displayed relatively higher con- centrations of several short- and long-chain AcylCNs such as L-acetylcarnitine C2 at mz 203.1160n ESI RT  0.57 min P  6.66E-04 FDR  0.066 tetradecanoylcarnitine C14 at mz372.3115 ESI RT  0.99 min P  1.46E-03 FDR  0.094 2-hydroxyhexadecanoylcarnitine C16OH at mz 416.3371 ESI RT  1.02 min P  1.60E-04 FDR  0.044 and 12-hydroxy-12-octadecanoylcarnitine C18OH at mz 444.3667 ESI RT 1.38 min P  5.70E-04 FDR  0.066 KW test Additional file 6.

It has been reported that LysoPC species could enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion via G-protein-coupled receptor G119 both in vivo and in vitro .Comparing NGT and prediabetic individuals we observed a strongly significant reduction of lysophosphatidylcholine species in the Chinese T2D patients including lysophosphatidyl- choline 180 at mz 508.3406 ESI- RT  1.83 min P  3.01E- 7 FDR  5.55E-05 and mz 508.3404 ESI- RT  1.7 min P 2.93E-05 FDR  1.88E-03 lysophosphatidylcholine 181 at mz506.3249 ESI- RT  1.39 min P  7.95E-06 FDR  6.67E-04and lysophosphatidylcholine 182 at mz 504.3093 ESI- RT 1.12 min P  6.28E-06 FDR  3.41E-03 which were selected by the T2D prediction model KW test Additional file 6.
