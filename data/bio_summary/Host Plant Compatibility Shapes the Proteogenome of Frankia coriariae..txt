Among the proteins specifically detected using the Dg1 database and thus wrongly annotated in the BMG5.1 database Supplementary Tables S1 S2 we noted the presence of high abundance proteins three transcriptional regulators KLL11059.1 WP013874517.1 KLL10836.1 and severalhypothetical proteins WP043603927.1 WP050803503.1 WP050803326.1 WP050803366.1 WP013875127.1.Remarkably the DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta WP013875121.1 and ATP-dependent Clp protease ATP- binding protein WP013875507.1 sequences were well covered with our proteogenomic approach based on the use of the Dg1 closely related genome information with 60 and 36 different peptides respectively.

Peptidoglycan-binding lysin domain-containing protein WP013872588.1 may contain beside the truly secreted proteins outer-membrane proteins lipoproteins or proteins bound to the cell wall in a non-covalent manner Buist et al.

Volumes of 20 ul of either cellular proteomes corresponding to 60 ug of total proteins or exoproteome corresponding to a few ug of secreted proteins were loaded per well.

Table 1 summarizes the proteomic data predicted from genome sequences and experimentally determined in this study.Next-Generation Proteomics of the BMG5.1 Strain Grown in BD-N MediumThe most abundant proteins of the BMG5.1 cellular proteome comprise housekeeping proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism nitrogen fixation and assimilation and DNA replication repair transcription and translation Figure 1.

Proteins that were detected in the exoproteome but not in the cellular proteome n  28 were further analyzed for aromatic amino acid counts which were found to be lower than for the proteins that were shared with cell proteins.Next-Generation Proteomics of the BMG5.1 Strain Grown in the Presence of Root ExudatesStrain BMG5.1 grows better in the presence of C. myrtifolia RE than in BD-N medium followed by A. glutinosa then C. melo RE as shown by total cellular protein yield and cell respiration IRA assays the two reliable indicators of biomass production and metabolic activities Figure 4.To check potential interference of plant proteins derived from RE we first interpreted MSMS spectra for the identification of peptides derived from C. melo RE in comparison with the exoproteome of BMG5.1 grown in C. melo RE.

The overall unique and shared proteins of the cellular proteome and exoproteome expressed under different rootexudates and BD-N are illustrated in a Venn diagram inFigure 5.Compared with the BMG5.1 proteome in BD-N medium 83 unique proteins were induced for the BMG5.1 proteome in the presence of C. myrtifolia RE Table 2.

2008.Modulated Proteins Matching the Early Step Receptive Reply toward Symbiotic RecruitmentWe identified in the category of proteins suspected to be symbiotically related 21 and 11 proteins with assigned and unassigned biochemical features respectively.
