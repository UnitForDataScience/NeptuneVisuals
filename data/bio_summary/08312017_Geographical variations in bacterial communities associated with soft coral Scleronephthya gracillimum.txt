The Shannon's index values for samples from the two locations in Japan were higher than those for the samples from Korea and Taiwan .A total of 102 bacterial OTUs were obtained from S. gracillimum.

The S. gracillimum-associated bacterial composition is shown by site TWG Green Island Taiwan TWK Kenting Taiwan KRM Moonsum Korea KRS Sungsan Korea JPK Kochi Japan and JPW Wakayama Japan.Based on the nMDS result and  S. gracillimum-associated bacterial communi- ties differed geographically.

The S. gracillimum associated bacterial composition were denoted as TWG Green Island Taiwan TWK Kent- ing Taiwan KRM Moonsum Korea KRS Sungsan Korea JPK Kochi Japan and JPW Wakayama Japan.DOCXS2 Fig.

The colours and associations of OTUs with countries are as follows green for Taiwan and Japan purple for Japan and Korea and black for Korea Japan and Taiwan.

However the communities in samples from locations where the latitude was  1 clustered together namely the two samples from Korea were most similar to each other similarity 70.8 the two samples from Taiwan clustered together similarity 33.3 and the two samples from Japan had 13.2 similarity.

Endozoicimonaceae was the dominant group in corals from Korea and Japan whereas Mycoplasma was dominant in corals from Taiwan corals.

Bacterial communities tended to be grouped by site Korea Japan and Taiwan but communities in Korean samples grouped more closely to samples from Japan than to those from Taiwan.

Samples were not collected from national parks or natural reserves in Japan thus no specific permission was required for sam- pling this species in Japan and the sampling in Korea was under the permission of Korean Coral Resources Bank KCRB by the Ministry of Land Transport and Maritime Affairs Korea.
