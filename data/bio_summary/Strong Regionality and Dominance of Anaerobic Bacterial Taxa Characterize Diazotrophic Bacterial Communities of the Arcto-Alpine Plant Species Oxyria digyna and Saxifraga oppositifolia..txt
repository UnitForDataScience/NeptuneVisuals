Further we hypothesized that like the total bacterial communities the PNFB communities are host plant specific and additionally shaped by climatic regions.MATERIALS AND METHODSSampling and DNA IsolationThe plant and DNA samples used to characterize total bacterial communities Kumar et al.

Several of these OPUs were important determinants in shaping the local host plant specific communities Supplemental Table S1.DISCUSSIONUsing the nifH gene as a proxy we analyzed the diversity and community composition of PNFB in two pioneer plantnested PCR approach with primers 19fnifH3 1st round Yeager et al.

The phylogenetic composition of the PNFB in our data set differs from those reported for high-organic-matter tundra soils from Arctic or alpine sites in which aerobic proteobacterial diazotrophs dominated Deslippe and Egger 2006 Tai et al.

Further key PNFB taxa in our study including G. uraniireducens Rf4 G. lovleyi SZ and Optitutaceae bacterium TAV2 were recently found to be significantly enriched in communities below the water table in thawing permafrost soils in the Canadian Arctic Penton et al.

Evidence for the presence of PNFB Geobacter types has alsobeen found in nifH defined communities from switchgrass roots in oxic temperate-climate prairie ecosystems Bahulikar et al.

The difference between PNFB communities of the two plant species was smaller than the previously reported effect on total bacterial community structures Kumar et al.

In the further text we use these partial sequences to characterize the populations of PNFB.The Species Richness and Diversity of PNFB Communities Is Lowest in the High ArcticThe species richness SR and Shannon diversity values SD of the PNFB communities based on the nifH gene amplicon OPUs as a proxy were highest in the bulk soils followed by the rhizosphere soils and the endosphere samples.

In the plant-associated compartments rhizo- and endospheres the values of both parameters were highest in the KJ in both plant-associated compartments but the differences between KJ and other regions were significant only in the rhizosphere communities P  0.05 Figure 3.Community Structures of PNFB Are Driven by Compartment and RegionThe community structures of the PNFB were analyzed at the OPU level across all samples.

The plant-associated KJ communities were more similar to both the NA and MA communities than the latter two to each other while the opposite was true for the bulk soil communities Table 1.Different Bacteria Dominate the PNFB Communities in Different Regions and CompartmentsWe next investigated the taxonomic composition of the PNFB communities across the different compartments and regions.

However we detected small but significant impacts of host plant species on the endosphere PNFBTABLE 1  Impact of different factors on PNFB community structures.PERMANOVA3.0815 0.001The PERMANOVA is based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrixes of square-root transformed relative abundances of PNFB OPUs.
