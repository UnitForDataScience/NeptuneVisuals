therefore sequencing of the 16s rrna gene was performed by the mean of the fd1-rp2 primers as previously described eurogentec seraing belgium using a 3130-xl sequencer applied biosciences saint aubin france .strain marseille-p3241 exhibited an 87.7 sequence identity with gordonibacter pamelaeae the phylogenetically closest published species with standing in nomenclature .

having a 16s rrna gene sequence similarity 5 with the phyloge- netically closest species with standing in nomenclature we propose the creation of the new genus  phoenicibacter phoe.ni.ci.bac0ter n.l.

marseille-p3241t is the type strain of the new species 'phoenicibacter massiliensis' gen. nov. sp.

before the study began approval was obtained by the ethics committee of the institut federatif de recherche ifr48 marseille france under number 09-022.one millilitre of phosphate-buffered saline was used to dilute stool samples before inoculation in blood culture media sup- plemented with 5 ml filtered rumen and 5 ml sheep's blood.

sequence alignment was performed by clustalw and phylogenetic inferences were generated by mega software with maximum-likelihood approach.

after 10 days of growth strain marseille-p3241 was iso- lated on 5 blood-enriched columbia agar biomerieux marcy l'etoile france.
