'Phoenicibacter massiliensis' gen. nov. sp.

Marseille-P3241T is the type strain of the new species 'Phoenicibacter massiliensis' gen. nov. sp.

nov. mas.il.i.en0sis L. gen. masc.

nov. a new bacterium isolated from the human gut of a pygmy womanM.

After 10 days of growth strain Marseille-P3241 was iso- lated on 5 blood-enriched Columbia agar bioMerieux Marcy l'Etoile France.

Strain Marseille-P3241 cells are coc- cobacillus Gram positive and catalase and oxidase negative with an average diameter of 2.9 mm.

Therefore sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed by the mean of the fD1-rP2 primers as previously described Eurogentec Seraing Belgium using a 3130-XL sequencer Applied Biosciences Saint Aubin France .Strain Marseille-P3241 exhibited an 87.7 sequence identity with Gordonibacter pamelaeae the phylogenetically closest published species with standing in nomenclature .
