Occupancy generally in- creased in more southeastern wetlands and snail intermediate host community composition had strong effects on most symbiont taxa.We have used sophisticated but accessible statistical methods to reveal that spatial components--which influence colonization--and host community composition-- which mediates transmission--both drive symbiont community composition in this system.

Environmental drivers of species turnoverBased on WAIC model selection the spatial and host community com- position components consistently influenced symbiont taxa occurrence and consequently overall community composition whereas the mod- els with habitat filtering showed little support Table 3.

Thus the model is able to generate bias-corrected species-specific estimates of covariate effects by account- ing for detection error.In particular we are interested in using the model to identify envi- ronmental gradients that strongly affect spatial turnover in the symbi- ont community.

the models with combinations of spatial andor host components outperformed the null model and the model with spatial components was marginally better than the null for Alaria spp.TABLE 4 Covariate effects estimated by the full model SpatHabHost.

Understanding the drivers of symbiont community pat- terns has implications ranging from emerging infectious disease to managing host microbiomes.Using symbiont communities from amphibian hosts sampled from wetlands of California USA we quantified the effects of spatial structure habitat filtering and host community components on symbiont occupancy and overall metacommunity structure.We built upon a statistical method to describe metacommunity structure that ac- counts for imperfect detection in survey data--detection error-corrected elements of metacommunity structure--by adding an analysis to identify covariates of com- munity turnover.

These methods allow us to associate broad patterns of community turno- ver to local species-level effects ultimately improving our understanding of spatial community dynamics.KEYWORDS amphibians Bayesian inference disease ecology metacommunity occupancy modelling parasites symbionts trematodes354  c 2017 The Authors.

Thus understanding the environmental driv- ers of symbiont community composition is an important goal and one for which the field of community ecology has much to offer Johnson et al.

Thus we amalgamate the within-host symbiont community of each sampled frog to a local wetland-level symbiont community.

Thus snail richness and the identity of snail host species within a wetland both play important roles for explaining symbiont community composition.The composition of alternative amphibian hosts had a smaller im- pact on symbiont community composition compared to snail compo- sition.
