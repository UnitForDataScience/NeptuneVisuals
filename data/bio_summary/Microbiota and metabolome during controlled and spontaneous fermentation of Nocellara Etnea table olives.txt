in addition results demonstrated that the use of bacterial cultures except the bc1 singly or in different combinations clearly influenced the fermentation process reducing the final ph value below 4.50. when microbiota was investigated through sequencing analysis data revealed the presence of halophilic bacteria and among lactobacilli the dominance of lactobacillus plantarum group at the initial stage of fermentation in all brine samples except in the bc5 in which dominated lactobacillus casei group.

yeast population showed an initial level of 4.07 log cfu ml-1 which drastically decreased after 7 days of fermentation and lightly shifted during the fermentation with the exception of the c samples.

nevertheless especially at indus- trial scale it is difficult to monitor the fermentation process and the use of starter cultures is strongly recommended both for inhibiting the growthsurvival of the undesirable microorganisms by accel- erating the process and for improving texture and flavour of the final products  .in the present work microbial composition of olives belonging to nocellara etnea cultivar processed at industrial-scale under spontaneous and controlled fermentation was studied using con- ventional and culture-independent approaches.

at the end of the fermentation among alcohols ethanol was the main com- pound detected probably due to the activity of yeasts which were found at highest cell densities after 90 days of fermentation with mean value of 6.56 log cfu ml-1 in accordance to previous results reported by and in discordance to re- sults reported by  which revealed high level of homoguaiacol 2-butanol 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylphenol in the nocellara del belice table olives.

forthis reason this volatile organic compound could be attributed to yeasts metabolism in accordance to  since at the middle stage of fermentation yeasts reached high level.conclusionthis was a study on spontaneous and inoculated brine fermentation of nocellara etnea table olives performed at industrial scale.

six different combination of bacterial cultures bc1-bc6 were used as starters for table olive fermentation and one additional process conducted without addition of any starters was used as control c. the processes were con- ducted in triplicate and overall 21 vessels were performed at industrial scale.

the fermentation was monitored for 120 days through culture-dependent and eindependent approaches.

at 60 and 120 days of fermentation an overturned bacterial ecology and an increase of biodiversity was observed in all samples with the occurrence of lactobacillus paracollinoides lactobacillus acidipiscis and pediococcus parvulus.

although the vocs amounts were sample-specific overall aldehydes were mostly produced at the beginning of the fermentation while acids alcohols and esters at the end of the process.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductiontable olives are one of the most produced fermented vegetables in the mediterranean countries.

thus the fermentation is the only procedure applied for table olives pres- ervation.

in order to limit the growthsurvival of these microorganisms the use of starter cultures for table olives fermentation is strongly recommended  .

up to now the application of starter cultures in table olive fermentation at industrial level is still limited.
