The first reported use of FMT in modern medical literature was in 1958 to treat a case of pseudomembranous colitis.1 This unusual therapy remained a medi- cal curiosity until the 2000s when the emergence of epidemic strains of Clostridium difficile and major advances in microbial sequencing resurrected FMT as a novel approach to treat recurrent C difficile infection CDI.2 In this setting FMT is a safe efficacious and cost- effective alternative to continuous or recurrent courses of antibiot- ics.2 At a mechanistic level the introduction of donor fecal material increases the diversity of the microbiome and alters the metabolicpathways active in the intestinal flora.3 Although FMT was initially used to treat recurrent or refractory CDI it has recently been evaluated in case series and randomized controlled trials in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease IBD without CDI.4-7Impact of Clostridium difficile Infection on Patients With Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCDI is a significant complicating factor in patients with IBD who undergo clinical relapse between 5 and 20 of patients with flare-ups are noted to be positive for the CDI toxin or gene.8 Risk factors for CDI in hospitalized IBD patients include a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis recent antibiotic use proton pump inhibitor use and low albumin levels 3 gdL.9 In addition patients taking immunomodulators have a higher rate of CDI than those not taking immunomodulators 74 vs 56 P.02 although a study in patients with ileal pouches did not confirm this association.10Patients with IBD and CDI appear to fare worse than their non-IBD counterparts.11-13 In IBD patients hospital- ized for infection-related complications CDI was found to be associated with excess inpatient mortality odds ratio 3.2 95 CI 2.6-4.0.13 Odds of colectomy in IBD patients with CDI particularly those with ulcerative coli- tis and CDI compared with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease alone increased significantly between the years 1998 and 2007.11 Similar to non-IBD patients those with IBD have a high risk of recurrent CDI nearly 60 of patients with IBD and CDI have recurrent CDI after initial therapy which is higher than the typical recurrence risk of 15 to 30 in non-IBD patients.9 A single-center pediatric cohort reported the rate of CDI recurrence in patients with IBD to be 34 vs 8 in non-IBD con- trols.

The first published randomized trial of FMT via nasoduodenal infusion demonstrated sig- nificantly higher rates of resolution of CDI-related diar- rhea 81 vs 31 P.008 and a significant increase in microbial diversity after FMT.20 A more recent random- ized controlled trial in the United States reported similar rates of resolution of recurrent CDI in patients with recent infection.21 A case series has repeated these results with primary and secondary cure rates of 80 to 90 and with no serious adverse events in the short term.22 It appears that the mode of administration of FMT has little impact on its overall efficacy oral FMT capsules FMT enemas and FMT duodenal infusions all produce success rates in the 70 to 90 range.23 It should be noted that the endpoint was usually improvement in diarrhea which is less rigorous of an endpoint than test- ing negative for C difficile by polymerase chain reaction and resolution of diarrhea.Although none of the randomized controlled trials were aimed at patients with IBD a number of groups has published results on CDI which include some patients with IBD Table.

The American College of Gastroenterology ACG guidelines suggest a test-and-treat strategy for all hospitalized patients with IBD in a flare.15 Metronidazole therapy is usually suffi- cient for non-IBD patients with mild to moderate CDI but the relatively high rates of treatment failure 22 and early recurrence 28 limit its value in patients with active IBD.16 Most patients with IBD have sufficient clini- cal features to be categorized as moderate to severe CDI warranting vancomycin therapy for initial infection and prolonged vancomycin pulsed-taper or fidaxomicin Difi- cid Merck for recurrent infections.1718 A conditionalrecommendation in the ACG practice guidelines supports the ongoing use of immunosuppression in CDI but sug- gests holding dose escalation or addition of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy until treatment for CDI has been ongoing for up to 72 hours although this recommenda- tion was not based on high-quality evidence.15Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Patients With Clostridium difficile InfectionGiven the high rates of CDI recurrence FMT fills an important role in the treatment algorithm of CDI.

Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation inClostridium difficile Infection With and Without IBDIBD inflammatory bowel disease.immunosuppression therapy although 26 of patients with IBD had a clinically significant flare of IBD after FMT.Potential for Fecal Microbiota Transplantation as a Primary Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseGiven the overlap of dysbiosis between CDI and IBD recent research has examined whether the composition of microbial communities could be adjusted with therapeu- tic intent in patients with IBD.Evidence of a Role for the Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease PathogenesisIt is understood from most animal models of IBD that the presence of intestinal bacteria is required for inflam- mation to occur regardless of which innate or adaptive defects exist in the host immune system.27 Not only are commensal bacteria crucial to the development of IBD but changes in the ecology of the colon may result in what has been termed a colitogenic flora which might adversely influence the host immune system.2829 While no specific pathogens have been identified to cause human IBD clear associations with the intestinal microbiome have been noted.3031 Reduced diversity of bacterial phyla including Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes has been noted in these studies although it is unclear if this is a cause or effect of IBD.

A similar high rate of cure 90 was reported in a cohort of 10 pediatric patients who received FMT via nasointestinal tube for recurrent CDI.25 Khoruts and colleagues recently reported that a single colono- scopic FMT cleared CDI from 74 of patients with IBD and 92 of patients without IBD P.0018.26 Patients had similar responses to FMT regardless ofTable.

Although the cure rate for CDI may be lower in IBD populations than in non-IBD populations the impact of CDI on the course of IBD warrants FMT intervention.

The first series was in children and reported a transient improvement in colitis symptoms after FMT enema.34 Later reports of the use of FMT in adults with active ulcerative colitis yielded mostly no or minimal effects in treating active disease.3536 Subsequently 2 randomized controlled trials of FMT in patients with active ulcerative colitis were published in 2015.45 Rossen and colleagues studied 50 patients in a double-blinded randomized trial of FMT via nasoduodenal tube.5 There was no significant difference in the probability of clini- cal remission between patients who received donor stool or autologous stool 30 vs 20 P.5.

A fur- ther update to the FDA draft guidance specifically stated that the use of a stool bank for FMT would require an IND application.39 All other uses of FMT including as primary therapy for IBD continue to require investiga- tors to submit an IND application.ConclusionFMT is a safe and effective option in the short term to prevent recurrent CDIs in patients with IBD and will likely remain an important tool in the future.

The rationale for FMT in this setting is based upon both the microbial disruption noted after antibiotic exposure and colonization by toxin-producing C difficile.19 FMT is assumed to initially enhance microbial diversity and diminish the ecologic niche that C difficile occupies in patients with CDI.

The largest cohort by Kelly and colleagues described outcomes in 36 patients with IBD including patients on corticosteroids immuno- modulators anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and anti-integrins.24 The overall cure rate in IBD patients was 94 with an 86 cure rate after a single FMT.
