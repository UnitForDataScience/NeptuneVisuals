the first reported use of fmt in modern medical literature was in 1958 to treat a case of pseudomembranous colitis.1 this unusual therapy remained a medi- cal curiosity until the 2000s when the emergence of epidemic strains of clostridium difficile and major advances in microbial sequencing resurrected fmt as a novel approach to treat recurrent c difficile infection cdi.2 in this setting fmt is a safe efficacious and cost- effective alternative to continuous or recurrent courses of antibiot- ics.2 at a mechanistic level the introduction of donor fecal material increases the diversity of the microbiome and alters the metabolicpathways active in the intestinal flora.3 although fmt was initially used to treat recurrent or refractory cdi it has recently been evaluated in case series and randomized controlled trials in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease ibd without cdi.4-7impact of clostridium difficile infection on patients with inflammatory bowel diseasecdi is a significant complicating factor in patients with ibd who undergo clinical relapse between 5 and 20 of patients with flare-ups are noted to be positive for the cdi toxin or gene.8 risk factors for cdi in hospitalized ibd patients include a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis recent antibiotic use proton pump inhibitor use and low albumin levels 3 gdl.9 in addition patients taking immunomodulators have a higher rate of cdi than those not taking immunomodulators 74 vs 56 p.02 although a study in patients with ileal pouches did not confirm this association.10patients with ibd and cdi appear to fare worse than their non-ibd counterparts.11-13 in ibd patients hospital- ized for infection-related complications cdi was found to be associated with excess inpatient mortality odds ratio 3.2 95 ci 2.6-4.0.13 odds of colectomy in ibd patients with cdi particularly those with ulcerative coli- tis and cdi compared with ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease alone increased significantly between the years 1998 and 2007.11 similar to non-ibd patients those with ibd have a high risk of recurrent cdi nearly 60 of patients with ibd and cdi have recurrent cdi after initial therapy which is higher than the typical recurrence risk of 15 to 30 in non-ibd patients.9 a single-center pediatric cohort reported the rate of cdi recurrence in patients with ibd to be 34 vs 8 in non-ibd con- trols.

the first published randomized trial of fmt via nasoduodenal infusion demonstrated sig- nificantly higher rates of resolution of cdi-related diar- rhea 81 vs 31 p.008 and a significant increase in microbial diversity after fmt.20 a more recent random- ized controlled trial in the united states reported similar rates of resolution of recurrent cdi in patients with recent infection.21 a case series has repeated these results with primary and secondary cure rates of 80 to 90 and with no serious adverse events in the short term.22 it appears that the mode of administration of fmt has little impact on its overall efficacy oral fmt capsules fmt enemas and fmt duodenal infusions all produce success rates in the 70 to 90 range.23 it should be noted that the endpoint was usually improvement in diarrhea which is less rigorous of an endpoint than test- ing negative for c difficile by polymerase chain reaction and resolution of diarrhea.although none of the randomized controlled trials were aimed at patients with ibd a number of groups has published results on cdi which include some patients with ibd table.

a similar high rate of cure 90 was reported in a cohort of 10 pediatric patients who received fmt via nasointestinal tube for recurrent cdi.25 khoruts and colleagues recently reported that a single colono- scopic fmt cleared cdi from 74 of patients with ibd and 92 of patients without ibd p.0018.26 patients had similar responses to fmt regardless oftable.

the first series was in children and reported a transient improvement in colitis symptoms after fmt enema.34 later reports of the use of fmt in adults with active ulcerative colitis yielded mostly no or minimal effects in treating active disease.3536 subsequently 2 randomized controlled trials of fmt in patients with active ulcerative colitis were published in 2015.45 rossen and colleagues studied 50 patients in a double-blinded randomized trial of fmt via nasoduodenal tube.5 there was no significant difference in the probability of clini- cal remission between patients who received donor stool or autologous stool 30 vs 20 p.5.

a fur- ther update to the fda draft guidance specifically stated that the use of a stool bank for fmt would require an ind application.39 all other uses of fmt including as primary therapy for ibd continue to require investiga- tors to submit an ind application.conclusionfmt is a safe and effective option in the short term to prevent recurrent cdis in patients with ibd and will likely remain an important tool in the future.

in the second trial moayyedi and colleagues compared the efficacy of 6 weekly fecal enemas to placebo enemas in a group of 75 patients with moderately active ulcerative colitis.4 a significantly greater proportion of patients who underwent fmt than who received placebo were in remission 7 weeks after the fmt therapy 24 vs 5. interestingly the clinical responders to fmt in this trial were more likely to have received stool from a specific donor donor b than from other donors 39 vs 10 p.06 suggesting a donor effect that has not been noted as a factor in treating recurrent cdi.the reported results in crohn's disease have also been mixed.

the american college of gastroenterology acg guidelines suggest a test-and-treat strategy for all hospitalized patients with ibd in a flare.15 metronidazole therapy is usually suffi- cient for non-ibd patients with mild to moderate cdi but the relatively high rates of treatment failure 22 and early recurrence 28 limit its value in patients with active ibd.16 most patients with ibd have sufficient clini- cal features to be categorized as moderate to severe cdi warranting vancomycin therapy for initial infection and prolonged vancomycin pulsed-taper or fidaxomicin difi- cid merck for recurrent infections.1718 a conditionalrecommendation in the acg practice guidelines supports the ongoing use of immunosuppression in cdi but sug- gests holding dose escalation or addition of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy until treatment for cdi has been ongoing for up to 72 hours although this recommenda- tion was not based on high-quality evidence.15efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with clostridium difficile infectiongiven the high rates of cdi recurrence fmt fills an important role in the treatment algorithm of cdi.

the largest cohort by kelly and colleagues described outcomes in 36 patients with ibd including patients on corticosteroids immuno- modulators anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy and anti-integrins.24 the overall cure rate in ibd patients was 94 with an 86 cure rate after a single fmt.

oral administration of pro- biotics has been proven to be therapeutic in controlledtrials in patients with ulcerative colitis and antibiot- ics prevent recurrence of inflammation at previously affected sites in crohn's disease.3233 cumulatively these data suggest that bacteria may play a role in the initia- tion and propagation of ibd and therapeutic manipu- lation of the host microbiome may reduce or prevent the intestinal inflammation characteristic of this condition.efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in human trials in inflammatory bowel diseaseinitial data to support a role for fmt in treating ibd came from small case series often in patients with refrac- tory disease.

although the cure rate for cdi may be lower in ibd populations than in non-ibd populations the impact of cdi on the course of ibd warrants fmt intervention.

ongoing studies are likely to determine the missing link between the efficacy of fmt and its impact on microbial communities and mucosal inflammation.ecal microbiota transplantation fmt currently describes the transfer of fecal material from a healthy donor to a patient for the purpose of increasing intestinal microbial diversityand reestablishing a normal microbiome.

the rationale for fmt in this setting is based upon both the microbial disruption noted after antibiotic exposure and colonization by toxin-producing c difficile.19 fmt is assumed to initially enhance microbial diversity and diminish the ecologic niche that c difficile occupies in patients with cdi.

unlike in cdi the efficacy of fmt in the treatment of ibd appears to be influenced by a number of factors including donor microbial profiles inflammatory burden and the microbial diversity of the recipient.
