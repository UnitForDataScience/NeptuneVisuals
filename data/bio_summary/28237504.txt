We aimed to study the impact and safety of FMT on decolonization of CRE or VRE carriers using a standardized protocol.MethodsSettingThis was a pilot prospective multicentre study of FMT for patients with digestive tract colonization with CRE or VRE.

There was no statistical difference between PCR and culture.moniae carbapenemase KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae within four weeks and about half of the KPC-positive patients were still carriers after nine months.A recent meta-analysis reported that the rate of decolonization of CRE carriers without intervention was 50 at six months.In a context where no other efficient strategy is available our first results show that FMT seems to be safe with an impact on CRE decolonization at one month and on VRE decolonization at three months.

Among them one and two were decolonized respectively at M1 and M3.One cirrhotic patient with persistent VRE carriage died three months after FMT from ascitic fluid infection and VRE bacteraemia.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of faecal microbiota transplantation FMT on a cohort of patients with digestive tract colonization by CRE or VRE.

Eight patients were included six carrying CRE and two colonized by VRE.

One month after FMT two patients were free from CRE carriage and another patient was free from VRE after three months.

carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae CRE and vancomycin-resistant enterococci VRE is occurring worldwide.Patients carrying these bacteria are at risk of developing severe infections due to these bacteria these in- fections are associated with a high mortality rate partially because of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment.The use of transmission precautions such as contact isola- tion with patients known to be colonized or infected with resistant micro-organisms is recommended in healthcare fa- cilities.

However to the best of our knowledge there have been no reported case series of FMT for CRE or VRE car- riers.

Moreover at admission prior to FMT colonization was confirmed by PCR testing PCR Xpert Car- baR and Xpert VanAVanB by Cepheidr Maurens-Scopont France.PatientsInclusion criteria were aged 18 years written informed consent signed CRE or VRE colonization confirmed by at least three consecutive positive rectal swabs at weekly intervals including one in the week prior to the FMT.Main exclusion criteria were immunosuppression HIV with CD4 200mm3 immunosuppressive therapy including corti- costeroids 60 mgday for more than five days chemo- therapy concomitant antibiotic prescription at the time of FMT.Study procedureDuring the two days prior to the FMT patients received a proton-pump inhibitor at the lowest dose i.e.
