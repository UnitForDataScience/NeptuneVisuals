the obtained results demonstratedthat the solar radiation is a relevant environmental factor influencing the relative abundance of specific- groups of phyllosphere-associated bacteria in pigmented baby leaf lettuce.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionthe phyllosphere which refers to the environment encom- passing the surface and interior of the aerial parts of vascular plants is mainly colonized by bacteria 105 to 107 cellsg affected by different biotic and abiotic stress factors  .

a similar observation was derived from studies performed with strawberries where the abundance-of pseudomonas and xanthomonas which belong to the gammapro- teobacteria class as well as the bacillus genus were lower in open field when compared to protected conditions .conclusionsdespite significant scientific literature highlighting the impact of solar radiation on bacterial communities in the phyllosphere the present study showed that the impact of different solar radiation exposures measured by the cumulative par was not associated with a change in the size of the total bacteria community of pig- mented baby leaf lettuce.

in a previous study it was observed that the composition and concentration of total and individual phenolic compounds varied within cultivars harvest week and weather variables .the impact of different par doses on the relative abundance of the different bacteria phyla was investigated.

however other authors have reported that the abundance of the phyllosphere bacteria was influenced by seasonal fluctuations due to changes in weather parameters such as temperature relative humidity and solar radiation  .on the other hand average numbers of total culturable bacteria 3.8 - 0.4 log total bacteriag were significantly lower than those measured using qpcr 7.3 - 0.3 log total bacteriag.

results showed that the total bacteria population was not affected by the different cumulative par irrespective of the method used to perform the measurement .

each treatment was defined as cumulative par as follows 4889 - 428 mmolm2s control 4265 - 356 mmolm2s 1 w 3602 - 225 mmol m2s 2 w and 3115 - 313 mmolm2s 3 w. bars with different letters indicate significant difference at p  0.05.. this could be attributed to the presence of non-viable or viable but non-culturable vbnc bacteria   but also to the amplification of plant chloroplasts and mitochondria when using universal bacterial primers  .

in the present study the impact of different solar radi- ation doses on the phyllosphere microbiota of red-pigmented baby leaf lettuce cultivated in open field under commercial conditions was evaluated.

several recent studies that focused on the seasonal dynamics of bacterial com- munities examined using molecular approaches have suggested that environmental factors such as ambient temperature solar ra- diation and frequency of the water supply provoke significant changes in the phyllosphere associated bacteria  .
