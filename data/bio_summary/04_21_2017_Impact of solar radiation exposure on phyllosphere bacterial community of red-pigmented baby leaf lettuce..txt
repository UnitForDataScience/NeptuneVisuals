The obtained results demonstratedthat the solar radiation is a relevant environmental factor influencing the relative abundance of specific- groups of phyllosphere-associated bacteria in pigmented baby leaf lettuce.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionThe phyllosphere which refers to the environment encom- passing the surface and interior of the aerial parts of vascular plants is mainly colonized by bacteria 105 to 107 cellsg affected by different biotic and abiotic stress factors  .

In a previous study it was observed that the composition and concentration of total and individual phenolic compounds varied within cultivars harvest week and weather variables .The impact of different PAR doses on the relative abundance of the different bacteria phyla was investigated.

A similar observation was derived from studies performed with strawberries where the abundance-of Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas which belong to the Gammapro- teobacteria class as well as the Bacillus genus were lower in open field when compared to protected conditions .ConclusionsDespite significant scientific literature highlighting the impact of solar radiation on bacterial communities in the phyllosphere the present study showed that the impact of different solar radiation exposures measured by the cumulative PAR was not associated with a change in the size of the total bacteria community of pig- mented baby leaf lettuce.

However other authors have reported that the abundance of the phyllosphere bacteria was influenced by seasonal fluctuations due to changes in weather parameters such as temperature relative humidity and solar radiation  .On the other hand average numbers of total culturable bacteria 3.8 - 0.4 log total bacteriag were significantly lower than those measured using qPCR 7.3 - 0.3 log total bacteriag.

Results showed that the total bacteria population was not affected by the different cumulative PAR irrespective of the method used to perform the measurement .
