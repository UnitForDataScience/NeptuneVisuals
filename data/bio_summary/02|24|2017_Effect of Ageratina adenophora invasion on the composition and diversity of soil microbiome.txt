Soil pH had a tendency P  0.0910 F  1.83 999 Monte Carlo permutations to contribute to the com- position of bacterial communities while soil available P and K TN TOC NH4-N and temperature did not show any significant community-environment relationship with P values of 0.1680 0.7100 0.2910 0.2330 and 0.4550respectively showing a lesser importance in affecting the composition of bacterial communities.DiscussionIn this study we have used high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the composition anddiversity of soil bacterial communities invaded by the aggressive weed A. adenophora at different population densities.

It has spread throughout much of Southwest- ern China including Yunnan Guizhou Sichuan Guangxi Xizang provinces and Chongqing Xie et al.

A. adenophora replaces native crops and trees by outcompeting them for the available fertilizer water sun- light and space and very rapidly becomes the single pre- dominant plant species McGeoch et al.

This weed is responsible for an an- nual loss of 150 million US dollars from livestock pro- duction decline and 400 million US dollars from the serv- ice function of grassland ecosystems in China Xu et al.

2006.Existence of a positive interaction between A. adenophora and its associated rhizosphere microbiome is speculated to play a key role in its successful establish- ment and dominance in its invasion of native habitats Yu et al.

adenophora alters the structure of its rhizosphere microbiome such that its growth is favored and native plant species are displaced Wan et al.

Bacteriostatic effects of its root exudates and associated plant litter have been confirmed Liu et al.

2010 and many antibacterial chemicals have been identified there Zhang et al.

Previous studies suggest that its colonization of soil in- creases levels of soil bacteria and fungi and the structure of the soil microbiome is altered Li et al.
