Therefore we postulate that butyrate dampens enteric-bacteria induced LP T cell activation via HDACi resulting in the modification of gene transcripts involved in T cell activation cytokine production andor cell death.Conversely given the heterogeneous nature of our LPMC cultures butyrate may also inhibit LP T cell activation indirectly through its effects on other cells such as mDCs which weDILLON et al.Page 9have shown to be critical in activation of LP T cells in response to enteric bacteria in vitro65 67.

Exogenous butyrate suppressed enteric Gram-negative bacteria-driven LP T cell activation and HIV-1 infection levels in vitro.CONCLUSIONS--Reductions in mucosal butyrate from diminished colonic BPB may exacerbate pathobiont driven gut T cell activation and HIV replication thereby contributing to HIV-associated mucosal pathogenesis.KeywordsHIV-1 infection microbiome mucosal immunology butyrate T cellsINTRODUCTIONHuman immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 disease is associated with dramatic alterations in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue GALT which occur early in the course of infection and contribute to HIV-associated chronic immune activation and disease progression1.

Finally to address potential mechanisms we directly investigated the impact of exogenous butyrate on pathobiont-driven T cell activation and HIV-1 infection using an in vitro lamina propria mononuclear cell LPMC model.METHODSClinical study participants and study designEighteen HIV-1 infected adult participants who were ART-naive or had not been on treatment for more than 7 days prior to the study and 14 HIV-1 uninfected adult control participants were enrolled into this cross-sectional study at the University of ColoradoDILLON et al.Page 4Anschutz Medical Campus.

Abundance of R. intestinalis a dominant BPB which was decreased to the greatest degree in untreated HIV-1 infected study participants was inversely associated with indicators of systemic MT immune activation and vascular inflammation.Moreover in vitro studies demonstrated that higher levels 2mM of butyrate inhibited pathobiont-driven LP T cell activation cytokine production IL-17A and IFNg and HIV-1 infection of CD4 T cells whereas lower butyrate levels lacked this strong immunomodulatory effect.

1D Table 3.Butyrate reduces P. stercorea-driven activation of HIV-1 infected LP T cells and pro- inflammatory cytokine production in vitroFindings from our clinical study led to the hypothesis that a loss of butyrate might exacerbate P. stercorea-driven intestinal T cell activation.

Butyrate reduces P. stercorea-enhanced LP T cell activation and HIV-1 productive infectionLamina propria mononuclear cells LPMC were spinoculated with CCR5-tropic HIV-1Bal and cultured with or without P. stercorea and butyrate 0.2mM 2mM for 4 days and levels of T cell activation cytokine production and productive HIV-1 infection determined n9.Percentages of LP CD4 A and CD8 B T cells co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR were assessed using multi-color flow cytometry.

Thus it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which gut microbes and their metabolic products such as butyrate influence immune cell function during HIV-1 infection.DESIGN--A cross-sectional study was performed to compare the relative abundance of butyrate- producing bacterial species BPB in colonic biopsies and stool of untreated chronic HIV-1 infected n18 and uninfected n14 study participants.

This study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board COMIRB at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.Clinical study sample processing and analysisThe collection storage and processing of rectal swabs colon biopsies plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC from these study participants is extensively detailed elsewhere 28 29.
