the acid whey concentrate after ultrafiltration used in rat diets caused reduced weight gain for atherogenic diet with wheat bread growth of caecum tissue and digesta weight a decrease in the ph of caecum digesta for atherogenic diet reduced activity of bacterial glycolytic enzymes and a significant increase in total scfa for both types of diet with wheat-rye breads containing acid whey concentrate.

two types of diet were used namely standard diet and cholic acid and cholesterol-supplemented diet the latter is called atherogenic diet.methodsmaterialsthe recipe and technology applied for preparing both types of breads wheat and wheat-rye used in this experiment were described in detail by wronkowska et al.. in brief wheat flour type 750 mlynomag tap water salt and fresh yeast lesaffre s.a. were used for the preparation of wheat bread.

found no changes in total scfa content in rats fed a diet con- taining quark compared with the standard diet and only a significant decrease in propionic acid concentration was observed for that group.biochemical indices in blood serum of rats fed the experimental diets are shown in 6. a statistically non- significant decrease was observed in serum glucose and tag levels of rats fed both types of diet with wheat bread fortified by acid whey concentrate.

for the atherogenic diet group the diet was modified by the addition of lard and cholic acid 4 and 02  of the diet respectively and also by increasing the cholesterol content compared with the standard diet 1 v. 03 .

many factors such as the quantity and source of fat used in the diet or the length of experimental feeding may affect the results obtained in this type of in vivo experiment.for rats fed the standard diet no difference was found in the body weight gain and diet intake 2. however for rats administered the atherogenic diet a significant effect oftable 1 .

the following sample abbre- viations were used bread from wheat flour type 750 w bread from a mixture of wheat flour type 750 and rye flour type 720 wr bread from wheat flour type 750 or from a mixture of wheat flour type 750 and rye flour type 720 with 20  addition of ultrafiltrated acid whey wu and wru.preparation of diets and animal protocolthe animal protocol used in this study was approved by the university of warmia and mazury institutional animal care and use committee permission no.

the main component of the diet was wheat or wheat-rye bread which constituted 77  of the diet.
