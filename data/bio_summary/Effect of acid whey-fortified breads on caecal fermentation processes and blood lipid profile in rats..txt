The acid whey concentrate after ultrafiltration used in rat diets caused reduced weight gain for atherogenic diet with wheat bread growth of caecum tissue and digesta weight a decrease in the pH of caecum digesta for atherogenic diet reduced activity of bacterial glycolytic enzymes and a significant increase in total SCFA for both types of diet with wheat-rye breads containing acid whey concentrate.

For the atherogenic diet group the diet was modified by the addition of lard and cholic acid 4 and 02  of the diet respectively and also by increasing the cholesterol content compared with the standard diet 1 v. 03 .
