 ARTICLEHigh intake of dairy during energy restriction does not affect energy balance or the intestinal microflora compared with low dairy intake in overweight individuals in a randomized controlled trialLine Quist Bendtsen Trine Blaedel Jacob Bak Holm Janne Kunchel Lorenzen Alicja Budek Mark Pia Kiilerich Karsten Kristiansen Arne Astrup and Lesli Hingstrup LarsenAbstract During weight loss dairy calcium is proposed to accelerate weight and fat-mass loss through increased fecal fat excretion.

43 1-10 2018 Published at on 22 August 2017.to conclude that dairy intake combined with energy restriction favors weight and fat-mass FM loss whereas dairy intake combined with ad libitum diets does not.Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of dairy products on BW and FM including increased fecal fat excretion and reduced lipogenesis.

All partici- pants were instructed to consume a diet with a daily 500-kcal 2100 kJ energy deficit compared with their estimated energy requirement and with a macronutrient composition of 30 energy percentage E fat 52 E carbohydrate and 18 E protein.

Conse- quently it has been suggested that both dairy calcium and pro- teins play a role in the reported beneficial effects of dairy products on energy balance and risk markers of cardiovascular diseases.Dietary changes induce alterations in the gut microbiota   and can change the function of the microbiota and affect host metabolism .

Consequently diets high or low in dairy may affect appetite BW and metabolic risk markers through alterations in the gut microbiota composition.We hypothesized that a high-dairy hypocaloric diet increases weight and FM loss and increases fecal fat excretion to a greater extent than a low-dairy hypocaloric diet.The primary objective of the present study was to investigate if an energy-restricted high-dairy compared with a low-dairy diet would increase BW loss FM loss andor fecal fat excretion over 24 weeks.

The secondary objectives were to investigate the effects of dairy intake on fecal calcium and energy excretion resting energy expenditure REE blood pressure and lipid metabolism and to determine if the interventions differentially affected the composition of the gut microbiota.Materials and methodsParticipantsNinety-six overweight or obese body mass index BMI 28- 36 kgm2 men and women aged 18-60 years were recruited for the study which was conducted at the Department of Nutrition Exercise and Sports University of Copenhagen by advertisements in local newspapers and through Webpages from June 2010 to August 2011.
