increased sympathetic nerve activity decreases nk activity 43. we recently demonstrated that oral administration of s-pt84 suppresses sympathetic nerve activity in the mouse spleen we therefore consider that one of the mechanisms behind the immunomodulatory effects of s-pt84 such as enhancement of nk activity involves sympathetic nerve activity.

one of the problems caused by stress is immune suppression in the present study we examined if oral administration of s-pt84 which has been shown to have immune function-enhancing activity particularly activity that enhances th1 immunity could ameliorate stress- induced immune suppression.

kumquat pericarp improves both thesuppressed plasma interferon ifn-g and nk activity per splenocyte in stressed mice and the active compound is considered to be b-cryptoxanthin myricetin which is a flavonol that is widely present in daily food attenuates the depressant-like behaviors observed in mice exposed to repeated stress the probiotic bacterial strain lactobacillus rhamnosus lcr35 produces an anti- hypersensitivity activity in a restraint stress model as described above the anti-stress effect of some food ingredients or components such as lactic acid bacteria lab are becoming clear however it is remains unclear whether lab can ameliorate immunological activity that is suppressed by stress.some lab that are ingredients of functional foods can modulate immune responses.

the mechanism by which lab regulate immune responses is becoming increasingly clear due to the large number of studies on this subject and application of lab to improve human health has also been shown we previously found that the lactobacillus pentosus strain s-pt84 s-pt84 has the strongest interleukin il-12-inducing activity among a variety of lab isolated from kyoto pickles heat-killed s-pt84 modulates the th1th2 balance toward th1 dominance exerts an anti-allergy effect activates nk and nk t nkt cells via toll- like receptor 24 pathways and exerts an anti-viral infection effect through induction of il-12 ifn-g and ifn-a production 30.in this study we tested the hypothesis that s-pt84 which has potent immunomodulatory activity might be effective for ameliorating stress-induced immune depression.

splenic nk activity il-12 and il-10 production by macrophages and ifn-g and il-4 production by splenocytes were measured as parameters of immune activity.

these results suggest that s-pt84 exerts anti- stress activity through immune modulation andor antioxidative activity.key words lactobacillus pentosus strain s-pt84 stress-induced immune suppression anti-stress reduced glutathione gshintroductionin modern society people can be exposed to stress throughout their lifetime.

1.effect of s-pt84 administration on stress-induced immune suppressionthe effect of s-pt84 administration on restraint stress- induced effects on splenic immune function was then investigated by assay of the number of splenocytes of splenic nk activity and of splenocyte con a-induced ifn-g and il-4 production levels.

we found that s-pt84 has an anti- stress activity through an immune modulating andor antioxidative activity.materials and methodspreparation of heat-killed labthe l. pentosus strain s-pt84 was cultured in deman rogosa and sharpe mrs broth difco laboratories detroit mi usa at 35degc for 48 hr.

2d.to investigate the effect of s-pt84 administration on stress-induced effects on innate immune activity we investigated il-12 and il-10 production by lps- activated peritoneal macrophages isolated from these mice.

s-pt84 is a lab that was identified in a screening in which the intensity of il-12 induction in macrophages and some immunomodulating effects in vivo were confirmed therefore il-12-inducing activity might be one of the mechanisms by which s-pt84 ameliorated stress-induced immune suppression.many studies have demonstrated that the th1th2 balance is closely related to the reduced gsh level within antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and that a gsh regulates il-12 production stress induces oxidative stress and decreases the gsh level in some organisms and cells which causes damage to cells such as leukocytes and hepatocytes as well as skin damage therefore the much larger decrease in the production of il-12 induced by stress fig.

details regarding such a mechanism should be clarified in future studies.in conclusion l. pentosus strain s-pt84 showed anti-restraint stress activity and in particular ameliorated stress-induced suppression of the immune system.

stress is now considered as an important modulator of the immune system and a major cause of increased risk for immune-related diseases such as inflammatory diseases infection and cancer it is therefore important to prevent immune suppression or disturbance caused by stress.the intake of functional foods over many years does not cure a disease but can maintain human health and there will be a greater demand for such foods in the future.
