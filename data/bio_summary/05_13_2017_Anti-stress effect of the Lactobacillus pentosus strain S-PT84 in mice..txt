Kumquat pericarp improves both thesuppressed plasma interferon IFN-g and NK activity per splenocyte in stressed mice and the active compound is considered to be b-cryptoxanthin Myricetin which is a flavonol that is widely present in daily food attenuates the depressant-like behaviors observed in mice exposed to repeated stress The probiotic bacterial strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35 produces an anti- hypersensitivity activity in a restraint stress model As described above the anti-stress effect of some food ingredients or components such as lactic acid bacteria LAB are becoming clear however it is remains unclear whether LAB can ameliorate immunological activity that is suppressed by stress.Some LAB that are ingredients of functional foods can modulate immune responses.

One of the problems caused by stress is immune suppression In the present study we examined if oral administration of S-PT84 which has been shown to have immune function-enhancing activity particularly activity that enhances Th1 immunity could ameliorate stress- induced immune suppression.

The mechanism by which LAB regulate immune responses is becoming increasingly clear due to the large number of studies on this subject and application of LAB to improve human health has also been shown We previously found that the Lactobacillus pentosus strain S-PT84 S-PT84 has the strongest interleukin IL-12-inducing activity among a variety of LAB isolated from Kyoto pickles Heat-killed S-PT84 modulates the Th1Th2 balance toward Th1 dominance exerts an anti-allergy effect activates NK and NK T NKT cells via Toll- like receptor 24 pathways and exerts an anti-viral infection effect through induction of IL-12 IFN-g and IFN-a production 30.In this study we tested the hypothesis that S-PT84 which has potent immunomodulatory activity might be effective for ameliorating stress-induced immune depression.

Stress of mice induced an increase in serum corticosterone and a decrease in splenic natural killer activity and in the number of splenocytes versus control mice.

2D.To investigate the effect of S-PT84 administration on stress-induced effects on innate immune activity we investigated IL-12 and IL-10 production by LPS- activated peritoneal macrophages isolated from these mice.

We recently demonstrated that oral administration of S-PT84 suppresses sympathetic nerve activity in the mouse spleen We therefore consider that one of the mechanisms behind the immunomodulatory effects of S-PT84 such as enhancement of NK activity involves sympathetic nerve activity.

Splenic NK activity IL-12 and IL-10 production by macrophages and IFN-g and IL-4 production by splenocytes were measured as parameters of immune activity.

These results suggest that S-PT84 exerts anti- stress activity through immune modulation andor antioxidative activity.Key words Lactobacillus pentosus strain S-PT84 stress-induced immune suppression anti-stress reduced glutathione GSHINTRODUCTIONIn modern society people can be exposed to stress throughout their lifetime.

1.Effect of S-PT84 administration on stress-induced immune suppressionThe effect of S-PT84 administration on restraint stress- induced effects on splenic immune function was then investigated by assay of the number of splenocytes of splenic NK activity and of splenocyte Con A-induced IFN-g and IL-4 production levels.
