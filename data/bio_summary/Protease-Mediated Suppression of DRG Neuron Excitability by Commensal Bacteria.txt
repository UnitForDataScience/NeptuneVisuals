p  0.01 one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post hoc test.Subsequently DRG neurons preincubated with PD98059 30 uM  an ERK12 inhibitor for 2 h before the addition of MET-1 prevented the decrease in excitability of DRG neurons by MET-1 B F359  4.029 p  0.0005 one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test post hoc test.Bacterial strain-specific effects on neuronal excitabilityTo determine whether individual strains of bacteria from MET-1 could have similar effects on the excitability of DRG neurons we tested two individual strains Bifidobacterium longum 16-6-I 4 FM hereafter 4M and F. prausnitzii 16-6-I 40 FAA hereafter 40FAA.

We found that these bacteria reduced the excitability of DRG neurons de- termined the mechanisms involved and examined whether MET-1 could reverse the hyperexcitability of DRG neurons caused by colitis.Materials and MethodsAnimals.

Together these data suggest that secretory products of MET-1 can inhibit the excitability of DRG neurons including those that innervate the colon.Voltage-clamp recordings were obtained to examine the role of voltage-gated K and Na currents in the decrease in DRG excitability observed in response to MET-1.

The effects of MET-1 on excitability of DRG neurons were abolished following heat treatment  F258  11.26 p  0.0001 one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test post hoc test.Protease-mediated effects of MET-1 on neuronal excitability Because heat-sensitive proteases can be produced by enteric bac- teria and are well-characterized modulators of excitability in DRG neurons     we sought to determine whether the active mediator in MET-1 supernatant could be a protease.

Cat G concentration-dependently decreased excitability of DRG neurons by increasing rheobase by 43 com- pared with controls D F452  4.796 p  0.0023 one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test post hoc test.PAR-4-mediated effects of MET-1 on neuronal excitability Because serine proteases are known to act on PARs which are present on DRG neurons we sought to determine whether MET-1 acts via a PAR  .

Preincubation of DRG neurons with SC-514 20 uM an NFKB inhibitor  for 2 h before the addition of MET-1 prevented the decrease in excitability of DRG neurons by MET-1 A F361  7.878 p  0.0002one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test post hoc test.Figure 4.

Moreover super- natant from MET-1 grown without the inclusion of 40FAA evoked no change in excitability of DRG neurons compared with media alone B F287  7.369 p  0.0006 one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test post hoc test.Effects of MET-1 on DRG neurons from mice with colitis During colitis the mucosal barrier is compromised leading to bacterial translocation as well as exposure of nociceptive nerve terminals to inflammatory mediators.

Our data also indicate that whereas colon- projecting DRG neurons are inhibited by MET-1 secretions non-colon-projecting DRG neurons may also be influenced by the secretions of members of the colonic microbiota.

In addition to demonstrating the potential antinociceptive effects of 40 FAA on DRG neurons we were able to show that removal of this strain from our original MET-1 community abolished the observed decrease in excitabil- ity of DRG neurons.
