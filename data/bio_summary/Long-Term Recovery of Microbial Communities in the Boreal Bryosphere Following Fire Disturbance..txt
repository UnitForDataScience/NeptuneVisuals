This was not observed in the moss layer possibly because organic acids were leached from the base of the moss layer into the mineral soil an increase in mineral soil pH with TSF was recorded results not shown.

Humus pH was established with an electronicpH meter after suspending 1 g DW of humus in 25 ml0.01 M CaCl2.The thicknesses of a the green and brown parts of the moss layer and b the humus layer were recorded at each forest site in order to identify changes in the structure of the moss layer with TSF .

reported the recov- ery of fungal communities associated with boreal feather mosses within 30 years of clear-cutting.Based on our findings and other published reports it is likely that the re-establishment of fungal communities in the moss layer either from spores or hyphae surviving in the soil is rapid in successional terms years or decades  Most of the major structural changes on our sites occurred early on.

The ordination of bacterial community constrained by TSF and pH humus was significant p  0.025 and explained about 62  of the variance in the bacterial community.

An analysis that looked at along-stem variation in bacterial and fungal communities with TSF could resolve this issue.ConclusionsBoth the bacterial and fungal communities of the bryosphere were similar to those reported in studies of boreal SMCs.

The moss layer data were also predict- able The length of the photosynthesising portion of the shoot stayed constant whilst more recalcitrant C accumulated in brown tissue and the underlying humus layer.Microbial Community StructureThe ordinations indicated that TSF was an important factor in explaining microbial community structure.

The recovery of the fungal community may have been related to the recovery of the moss layer which takes 20-30 years  andor the re-establishment of understory herbs and shrubs   .

This pattern is explicable if the bacteria responded to changes in green tissue which remained at a constant length but the fungal community was primarily influenced by changes towards the base of the moss layer.

In this case TSF was closely related to several edaphic factors notably total C total N and EIN and the physical attributes of the bryosphere moss layer thickness and moss litter accumu- lation.

.The length of the green portion of the moss layer stayed constant with TSF mean length 2.4 - 0.1 cm whereas the length of the brown tissue increased withRUS 0.3 - 0.0339.4 - 7.644.6 - 1.6 3.30 - 0.04LAD 0.1 - 0.01120.7 - 15.999.4 - 2.6 3.06 - 0.02GUO 0.4 - 0.01NA45.1 - 1.4 3.48 - 0.18TJA 0.5 - 0.0195.4 - 1.943.5 - 0.3 2.98 - 0.02REV 0.3 - 0.0154.8 - 7.244.8 - 1.0 3.11 - 0.05The analysis was performed on the humus layer.
