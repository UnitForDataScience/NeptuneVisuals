The name Proteobacteria was first proposed by Stackebrandt et al.

For example Lambeth et al.

They found a significant increase in an unknown genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family included in the phylum Proteobacteria as well as an increase in the genus Collinsella in the T2DM group in comparison to the other groups .A connection between low-grade inflammation sus- tained by lipopolysaccharides LPS and the development of metabolic disorders is well established  however the hypothesis regarding the direct role of the microbiota in the development of this inflammatory state called endo- toxemia is more recent and was studied in particularby Cani et al.

In fact GM mice are usually resistant to HFD-induced obesity 33 4.Major insights into the role of microbiota in obesity comes from the very well-known study by Turnbaugh et al.

For example Vrieze et al.

For example Michail et al.

When analyzing at family and genus levels authors found that this difference was sustained by an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia respectively.Similar results were obtained by Kapil et al.

In fact Vaughn et al.

For example de Filippo et al.
