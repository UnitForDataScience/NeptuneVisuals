In conclusion here we propose the impact of hypervariable region selection for the 16S rRNA gene in differentiating thanatomicrobiomic profiles to provide empirical data to explain a unique concept the Postmortem Clostridium Effect.Keywords thanatomicrobiome Clostridium 16S rRNA gene V4 hypervariable regions V3-4 hypervariable regions Postmortem Clostridium EffectINTRODUCTIONThanatomicrobiome studies have determined that there is extremely rapid postmortem overgrowth of Clostridium spp.

We hypothesized that by modulating 16S rRNA gene hypervariable fragment lengths on the Illumina MiSeq platform the two specified regions would produce dissimilar microbial signatures.Bioinformatic surveys have shown that hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene differ in the detection of sequence diversity thus a particular region may function well for ascertaining a spectrum of bacterial taxa whereas a different region may exhibit a distinct degree of taxonomic diversity.

The question then arises What hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene best profile the shifts that occur in response to the massive proliferation of microbiota after death The phenomenon that these signatures are left behind by the corpse provides unique forensic potential to make available trace evidence that can be used in microbial forensics.Analysis of the very informative 16S rRNA gene is commonly used as a genetic marker for profiling prokaryotic communities          .

Studies have shown that V4 is the best region for phylogenetic studies particularly at the phylum level  .A key question is which sub-region V4 or V3-4 is more effective for phylogenetic studies of the human thanatomicrobiome To explore the potential to determinecadaver thanatomicrobiome signatures using two hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene we compared the performance of primers 515F-806R V4 to 357wF-785R conjoined V3-4 hypervariable regions  .

DNA wasquantified by NanoDrop2000TM Thermo Scientific measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.Illumina MiSeq SequencingV4 and V3-4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA gene were amplified for sequencing at RTL Genomics Research and Testing Laboratory Lubbock TX United States in two-step independent reactions using HotStar Taq Master Mix Kit Qiagen with universal primers 515F-806R for the V4 region and primer constructs 357wF785R for the longer combined V3-4 regions.

The average Shannon Diversity index representing both regions was approximately 2.63 for the V4 region and 2.55 for V3-4 however significant differences were observed for gender manner of death and season of death ANOVA p  0.001 .Results of multivariate difference interactions between both 16S rRNA gene regions and other variables resulted in statistical significance in region and location interaction ADONIS p 0.001 which demonstrated that location was the only factor that had a confounding effect on region and that other factors were not confounding results.

Given the fact that significant differences were observed among regions in unweighted but not in weighted UniFrac the presence or absence of OTUs was more dissimilar than the abundance of OTUs .In order to visualize beta diversity differences between 16S rRNA gene regions PCoA plots were generated based on unweighted  and weighted Unifrac distances metrics .

We performed phylogenetic surveys of thanatomicrobiome signatures of cadavers' internal organs to compare the microbial diversity between the 16S rRNA gene V4 hypervariable region and V3-4 conjoined regions from livers and spleens of 45 cadavers undergoing forensic microbiological studies.
