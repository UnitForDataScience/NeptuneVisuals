NewsGut microbiome and immunotherapy responseA new study by Vancheswaran Gopalakrishnan MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston TX USA and colleagues has found that the composition of the gut microbiome affects the way patients with advanced melanoma respond to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.The investigators examined oral and gut microbiome samples from 112 patients with metastatic melanoma before and after treatment with PD-1 inhibitors.

Progression-free survival was significantly longer for patients with a high diversity in their gut microbiome than those with an intermediate diversity hazard ratio360 95 CI 102-1274 or lowdiversity 357 95 CI 102-1252.

Corrie raised the possibility of turning non-responding patients into responders by transplanting particular bacteria into their gut.

Taxonomic profiling of available faecal microbiome samples n43 showed significant differences between patients who responded to therapy n30 and those who did not n13 p001 although the oral microbiome between these patient groups did not differ p011.

Can we change the microbiome to enhance responses to immunotherapy Should we be limiting or at least tightly monitoring antibiotic use in patients who are preparing for immunotherapy Should we be looking at probiotic usePippa Corrie Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Cambridge UK welcomed the findings.

Responders had a higher abundance of the Ruminococcaceae family and Faecalibacterium than did non- responders.Co-author Jennifer Wargo MD Anderson Cancer Center theorised that the gastrointestinal bacteria are interacting with the immune cells that line the gut and might influence immunity through metabolites.
