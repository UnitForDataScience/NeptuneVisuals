comparing the unions of the four tax- onomies against ott an immediate conclusion is that there is more variety in the union all at the phylum 54 and class 64 ranks and more in ott at the genus 63 and species ranks not shown whereas at order and family ranks highest portion of taxonomic units is shared among the union all and ott 59 and 46 accordingly.comparison by mappingwe compare the five taxonomic classifications by map- ping them onto each other using the three methods defined above.

taxonomic rank information for archaea and bacteria is obtained from bergey's taxonomic outlines and from the list of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature lpsn whereas eukaryotic taxonomy is based on the consensus views of the international society of pro- tistologists taxonomic rank assignments in the silva database are manually curated for the compar- isons we used the taxonomy associated with silva smalltable 1 overview of five taxonomic classificationsafor the analyses we have used ncbi taxonomy as published on 5th oct 2016subunit ribosomal rnas 16s18s v128 as released on 29092016.ribosomal database project rdpthe rdp database is based on 16s rrna sequences from bacteria archaea and fungi eukarya.

names of the organisms associated with the sequences are obtained as the most recently pub- lished synonym from bacterial nomenclature up-to-date information on taxonomic classification for bacte- ria and archaea is based on the taxonomic roadmaps by bergey's trust and lpsn taxonomic informa- tion for fungi is obtained from a hand-made classification dedicated to fungal taxonomy for the comparisons we used a taxonomy associated with rdp database of 16s rrna bacteria and archaea and 28s rrna fungi sequences as released on 30092016 release 11.5.greengenes ggthe greengenes taxonomy  is dedicated to bacteria and archaea.

while our main focus is on the four most popular taxonomic trees we also consider the recently published open tree of life taxonomy ott .we found that silva rdp and greengenes can be mapped into ncbi and ott with few conflicts but not vice versa.

ncbi and ott both are very similar with respect to path comparisons dissimilarities are  0.01.because ott is the largest of the five taxonomies and because all other taxonomies map well on it one might consider using ott as the reference taxonomy of choice.

we dis- play a comparison of the naive lowest common ancestor lca algorithm and the so-called weighted lca wlca algorithm clearly showing that one method produces more specific taxonomic assignments than the other.discussion and conclusionscomparing taxonomies by shared taxonomic units as shown in fig.

taxonomies are sourced from indexfungorum silva ncbi global biodiversity information facility interim register of marine and nonmarine genera and some clade spe- cific resources for the comparisons we used ott taxonomy v2.10 draft 11 as generated on 10092016.methodsshared taxonomic unitsfirst we determined how similar taxonomies are to each other by counting how many taxa they have in common at each rank.

additional file  table s2 -- the numbers for ncbi and ott are very similar up to the family rank and differ significantly from genus rank only.path comparison dissimilarities indicate the scale of differences among paths to the taxonomic units shared pairwise by these taxonomies.

a much worse dissim- ilarity for loose mapping of ott to ncbi 0.12 is most likely due to the fact that ott has almost twice as many nodes as does ncbi.small differences 0.05 between strict and loose map- ping dissimilarities are mostly observed for the pairs of taxonomies where both dissimilarities are relatively high 0.5. this is the case for all mappings on greengenes.

dis- similarity for the loose mapping of ott to ncbi is quite small 0.12 indicating that even though ott is twice as large as ncbi it is not much more diverse.

in a typical taxonomy guided approach sequencing reads are first binned into taxonomic units and then the micro- bial composition of samples is analyzed and compared in detail see fig.

the two main technical ingredients of taxonomic anal- ysis are the reference taxonomy used and the binning approach employed.

taxonomic binning of 16s reads is usually based on one of these four taxonomies silva rdp greengenes orncbi how important is the choice of reference taxonomy given the known inconsistencies of microbial classifica- tions to address this the aim of this paper is to determine how similar these four taxonomies are andwhether results obtained using one classification can eas- ily be carried over to another.we define and explore an algorithm for mapping one taxonomy into another.

in the following we describe each of the five taxonomies in more detail sum- marized in table silvathe silva database contains taxonomic information for the domains of bacteria archaea and eukarya.

sequences are aligned by their characters and secondary structure and then subjected to tree construction with fasttree inner nodes are automatically assigned taxonomic ranks from ncbi supplemented with previous version of greengenes taxonomy and cyanodb for the comparisons we used a taxonomy associated with the greengenes database as released on may 2013. although greengenes is still included in some metagenomic anal- yses packages for example qiime it has not been updated for the last three years.ncbithe ncbi taxonomy contains the names of all organ- isms associated with submissions to the ncbi sequence databases.
