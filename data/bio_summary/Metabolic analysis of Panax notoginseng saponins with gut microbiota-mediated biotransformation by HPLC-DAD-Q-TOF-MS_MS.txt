The results showed that the most abundant metabolites ginsenoside F1 protopanaxatriol PPT ginsenoside Rh2 ginsenoside compound K GCK and protopanaxadiol PPD were reported to possess stronger related pharmacological activities when compared with parent ginsenosides.

Forty-five metabolites were separated and tentatively identified from the PNS metabolic profiles including the major compounds ginsenoside F1 protopanaxatriol PPT ginsenoside Rh2 ginsenoside compound K GCK and protopanaxa- diol PPD.

Forty-five metabolites were found and identi- fied including considerable amounts of deglycosylated metabolites of ginsenoside F1 ginsenoside Rh2 ginsenoside compound K protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol.

The product ions were detected at mz 459.3819 M-H-Glc- and 161.0457 Glc- H-H2O-indicating that M35 was a PPD-type ginsenoside and had a glucosyl group which could be confirmed as ginsenoside com- pound K. M36 had an accurate M H- ion at mz 765.4950 and major fragment at mz 603.5032 which implied that it could be con- nected with a terminal glucose monomer.

The results showed significant differences on PNS metabolism in vitro between the two dietary-induced human gut microbiota groups.Materials and methodsChemicals and reagentsGinsenosides including ginsenoside Rb1 Rb3 Rg1 20S-Rg2 20S-Rg3 20R-Rg3 20S-Rh1 20R-Rh1 20S-Rh2 20R-Rh2Rc Rd Re F1 F2 20S-protopanaxadiol with purity  98 were purchased from Baoji Herbest Bio-Tech Co.

All the operations and acqui- sition of data were conducted on Agilent LC-Q-TOF-MS MassHunter Workstation software Version B.05.00 Qualitative Analysis Agilent Technologies.HPLC method validationThe six saponins including notoginsenoside R1 ginsenoside Rg1 Rb1 F1 Rd and PPD were dissolved in methanol with known concentrations to validate the precision and stability of the devel- oped method.

To achieve higher ionization efficiency of PNS and metabolites the collision energy was optimized for every precursor ion setting at 30 - 15 eV for collision-induced dissociation.HPLC method validationThe HPLC method was validated using intra- and inter-day variations RSDs of notoginsenoside R1 ginsenoside Rg1 Rb1 F1 Rd and PPD.
