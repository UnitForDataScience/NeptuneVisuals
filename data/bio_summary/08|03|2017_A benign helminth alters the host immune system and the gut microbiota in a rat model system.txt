We required significantly associated OTUs to i differ significantly between infected and control treatment groups during the patent period but not in the period before infection andchange significantly between the period before infection and the patent period in H. dimin- uta-treated rats.

Infection period light gray  before infection n  10 per rat gray  prepatent period n  4 per rat black  patent period n  10 per rat.shift at the community level beta diversity is a result of changes at the strain and species level and  rather than broad shifts from Bacilli Firmicutes to Clostridia Bacteroi- detes observed previously in H. diminuta infected rats  .

We cannot comment on Tregs as they are included in the group of double-negative T-cells but not specifically measured.Our hematological data showed no eosinophilia in rats over the course of H. diminuta infection  which is an expected part of the type 2 immune response to H. diminuta in mice   and rats .

The blood samples for IL-10 analyses were collected in seven time points on days 30 37 43 49 61 73 and 85 .We checked fecal samples of all rats for the presence of H. diminuta eggs daily beginning on day 45 12 days post infection--dpi using the modified Sheather flotation method SpG 1.3 to confirm infection of rats in the treatment group and the absence of infection in the negative controls.

We ask i whether H. diminuta infection causes a disturbance of the gut microbiota in the prepatent or patent period and ii how long-term H. diminuta colonization influences the host immune system.Material and methodsAnimal useWe performed two experiments one in which we tracked the microbiota and broad immuno- logical response Experiment A and a follow up in which we assessed IL-10 cytokine gene expression over time to characterize the type 2 immune response to H. diminuta infection Experiment B .

Levels of IgA antibodies to H. diminuta only were significantly elevated in the H. diminuta infected group throughout the patent period .Interleukin 10 expression during H. diminuta infection.

rarely found tissue eosinophilia in H. diminuta infected rats and peripheral blood may not be suit- able for characterizing eosinophilia.Overall our immunological data suggest that H. diminuta larvae induce a short type 2 immune response in the very beginning of infection--prepatent period--that likely contrib- utes to expulsion of many worms.

The number of leukocytes detected in peripheral blood by hematological analysis is significantly lower in the patent period in H. diminuta infected rats .

We analyzed the fecal extracts from the H. diminuta infected group n  4 rats and the control group n  4 rats at six time points over the course of the experiment.

Alpha diversity did not change in the response to H. diminuta infection  consistent with the previous study of H. diminuta in rats .
