In this context others demonstrated that the onset of skin inflammation in Nfkbiz-- is independent of the Th2 response by showing that dermatitis still developed in Nfkbiz--Stat6-- mice.

To investigate which genes are involved in the regulation of skin inflammation induced by resi- dent bacteria in the absence of the Nfkbiz gene we compared the gene expression profiles in the skin tissues of Nfkbiz- mice Nfkbiz-- mice and antibiotic-treated Nfkbiz-- mice.

Once we confirmed the development of dermatitis in Nfkbiz-- mice we performed further experiments.IL-17A- and IL-22-secreting skin-resident T cells increased in Nfkbiz-- mice.

To support this amelioration of skin inflammation we found significantly lower levels of TEWL and IgE Abs in the antibiotic-treated Nfkbiz-- mice than in the untreated Nfkbiz-- mice Fig.

By analysis with the IPA software downregulation of the NF-kB signal pathway was predicted in the skin of Nfkbiz-- mice in the absence of resident microbiota after antibiotic treatment in comparison with that in untreated Nfkbiz-- mice Fig.

Topical application of S. xylosus leads to differentiation of Th17 cells in skin of Nfkbiz-- mice.A Flow cytometry analysis of IL-17A and IL-22 production in CD4 cells from skin of PBS heat-killed S. xylosus HK-S.x or S. xylosusS.x-inoculated Nfkbiz-- mice.

Of note the inocula- tion of S. xylosus in the skin of Nfkbiz-- and their heterozygous littermates Nfkbiz- resulted in the expansion of IL-17A production from CD4 T cells.ResultsNfkbiz-- mice developed spontaneous skin inflammation.

The expansion of commensal S. xylosus may be one cause of skin dysbiosis in Nfkbiz-- mice and suggests that the Nfkbiz gene may play a regulatory role in the microbiota-skin immunity axis.The skin acts as an important physical barrier that is directly exposed to numerous pathogens in the environ- ment.

In labora- tory mice S. xylosus has been associated with spontaneous dermatitis in both NOS2-- miceand athymic nude miceand with conjunctivitis in NADPH oxidase-- mice implying that S. xylosus is an opportunistic patho- gen.
