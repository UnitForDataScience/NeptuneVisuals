This data demonstrates that miRNAs can be used as an independent non-invasive marker of microbial fluctuations along with gut pathology in the intestine.Keywords microbiota microRNA enteric stool hostIntroductionThe gut hosts a complex and diverse population of commensal bacteria collectively known as the gut microbiota which has increasingly been implicated in host metabolism immunity nervous system function and disease Backhed et al.

The expression of miR-1224-5p was also lower in germ-free animals however this failed to reach statistical significance.Antibiotic mediated depletion of the gut microbiota influences faecal miRNA expression in diverse patternsRecognising that miRNA expression in the faeces of mice was influenced by the microbiota we investigated if absence of bacteria from birth was required to see such reductions in miRNA expression.

It is important to understand the mechanisms through which the host can maintain the composition of the gut microbiota.

Recent findings suggest that miRNA produced by the host's intestinal epithelial cells IECs participate in shaping the microbiota.

To investigate whether miRNA expression was influenced by the gut microbiota we measured the expression of miRNAs expressed by intestinal epithelial cells in faeces.

Specifically we measured miRNA expression in faeces from germ-free GF and conventional mice and similarly in a rat model of antibiotic-mediated depletion of the gut microbiota control rats.

Following antibiotic-mediated depletion of gut microbiota rats showed two divergent profiles of miRNA expression.

During the first year of life the microbiota has a maternal signature however it evolves fairly quickly and reaches adult- like complexity after 1-3 years Grenham et al.

Numerous factors have been shown to influence gut microbiota composition includingdiet disease and host age and genetics Claesson et al.
