These sequence reads clustered into 39 543 OTUs using QIIME's closed-reference processing 518 246 OTUs from de novo clustering using Mothur not filtered for OTU abun- dances and 83 908 sOTUs using Deblur with a filtering of at least 25 reads total per sOTU.

The diversity of microorganisms associated with sponges has been the subject of intense study the search of sponge microbial diversity returned 348 publications in the Scopus database .

For a bacterial sequence s and metadata value v denote byFvs the vector of relative frequencies of bacteria s in all sam- ples with metadata value v and denote by --Fvs the vector of relative frequencies of bacteria s in all samples with metadata other than v. The ranksum P-value is then calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis test for Fvs and --Fvs and shown only if signifi- cantly enriched in samples containing v i.e.

Raw sequences total of 1.1 billion sequences were processed and clustered with i a standard protocol using QIIME closed-reference picking resulting in 39 543 operational taxonomic units OTU at 97 sequence identity ii a de novo clustering using Mothur resulting in 518 246 OTUs and iii a new high-resolution Deblur protocol resulting in 83 908 unique bacterial sequences.

Pie charts below show the total number of samples right and the number of samples where the submitted sequence is present left based on the scientific names of the host followed by the significantly enriched host names containing the submitted sequence using either presenceabsence binomial test or relative frequency-based ranksum test.
