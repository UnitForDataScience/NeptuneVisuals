and as we now reveal also play a role in behavioural pho- toacclimation Aggregation of cryoconite into granules thus en- hances community production by supporting a stable cooper- ative microbial community enabling physical migration to cope with the extreme glacier surface environment.Behavioural downregulation of photochemistry chloroplast movement andor cell positioning within the sediment has therefore been demonstrated for cryoconite phototrophic com- munities but what is the role of physiological downregulation in the form of NPQ in green algae and diatoms and state tran- sitions in cyanobacteria for these phototrophs Calculation of NPQ from the change in maximum fluorescence yield during in- creasing incremental RLCs indicated an initial reversal of NPQ retained from exposure to ambient light prior to measurements highlighting NPQ as an important mechanism of downregula- tion employed by cryoconite communities in situ.

Photoacclimation of the cryoconite phototrophic community on Longyearbreen Svalbard was investigated using in situ variable chlorophyll fluorescence.

These findings demonstrate that cryoconite phototrophs combine multiple forms of physiological and behavioural downregulation to optimise light exposure and maximise photosynthetic productivity.

This plasticity of photoacclimation enables them to survive productively in the high-light stress environment on the ice surface.Keywords cryoconite photoacclimation downregulation non-photochemical quenching productivity fluorescenceINTRODUCTIONCryoconite cryo  ice conite  dust is an important compo- nent of the glacier ecosystem.

Microorganisms in cryoconite are typically sourced from the surrounding environ- ments and include cyanobacteria microalgae archaea bacte- ria fungi and heterotrophic protists Cameron Hodson and Os- born  Edwards et al.
