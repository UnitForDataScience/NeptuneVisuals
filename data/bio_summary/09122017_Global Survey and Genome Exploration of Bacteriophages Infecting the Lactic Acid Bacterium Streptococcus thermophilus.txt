While thevast majority of phages could be grouped using this method eight isolates did not yield an amplicon using this PCR system employing either fresh lysate or extracted DNA as template material discussed further below.Three main criteria were used to select phages for sequencingi phages which did not return a PCR product using the above mentioned phage grouping PCR and which were therefore considered novel ii persistence andor prevalence as determined by similar phages being isolated persistently from the same dairy factories or phages infecting two or more distinctS.

For the purpose of this study the results and discussion thereof below pertain to the subset of 40 phages whose genomes were sequenced unless otherwise indicated.As indicated in Table 1 cos-containing phages were the most frequently detected phage group both in the 120-phage collection as a whole as well as within the selected 40 phages a dominance also observed--though to varying degrees-- in previously analyzed phage collections Zago et al.

Total genomic DNA was qualitatively analyzed by agarose 1 Sigma-Aldrich gel electrophoresis on which the samples were separated at 100 V for at least 20 min.Unique phages were distinguished prior to DNA sequencing by restriction profile analysis using EcoRV or HaeIII FastDigest Thermo Scientific enzymes whereby a reaction mixture containing 8 ul phage DNA 1 ul enzyme 2 ul 10X FastDigest Buffer and 9 ul sterile distilled water sdH2O was incubated at 37C for 17 min prior to electrophoretic examination as described above.Multiplex PCR Detection of PhagesPCR multiplex detection of S. thermophilus phage groups was performed using phage DNA as template and is a modification of a previously described method Quiberoni et al.

The complete nucleotide sequences of a total of 26 cos-containing phages 10 pac-containing phage and four 5093 group phages were determined with the genomes of the four 987 group phages presented elsewhere McDonnell et al.

Adsorption to wild-type and antireceptor-incubated cells was calculatedas follows control phage titer - sample phage titercontrol phage titer x 100.

Furthermore considering that the primers used to detect the 987 targeting Open Reading Frame 6 ORF6 of phage 9871 which encodes a conserved scaffolding protein and 5093 targeting ORF3 of phage 0095 which encodes a portal protein phage groups produce products of different sizes 707 base pairs bp and 983 bp respectively these newly designed primer sets are fully compatible with each other and with the cos and pac phage-detecting pairs Quiberoni et al.

Phage 0091 a cos-containing phage also infecting ST67009 was included as a negative control to indicate the specificity of RBP0095 in inhibiting the adsorption of phage 0095 but not that of phage 0091 Figure 6B.

The increased database of phage genomes provides a valuable knowledge resource to the dairy industry which relies on up-to-date phage detection and phage-host interaction information in order to successfully implement rotational schemes which minimize the economic impact of phage fermentation contamination.DECLARATIONThe datasets generated andor analyzed during the current study are available in the GenBank repository  under accession numbers KY705251- KY705290 inclusive.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSBM was involved in the experimental design and work and prepared the manuscript.

Members of this novel phage group appear to have evolved through a genetic exchange event between an S. thermophilus phage and an unknown member of the P335 group of L. lactis phages Labrie et al.

The reason for the observed dominance of cos-containing phages is not known.As noted above a total of eight phage isolates did not yield a PCR product using the standard cos- and pac-containing phage detection PCR.
