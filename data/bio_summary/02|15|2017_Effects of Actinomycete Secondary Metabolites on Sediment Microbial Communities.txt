b Phylum-level community composition.In this study we tested the hypothesis that secondary metabolites from marine sediment-dwelling bacteria affect microbial community composition.

The results provide insight into how low-abundance organisms may help structure microbial communities in ocean sediments.KEYWORDS chemical ecology marine sediments microbial communities secondary metabolitesFebruary 2017 Volume 83 Issue 4 e02676-16Applied and Environmental Microbiology 1cean sediments represent one of Earth's largest biomes yet we know relatively little about microbial diversity and function in these habitats.

While such competitive interactions have been addressed with marine bacteria   it remains unknown how competitive interactions structuresediment microbial communities.The competitive strategies employed by bacteria range from rapid growth and mineral chelation to the production of allelopathic secondary metabolites .

Furthermore it will be important to determine the MICs of the extracts against the test strains to better understand the relationships between these activities and the results observed in the mesocosm studies.In conclusion we found that marine actinomycete secondary metabolites had consistent effects on microbial community structure in mesocosm experiments.

Although this species may be a rare member of the bacterial community its mycelial growth form and ability to secrete biologically active secondary metabolites suggest that it could have a major impact on localized community struc- ture thereby contributing to sediment microbial heterogeneity.

nov. two carotenoid- and squalene-producing marine bacteria of the family Ver- rucomicrobiaceae within the phylum Verrucomicrobia isolated from marine animals.

In this study we used next-generation amplicon sequencing to assess native microbial community composition in shallow tropical marine sediments.

are found in animal gut and marine environments until recently they were thought to prey exclusively on Gram-negative bacteria but new evidence suggests that they may also be capable of preying on Gram-positive bacteria .

Moreover bacteria in these communities produce antibiotics and other bioactive secondary metabolites yet little is known about how these compounds affect microbial community struc- ture.

Results from beta diversity analyses performed using QIIME  suggested that the S. arenicola treatment community began changing at the first time point while the medium extract control community remained relatively stable until time point 3 72 h T3 after which there was a large shift Fig.
