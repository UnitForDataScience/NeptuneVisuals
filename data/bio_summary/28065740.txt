However lipid A is the only component to be recognized by the innate immune system 72 through a receptor complex that includes LPS binding protein LBP CD14 toll-like receptor 4 TLR4 and MD2 73.Components of this LPS-sensing receptor complex are expressed by peripheral sensory neurons including nodose ganglion neurons 74 TRPV1-positive nociceptor trigeminal neurons 7576 and dorsal root ganglia DRG neurons 77-80.

Second peripheral sensory neurons - olfactory chemosensory neurons and nociceptor sensory neurons - detect bacterial toxins formyl peptides and lipopolysaccharides LPS through distinct molecular mechanisms to elicit smell and pain.

The intrinsic neurons of the gut form the enteric nervous system ENS which forms a complete sensorimotor reflex circuit consisting of intrinsic primary afferent neurons IPANs interneurons and motor neurons contained entirely within the gut wall.

Gut bacterial modulation of homeostatic functionIn addition to influencing the enteric nervous system and gut motility Section 4 short chain fatty acids SCFAs have also been linked to the gut-brain-axis through neural circuits that are activated by sensory afferents that feed into the hypothalamus and to efferent nerves within the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system.Indeed Gpr41 one of the receptors for SCFAs has been reported to be expressed in various parts of the peripheral nervous system that constitute the gut-brain axis including nodose neurons DRG neurons and sympathetic ganglia neurons 157.Kimura et al.

Recent work shows that similar mechanisms are also present in mammals whose vomeronasal olfactory neurons and pain-sensing nociceptor neurons respond to bacterial effectors such as pore-forming toxins N-formyl peptides and various pathogen-associated molecular patterns PAMPs.

discovered that mouse vomeronasal olfactory neurons express subsets of FPRs Fpr-rs1 Fpr-rs3 Fpr-rs4 Fpr-rs6 and Fpr-rs7 5960.Accordingly fMLF a prototypical formyl peptide derived from E.coli 61 induced calcium influx in vomeronasal sensory neurons ex vivo 60.

Consistent with this observation LPS has been reported to directly activate sensory neurons via TLR4 eliciting calcium influx in trigeminal 7681 and DRG neurons 82.

Following LPS activation trigeminal and DRG neurons produce pain and nodose ganglia neurons modulate appetite nausea and fever.

CpG induced DRG neurons to express inflammatory mediators including prostaglandin E2 PGE2 and IL-1 and also increased expression of TRPV1 86.TLR3 and TLR7 have also been reported to be expressed in sensory neurons.

For example Vibrio cholerae cholera toxin or metabolites produced from the gut microbiota act on ECs to induce the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT also known as serotonin which act on enteric neurons to regulate peristalsis and secretions 121-123.Yang and ChiuPage 12Bacteria also activate resident immune cells of the gut which may signal to enteric neurons through immune mediators 124125.
