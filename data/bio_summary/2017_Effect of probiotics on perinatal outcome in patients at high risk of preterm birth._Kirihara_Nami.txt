patients administered probiotics for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis or the treatment of constipation at the obstetrician's discretion were defined as the probiotics pb group n  45. patients not administered probiotics were defined as the non- probiotics non-pb group n  76. in the pb group a probiotic had been administered daily at a dose of 3-6 g starting before gestation week 20 12.5 4.1 weeks until delivery.

probiotics reduced the incidence of camfuni- sitis with an adjusted or of 0.07 0.01-1.03 but this result was not statistically significant.the results from univariate and multiple regression analysis indicated that the use of probiotics was the only significant variable for normal vaginal flora table 5. crude and adjusted ors 95 ci of probi- otic administration for normal vaginal flora were 14.9 1.92-116 and 38.6 3.20-461 respectively.discussionin the present study we evaluated the effect of oral probiotics on perinatal outcomes.

the aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on perinatal outcomes.methods we retrospectively evaluated the effects of oral probiotics on perinatal outcome in patients at high risk of preterm birth.

probiotics are admin- istered for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis or treat- ment of constipation in pregnant women in our institution however the influence of probiotics on perinatal status is unknown.

significant dif- ferences between the groups were observed in gesta- tional age at birth 36.8 vs 34.6 weeks rates of preterm birth before 32 weeks 2.2 vs 25.0 birth weight 2712 g vs 2375 g and rates of cam 2.2 vs 15.8 and normal vaginal flora 97.8 vs 74.6. no differences were observed in rates of funisitis and neonatal gender between groups.factors influencing perinatal outcomesunivariate regression analysis showed that probiotics and fetal fibronectin were significant variables for pre- term birth before 32 weeks table 3. multivariate regression analysis confirmed that probiotics and fetal fibronectin were significant variables.

adjusted ors 95 ci for preterm birth before 32 weeks were 0.05 0.01-0.71 and 53.5 7.34-390 for probiotics and fetal fibronectin respectively.univariate regression analysis of camfunisitis showed that history of miscarriage fetal fibronectin and probiotics were significant variables table 4.1 2.219 25.0t-test.

previous reports have indicated that probiotics using lactobacillus were effective for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis2223 and although not elucidated the prevention of preterm birth if any- thing is negative.223-25 thus probiotics including clostridium might be a key to our results.our study does have some limitations.

probiotics containing streptococcus faecalis clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesenteri- cus were administered for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis or treatment of constipation starting at 12.5 4.1 weeks until delivery.

patients not administered probiotics were defined as the non-probiotics group.

in addition multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors influencing preterm birth before 32 weeks chorioamnionitisfunisitis and normal vaginal flora.results the probiotics group showed longer gestation higher birth weight lower rates of chorioamnionitis and higher rates of normal vaginal flora compared to the non-probiotics group.

multivariate regression anal- ysis showed that probiotics significantly suppressed preterm birth before 32 weeks and tended to suppress chorioamnionitisfunisitis.

the adjusted odds ratios 95 confidence interval for preterm birth before 32 weeks and chorioamnionitisfunisitis were 0.05 0.01-0.71 and 0.07 0.01-1.03 respectively.conclusions oral probiotics containing clostridium had a significant effect on the prevention of preterm birth before 32 weeks of gestation.key words chorioamnionitis clostridium preterm birth probiotic regulatory t cell.introductionnearly 90 of preterm births resulting from infections are caused by ascending infection via the vagina and abnormal vaginal flora is considered an important factor leading to premature birth.

herein we retrospec- tively evaluated the effect of probiotics on perinatal outcomes including preterm birth onset of chorioam- nionitis cam or funisitis and vaginal flora in preg- nant women at high risk of preterm birth.methodsstudy subjectsthe medical records of pregnant women with a high risk of preterm birth from 2008 to 2014 were collected from kagoshima city hospital.

the probiotics tablet adminis- tered was formulated with streptococcus faecalis 10 mgg clostridium butyricum 50 mgg and bacil- lus mesentericus 50 mgg.5routine screening of bacterial vaginosis in the first trimester in these patients was not performed.
