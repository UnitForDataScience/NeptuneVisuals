here we report the first genetic analysis of dental calculus from five neanderthals two individuals from el sidron cave in spain two individuals from spy cave in belgium and one individual from breuil grotta in italy and compare these data to a historic wild-caught chimpanzee n  1 and modern human n  1 as well as to low coverage sequencing of calculus from a wide-range of ancient humans supplementary table 1. to provide increased resolution of the diseases that may have affected neanderthals we also deeply sequenced 147 million reads dental calculus from the best-preserved neanderthal el sidron 1 which suffered from a dental abscess.size-based pcr-amplification biases can confound standard metabar- coding analyses for example sequencing of 16s ribosomal rrna amplicons of ancient dental calculus.

as a result the 16s amplicon datasets were excluded from down- stream analysis along with the neanderthal sample from the breuil grotta which failed to produce amplifiable sequences.the shotgun datasets consisted of short dna fragments 70 bp which complicated accurate identification of bacterial species using standard software such as mg-rast or diamond  see supplementary information.

to process the 16s amplicon data sequences were de-multiplexed using the casava pipeline and joined into amplicons using fastqjoiner ea-utils.

as a result neanderthal diet remains a topic of considerable debate with limited data on the specific animals and plants directly consumed or the potential effects on neanderthal health and disease.although genomic studies continue to reveal evidence of inter- breeding between anatomically modern humans and neanderthals across eurasia little is known about the health consequences of these interactions.
