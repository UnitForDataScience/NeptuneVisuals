.Global gene expression of EHEC strains O2621765 and O157EDL933 in ground meat with or without background microbiotaWe set out to investigate the effects of ground beef back- ground microbiota on the overall gene expression of EHEC strains O2621765 and O157EDL933 by comparison with their behavior in beef without microbiota.

We then used strand-specific RNA-seq to investigate the effects of the ground beef background microbiota on the overall gene expression of EHEC strains O2621765 and O157EDL933 by comparison with their behavior in beef meat without microbiota.MethodsBacterial strainsThe EHECs used in this study were 0157H7 strain EDL933 O157EDL933 and O26H11 strain 21765 O2621765 iso-lated from Michigan ground beef and human fecal samples respectively and linked to human EHEC infections .Sample preparationA single beef piece of about 11 kg taken from a local slaughterhouse was kept 72 h at 4 degC before processing in our laboratory.

This permease is known to be maximally expressed under anaerobic condition when intracellular nickel is scarce the rcnA gene encoding a membrane bound polypeptide RcnA described as a cobalt and nickel efflux system in E. coli  the feoB gene encoding the polytopic membrane protein FeoB which is essential for FeII uptake  note that feoB has been described as one of the most prevalent virulence genes in UPECs isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infection  and the fecR gene encoding the FecR protein the sensor that recognizes iron III dicitrate in the periplasm Table  The results of the transcriptomic analysis of O2621765 suggest that iron and nickel could be more bioavailable in ground beef with microbiota and their transporters might be repressed in response to these external stimuli.Other down-regulated genes Three 590016 690023 and 710001 and two Z4363 and 5408 genes annotated as putative transcriptional regulators were down-regulated respectively in O2621765 and O157EDL933 strains Fig.

For our experimental design the choice of two strains one isolated from Michigan ground beef O157EDL933 and one from human fecal samples O2621765 enabled us to gain information of continuing importance for understanding the biology of EHECs in general and the strain-specific ad- aptations of strains O157EDL933 and O2621765 in particular.In strain O2621765 95 genes were expressed at signifi- cantly lower levels in ground beef samples with microbiota and 28 were significantly up-regulated.

The method- ology developed was designed for describing the effects of ground beef background microbiota on the overall gene expression of EHEC strains O2621765 and O157EDL933 by comparison with their behavior in beef with no microbiota.

These were the four metBELR genes involved in methionine biosynthesis or regulation the gltD gene which encodes glutamate synthase NADPH small chain precursor grxA encoding glutaredoxin 1 redox coenzyme ribonucleotide reductase and ybdL encoding a PLP- dependent methionine aminotransferase Table .Expression of the nfi gene encoding endonuclease V EndoV was also repressed in O2621765 grown in ground beef with microbiota.

This is the first study to use strand-specific RNA-seq to investigate the effects of ground beef back- ground microbiota on the overall gene expression of EHEC strains O2621765 and O157EDL933.

A total of 2852952 bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences obtained from 3 samples ground beef with natural microbiota and ground beef inoculated with strain O2621765 or strain O157EDL933 were analyzed.

Then we applied strand-specific RNA-seq to investigate the effects of this microbiota on the global gene expression of EHEC O2621765 and O157EDL933 strains by comparison with their behavior in beef meat without microbiota.

The up-regulated NO response mechanisms in ground beef without microbiota may allow the pathogen to adapt to sublethal environmental conditions and enhance its re- sistance to chemicals typically used as preservatives.Genes implicated in the bacterial pathogenicity of EHECs The peR gene was down-regulated in strain O157EDL933 Table This gene encodes a perosamine synthetase essential for the production of O antigen.
