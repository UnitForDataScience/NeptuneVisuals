.global gene expression of ehec strains o2621765 and o157edl933 in ground meat with or without background microbiotawe set out to investigate the effects of ground beef back- ground microbiota on the overall gene expression of ehec strains o2621765 and o157edl933 by comparison with their behavior in beef without microbiota.

this permease is known to be maximally expressed under anaerobic condition when intracellular nickel is scarce the rcna gene encoding a membrane bound polypeptide rcna described as a cobalt and nickel efflux system in e. coli  the feob gene encoding the polytopic membrane protein feob which is essential for feii uptake  note that feob has been described as one of the most prevalent virulence genes in upecs isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infection  and the fecr gene encoding the fecr protein the sensor that recognizes iron iii dicitrate in the periplasm table  the results of the transcriptomic analysis of o2621765 suggest that iron and nickel could be more bioavailable in ground beef with microbiota and their transporters might be repressed in response to these external stimuli.other down-regulated genes three 590016 690023 and 710001 and two z4363 and 5408 genes annotated as putative transcriptional regulators were down-regulated respectively in o2621765 and o157edl933 strains fig.

then we applied strand-specific rna-seq to investigate the effects of this microbiota on the global gene expression of ehec o2621765 and o157edl933 strains by comparison with their behavior in beef meat without microbiota.

the method- ology developed was designed for describing the effects of ground beef background microbiota on the overall gene expression of ehec strains o2621765 and o157edl933 by comparison with their behavior in beef with no microbiota.

these were the four metbelr genes involved in methionine biosynthesis or regulation the gltd gene which encodes glutamate synthase nadph small chain precursor grxa encoding glutaredoxin 1 redox coenzyme ribonucleotide reductase and ybdl encoding a plp- dependent methionine aminotransferase table .expression of the nfi gene encoding endonuclease v endov was also repressed in o2621765 grown in ground beef with microbiota.

we then used strand-specific rna-seq to investigate the effects of the ground beef background microbiota on the overall gene expression of ehec strains o2621765 and o157edl933 by comparison with their behavior in beef meat without microbiota.methodsbacterial strainsthe ehecs used in this study were 0157h7 strain edl933 o157edl933 and o26h11 strain 21765 o2621765 iso-lated from michigan ground beef and human fecal samples respectively and linked to human ehec infections .sample preparationa single beef piece of about 11 kg taken from a local slaughterhouse was kept 72 h at 4 degc before processing in our laboratory.

in o2621765 the norr gene encoding an no-responsive regu- lator norr  was down-regulated table .in our study the ytfe gene was down-regulated in o2621765.

for our experimental design the choice of two strains one isolated from michigan ground beef o157edl933 and one from human fecal samples o2621765 enabled us to gain information of continuing importance for understanding the biology of ehecs in general and the strain-specific ad- aptations of strains o157edl933 and o2621765 in particular.in strain o2621765 95 genes were expressed at signifi- cantly lower levels in ground beef samples with microbiota and 28 were significantly up-regulated.

the up-regulated no response mechanisms in ground beef without microbiota may allow the pathogen to adapt to sublethal environmental conditions and enhance its re- sistance to chemicals typically used as preservatives.genes implicated in the bacterial pathogenicity of ehecs the per gene was down-regulated in strain o157edl933 table this gene encodes a perosamine synthetase essential for the production of o antigen.

atcc 39006 production of antibiotics has also been reported in serratia plymuthica rvh1 and serratia marcescens strain 12 these observations suggest that the presence of ground beef background microbiota might induce multi- drug resistance in ehecs by stimulating transcription of e. coli drug resistance genes such as mara which has been described as sufficient to give e. coli multiple antibiotic resistance .genes implicated in stress response the pspd gene encoding the peripheral inner membrane phage-shock protein pspd was up-regulated in o157edl933 table expression of the pspd gene is known to be associated with membrane stress and in response to conditions such as phage attack heat shock and hyperosmotic stress and exposure to certain metabolites thus the presence of adventitious microbial activity or phage could induce specific stresses in e. coli.

the criter- ion whether or not to discard an up-regulated gene was a score of nucleotide identity between the altered gene and any other gene provided by genbank as being part of the genome sequencing data of the identified genus by 16s meta-genomic analysis of more than 50 across 80 or more of their length.this constraint also influenced our sequencing strategy sequencing mode paired-end sequencing library-type strand-specific cdna library and choice of the read length 125 bp.

a large initial ehec inoculum 3 log greater than the natural microbiota counts was chosen to en- sure that the meat microbiota present at an initial level of about 104 cfug would not impair the growth of either o157edl933 or o2621765 as expected after 7 days of incubation no flora were detected in the inner part of the muscle used as control whereas in the outer part about 8 log cfug of each type of bacteria aerobic and lab were counted additional file table s1.

overall of 5611 coding sequences of strain o2621765 95 were expressed at significantly lower levels in samples with microbiota compared to those without microbiota and 28 were significantly up-regulated fig.

this protein and l-lactate perme- ase encoded by the lldp gene allow e. coli to grow in a medium containing l-lactate as the sole carbon source transcription of glpa which encodes a sn-glycerol-3- phosphate g3p dehydrogenase glpa was also repressed in o2621765 table under anaerobic conditions g3p dehydrogenase glpa converts g3p to dihydroxyacetone phosphate  this latter compound is converted intoglyceraldehyde-3p entering the gluconeogenesis pathway thus in ground meat the presence of microbiota seems to repress the transcription of several genes involved in the assimilation of gluconeogenic substrates such as glycerol-3p and l-lactate.
