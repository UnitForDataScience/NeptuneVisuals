found that promoter DNA methylation ofBNC1 and ADAMTS1 is a potential biomarker to detect early-stage PCs and the promoter methylation status of these genes in circulating DNA from serum is a promising strategy for early detection of PC.42Non-Coding RNAsAccumulating evidence shows that ncRNA profiles especially miRNAs and lncRNAs are cell-specific and tumor-specific43 and may be used as diagnostic markers.microRNAsSpecific miRNA profiles in PC tissues that are different from those of normal tissues chronic pancreatitis tissues and other digestive cancer tissue have been described.44 In addition nor- mal duct cells accumulate several histological and molecular abnormalities including miRNAs that lead to invasive PC.45 miRNAs extracted from pancreatic tissue pancreatic juices blood plasma sera bile salivary and stool of patients with PC have shown potential diagnostic value46-54 Table 2.

Overview of early detection for pancreatic cancer.

Glypican-1 expression on PC-derived exosomes can identify 100 of patients with late-stage PC and distinguish patients with precancerous pancreatic lesions from those with benign pancreatic diseases.77 However the method for isolating PC- related exosomes should be simplified for use in the clinic.Applications of Metabolomics in Early Detection of PCMetabolomics is one of the most rapidly developing technol- ogies in the field of -omics and denotes the comprehensive analysis of low molecular-weight compounds and their path- ways.91 Although the Warburg effect is not universally appli- cable to all cancers metabolic reprogramming in particular glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is common and augments anabolic reactions linked to cell growth and proliferation.92Because of the harsh local environment surrounded by a pronounced desmoplastic and hypovascular microenviron- ment metabolic alterations play crucial roles in regulating the progression of PC.93 Identification of metabolomic differ- ences between PanIN and PC tissues and sera is beneficial for a better understanding of the mechanism of cancer devel- opment and the establishment of diagnostic strategies target- ing the early stage of PC.The metabolic profiles and characteristic metabolites of PanIN and PC tissues were analyzed using 1 H nuclear mag- netic resonance spectroscopy based on DMBA-induced SD rat models with screening for differential metabolites.

One metabolome cannot be easily decomposed to a specific single marker that will designate the disease state99 rather multiple metabolomic features might be neces- sary for accurate description of a developing cancer.
