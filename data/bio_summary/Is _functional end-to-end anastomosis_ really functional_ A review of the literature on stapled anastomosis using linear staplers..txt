a large rct conducted in 1993 showed a significant reduction in the incidence of intra- operative fecal contamination with stapled anastomosis p  0.02 and a non-significant decrease in anastomotic leakage hand-sewn 8.3  stapled 2.8  respectively .a meta-analysis comparing stapled ileocolic anastomo- sis to hand-sewn anastomosis was reported in 2011 .

other surgical techniques such as stapled anastomosis are developed in a similar manner which makes the assessment of these surgical techniques difficult.the history of the development of stapled side-to-side anastomosisstapled side-to-side anastomosis sssa using a linear cut- ter stapler was first reported by steichen .

in the systematic review of stapled ileocolic anastomosis  and ileostomy closure  the study items did not distinguish between isoperistaltic and antiperistaltic anastomosis table .the clinical assessment of stapled anastomosis in ileocolic anastomosis and ileostomy closureileocolic anastomosis is used in the resection of right-sided colon cancer and is commonly performed in crohn's dis- ease when a patient has an obstruction andor intestinal fistula in the same lesion.

although it was a retrospective study a multivariate analysis showed that stapled anastomosis is the only risk factor for postop- erative anastomotic leakage .with regard to the incidence of other specific postopera- tive complications after ileocolic anastomosis many arti- cles have reported the superiority of stapled anastomosis in comparison to hand-sewn anastomosis.

the reduced risk of reoperation for recurrent cd after stapled anastomosis has also been shown   .a systematic review which analyzed multiple prospec- tive rcts and retrospective studies of stapled ileocolic anastomosis in cd was reported in 2014 .

stapling devices are widely used because stapled anastomosis sa can shorten operation times.

antiperistaltic stapled side-to-side anastomosis sssa using linear staplers is a popular sa technique that is often referred to as functional end-to-end anastomosis feea.

however the use of the terms functional end-to-end masayuki kano 1 department of frontier surgery chiba university1-8-1 inohana chuo-ku chiba chiba 260-0856 japananastomosis andor feea could cause confusion for surgeons and researchers and should therefore be avoided.keywords functional end-to-end anastomosis  stapled anastomosis  linear staplerintroductionmany automatic anastomotic techniques have been applied to the field of gastrointestinal surgery  .

antiperistal- tic stapled side-to-side anastomosis sssa is sometimes referred to as functional end-to-end anastomosis feea  .

in this respect stapled anasto- mosis is compatible with laparoscopic surgery which has a long duration time in comparison to open surgery.

this review includes a critical assessment of the pertinent literature and a discussion on the mixed reviews and experimental articles on the technique.methodswe performed a search of the pubmed database using the search terms stapled anastomo andor functional end- to-end andor side-to-side anastomo and ileocolic anastomo andor ileostomy closure and focused on articles that reported the use of sa for colon cancer andor crohn's disease and ileostomy closure.resultsthe theory and practice of anastomosisgoulder et al.

anastomoses can be classified as follows end-to-end or side-to-side  isoperistaltic or anti- peristaltic and  stapled or hand-sewn.
