A large RCT conducted in 1993 showed a significant reduction in the incidence of intra- operative fecal contamination with stapled anastomosis p  0.02 and a non-significant decrease in anastomotic leakage hand-sewn 8.3  stapled 2.8  respectively .A meta-analysis comparing stapled ileocolic anastomo- sis to hand-sewn anastomosis was reported in 2011 .

Other surgical techniques such as stapled anastomosis are developed in a similar manner which makes the assessment of these surgical techniques difficult.The history of the development of stapled side-to-side anastomosisStapled side-to-side anastomosis SSSA using a linear cut- ter stapler was first reported by Steichen .

Two studies showed statistically that stapled anastomosis is superior to the hand-sewn method with regard to the incidence of anastomotic leakageSSSA stapled side-to-side anastomosis HEEA hand-sewn end-to-end anastomosis OR odds ratio RD relative difference RR risk ratioa OR 95  CI b RD 95  CI c RR 95  CIantimesentrium in a side-to-side manner with a linear sta- pler and to close the two connected stumps with double stapling .

In the systematic review of stapled ileocolic anastomosis  and ileostomy closure  the study items did not distinguish between isoperistaltic and antiperistaltic anastomosis Table .The clinical assessment of stapled anastomosis in ileocolic anastomosis and ileostomy closureIleocolic anastomosis is used in the resection of right-sided colon cancer and is commonly performed in Crohn's dis- ease when a patient has an obstruction andor intestinal fistula in the same lesion.

Although it was a retrospective study a multivariate analysis showed that stapled anastomosis is the only risk factor for postop- erative anastomotic leakage .With regard to the incidence of other specific postopera- tive complications after ileocolic anastomosis many arti- cles have reported the superiority of stapled anastomosis in comparison to hand-sewn anastomosis.

The reduced risk of reoperation for recurrent CD after stapled anastomosis has also been shown   .A systematic review which analyzed multiple prospec- tive RCTs and retrospective studies of stapled ileocolic anastomosis in CD was reported in 2014 .

Is functional end-to-end anastomosis really functionalA review of the literature on stapled anastomosis using linear staplersMasayuki Kano1  Naoyuki Hanari1  Hisashi Gunji1  Koichi Hayano1  Hideki Hayashi1  Hisahiro Matsubara1Received 24 August 2015  Accepted 30 November 2015  Published online 17 March 2016c Springer Japan 2016AbstractPurposes Anastomosis is one of the basic skills of a gas-trointestinal surgeon.

Stapling devices are widely used because stapled anastomosis SA can shorten operation times.

Antiperistaltic stapled side-to-side anastomosis SSSA using linear staplers is a popular SA technique that is often referred to as functional end-to-end anastomosis FEEA.
