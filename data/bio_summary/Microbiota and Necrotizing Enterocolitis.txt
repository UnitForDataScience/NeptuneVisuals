the poorly understood patho- genesis of nec makes it difficult to develop a cure for the illness 16 17.the interplay between various factors including the developmentally regu- lated inflammatory response of the immature innate immune system hypoxia ischemia reperfusion free radicals and the presence of substrates and bacterial endotoxins is currently thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of nec 1 17-22. the roles excessive proinflammatory responses of the imma- ture innate immune system bacterial endotoxins toll-like receptors and dys- biosis of the gut microbiota play have become a research priority to improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of nec 18 19 23-27. this brief review is focused on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of nec in preterm vlbw infants.role of microbiota in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitisno specific pathogen has been consistently associated with nec despite the wide agreement that gut microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of this condition 28. a range of microorganisms including bacteria viruses and fungal species has been associated with nec in preterm infants and the same microbe species are often found in gestation-matched healthy infants 27 29- 31. proving a causative relationship between a specific pathogen and nec is thus difficult even during clustered outbreaks of the condition 32 33. in a pro- spective case-control study peter et al.

it occurs in 4-6 of preterm infants with very low birth weight vlbw 1500 g and 9-14 of infants with extremely low birth weight elbw 1000 g 1-6. nec stage ii is associated with significantmortality 25 and morbidity including recurrent late-onset sepsis pro- longed dependence on parenteral nutrition need for surgery survival with in- testinal failure and long-term neurodevelopmental impairment 1-3 7-13. the outcomes are worse in elbw infants needing surgical intervention for nec 5 9 14. the mortality could be as high as 100 in those with extensive full- thickness necrosis of the gut 5 9 14. the socioeconomic burden of stage ii nec is significant considering the prolonged hospital stay and long-term con- sequences of the illness 1 15. advances in neonatal intensive care have result- ed in an increase in the absolute number of survivors of extreme prematurity who are at high risk of nec.

these findings support the role of a diminished diversity of the gut microbiome and prolonged exposure to antibiotics in the development of nec 63.discussionoverall the current evidence indicates that in contrast to the healthy adult gut microbiota the early postnatal gut microbiota of preterm infants is simple very diverse and dynamic and plays an important role in the development of nec 28. given the number of factors involved in shaping the early gut microbiota in preterm infants including the mode of delivery gestational and postnatal age type of milk feeds exposure to antibiotics in the early pre- and postnatal period and exposure to gastric acid inhibitors it is not surprising that the results of gut microbiota studies in preterm infants are difficult to interpret 64-69. differ- ences in the methodology for assessing the gut microbiota further complicate the issue.
