the spbc group had the highest removal rate of inorganic p. although the total p content in the mixed- culture groups was similar to that in the mono-culture groups the removal rate of inorganic p in the mixed-culture groups increased significantly p  0.05 indicating that p removal from ecosystems is not highly correlated to the growth of plants.

removal rate  0 resulting from 1 the spbc group had the minimum aerobic microorganism level b required to generate the lowest organic matter biodegradation performance and 2 the spbc group had relatively higher biomass  which would cause it to ''bleed out more root exudates that provided more cod than the total amount of biodegradation.different from the cod removal rate the mixed-culture groupsshowed a significantly p  0.05 higher tn removal rate 54.1-i17010me180cy190161w8c 161w5c10me170 i160cy170 181w8c181w9c10me160183w6c64.0 as compared to the monoculture groups 49.2-53.0 regardless of the spc group 55.9 .

thus we believed that substrate absorption complexation is the key mechanism of inorganic p removal in cws which has also been reported in pre- vious studies  .conclusionin this study the mixed-culture improved tn and tp removal efficiencies significantly but had lower cod removal rates.

although the total n uptake in the spa group was higher than that in the spab and spbc groups  the tn removal efficiencies in the spab and spbc groups were significantly higher than in the spa group p  0.05.shows the different removal rates of inorganic p mainly po3- among the six planting groups.

these findings demonstrate that plant uptake and utilization is not the main mechanism of inorganic p removal because some inorganic p elements will rapidly return into the substrate during inorganic p accumulation in plant tissues and root cells.

the nutrient con- centrations in the plant tissues were calculated as follows  ci 14 dci1 x w1thth dci2 x w2thth dci3 x w3th d2thwhere ci is the nutrient concentrations i stands for n or p w w0 is the total biomass of one species g w1 is the biomass of the leaves g w2 is the biomass of the stems g w3 is the biomass of the roots g ci1 is the concentration of nutrients i stands for n or p w in the leaves ci2 is the concentration of nutrientsi stands for n or p w in the stems and ci3 is the concentration of nutrients i stands for n or p w in the roots.photosynthesisat the end of august a portable photosynthesis system ciras- 2 hitchin uk was used to measure the photosynthetic traits and physiological characteristics pn tr gs of the samples.

as shown in  the cod removal rates in the mixed-culture groups 41.4-43.1 were significantly lower p  0.05 than that in the monoculture groups 52.6-61.9. it has been reported that biodegradation and aerobic conditions are main factors contribut- ing to the removal of organic matter .

the removal rates were sig- nificantly impacted by plant richness where the removal rate of the mixed-culture groups 85.8-92.8 was significantly higher p  0.05 than that of the monoculture groups 69.9-80.2. how- ever the figure also reveals that the type of plant combination is extremely important i.e.

mixed-culture groups improved the removal efficiency of tn and tp significantly but exhibited lower cod removal rates.

previous studies have demonstrated that the photosynthesis of plants can affect the oxygen production and pollutant removal rates in differ- ent cws .to improve pollutant removal efficiency in cws it is essential to investigate the effect of plant biodiversity in cws through monitor- ing their physiological functions.

in particular there have been no reports on the relation between pollutant removal rates in cws and microbial communities in different plant compositions using a comprehensive analysis involving pca and plfa.in this study a new and suitable cws planting allocationmethod was used as a candidate method by which to improve pol- lutant removal capacity because the applied aquatic plants are located in northeast china and can survive in areas where they are under environmental stress i.e.

cod and nh-n were analyzed according to the standard protocol of the national environmental protection agency of china 2002. the removal rate was calcu- lated as follows removal rate dth14 121 - dvout x coutvin x cinth x 100 d1thwhere vout is the cw effluent volume l cout is the cw effluent concentration mgl vin is the cw effluent volume l and cin is the cw effluent concentration mgl.after 6 months the plants and substrate samples were har- vested.

in addition n and p removal capacity of the spab and spabc groups were also enhanced by addition of species a. the above phenomenon could be affected by fungi the representative microorganisms of pc1 spa spab and spabc serving as a host microbe can improve the transformation of nutrients from roots to shoots in host plants and provide a stabilization pathway by substantially enhancing soil structure  further help microcosms remove pollutants significantly.removal rate of pollutants according to different plant compositionsabove we illustrated that plant compositions can dramatically affect morphological traits including biomass root size and leaffig.
