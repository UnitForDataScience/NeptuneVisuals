the SPBC group had the highest removal rate of inorganic P. Although the total P content in the mixed- culture groups was similar to that in the mono-culture groups the removal rate of inorganic P in the mixed-culture groups increased significantly P  0.05 indicating that P removal from ecosystems is not highly correlated to the growth of plants.

Effect of plant species compositions on performance of lab-scale constructed wetland through investigating photosynthesis and microbial communitiesShishu Zhu Xiaochen Huang Shih-Hsin Ho  Li Wang Jixian YangState Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology Harbin 150090 PR Chinah i g h l i g h t s The mixed-culture groups improved TN and TP removal capacities significantly.Total biomass and N P uptake were affected by species richness and type.Microorganisms displayed significant variances in the different plant compositions.Fungi mainly existed in SPA SPAB and SPABC to elevate the N P accumulation.g r a p h i c a l a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f oArticle historyReceived 15 November 2016Received in revised form 9 January 2017 Accepted 11 January 2017Available online 13 January 2017KeywordsPlant species richness Constructed wetland Pollutant removal Photosynthesis Microbial communitiesa b s t r a c t This study focused on the effects of plant compositions on removal rates of pollutants in microcosms through investigating rhizosphere microbial populations photosynthetic efficiency and growth charac- teristics.

The nutrient con- centrations in the plant tissues were calculated as follows  Ci 14 dCi1 x W1Thth dCi2 x W2Thth dCi3 x W3Th d2Thwhere Ci is the nutrient concentrations i stands for N or P w W0 is the total biomass of one species g W1 is the biomass of the leaves g W2 is the biomass of the stems g W3 is the biomass of the roots g Ci1 is the concentration of nutrients i stands for N or P w in the leaves Ci2 is the concentration of nutrientsi stands for N or P w in the stems and Ci3 is the concentration of nutrients i stands for N or P w in the roots.PhotosynthesisAt the end of August a portable photosynthesis system CIRAS- 2 Hitchin UK was used to measure the photosynthetic traits and physiological characteristics Pn Tr Gs of the samples.

Thus we believed that substrate absorption complexation is the key mechanism of inorganic P removal in CWs which has also been reported in pre- vious studies  .ConclusionIn this study the mixed-culture improved TN and TP removal efficiencies significantly but had lower COD removal rates.

removal rate  0 resulting from 1 the SPBC group had the minimum aerobic microorganism level b required to generate the lowest organic matter biodegradation performance and 2 the SPBC group had relatively higher biomass  which would cause it to ''bleed out more root exudates that provided more COD than the total amount of biodegradation.Different from the COD removal rate the mixed-culture groupsshowed a significantly P  0.05 higher TN removal rate 54.1-i17010Me180cy190161w8c 161w5c10Me170 i160cy170 181w8c181w9c10Me160183w6c64.0 as compared to the monoculture groups 49.2-53.0 regardless of the SPC group 55.9 .

The removal rates were sig- nificantly impacted by plant richness where the removal rate of the mixed-culture groups 85.8-92.8 was significantly higher P  0.05 than that of the monoculture groups 69.9-80.2.

These findings demonstrate that plant uptake and utilization is not the main mechanism of inorganic P removal because some inorganic P elements will rapidly return into the substrate during inorganic P accumulation in plant tissues and root cells.

Although the total N uptake in the SPA group was higher than that in the SPAB and SPBC groups  the TN removal efficiencies in the SPAB and SPBC groups were significantly higher than in the SPA group p  0.05.shows the different removal rates of inorganic P mainly PO3- among the six planting groups.

Mixed-culture groups improved the removal efficiency of TN and TP significantly but exhibited lower COD removal rates.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the photosynthesis of plants can affect the oxygen production and pollutant removal rates in differ- ent CWs .To improve pollutant removal efficiency in CWs it is essential to investigate the effect of plant biodiversity in CWs through monitor- ing their physiological functions.
