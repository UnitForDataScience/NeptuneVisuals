removal rate  0 resulting from 1 the SPBC group had the minimum aerobic microorganism level b required to generate the lowest organic matter biodegradation performance and 2 the SPBC group had relatively higher biomass  which would cause it to ''bleed out more root exudates that provided more COD than the total amount of biodegradation.Different from the COD removal rate the mixed-culture groupsshowed a significantly P  0.05 higher TN removal rate 54.1-i17010Me180cy190161w8c 161w5c10Me170 i160cy170 181w8c181w9c10Me160183w6c64.0 as compared to the monoculture groups 49.2-53.0 regardless of the SPC group 55.9 .

the SPBC group had the highest removal rate of inorganic P. Although the total P content in the mixed- culture groups was similar to that in the mono-culture groups the removal rate of inorganic P in the mixed-culture groups increased significantly P  0.05 indicating that P removal from ecosystems is not highly correlated to the growth of plants.

Thus we believed that substrate absorption complexation is the key mechanism of inorganic P removal in CWs which has also been reported in pre- vious studies  .ConclusionIn this study the mixed-culture improved TN and TP removal efficiencies significantly but had lower COD removal rates.

The removal rates were sig- nificantly impacted by plant richness where the removal rate of the mixed-culture groups 85.8-92.8 was significantly higher P  0.05 than that of the monoculture groups 69.9-80.2.

Mixed-culture groups improved the removal efficiency of TN and TP significantly but exhibited lower COD removal rates.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the photosynthesis of plants can affect the oxygen production and pollutant removal rates in differ- ent CWs .To improve pollutant removal efficiency in CWs it is essential to investigate the effect of plant biodiversity in CWs through monitor- ing their physiological functions.

In particular there have been no reports on the relation between pollutant removal rates in CWs and microbial communities in different plant compositions using a comprehensive analysis involving PCA and PLFA.In this study a new and suitable CWs planting allocationmethod was used as a candidate method by which to improve pol- lutant removal capacity because the applied aquatic plants are located in Northeast China and can survive in areas where they are under environmental stress i.e.

Although the total N uptake in the SPA group was higher than that in the SPAB and SPBC groups  the TN removal efficiencies in the SPAB and SPBC groups were significantly higher than in the SPA group p  0.05.shows the different removal rates of inorganic P mainly PO3- among the six planting groups.

The aim of this study was to improve the pollutant removal rates of constructed wetland microcosms via different plant compositions and to analyze the growth characteristics and microbial communities around roots.
