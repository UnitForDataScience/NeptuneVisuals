Lowmiddle and high levels contained the lower middle and upper 33rd percentiles respectively of subject FI34 low 0-0.083 middle 0.091-0.137 high 0.142-0.365 or chronological age low 43-61 middle 62-66 or high 67-79 to ensure even group sample sizes for comparison between FI34 and chronological age as correlates of OTU abundance.

FI34 score negatively correlates with stool sample richness.The total number of observed unique sequence variants denoised sequenced read clusters in each sample observed richness and the evenness of sequence variants in each sample based on the inverse Simpson evenness index were calculated and plotted against FI34 scores and chronological age A-B and C-D respectively.

Point colors indicate subject FI34 or chronological age groups separated into low blue middle gray or upper red 33rd percentiles ofSignificant differentially abundant genera between high and low and middle and low FI34 scores were identified.

Thus gut microbial com- munity structure varies according to subject FI34 scores and tends to be similar between subjects of similar FI34 score but not so for those of similar chronological age.

Correlation statistics between OBNB richness and FI34 as well as OBNB and chronological age were significantly different p  .05.Two indices of evenness were evaluated and compared for their potential association with chronological or biological age.

Biological age A and C and chronological age B and Dp values are corrected for subject body mass index sex sample read depth family membership antibiotic usage and chronological age or FI34.

Overall these data suggest the relative phylogenetic similarity of stoolmicrobial communities based on subject biological age but not chronological age.Taxon Correlates Distinguish Biological From Chronological AgeSubject FI34 and chronological age were assigned to low middle and high tertiles for OTU differential abundance analysis.

The remaining genus-level OTUs failed to significantly correlate in abun- dance with FI34 score or chronological age Supplementary Figures 3 and 4.Genus-Level Subcommunities Correlate With Biological Agethe full A FI34or B chronological age range.

Subjects with high FI34 scores compared with those with low FI34 exhib- ited increased abundance of Coprobacillus q  0.08 Dialister q  0.08 and a TM7 candidate-phylum OTU false-discovery rate q  0.04 .

Middle FI34 compared with low FI34 was associated with greater TM7 candidate-phylum OTU abundance q  0.04 log2 fold-change  3.06.
