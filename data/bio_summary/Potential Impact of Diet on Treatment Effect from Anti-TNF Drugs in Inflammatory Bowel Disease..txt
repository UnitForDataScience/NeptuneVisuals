Further studies using hypothesis-driven and data-driven strategies in prospective observational animal and interventional studies are warranted.Keywords lifestyle factors chronic inflammatory diseases treatment result treatment response diet meat intake dietary pattern food mucosa associated bacteria epithelium-associated bacteria microbiome fibre intake personalized medicine mucus sulphate-reducing bacteria mucin-degrading bacteria Western style diet anti-TNFIntroductionInflammatory bowel diseases IBD including Crohn's Disease CD and ulcerative colitis UC are chronic lifelong illnesses of early onset that substantially affect the life quality of the patients and their families -.

Thus diet modification may represent directions for future treatment and preventative strategies.ConclusionsDiet and other lifestyle factors may potentially impact the treatment response to anti-TNF drugs.

Elemental diet therapy ED is high-calorie liquid diets containing primarily amino acids that are absorbed by the small intestine without digestion and was originally developed as food for astronauts who worked for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the 1960s .One prospective study on diet and anti-TNF treatment in IBD was identified.

There is however some evidence for the impact of diet on disease course and treatment results from other studies .One study of 191 UC patients with prospective sampling of diet information using a food frequency questionnaire FFQ reported 52 patients had a relapse according to the simple clinical colitis activity index SCCAI within one year .

Some of these mechanisms may also work in treatment response mechanisms although the evidence for an involvement in anti-TNF treatment response is scarce.New Understanding of Impact of Diet on Gut InflammationLow levels of fibre may change the gut microbial metabolism from primarily using microbial derived short chain fatty acids to using mucinous carbohydrates as the main energy source Figure  .Figure 2.

Hence our exploratory pharmacogenetic studies indicate that the genetic make-up of the host may define the response to anti-TNF treatment and may involve gut-microbe interactions.Different mechanisms likely define the treatment response in the small intestine and in colon.

45-2115-7790Received 8 February 2017 Accepted 10 March 2017 Published 15 March 2017Abstract We wanted to investigate the current knowledge on the impact of diet on anti-TNF response in inflammatory bowel diseases IBD to identify dietary factors that warrant further investigations in relation to anti-TNF treatment response and finally to discuss potential strategies for such investigations.

One small prospective study on diet and anti-TNF treatment in 56 patients with CD found similar remission rates after 56 weeks among 32 patients with good compliance that received concomitant enteral nutrition and 24 with poor compliance that had no dietary restrictions 78 versus 67 p  0.51.

A meta-analysis of 295 patients found higher odds of achieving clinical remission and remaining in clinical remission among patients on combination therapy with specialised enteral nutrition and Infliximab IFX compared with IFX monotherapy OR 2.73 95 CI 1.73-4.31 p  0.01 OR 2.93 95 CI 1.66-5.17 p  0.01 respectively.In conclusion evidence-based knowledge on impact of diet on anti-TNF treatment response for clinical use is scarce.
