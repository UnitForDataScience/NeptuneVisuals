In addition Cerso- simo et al 73 analyzed the composition of ruminal methanogens using 454 pyrosequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA gene amplicons generated from a pair of primers specific for methanogens while Fouts et al 74 investigated the ruminal fungal diversity using a fungal-specific 18S rRNA primer pair Table 3.

Kim et al 12 first retrieved all the 16S rRNA gene sequences of both ruminal bacteria and archaea deposited in the RDP database and then conducted a meta-analysis of the retrieved sequences to examine the collective bacterial and archaeal diversity in the rumen.

AnotherNeocallimastigales-specific qPCR primer set targeting the 5.8S rRNA gene was first validated by Edwards et al 61 but few studies have ever used it.Several recent papers investigated the bacterial communities in the lower GI tract of pre-weaned calves and steers using qPCR 6263 and these studies advanced our limited knowledge about the microbiome residing in the small and large intestines and its roles in post-ruminal feed digestion.

Frey et al 65 detected methanogens in the duodenum of lactating dairy cows but it remains to be determined if they are live methanogens.PHYLOGENETIC MICROARRAYA phylogenetic microarray is a 16S rRNA gene chip composed of a large number of oligonucleotide probes.

Caporaso et al 76 developed a workflow to examine bacterial diversity using the Illumina GAIIx platform by analyzing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA genes Table 3.
