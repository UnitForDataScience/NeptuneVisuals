viable from clouds and atmospheric samples  where their presence is particularly interesting for many reasons plant pathogenicity and epidemiology degradation of organic compounds in clouds  production of siderophores and interactions with iron and radical chemistry  production and release of surfactants which could facilitate the formation of cloud water droplets  ice nucleation which in clouds can trigger precipitation hypothesized as bioprecipitation e.g.. sphingomonas are pigmented oligotrophic bacteria frequently described as psychrotolerant bacteria recovered from polar environments and air samples .

this consortium of active microorganisms finally revealed provides crucial information for further research on the interactions existing between microbial communities and abiotic processes in clouds as well as important insights into the aerial dispersion of microorganisms.material and methodssample collectionthree cloud water samples were collected during the fall 2013 from the atmospheric station at the summit of puy de dome mountain 1465 m a.s.l.

the detection of eventual environmental drivers prokaryotic total dna fraction and active rna fraction community composition in the cloud water samples at the phylum level aand relative distributions of proteobacteria orders b.such as meteorological variables to the microbial communities observed was beyond the scope of this study.

on top of this some atmospheric corridors connecting distant regions together and defining some extent of bio-geographical distribution of microorganisms on the planet have been identified .airborne communities are sorts of blurred airborne imprints of surface ecosystems gather- ing and overlapping with each other in clouds a set of microorganisms able to maintain meta- bolic activity in clouds was identified among complex communities.

here microbial communities in cloud water collected at puy de dome mountain's meteoro- logical station 1465 m altitude france were fixed upon sampling and examined by high- throughput sequencing from dna and rna extracts so as to identify active species among community members.

twenty-four hours backward tra- jectory plots of the air masses sampled were computed for the puy de dome's site 45.772 n 2.9655 e 1465 m above sea level using the noaa hysplit trajectory model hybrid sin- gle-particle lagrangian integrated trajectory  using gdas 1degree meteorological data archive and default parameters for this site.nucleic acids extraction amplification and sequencingdna and rna were extracted separately from dedicated filter halves using mobio power- water isolation kits for dna and for rna respectively following manufacturer's recommen- dations and including a dnase treatment step on rna extracts.

this ecological theory that functional stability implies even structure derives from established ecosystems and it is applied here for apprehending the functioning of cloud's microbial communities in the frame of clouds as microbial habitats hypothesis it is possible though that this is not applicable to environments acting mainly as transport areas where microbial establishment is by essence not possible like clouds.any microbe inhabiting a surface environment has a probability to get aerosolized though more or less promptly depending on its physiological characteristics e.g.

in all samples the community was largely dominated by 4 bacterial phyla which represented 75 to 79 of the reads in dna datasets and 85 to 88 in rna  proteobacteria 28 to 51 of the dna reads in particular the gamma- 6-21 alpha- 2-21 and beta- 3-12 classes bacteroidetes 5-30 firmicutes 5-18 and actinobacteria 6-13. these phyla are almost systematically reported dominant in outdoor airborne bacterial communities studies e.g.

this process was implemented using the pipeline panam phylogenetic anal- ysis of next-generation amplicons and is described in more detail in .the resulting otus were subjected to additional conservative filtering intended to remove potential sequencing artefacts otus represented by less than 3 reads contaminants otus detected in the control samples and phantom otus otus detected in rna and not in the dna fraction of the corresponding sample totals of 761 729 and 140 645 reads and 48 202 and 37 504 reads remained in the dna and rna fractions for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively.

ascomycota were previously reported dominant in the active fraction of airborne fungi  and in basidiomycota sporodiobolales includes yeasts frequently isolated from cloud water samples at the same site rhodotorula and sporobolo- myces  however if rnadna ratio gives hints about potentially active eukaryotes ribo- some gene number is intrinsically more variable than it is in prokaryotes  so estimating their actual relative activity in cloud water will necessitate more investigations.our investigations revealed an incredible richness in the atmosphere originating from a variety of different sources and meeting in clouds.

rarefaction curves were plotted using the ggplot2 package version 2.2.0  from community analyses made with the vegan package version 2.4.1  venn diagrams were made using venny 2.1.0 .resultssamples characteristicsthe basic biological chemical and meteorological features of the cloud water samples investi- gated are shown in  these were usual for clouds collected at the puy de dome mountain's atmospheric observatory .

a relationship between human activities and microbial communities structure in clouds was reported in china  with higher diversity in non-polluted clouds.

here using molecular methods we investigate the structure of cloud water microbial communities and clarify our current vision of clouds as habitats by identifying active members.

another study rather pointed out an impact of day and night on the composition of bacterial communities in clouds a higher representation of alpha-proteobacteria during the night notably was reported  but the reasons for such trend are not clear.clouds are environments open to all but where only some can thrive active groupsamong the high diversity of cloud microbial communities some were capable of maintaining met- abolic activity in cloud despite probable stressful conditions.

prokaryotes including bacteria and archaea contributed 6.6 millions reads in dna and 1.5 million reads in rna abbreviated into 16sdna and 16srna respectively and eukaryotes 2.5 millions reads in dna and 1.1 million reads in rna 18sdna and 18srna respectively.
