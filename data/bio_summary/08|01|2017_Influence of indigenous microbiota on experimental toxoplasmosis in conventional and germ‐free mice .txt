We conclude that despite similar survival curves CV animals succumb to an exaggerated inflammatory response whereas GF mice fail to produce an adequate systemic response.Keywordsgerm-free mice gut inflammation microbiota Toxoplasma gondii toxoplasmosisToxoplasma gondii has a broad worldwide distribution and approximately one-third of the human population is serum positive for the parasite Tenter et al.

Infected cells secrete cytotoxic molecules that attract neutrophils macrophagesmonocytes and T cells Mennechet et al.

The latter induces macrophages dendritic cells and enterocytes to produce microbicidal molecules such as NO which should eliminate the parasite Buzoni-Gatel et al.

Comparisons of germ-free GF and conventional CV animals have confirmed a role for the indigenous microbes in inflammatory and immune response.c 2017 The Authors.International Journal of Experimental Pathology c 2017 International Journal of Experimental Pathology191Intestinal microbiota plays an important role in host animal homoeostasis Sartor 2010 Martins et al.
