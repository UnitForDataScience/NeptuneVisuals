The 16S sequen- cing analysis of faeces from M-SHIME recipient mice revealed that relative to a range of actual M-SHIME samples and faecal samples from conventional mice from ongoing microbiome-related studies M-SHIME recipient mice had microbiomes that although distinct from both aforementioned groups were much closer in overall composition to M-SHIME microbiomes indicating that our approach preserved much of the basic nature of the M-SHIME microbiota many weeks fol- lowing transplant A.

Analogously the dietary emulsifiers CMC and P80 induce a moderate disturb- ance of microbiota in WT mice that associates with low-grade inflammation and metabolic disease but promotes robust colitis associated with a more severe alteration of gut microbiota com- position in mice lacking IL-10 or TLR5.On the one hand the ability of the host and microbiota to influence each other precludes the use of microbiota-free hosts ie GF mice or host-free microbiotas eg M-SHIMEs in fully defining how CMC or P80 or other substances ultimately impacts the host or microbiota.

Transfer of both emulsifier-treated M-SHIME microbiotas to germ- free recipient mice recapitulated many of the host and microbial alterations observed in mice directly treated with emulsifiers.Conclusions These results demonstrate a novel paradigm of deconstructing host-microbiota interactions and indicate that the microbiota can be directly impacted by these commonly used food additives in a manner that subsequently drives intestinal inflammation.INTRODUCTIONA panel of chronic inflammatory diseases is asso- ciated with alterations in the species andor genomic composition of the intestinal microbiota.

Gut 2017661414-1427. doi10.1136gutjnl-2016-313099the observation that transfer of microbiota from diseased hosts--either mice or humans--to GF mice can transfer some features of disease suggests that disease-associated alterations in microbiota composition are not purely a consequence of dis- eases but rather play a role in driving disease development.

Such inflammation was associated with low-grade inflammation and metabolic disease in wild-type WT mice and increased incidenceseverity of overt colitis in interleukin-10 IL-10-- mice which are prone to this disorder.

We observed that P80 and CMC altered the microbiota in the M-SHIME model in a manner reminiscent of and capable of recapitulating their effects previously observed in mice thus suggesting that the microbiota may be a key direct target of CMC and P80.METHODSMiceC57BL6 mice were maintained in gnotobiotic conditions in a GF or altered Schaedler flora ASF state in a Park Bioservices isolator as previously described.

Experiments used both male and female mice comparisons within a gender except for and that used female mice.

ASF mice were established by colo- nising WT C57BL6 GF mice with the complete ASF eight strains using faeces purchased from ASF Taconic Hudson New York USA and resuspended in drinking water.Fasting blood glucose measurementMice were placed in a clean cage and fasted for 5 hours or 15 hours.

For clustering analysis on principal coordinate plots categories were compared and stat- istical significance of clustering was determined via Permanova.RESULTSCMC and P80 do not impact intestinal microbiota or host in ASF miceIn order to investigate the extent to which CMC and P80 might impact the host andor microbiota in mice with a limited defined pathobiont-free microbiota we administered CMC and P80 to mice colonised exclusively with ASF.

Moreover in ASF mice CMC and P80 admin- istration did not result in microbiota encroachment L M mucus thinning or features of low-grade inflammationmeta- bolic syndrome that are induced by these compounds in mice with a complex microbiota.Together these results argue against the notion that these emulsifiers have a strong direct effect on the host and rather suggest the possibility that more subtle effects on a complex microbiota may be proximal mediators of the effects of these compounds.P80 alters microbiota composition in the M-SHIME model Having not observed an impact of CMC and P80 on a host lacking a complex microbiota we next used the converse approach of examining how these compounds impacted a complex microbiota in the absence of a host by using the M-SHIME model.
