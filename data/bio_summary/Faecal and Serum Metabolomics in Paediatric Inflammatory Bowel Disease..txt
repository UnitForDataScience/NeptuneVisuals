in crohn's disease serum creatine and taurocholic acid showed signifi- cant negative associations with bmi pearson's r-0.494 p0.012 and r-0.463 p0.02 respectively but creatinine and the amino acids methionine proline tryptophan lysine and alanine showed a positive association with bmi pearson's r between 0.402 and 0.517 and p between 0.008 and 0.047. there were however no data available on energy intake of the patients but samples of treatment naive patients were taken while fasting.faecal calprotectin level a surrogate marker of intestinalinflammation showed correlation with various faecal metabolites carnosine ribose-5-phosphate choline aminoadipic acid taurine glyceraldehyde and l-methinone in uc.

the second sample set consisted of 12 follow-up samples available from first sample set crohn's n6 ucibdu n6 and additional samples from 18 newly diagnosed patients no medica- tion crohn's n10 ucibdu n8 as a validation cohort.

in faecal samples no pathways were significantly altered in crohn's disease data not shown whereas in faecal samples of uc patients the majority of the studied pathways were perturbed when compared to controls taurine and hypotaurine metabolism being the most highly enriched pathways .we further investigated the metabolite differentiations local-ized to colitis in both crohn's disease and uc.

we show that both blood and faecal metabolites can be used to classify crohn's disease and uc patients and separate themfrom healthy subjects providing new options for diagnostics and treatment.subjects and methodswe invited 6- to 17-year-old native finnish patients with ibd treated at the gastroenterology unit of the children's hospital helsinki university finland to this prospective study on metabolomics.

intriguingly a recent spectroscopy-based study on adult ibd patients reported that for strati- fication of crohn's disease and uc the metabolites holding differential power primarily belonged to a range of amino acids microbiota-related short chain fatty acids and lactate suggesting an inflammation-driven malabsorption and dysbiosis of the normal bacterial ecology.unlike our paediatric patients all the adult patients were on maintenance medi- cation at least partially modifying the observed results.4.1.

the serum and faecal metabolomics were determined using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer.results serum and faecal metabolite profiles in newly diagnosed paediatric ibd patients were different from healthy controls and categorized crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis uc patients into separate groups.

secondly after analysing the first sample set of patients undergoing diagnostic investigations we invited 12 of the included patients n51 to provide a follow-up sample once while recruiting additional patients undergoing diagnos- tic investigations for ibd n18 validation cohort.

in faecal samples we found that crohn's disease patients showed in general low or intermediate levels of metabolites that were more abundantly present in paediatric uc.

unlike serum samples metabolomic analyses of faecal samples clearly showed elevated levels of all the top metabolites except cytosine in uc as compared to crohn's disease and controls .
