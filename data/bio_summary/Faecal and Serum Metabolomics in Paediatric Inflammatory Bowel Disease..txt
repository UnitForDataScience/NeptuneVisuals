The second sample set consisted of 12 follow-up samples available from first sample set Crohn's n6 UCIBDU n6 and additional samples from 18 newly diagnosed patients no medica- tion Crohn's n10 UCIBDU n8 as a validation cohort.

In faecal samples no pathways were significantly altered in Crohn's disease data not shown whereas in faecal samples of UC patients the majority of the studied pathways were perturbed when compared to controls taurine and hypotaurine metabolism being the most highly enriched pathways .We further investigated the metabolite differentiations local-ized to colitis in both Crohn's disease and UC.

We show that both blood and faecal metabolites can be used to classify Crohn's disease and UC patients and separate themfrom healthy subjects providing new options for diagnostics and treatment.Subjects and MethodsWe invited 6- to 17-year-old native Finnish patients with IBD treated at the Gastroenterology unit of the Children's hospital Helsinki University Finland to this prospective study on metabolomics.

Intriguingly a recent spectroscopy-based study on adult IBD patients reported that for strati- fication of Crohn's disease and UC the metabolites holding differential power primarily belonged to a range of amino acids microbiota-related short chain fatty acids and lactate suggesting an inflammation-driven malabsorption and dysbiosis of the normal bacterial ecology.Unlike our paediatric patients all the adult patients were on maintenance medi- cation at least partially modifying the observed results.4.1.
