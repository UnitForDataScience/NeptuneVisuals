The scatter plot is of principal coordinate 1 PC1 vs principal coordinate 2PC2.Environmental parameters such as nutrient availability and cation so- lubility are often related to soil pH  and these factors may cause changes in pH that affect the microbial community composition.Microbial community structureMicrobial communities exposed to heavy metals pollution change those microorganisms that are susceptible to toxins abruptly decrease while resistant organisms adapt to the altered conditions thereby al- tering microbial community structure .

However As and Hg had no obvious effect on microbial community structure.Relationship between microbial abundance and environmental parametersSpearman's rank-order correlation was used to analyze correlations among environmental parameters and microbial abundance .

However Acidibacter Blastocatella Flavo- bacterium and Pedobacter had increased in varying degrees in L-site.Relationship between microbial community structure and environmental parametersResults of PCA revealed that bacterial communities from different soil samples were clustered according to their type  which may be due to the influence of environmental factors.Results of CCA showed a clear association between microbial community structure and environmental factors .

The effect of SOM pH and Zn on the microbial community structure were highly significant P  0.01 and the effect of Cd Pb and H2O were significant P  0.05 indicating that these environmental factors were the key factors affecting microbial community.

However data regarding the relationship be- tween soil microbial community structure and heavy metal bioavail- ability are limited .Microbial community structure can play a role in the community's ability to achieve different functions but also can resist environmental interference .

This helps us to ex- plore the interaction between heavy metals and soil microbial com- munities to elucidate the mechanism by which heavy metal pollution changes microbial community structures.For this purpose an experiment was conducted in contaminated fields located in Zhen'an County of Shangluo City Shaanxi Province China.

The relationship be- tween microbial abundance and SOM pH was similar to that of most soil microorganisms with Cd Pb Zn and Hg.SOM appears to be important for shaping microbial community structure.

We came to the conclusion that the microbial community of contaminated soil has changed compared with healthy soil and environmental factors SOM pH Zn Cd Pb and H2O had a significant effect on microbial com- munity structure.

Our findings are crucial to understanding microbial diversity in heavy metal polluted soils of China and can be used to evaluate microbial communities for scientific applications such as bioremediation projects.IntroductionSteady economic development in China threatens soil ecosystems due to excessive mining activities .
