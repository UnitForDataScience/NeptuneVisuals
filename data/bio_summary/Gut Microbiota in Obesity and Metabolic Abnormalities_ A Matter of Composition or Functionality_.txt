since a higher microbial diversity has consistently been associated with a healthier profile and it may be worth investigating whether despite the decrease in microbial diversity with these restrictive diets the functional core and its metabolic capa- bilities are maintained.although there is no consensus on which type of gut microbiome-modulating diet will induce a better metabolic profile studies in obesity and metabolic complications show that the baseline microbiota composition can signifi- cantly influence or predict individual responsiveness to metabolic improvements .

thus future intervention studies should aim at modulating not only the composition but also the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiota.gut microbial metabolites in obesity and metabolic complicationswhile metagenome data provide information on the com- munity's potential metabolic pathways they do not neces- sarily reflect the actual metabolic pathways used by the gut microbiota .

together these findings highlight the importance of considering medications in gut microbiome studies without doing so it will be even harder to distin- guish whether any alteration in the gut microbiota is caused by the medications used or by the underlying disease .gut microbiota and obesityas discussed in a comment published earlier this year by peter turnbaugh a pioneer of gut microbiome-obesity research even after a decade of research on animal models demonstrating the contribution of gut microbiota to host adiposity the field struggles to provide answers on the role and signature of the gut microbiota in human obesity .

longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether the reduced microbial di- versity and richness are a cause or consequence of obesity and eventually intervention studies aimed at increasing gut microbiota diversity might aid in the treatment of the disease.in conclusion the most consistent results among gut mi- crobiota compositional studies indicate that obesity is char- acterized by a low abundance of certain taxa such as rikenellaceae and oscillospira as well as a decreased di- versity of bacterial communities .

thus more studies are needed to corroborate the role of gut microbiota in the circulating levels of amino acids and to dissect their relationship not only with insulin resistance and obesity but also with the development of hypertriglyceridemia.strategies to modulate bmi through gut microbiota- focused interventionsgiven the role of microbiota in human obesity there has been an increasing interest in interventions targeted at modulating microbiome composition and functionality and thus improving host metabolic phenotype.

a limited number of studies have assessed the functional effects of gut micro- biota and their metabolome in the host reporting increased functional annotations related with the use of amino acids carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolites .hence the generation of further knowledge on the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota related to weight-loss and remission of metabolic complications will be key in the development of therapeutic strategies that allow the modulation of the intestinal microbiota.

while animal and human studies have demonstrated that a gut microbiota imbalance or dysbiosis is associated with obesity  it remains controversial whether the role of gut microbiota in the development of this disease is causal.

in recent years the num- ber of large-scale studies of gut microbiota composition has grown significantly and recent reports are increasingly ac- counting for the confounders between gut microbiota and host physiology.

since the number of studies on gut microbiota differences between normal- weight overweight and obese humans is still low in this section we also discuss studies testing for an association with bmi particularly those with a large sample size.

although more studies are needed to confirm these findings it may be worth per- forming mechanistic studies to determine if this taxon par- ticipates in weight regulation.a consistent finding in shotgun sequencing studies of different populations is the previously reported depletion of genus akkermansia in subjects with a high bmi .

thus the participation of the gut microbiota in the metabolism of bile acids strengthen its role as an important regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism which in turn is linked to the develop- ment of obesity and metabolic complications.there is a paucity of studies in animal models describing the role of bile acids in weight regulation and obesity .

nevertheless additional studies are warranted to identify the role of the gut microbiota in modulating bile acid pools in humans and thus explore their modulation as a mechanism underlying the development of obesity and metabolic complications.tmaotrimethyl-amine-n-oxide tmao is a product derived from bacterial metabolism as well as from food sourcesi.e.

over- all these studies support the idea that metabolically compromised individuals harbor an inflammation- associated microbiota.metagenomics studies in human obesity and metabolic complications are still scarce.

there is thus a clear need for more studies specif- ically aimed at investigating the role of scfas in human metabolic complications.despite the well-known role of some bacterial species in the production of some of these scfas studies assessing which bacteria within the gut contribute to scfa produc- tion in humans are still scarce.
