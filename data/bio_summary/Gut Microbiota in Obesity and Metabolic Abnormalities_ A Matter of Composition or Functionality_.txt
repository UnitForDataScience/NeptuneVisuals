Since a higher microbial diversity has consistently been associated with a healthier profile and it may be worth investigating whether despite the decrease in microbial diversity with these restrictive diets the functional core and its metabolic capa- bilities are maintained.Although there is no consensus on which type of gut microbiome-modulating diet will induce a better metabolic profile studies in obesity and metabolic complications show that the baseline microbiota composition can signifi- cantly influence or predict individual responsiveness to metabolic improvements .

Thus future intervention studies should aim at modulating not only the composition but also the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiota.Gut Microbial Metabolites in Obesity and Metabolic ComplicationsWhile metagenome data provide information on the com- munity's potential metabolic pathways they do not neces- sarily reflect the actual metabolic pathways used by the gut microbiota .

In humans its abundance and gene rich- ness have been positively associated with a healthier metabolic status including a better body fat distribution and the absence of metabolic syndrome MetS .

Again and consistent with several reports in the literature higher diversity was associated with a healthier metabolic profile since it correlated negatively with triglyceride levels and with the presence of MetS .It is clear that more controlled case-control studies with a large sample size and which account for confounding factors are needed to corroborate current findings and recognize further taxa contributing to obesity and metabolic complications.

While it is not yet clear which metabolic pathways contribute to obesity the gut mi- crobiome of subjects with metabolic complications is en- riched in inflammatory pathways .

butyrate propionate and acetate e are the end products of polysaccharide fermentation a metabolic pathway that has been implicated in diverse functions in obesity and metabolic complications .

This will allow the development of precision medicine for the treatment and management of patients with obesity.ConclusionsThe gut microbiota has an enormous metabolic capacity able to influence multiple metabolic pathways in the host and to thus contribute to obesity.

Interestingly interventions aimed at modulating gut micro- biota and thus the metabolic profile could also contribute to unraveling the mechanism linking the gut microbiota with obesity and metabolic complications.

REVIEW ARTICLEGut Microbiota in Obesity and Metabolic Abnormalities A Matter of Composition or FunctionalitySofia Moran-RamosBlanca E. Lopez-Contrerasand Samuel Canizales-QuinterosaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia CONACYT Ciudad de Mexico MexicobUnidad de Genomica de Poblaciones Aplicada a la Salud Facultad de Quimica UNAMInstituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica Ciudad de Mexico MexicoReceived for publication September 27 2017 accepted November 15 2017 ARCMED-D-17-00539.The obesity pandemic and the metabolic complications derived from it represent a major public health challenge worldwide.

Thus the aim of the present review is to discuss structural and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome in human obesity challenges associated with multi-omic technol- ogies and advances in identifying microbial metabolites with a direct link to obesity and metabolic complications.To date studies suggests that obesity is related to low microbial diversity and taxon depletion sometimes resulting from an interaction with host dietary habits and genotype.
