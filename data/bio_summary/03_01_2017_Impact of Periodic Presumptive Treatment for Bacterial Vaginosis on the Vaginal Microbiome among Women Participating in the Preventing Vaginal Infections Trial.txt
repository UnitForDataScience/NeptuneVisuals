Bacterial vaginosis vaginal microbiome vaginal health interventions periodic presumptive treatment.Bacterial vaginosis BV is a highly prevalent vaginal infection affecting hundreds of millions of reproductive-aged women globally every year 1-3.

Prevalence of Bacteria at Levels Above the Lower Limit of Detection LLD and at or Above the Receiving Operating Characteristic ROC Curve Cutoff by Study Arm During Follow-upAbbreviations aRR adjusted relative risk A. vaginae Atopobium vaginae BVAB bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium CI confidence interval G. vaginalis Gardnerella vaginalis L. cris- patus Lactobacillus crispatus L. iners Lactobacillus iners L. jensenii Lactobacillus jensenii M. indolicus Mageeibacillus indolicus RR relative risk.aThe numerator represents the number of follow-up visits where the bacteria of interest was detected at levels above the LLD and the denominator is the number of follow-up visits with microbiome testing.bData are from generalized estimating equations with a log link and exchangeable correlation structure and clustered by participant.cData are from generalized estimating equations with a log link and exchangeable correlation structure and clustered by participant with adjustment for study site.dConvergence not achieved for the L. iners model with adjustment for site.Kenyan participants we observed reductions in the proportion of visits with values below the LLD in the intervention arm compared with the placebo arm for BVAB1 BVAB2 A. vagi- nae LeptotrichiaSneathia species Megasphaera species andM.

The present analysis extends the findings of the original trial by showing that this PPT regimen also reduces detectionand concentrations of species that are highly predictive of BV persistence and recurrence including BVAB2 A. vaginae LeptotrichiaSneathia species and Megasphaera species.

For each species we noted the log10 quantity correspondingto the highest proportion correctly classified as being BV posi- tive or BV negative on the basis of the Nugent score and calcu- lated the sensitivity and specificity for BV at that quantity value.

Changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations with intravaginal metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis as assessed by quantitative PCR.

Per protocol study prod- uct was withheld if a participant tested positive for pregnancy therefore we performed a sensitivity analysis that excluded vis- its where pregnancy was detected.Since we used qPCR assays which provide bacterial concen- trations rather than broad-range PCR with sequencing which provides relative abundance we planned to assess the impact of the intervention on bacterial concentration in addition to detec- tion.

The International infections in pregnancy IIP study variations in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and dis- tribution of morphotypes in vaginal smears among pregnant women.

However there is limited understanding of the impact of suppressive therapy on specific bacterial species in the vaginal microbiome.

Evidence suggests that specific vaginal bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis BV may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes in women.
