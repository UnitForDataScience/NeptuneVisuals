The primary bile acid CA which was derived from the conjugated endogenous bile acids by specific gut bacteria was much higher in Meihua than Landrace P  0.05 while the secondary bile acids DCA and LCA derived from the primary bile acids were significantly lower in Meihua compared with Landrace particularly for DCA P  0.05 Figure 2B.

2014.The mRNA expression of bile acid receptor FXR which is activated by unconjugated primary and secondary bile acids and inhibited by conjugated bile acids Wahlstrom et al.

Those 70 compounds included bile acids free amino acids dipeptides lipids nucleotides organic acids nitrogen-containing compounds and so on.

The result indicated that the high levels of SCFAs in the colon lumen of Landrace might be positively correlated with the expression of GPR41and SLC5A8 in colon mucosa.For bile acids in the colon lumen Landrace piglets had higher levels of the secondary bile acids LCA and DCA when compared to Meihua piglets.

During metabolism of bile acids taurine- or glycine-conjugated bile acids were found to escape from the distal ileum when reabsorbed to enterohepatic circulation.

Here we showed that the abundance ofbacterial genes bile salt hydrolase KO1442 related to secondary bile acid biosynthesis was higher in the colonic lumen of Meihua piglets while the absolute quantification of secondary bile acids DCA and LCA in the colon contents was lower.

In addition bile acids in the gut lumen can also directly regulate microbiotic functioning by serving as an antibiotic for bile sensitive bacteria or as a promoter for bile acid-metabolizing bacterial communities Hofmann and Eckmann 2006 Wahlstrom et al.

Landrace accumulated more short-chain fatty acids SCFAs and secondary bile acids in the colon lumen.

Collectively our results demonstrate for the first time that there were differences in the colonic microbiome and metabolome between Meihua and Landrace piglets with the most profound disparity in production of SCFAs and secondary bile acids.Keywords microbiome metabolome pig breeds colon short chain fatty acids bile acidsINTRODUCTIONThe gastrointestinal tract is a multi-function organ that harbors a dynamic microbiota population that interacts with the nutritional physiological and immunological functions of the host Brestoff and Artis 2013.
