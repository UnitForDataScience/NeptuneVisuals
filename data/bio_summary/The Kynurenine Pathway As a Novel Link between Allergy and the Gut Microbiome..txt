ido has also been shown to control dendritic cells maturation and migration .the first discovery of immunomodulatory effects of ido was unknowingly made in 1984 when pfefferkornobserved that ifn-g induced trp degradation and blocked growth of toxoplasma gondii in human fibroblasts what he actually observed was ifn-g activation of ido and the induction of the kyn pathway trpbreakdown and accumulation of kyn metabolites  .

while they tentatively explain some of the immunosuppressive effects mediated by ido-trp deprivation   the accumulation of the kyn pathway metabolites has been greatly ignored in these studies.activity of kyn pathway metabolitesin the past kyn catabolites were viewed as inert precursors for the formation of nad but newer findings have identified a number of physiological effects for these metabolites.

most critically though increasing evidence on germ-free mice and other early-life microbiome studies show that gut microbiota are key in determining the functioning of the kyn-ido pathway with its broad range of activities.evidence of gut microbial influence on trp concentrations and ido activity raises the question could targeting the gut microbi- ome to modulate trp metabolism and the kyn pathway treat or prevent diseases--specifically allergy studies of bifidobacterium infantis have reported increases of trp concentrations and kyn metabolites after colonization  .

concerning this delicate balance of initiation and suppression a growing body of research from the turn of the century has identified in particular the ido subset of the kyn pathway as having an active role in maintaining equilibrium between the two responses.although the primary link and majority of research on the immune function of the ido is on the rate-limiting enzyme ido-1 herein referred to ido due to its central role it is criti- cal to compare it to tdo.

as such we recommend further research on how this pathway may be a critical link between the microbiome and development of allergy.keywords kynurenine tryptophan allergy gut microbiome indoleamine 23 dioxygenaseintroductionthe indolamine 23-dioxegenase ido subset of the kynurenine kyn pathway of tryptophan trp degradation has long been acknowledged to contribute substantially to the control of general inflammation .

's th2-dependent allergic airway model the suppression of eosinophils and reduction of inflammation to achieve tolerance was dependent upon 3-kyn kyn and xa .in summary most agree that ido acts as a tolerogenic immu- nosuppressive enzyme to reduce allergic inflammation with the induction of the ido-kyn pathway resultant depletion of trp and elevation in kyn metabolites.

this induction of the ido pathway and subsequent immune sys-tem events help to limit allergic responses such that individuals remain unresponsive after being exposed to an allergen.the immunosuppressive role of ido in response to an allergen was initially realized through a study by bubnoff von et al.

as such additional work has to be done to solidify ido-2's differential role from the ido-1 isoform.regarding trp utilization by each pathway 95 of ingested trp is broken down via the kyn pathway 1-2 is used for protein synthesis and 1-2 for serotonin synthesis .

ultimately we will attempt to show that the kyn pathway may connect the development of allergic disease to the gut microbiome in infancy.trp metabolism and its immunomodulatory functionstrp degradation versus pathway metabolitesthe general function of the host immune system is to correctly distinguish between self and non-self and to initiate a protec- tive cascade of immune responses in the presence of a harmful non-self-antigen.

finally changes to circulating kyntrp ratios have been observed following experimental induction of gastrointestinal inflammation via introduction of a parasite and likely altered gut microbiota .the lowering of serotonin and kyn metabolite levels in the absence of gut microbiota and their restoration following the re-introduction of gut microbes indicates a key role for gut microbiota in the kyn pathway.

other metabolites of the kyn pathway have demonstrated activity as ahr ligands but differently from kyn.

for example serotonin directly regulates cell pro- liferation and cytokine production at the transcriptional level in leukocytes .the kyn pathway andor accumulation of kyn metabolites have also been shown to contribute to depressive-like behaviors which can be negated via exercise .

several studies have linked microbial- induced kyn pathway changes to the expression of colonocyte tlrs in germ-free mice    namely reduced tlr stimulation in germ-free mice has resulted in reduced trp metabolism.maternal microbiota postnatal immune development and the kyn pathwayimmediately after birth our gut microbiota is dominated by the lactic-acid bacteria bifidobacteria lactobacilli and enterococci .

essential to understanding the immunomodulatory effects of trp describes basic elements of its fate in the body and the kyn pathway.trp breakdown by kyn enzymesthe full library of kyn enzymes is only known to be fully expressed in hepatocytes tumor cells vascular endothelial cells fibroblasts and antigen-presenting cells apcs specifically dendritic cells monocytes and macrophages  .

the addi- tion of exogenous kyn metabolites kyn 3-haa qa 3-hk and picolinic acid to various immune cell subtypes showed that kyn metabolites can selectively inhibit active t-cells b-cells and nk cells at more physiologically relevant trp levels specifi- cally in the case of t-cell suppression than the trp depletion theory would suggest -.
