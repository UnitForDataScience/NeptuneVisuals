albopictus are of main public health concern.

albopictus subgroup.

albopictus coexist with populations of ae.

albopictus occur in sympatry with indigenous populations of ae.

albopictus in disease transmission has been poorly studied so far.

albopictus presents a relative homogenous structure among populations and studies on whole body from field-caught individuals highlighted a dominance of wolbachia pipientis walba and walbb which often co-occur at a prevalence of100 - these intracellular symbionts are in- volved in a control of the reproduction of ae.

albopictus through cytoplasmic incompatibility  this process results from aberrant offspring production between in- fected males and uninfected females or between hosts carrying incompatible wolbachia strains.
