The preparation of the mosquito's cibarial armature followed an adopted method given by Sirivana- karn The head of each female was cut off with a sharp razor blade and macerated with 10 KOH at 95 degC until clearance.

The sequences were then aligned using MUSCLE algorithm through SEAVIEW software and polymorphic haplotypes were determined using DnaSP v5.10  The haplotype Hd and nucleotidic p diversities were estimated with DnaSP v5.10.

The two generalist wsp primers 81 F 5'-TGG TCC AAT AAG TGA TGA AGA AAC-3' and 691R 5'- AAA AAT TAA ACG CTA CTC CA-3' were used The amplification protocol was held at 95 degC for3 min followed by 35 amplification cycles at 94 degC for 45 s 52 degC for 40 s 72 degC for 1 min and a final extension of 72 degC for 10 min.

The study of symbiotic interactions is a complex and dynamic system and previous experi- ments have revealed strong variations in symbionts composition when comparing laboratory-reared vs field- caught mosquitoes but also among individuals caught in different ecosystems -.

These modifications can be explained by host or symbiont population dynamics genetic drift bottleneck effect expansion modification of symbionts transmission-acquisition probability but also by modification of nutrients quality or abiotic fac- tors that could suggest a local adaptation of one or both partners and local variation of their interaction - The bacterial microbiota of Ae.
