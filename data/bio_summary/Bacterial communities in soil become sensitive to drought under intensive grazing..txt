In the less diverse inten- sively-managed soils adapting to drought required more drastic chang- es in the community suggesting that the tolerances of individual community members are key determinants of bacterial community dis- turbance responses .

However the effects of these combined stressors on soil bacterial communities are poorly understood .A wide range of studies on the disturbance-responses of bacterial communities generally finds that community functions may be main- tained despite disturbance likely due to the large numbers of bacteria performing the same functions in the extremely diverse soil microbial community.

This last finding adds a further complica- tion to determining the outcome of soil disturbance on the community as the responses may be dependent on the bacterial community struc- ture at the time of perturbation.Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and magnitudeof both flood and drought events and our results should be considered in conjunction.

Importantly the response of a given bacterial community to disturbance is highly dependent on the type of disturbance the presence organisms capable of withstanding the disturbance resistant as well as on the recovery time  .Here we studied the responses of soil bacterial communities under- lying sustainably- and intensively-managed Mediterranean agro-silvo- pastoral oak woodlands to month-long flood and drought simulations.

At a community level the potential for altered precipitation patterns to modify soil bacterial community structure has been previously explored  .

They decreased under flood and drought conditions 5 and 6 of the community on av- erage respectively but were at lower relative abundances in intensive- ly-managed soils under all conditions 2 of the community on average .

exhibited highest relative abundances in intensively-managed soils exposed to flooding and drought particularly on the 5th day of recoverytogether 14 of the community on average for both treatments slightly lower relative abundances in control soils 9.5 of the commu- nity on average and much lower ones in sustainably-managed soils 2 of the community on average for all treatments .

In an- other example an OTU matching Chloracidobacteria RB41decreased rel- ative to the controls from 0.3 to b 0.1 of the community in the flood treatment for sustainably-managed mesocosms but significantly in- creased relative to the controls from 0.2 to 0.4 of the community in flood and drought treatments for the intensively-managed mesocosms .DiscussionGiven the increase in anthropogenic pressures worldwide and the forecasted intensification of precipitation patterns it is crucial to under- stand whether the resilience of soil ecosystems under stress is impaired.

Kruskal-Wallis kh2 tests also revealed significant effects of management x treatment on richness kh2  14.687 p  0.040 and evenness kh2  16.582 p  0.020 as well as of management x time x treatment on richness kh2 16.102 p  0.003 and evenness kh2  18.183 p  0.001 suggest- ing that the communities changed in response to the treatments.Resistance of the bacterial community to treatment effectsTo characterize the control bacterial communities in both manage- ment regimes we analyzed the soil samples collected in the control mesocosms from all time points in each management type.

This also aligns with the finding that a soil bacterial community's propensity to invasion is determined by resource avail- ability and competitive dynamics  .Our findings thus highlight the complexity of soil bacterial commu- nity responses to real-world disturbances on multiple levels.
