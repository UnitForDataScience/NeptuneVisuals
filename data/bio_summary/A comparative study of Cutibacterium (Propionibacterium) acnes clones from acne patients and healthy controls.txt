The Leeds score of patients ranged from 3 to 8 mean 4.42.No growth of C. acnes was obtained from follicle samples of 5 patients and one control.Characterization of bacterial isolatesFor initial typing of all 795 isolates obtained from follicles and surface skin of patients and controls a combination of the allelic sequences of the housekeeping genes fba and recA were used ac- cording to the MLSA scheme .

The nucleotide patterns of 54 homopolymeric tracts previously identified in C. acnes genomes were inspected for differences associated with the clinical origin of the strains using the Sybil database available at as reference.Presence of plasmid DNA as detected in some C. acnes strains was examined by PCR amplification using four primer sets 1 Forward primer P1F GGGCACCTGTAAGCCTGTAT and Reverse primer PIR GATCGCGTGGGAGGTCTTC 2 Forward primer P2F ATTGCCCGTCCATGTCGATG and Reverse primer P2R CGAAACCGGCGTGGAAAAG and 3 Forward primer P3F TCTTGGTGCTATCGCCTTGG and Reverse primer P3R TGGGAC- GAGGTAGTCGAGTTA 4 Forward primer tadA GGGTAACCAT- GAGGTGGTTGandReverseprimertadA-rev CTGAACGGATCTGCTCAACA targeting four distinct and conserved loci in the plasmids previously detected in C. acnes strains .ResultsStudy subjectsThe 23 study subjects included 11 females 5 acne patients and 6 controls and 12 males 7 acne patients and 5 controls .

In acne patients the dominant types in follicles all belonged to the CC18 complex including ST 18 4 patients and ST 12 2 patients with the exception of one isolate belonging to the CC3 complex ST3.

Finally attempts to amplify several genes characteristic of plasmid DNA in C. acnes from both crude and purified cellular DNA resulted in amplicons only in strain 441L1.DiscussionThe present study was undertaken to obtain a detailed com- parison between the clonal complexity and dominant C. acnes clones in follicles from patients with moderate to severe acne and healthy individuals.

All patients were untreated for acne at least three months prior to sampling except patient 9 who had received oral tetracycline and topical adapalene treatment for 1 month before sampling.Skin samples and bacterial isolatesSebaceous follicles were sampled by cyanoacrylate biopsy from an acne-affected facial area of patients and from the side of the nose of controls.

If no growth was detected from follicles then up to 30colonies were isolated from facial skin of the person.PCR and sequencing of bacterial DNAPreparation of bacterial DNA and subsequent PCR and sequencing of internal fragments of the nine housekeeping genes cel coa fba gms lac oxc pak recA and zno was performed ac- cording to the multi locus sequence typing MLST scheme described previously .Genome sequencing and comparisonIn order to compare CC18 isolates from patients and controls eleven isolates including five from acne patients and six from controls were genome-sequenced by paired-end sequencing with 50X coverage using Illumina Hiseq 2000 technology and assembled at BGI Beijing China.

The dominating C. acnes clones in follicles from acne patients were exclusively from the phylogenetic clade I-1a and all belonged to clonal complex CC18 with the exception of one patient dominated by the worldwide-disseminated and often antibiotic resistant clone ST3.

The reason for this is not clear but it may be due to less C. acnes residing in the highly inflammatory lesions of patients with more severe acne as previously suggested .The use of furazolidone in agar plates inhibits the growth of other bacteria especially S. epidermidis and it is not known if interaction between these bacteria and C. acnes could lead to a different clonal distribution .
