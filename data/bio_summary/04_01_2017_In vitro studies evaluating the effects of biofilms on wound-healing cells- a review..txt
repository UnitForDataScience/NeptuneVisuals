The authors noted that after 5 h of incubation biofilms had formed on specimens inoculated with S. aureus and by 10-h biofilms had formed on specimensinoculated with P. aeruginosa 39.

Finally molecular analysis of chronic wounds of 2963 patients found similarity in the number of distinct bacterial species across each chronic wound type and that the peak number of different species per wound was between two and five species 17.Despite the prevalence of biofilms in wounds and their apparent contribution to woundchronicity investigators are just beginning to eluci- date the role of biofilms in chronic wound patho- genesis.

Investigations started with one host cell-type and single species biofilms and demonstrated that biofilms or their secretions had deleterious effects on wound-healing cells.

P. aeruginosa biofilms also impacted ker- atinocyte migration and proliferation coalesced and adhered to epidermal structures and multiplied in dermal matrices.More complex systems involved the use of multi- ple host celltissue types and single species biofilms.

21 found that S. aureus biofilms also significantly affect keratinocyte cytokine produc- tion.

31 investigated the effects of grow- ing S. aureus biofilms on explanted dermal tissues.

32 grew S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms in a collagen gel matrix containing serum proteins.

For example S. aureus biofilms were detri- mental to both keratinocyte and fibroblast migra- tion proliferation and viability.

Staphylococcus aureus biofilms elicited a strong inflammatory response from both keratinocytes and fibroblasts and had damaging effects on epidermal structures.

Staphylococcus aureus biofilms flourished in dermal matrices while also depleting oxygen from the envi- ronment.
