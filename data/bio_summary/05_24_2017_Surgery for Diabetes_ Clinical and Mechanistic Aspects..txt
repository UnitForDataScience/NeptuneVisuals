Caloric restriction leads to improved insulin sensitivity in the early and short-term period following bariatric surgery and facilitates long-term weight loss and stabilization.remission of type 2 diabetes via improved glycemic control and induction of weight loss on the basis of their known physiologic actions and subsequent changes in levels following bariatric surgery procedures.Glucagon-like peptide-1Glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 is an incretin peptide that is secreted into circulation within minutes of food ingestion through hormonal and neural signals via vagal stimulation .

Murine models of RYGB demonstrated an increase in the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Verrucomicrobiales that when transplanted into germ-free nonoperated mice resulted in weight loss and reduced adiposity supporting the concept that altered gut microbiota contributes to weight loss after bariatric surgery .It is interesting that Akkermansiamuciniphilia of the Verrubiales phylum is reduced in obese mice and its abundance is positively asso- ciated with improved glucose tolerance and number of GLP-1- producing enteroendocrine L cells suggesting that specific bacterial lineages may influence glycemic control .

Although there was improvement in glycemic control in the early postoperative period patients undergoing DJB had lower amounts of weight loss at 12 months 7 excess weight loss pro- gressive increases in glycated hemoglobin levels and low rates of diabetes remission 5 .

Although rodent models of obesity and bariatric surgery have demonstrated empirical support for changes in gut microbiota influencing weight loss and improve- ments in glycemic control after bariatric surgery further studies are still required to establish correlation and causality in human subjects.ConclusionsObesity and type 2 diabetes are serious chronic diseases that are associated with complex metabolic dysfunction that leads to sys- temic complications and increased mortality.

However mechanistic studies have described a large number of metabolic modifications associated with these surgeries includ- ing changes in incretins gut hormones bile acid BA levels microbiota which have led to referring to these weight loss sur- geries as metabolic operations.The decision about the type of surgery is made in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team based on the patients' medical con- ditions including current body weights and obesity-related dis- eases and expected compliance with supplementation and follow up as well as the patients' personal preferences.

Similarly varying levels have been observed in mixed restrictive and malabsorptive procedures in which RYGB resulted in a decrease in plasma ghrelin compared to normal-weight controls obese patients and patients who had undergone medical weight loss .

Unfortunately the medium-term weight loss associated with the best medical treatments is modest 3 to 7 total weight loss and the chance for remission of type 2 diabetes once established is anecdotal under 1 .

Weight loss bariatric surgery has thus become an integral part of the clinical management modalities for severely obese patients who have failed medical management.A number of surgical procedures have emerged over the past 40 years including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB in 1971 adjust- able gastric banding AGB in 1980 biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch BPD-DS in 1989 and sleeve gastrectomy SG endorsed in 2011 by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery .

Indeed significant weight loss 5 resulting from caloric restriction by means other than bariatric surgery is associated with improvement in beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with or without hyperglyce- mia .

At 3 and 5 years diabetes remission was maintained in 31 and 26 of surgical patients and in only 5 of patients in the medical therapy groups .A meta-analysis by Buchwald et al in 2009 reported overall reso- lution rates of 78.1 and improved glycemic control in 86.6 of patients when all procedures were considered .
