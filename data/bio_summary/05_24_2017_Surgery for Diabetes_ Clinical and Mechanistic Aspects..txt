weight loss bariatric surgery has thus become an integral part of the clinical management modalities for severely obese patients who have failed medical management.a number of surgical procedures have emerged over the past 40 years including roux-en-y gastric bypass rygb in 1971 adjust- able gastric banding agb in 1980 biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch bpd-ds in 1989 and sleeve gastrectomy sg endorsed in 2011 by the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery .

at 3 and 5 years diabetes remission was maintained in 31 and 26 of surgical patients and in only 5 of patients in the medical therapy groups .a meta-analysis by buchwald et al in 2009 reported overall reso- lution rates of 78.1 and improved glycemic control in 86.6 of patients when all procedures were considered .

metabolic surgery is now rec- ommended for all surgically appropriate patients with type 2 dia- betes who have bmis of 40 kgm2 or higher or 37.5 kgm2 or higher in patients of asian descent regardless of level of glycemic control or regimen and with bmis 35.0 to 39.9 kgm2 32.5 to 37.4 kgm2 in patients of asian descent if glycemic targets cannot be achieved despite implementation of maximum lifestyle and medical therapy.

this team typi- cally includes a bariatric nurse nutritionist mental health special- ist and social worker in addition to a bariatric surgeon.

caloric restriction leads to improved insulin sensitivity in the early and short-term period following bariatric surgery and facilitates long-term weight loss and stabilization.remission of type 2 diabetes via improved glycemic control and induction of weight loss on the basis of their known physiologic actions and subsequent changes in levels following bariatric surgery procedures.glucagon-like peptide-1glucagon-like peptide-1 glp-1 is an incretin peptide that is secreted into circulation within minutes of food ingestion through hormonal and neural signals via vagal stimulation .

it has been hypothesized that a reduc- tion in ghrelin levels after bariatric surgery could lead to improved glucose homeostasis through increased insulin secretion but evi- dence of a direct effect for ghrelin on glycemic control in humans is limited and variations in levels following bariatric surgery may be more reflective of adaptions to changes in energy balance .

although rodent models of obesity and bariatric surgery have demonstrated empirical support for changes in gut microbiota influencing weight loss and improve- ments in glycemic control after bariatric surgery further studies are still required to establish correlation and causality in human subjects.conclusionsobesity and type 2 diabetes are serious chronic diseases that are associated with complex metabolic dysfunction that leads to sys- temic complications and increased mortality.

this position statement calls for bariatric surgery to be considered earlier in eligible patients so as to help stem the serious complications that can result from diabetes.

the canadian diabetes association 2013 clinical prac- tice guidelines for the prevention and management of diabetes in canada also state that surgery represents a valid option for the manage- ment of type 2 diabetes in severely obese patients bmi 35 kgm2 who have failed initial medical and nutritional management .mechanisms of actionmultiple mechanisms leading to short-term improvements in gly- cemic control and remission of type 2 diabetes following bariatric surgery have been proposed and are outlined in .the incretin class of hormones are gastrointestine-derived polypeptides released from the duodenum and distal jejunum ileum and colon by enteroendocrine l and k cells in response to stimulation of the gut through food ingestion.

in addition to central anorexigenic effects glp-1 inhibits gastric emptying in healthy people and in those who have type 2 dia- betes  and the relationship between the reduced rate of gastric emptying and the lower peak glucose levels following a carbohy- drate load has previously been established in patients without dia- betes and post restrictive and malabsorptive bariatric procedures .

specific preoperative peptide hormone levels that suggest which patients are more likely to undergo type 2 diabetes remission with bariatric surgery remain to be defined.

however mechanistic studies have described a large number of metabolic modifications associated with these surgeries includ- ing changes in incretins gut hormones bile acid ba levels microbiota which have led to referring to these weight loss sur- geries as metabolic operations.the decision about the type of surgery is made in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team based on the patients' medical con- ditions including current body weights and obesity-related dis- eases and expected compliance with supplementation and follow up as well as the patients' personal preferences.

after rygb patients receive in addition vitamin b12 1200 mg calcium carbonate 1000 mg with vitamin d3 1000 u and ferrous sulfate 300 mg. following bpd-ds patients receive a multivitamin complex centrum forte pfizer new york new york united states vitamin a 20000 iu vitamin d2 50000 iu calcium carbonate 1000 mg and ferrous sulfate 300 mg. supplements are adjusted over time according to blood levels.clinical outcomes in type 2 diabeteswalter pories et al were among the first to look specifically at the remission of type 2 diabetes following weight loss surgery.

similarly varying levels have been observed in mixed restrictive and malabsorptive procedures in which rygb resulted in a decrease in plasma ghrelin compared to normal-weight controls obese patients and patients who had undergone medical weight loss .
