Healthy overweight-obese individuals were considered in the same group because they showed a similar lipid profile A. Total- cholesterol values were similar among healthy normoweight healthy overweight-obese and MetS groups .

The associations between basal CMR factors and the urine urolithin metabolomic signature were explored in 20 healthy normoweight individuals consuming walnuts 30 gd 49 healthy overweight- obese individuals ingesting pomegranate extract 450 mgd and 25 metabolic syndrome MetS pa- tients consuming nuts 15 g-walnuts 7.5 g-hazelnuts and 7.5 g-almondsd.Results Correlations between CMR factors and urolithins were found in overweight-obese individuals.

Ultra performance liquid chromatography-electroLipid and lipoprotein profile plasma glycemia and urinary and fecal excretion of urolithin-A and isourolithin-A urolithin-B after dietary ETs consumption were quantified in healthy normoweight healthy overweight-obese and MetS groups .

Notably overweight-obese individuals with UM-B were at increased CVD risk whereas UM-A seemed to be a protective metabotype against cardiovascular risk factors.

We observed that differences between UM-A and UM-B and total- cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol values were significant only in overweight-obese individuals and MetS group under statin treat- ment but not in the MetS group free of statins.

In contrast the percentage of individuals with UM- A was lower in those individuals with MetS 50 than in overweight-obese 57 and normoweight 70 groups.Correlation between baseline serum markers and urolithinsHealthy overweight-obese subjects with dyslipidemia but not subjected to any medical treatment were further investigated.

Both healthy normoweight and overweight-obese groups of subjects were compared with MetS patients.Materials and methodsIntervention studies and study productsHuman nutritional intervention studies were conducted in line with the Helsinki Declaration.
