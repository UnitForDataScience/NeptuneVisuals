Future research efforts may con- sider investigating the toxicities of individual PAHs mix- tures of PAHs and mixtures of PAHs with other classes of pollutants in the environment.Indeed bioremediation has proven to be an efficient and safe technology that can be further exploited to ameliorate the consequences of PAH contamination.

Bioremediation aerobic and anaerobic use of biosurfactants and bioreactors as well as the roles of biofilms in the biological treatment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also explored.Keywords Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs Environment  Bioremediation  MicroorganismsIntroductionPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs are a group of persistent semi-volatile organic pollutants that are ubiqui- tous in the environment and enter environmental matrices via natural and anthropogenic sources including several industrial and certain agricultural activities Wick et al.

Also PAHs sub- stituted with alkyl groups are normally found together with PAHs in environmental matrices Lundestedt  Nkan- sah .PAHs are classified as low molecular weight LMW if they have two or three fused rings and as high molecular weight HMW if they have four or more fused rings Wick et al.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency US EPA has designated 16 PAH compounds as priority pol- lutants Luch  including the HMW PAHs benzoa pyrene dibenzahanthracene and indeno123-cdpyrene among others and the LMW PAHs naphthalene ace- naphthene fluorene and phenanthrene among others which are often monitored for measurement in environ- mental samples.

Although many studies regarding the characteristics toxicity and biodegradability of PAHs have been conducted on single often solid crystal compounds to minimise the number of variables research has shown that PAHs exist in environmental samples as complex mixtures Cerniglia .

.The fate of PAHs in the environment and the routes of wildlife or human exposure are influenced by the environ- mental medium air food water or soil in which the PAHs reside Arey and Atkinson  the physico-chemicalproperties of the PAH compound and several other envir- onmental factors.

.Several researchers have observed greater amounts of PAHs in urban soils as they are more exposed to the PAHs produced by both stationary power plants industries and residential heating and mobile sources traffic emissions and road by-products such as wearing of tyres and asphalt constituents Kamaljit et al.

Rainwater has been shown to contain many organic com- pounds including PAHs where the concentration of PAHs in rainfall can sometimes be much higher than in the receiving water body Manoli and Samara .PAHs in groundwater may originate from polluted sur- face water bodies irrigation with contaminated water lea- chates from solid waste disposal sites or contaminated soil Manoli and Samara .

Humans are exposed to PAHs through inhalation ingestion of contaminated food and water and through dermal contact Sowa .Human Health EffectsThe effects of PAHs on human health depend mainly on the duration and rate of exposure as well as the concentration and the innate toxicity of the individual PAH Buha  Rengarajana et al.

It is often difficult to ascribe exclusive health effects in epide- miological studies to specific PAHs because most exposures are to a combination of different PAHs ATSDR .
