The relative level of T. forsythia increased in Tf-2w and Tf-8w P o0.05 f but no significant difference were detected in all groups before the starting of infection shaw-0wTf-0w P40.05 f. aP o0.05 vs controls all data are mean - s.d..coating and the odds of yellow tongue coating on high fatty food liking fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity increased in individuals and T. forsythia induced elevation of fatty food liking adiposity and IR in animals which also support the hypothesis that the alteration of T. forsythia and fatty food liking could be vital in fat accumulation and IR in CUFA.Interestingly our findings illustrated that the infection of T. forsythia and increases in fatty food liking preceded the development of fat accumulation and IR in both CUFA and T. forsythia-infected rats which suggests adiposity and IR in these animals might be mediated byT.

Besides tongue diagnosis has been an integral part of Traditional Chinese Medicine practice and obesity has been investigated since the latter's inception around the third century BCEin which yellow tongue coating is considered as important characteristics of obesity.Recently T. forsythia is reported to be very important in yellow tongue-coating microbiota.There- fore the changes of T. forsythia on the dorsum of tongue probably associate with yellow tongue coating in CUFA subjects and both of them is likely to be pivotal in fat accumulation and IR in CUFA.

It is reported that T. forsythia outer membrane vesicles which Gram negative microorganisms deploy theirperiplasm to secrete for trafficking bacterial biochemicals to target cells in their environment contained predominately C16 and C18 linear alkyl chains in abundance but less shorter chain fatty acids.The abundant long-chain fatty acids and rarity of shorter chain fatty acids in T. forsythia outer membrane vesicles might be an important explanation for increases in fatty food liking in T. forsythia-infected mammals.Yet it should be noted that for practical reasons involving theunavailability of facilities or agents we were not able to employ more tests to evaluate fatty acid taste sensitivity although it is reported that there is a positive correlation between performance in the fat ranking task and oral fatty acid sensitivity.Moreover the motivation to obtain a food reward also termed 'wanting' was not assessed as goal-directed behavior in spite of the fact that the relevance was illustrated between the behavior of 'liking' and 'wanting'.

The food intake of CUFA rats was restricted to 60 of that eaten by their ad libitum-fed companions of the same weight while caloric restriction and the CUFA animals were pair-fed with their weight-matched ad libitum-fed controls after refeeding as described previously.Experiment B changes in fat taste reactivity fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity in T. forsythia-infected ratsAnimals were randomly divided into four groups 12 rats in each group for two sampling points T. forsythia infected for 2 weeks Tf-2w T. forsythia infected for 8 weeks Tf-8w and their sham-infected controls Sham-2w and Sham-8w respectively.

Similarly our observations showed that the T. forsythia colonization fatty food liking adiposity and IR were augmented in CUFA humans and rodents in the present study the T. forsythia found on the tongue closely correlated with yellow tongueFigure 3.

Notably the T. forsythia found on the tongue closely correlated with yellow tongue coating and the odds of yellow tongue coating on high fatty food liking fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity increased in humans.

Moreover the T. forsythia found on the tongue correlating closely with yellow tongue coating and the increases in odds of yellow tongue coating on high fatty food liking fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity were observed in human individuals in our investigation.

reported that impairment of insulin sensitivity and accelerated body fat recovery in CUFA using a rat model of semistarvation-refeeding which is consistent with our findings.We further found that increases in proportions of T. forsythia colonization and yellow coating on the dorsum of tongue and upregulation of fatty food liking in CUFA humans which are characterized by fat accumula- tion and IR.
