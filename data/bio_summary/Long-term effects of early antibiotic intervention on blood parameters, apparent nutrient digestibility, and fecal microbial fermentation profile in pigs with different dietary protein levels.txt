overall these results indicated that eai had short-term effect on nutrient digestibility.table 3 effects of early antibiotic intervention on growth performance of pigs with different protein level diets1a bmeans in the same row with different superscripts differ p  0.051the commercial creep feed with or without in-feed antibiotics 50 mgkg olaquindox 50 mgkg oxytetracycline calcium and 50 mgkg kitasamycin was fed to pig from d 7 to d 42. thereafter the con and ant group were further randomly assigned to provide a normal 20 18 14 cp from d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively or low cp diet 16 14 10 cp from d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively respectively2the p values indicate main effects for antibiotic ant protein level cp and their interaction ant x cp respectivelytable 4 effects of early antibiotic intervention on total tract apparent digestibility of pigs with different protein level dietsaitem low-cpnormal-cpsem p-value2con antcon antantcpant x cpd 77dm dry matter cp crude protein om organic matterathe commercial creep feed with or without in-feed antibiotics 50 mgkg olaquindox 50 mgkg oxytetracycline calcium and 50 mgkg kitasamycin was fed to pig from d 7 to d 42. thereafter the con and ant group were further randomly assigned to provide a normal 20 18 14 cp from d 42 to d 77d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively or low cp diet 16 14 10 cpfrom d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively respectively.

in general these results indi- cated that eai had short-term effects on serum parame- ters and these effects may be influenced by dietary cp levels.table 5 effects of early antibiotic intervention on serum biochemical indexes of pigs with different cp level diets1hdlc high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ldlc low density lipoprotein-cholesterola-cmeans in the same row with different superscripts differ p  0.051the commercial creep feed with or without in-feed antibiotics 50 mgkg olaquindox 50 mgkg oxytetracycline calcium and 50 mgkg kitasamycin was fed to pig from d 7 to d 42. thereafter the con and ant group were further randomly assigned to provide a normal 20 18 14 cp from d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively or low cp diet 16 14 10 cp from d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively respectively.

however when fed low-cp diet whether early antibiotic intervention affect body metabolism and fecal microbial fermentation profile in pigs remains unclear.to test the hypothesis that early antibiotic interven- tion eai from d 7 to d 42 may have long-lasting effects on subsequent host metabolism and git mi- crobes and microbial fermentation in pigs the present study examined the blood parameters apparent nutrient digestibility and major bacterial taxonomic groups and microbial metabolism in feces on d 77 short-term and d 185 long-term in relation to different cp diets.methodsanimals and experimental designa total of 18 litters crossbred duroc xlandrace x large white newborn piglets 212 piglets in total were used in this study.

the feces were then frozen at -20 degc until the analysis of microbial metabolites and dominant bacterial community which was completed within 2 weeks after sample collection.on d 77 28.4 - 0.6 kg and d 185 102.0 - 0.6 kgwhen the experimental pigs were fasted for approxi- mately 12 h one median bw barrow from each pen was selected for blood sampling n  5. blood samples 10 ml were collected from the jugular vein and serumtable 1 ingredient and nutrient composition of experimental diets  as-fed basisaanalyzed nutrient compositionf  crude protein16.6320.1114.0318.0210.1814.06athe pigs of control and antibiotic groups were divided to 1 of 2 treatment groups normal vs. low cp diet after d 42. lp low protein diet np normal protein dietbprovided per kilogram of diet vitamin a 2.85 million iu vitamin d3 0.6 million iu vitamin e 67.50 iu vitamin k3 750 mg vitamin b1750 mg vitamin b2 1500 mg vitamin b6 900 mg vitamin b12 7.5 mg nicotinic acid 7500 mg folic acid 300 mg calcium pantothenate 3750 mg biotin 37.5 mg vitamin b4 100 mg antioxidants 15 mg cu cuso4.5h2o 60 mg fe feso4.h2o 51.6 mg co cocl2 50 mg mn mnso4.h2o 25 mg zn znso4.h2o 21.2 mg zn zno 6 mg i ki 3.9 mg se na2seo3 3.0 mg carrier sepiolite 604.3 mgccalculate values according to nrc dme  metabolizable energyesid aa  standardized ileal digestible aafanalytical results obtained according to aoac was obtained by centrifuging at 3000xg for 10 min at 4 degc.

differences at p  0.05 were identified significant.resultsgrowth performance and apparent nutrient digestibility growth performance of the pigs was shown in table for adg there was an interaction p  0.05 between eai and dietary cp treatment from d 77 to d 185 and d 42 to d 185. the eai increased adg p  0.05 from d 42 to d 185 in the low-cp diets but not in the normal- cp diets.

the low-cp diet reduced cp and crude fat digestibility p  0.05. on d 185 digestibil- ity of crude fat was decreased p  0.001 when pigs fed the low-cp diet but dm cp and om digestibility were not affected by treatment.

the low-cp diets reduced the protein fermentation prod- ucts in feces on both d 77 and d 185.discussionby employing a whole growth stage continuous feeding strategy the current experiment enabled to evaluate the short- 77 d and long-term 185 d effect of eai from d 7 to d 42 on pig blood parameters apparent nutrientdigestibility microbial metabolism and bacterial counts in feces with different dietary cp level.

the body weight bw of pigs was recorded at the begin- ning of the experiment and at the end of each period to determine average daily gain adg average daily feed in- take adfi and the ratio of gain to feed gf.sample collection and preparationthe fecal samples were collected for 3 consecutive days from d 75 to 77 and 183 to 185 of age respectively during the feeding period in the morning by rectal stimulation.

pigs with low-cp diet tended to record a lower count of lactobacillus p  0.09. overall these results suggest that the effect of eai and dietary cp levels on bacterial groups in the fecal samples was limited except for e. coli.fermentation metabolites in fecal contentsto understand whether eai affect fecal fermentation profiles with different cp diets fermentation metabolites were determined.

furthermore pigs with low-cp diet reduced the concentrations of p-cresol and indolep  0.05. there was no dietary treatment effect on phe- nol concentration.

thus the dietary nitrogen was used more effi- ciently with low level of potentially harmful metabolites in pigs fed low-cp amino acids-supplemented diets.low-cp diets altered the markers of microbial carbohy- drate metabolism on d 185 such as decreased the concen- trations of acetate propionate isobutyrate isovalerate and total scfa consistent with le et al.

thus in the present study a decrease of scfas may be related with the altered metabolism activity of gut microbiota after low-cp diet.conclusionsin conclusion combined with the changes in blood metabolites digestibility and microbial metabolite our results showed that eai from d 7 to d 42 showed short-term effects on pigs especially on the body and microbial metabolism.

our previous study found that low crude protein low-cp diet increased the counts of bacteroidetes clostridium cluster iv and clostridium cluster xiva decreased escher- ichia coli counts and decreased cadaverine phenol and indole compounds concentrations   suggesting a beneficial effect of low-cp diet.

meanwhile low-cp diet tended to reduce the adfi p  0.08 from d 42 to d 185 but gf at each feeding period did not differ among treatments.for apparent nutrient digestibility no interactions between eai and dietary cp treatment were observed table on d 77 there was no difference of om di- gestibility among treatments.
