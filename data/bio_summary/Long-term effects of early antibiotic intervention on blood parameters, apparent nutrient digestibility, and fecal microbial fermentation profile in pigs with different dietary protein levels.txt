However when fed low-CP diet whether early antibiotic intervention affect body metabolism and fecal microbial fermentation profile in pigs remains unclear.To test the hypothesis that early antibiotic interven- tion EAI from d 7 to d 42 may have long-lasting effects on subsequent host metabolism and GIT mi- crobes and microbial fermentation in pigs the present study examined the blood parameters apparent nutrient digestibility and major bacterial taxonomic groups and microbial metabolism in feces on d 77 short-term and d 185 long-term in relation to different CP diets.MethodsAnimals and experimental designA total of 18 litters crossbred Duroc xLandrace x Large White newborn piglets 212 piglets in total were used in this study.

Thereafter the Con and Ant group were further randomly assigned to provide a normal 20 18 14 CP from d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively or low CP diet 16 14 10 CP from d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively respectively.

Thereafter the Con and Ant group were further randomly assigned to provide a normal 20 18 14 CP from d 42 to d 77d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively or low CP diet 16 14 10 CPfrom d 42 to d 77 d 77 to d 120 d 120 to d 185 respectively respectively.

The low-CP diets reduced the protein fermentation prod- ucts in feces on both d 77 and d 185.DiscussionBy employing a whole growth stage continuous feeding strategy the current experiment enabled to evaluate the short- 77 d and long-term 185 d effect of EAI from d 7 to d 42 on pig blood parameters apparent nutrientdigestibility microbial metabolism and bacterial counts in feces with different dietary CP level.

The body weight BW of pigs was recorded at the begin- ning of the experiment and at the end of each period to determine average daily gain ADG average daily feed in- take ADFI and the ratio of gain to feed GF.Sample collection and preparationThe fecal samples were collected for 3 consecutive days from d 75 to 77 and 183 to 185 of age respectively during the feeding period in the morning by rectal stimulation.

The feces were then frozen at -20 degC until the analysis of microbial metabolites and dominant bacterial community which was completed within 2 weeks after sample collection.On d 77 28.4 - 0.6 kg and d 185 102.0 - 0.6 kgwhen the experimental pigs were fasted for approxi- mately 12 h one median BW barrow from each pen was selected for blood sampling n  5.

Differences at P  0.05 were identified significant.ResultsGrowth performance and apparent nutrient digestibility Growth performance of the pigs was shown in Table For ADG there was an interaction P  0.05 between EAI and dietary CP treatment from d 77 to d 185 and d 42 to d 185.

On d 185 digestibil- ity of crude fat was decreased P  0.001 when pigs fed the low-CP diet but DM CP and OM digestibility were not affected by treatment.
