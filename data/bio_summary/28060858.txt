while treatment with fpp augmented nk cell cytotoxicity in elderly patients it is possible that it has no effect on nk cell cytotoxicity in healthy young people as observed for hesperidin .further studies are needed to determine which low-molecular-weight phenolic acids phe- nolic acid combinations or ratios are most effective for activating nk cells without activating cytokines and chemokines or increasing the frequency of nk cells.

it has been reported that cytokines and chemokines released in response to lipopolysaccharide lps from the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria stimulate nk cell activity through dendritic cell dc toll-like receptors tlrs of intestinal epithelium - however administration of fpp did not affect the level of cytokines or chemokines analyzed in the present study .doi10.1371journal.pone.0169240.g001after administration of fpp the abundance of firmicutes was significantly decreasedp  0.05 student's t-test  figs and .

here we consider pbmc cytolytic activity to be representative of the effects of fpp on nk cell cytotoxicity.our results indicate that before fpp administration nk cell cytotoxicity cytolytic activity was lower e t  101 2.56 - 9.0 201 24.95 -15.3 in elderly patients 67-97 years of agethan healthy controls aged 20-60 years e t  101 8.9  29.5 201 171  47.8 .

the cyto- lytic activity of pbmcs against malignant cells such as k564 depends almost entirely on nk cell cytotoxicity  therefore we expressed nk cell cytotoxicity as cytolytic activity of pbmcs.fecal flora analysisfecal bacterial composition was analyzed before and after administration of fpp and in the con- trol group by high-throughput sequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from each stool sample .

to our knowledge the present study is the first to evaluate the clinical effects of fpps in tube-fed patients.effect of fpp on immunityclinical laboratory effects of fpp administration revealed changes in pbmc cytolytic activity only which are primarily dependent on the function of nk cell cytotoxicity as discussed in materials and methods and on the microbiota in feces.

in addition there were no observed increases in gram-negative bacteria lactococcus and bifidobacteroides which are found in probiotics and reported to be stimulators of tlr-4 or living bacteria e. faecalis and a. oryzae used for fermentation in fpp as determined by 16s rrna analysis of the incubation media.these results suggest that fpp do not increase nk cell cytotoxicity by activating cytokines.

nk cell cytotoxicity increased after administration of fpp in a dose-dependent manner although the effect was not statistically significant because of differences between strong and poor responders.it is reported that the number of nk cells increases and their components change e.g.

for example we did not classify nk cell frequency which may further explain our results showing enhanced nk cell cytotoxicity.

these experiments suggest that the decrease in nk cell cytotox- icity may be caused by the environment surrounding the aged nk cells andor intracellular events such as energy production and signal trafficking rather than by the nk cells themselves.nk cells are activated in the presence of lps released from probiotics which is accompanied by changing cytokines and chemokines.
