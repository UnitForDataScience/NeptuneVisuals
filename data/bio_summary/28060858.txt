The majority of polyphenols are broken down and absorbed in the intestines by intestinal microflora suggesting that the original structures of polyphenols do not necessarily mediate their functions in vivo.The level of polyphenols such as procyanidins chlorogenic acids and anthocyanins are lower in peripheral blood than that of other flavonoids even after administration of high dosesor consumption of large amounts of foods rich in these compounds .

It has been reported that cytokines and chemokines released in response to lipopolysaccharide LPS from the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria stimulate NK cell activity through dendritic cell DC toll-like receptors TLRs of intestinal epithelium - however administration of FPP did not affect the level of cytokines or chemokines analyzed in the present study .doi10.1371journal.pone.0169240.g001After administration of FPP the abundance of Firmicutes was significantly decreasedP  0.05 Student's t-test  Figs and .

The cyto- lytic activity of PBMCs against malignant cells such as K564 depends almost entirely on NK cell cytotoxicity  therefore we expressed NK cell cytotoxicity as cytolytic activity of PBMCs.Fecal Flora AnalysisFecal bacterial composition was analyzed before and after administration of FPP and in the con- trol group by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from each stool sample .

PBMC cytolytic activity NK cell activity induced by FPP administration for 30 days.Data in parentheses are normal values for 20-65-year-old healthy subjects.doi10.1371journal.pone.0169240.t001NK cell cytotoxicity induced by FPP administration for 30 days.

Here we consider PBMC cytolytic activity to be representative of the effects of FPP on NK cell cytotoxicity.Our results indicate that before FPP administration NK cell cytotoxicity cytolytic activity was lower E T  101 2.56 - 9.0 201 24.95 -15.3 in elderly patients 67-97 years of agethan healthy controls aged 20-60 years E T  101 8.9  29.5 201 171  47.8 .

In an in vitro study INF-g concentrations were increased after treatment with resveratrol however because the study was done in a cell cul- ture system release of INF-g was likely the result of NK cell activation .

While treatment with FPP augmented NK cell cytotoxicity in elderly patients it is possible that it has no effect on NK cell cytotoxicity in healthy young people as observed for hesperidin .Further studies are needed to determine which low-molecular-weight phenolic acids phe- nolic acid combinations or ratios are most effective for activating NK cells without activating cytokines and chemokines or increasing the frequency of NK cells.

For example we did not classify NK cell frequency which may further explain our results showing enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity.

Studies have shown that polyphenols epigalocatechin gallate oenothelin B ellagitanin and resveratrol augment NK cell cytotoxicity - however a study of hesperidin showed no effects in healthy well-nourished humans .

Our results suggest that FPP and probiotic supplementation is useful for tube-fed patients to maintain a healthy immune status.ConclusionsOur results show that older patients who are tube-fed over the long term have decreased NK cell toxicity and that low-molecular-weight phenolic acids produced by the fermentation of polymerized large molecular weight polyphenols are bioactive.
