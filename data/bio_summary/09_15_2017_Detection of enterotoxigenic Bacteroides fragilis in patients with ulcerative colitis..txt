Also samples which did not display the flu- orescent signal earlier than 37 cycles were considered negative.The number of positive samples for 16S rRNA gene andbft gene using real time PCR are presented in Table .The results of quantitative analysis of real time PCR for 16S rRNA gene counted for B. fragilis and bft gene counted for ETBF were shown in Table .In this study there were 60 non-IBD controls.

Several stud- ies implicated that B. fragilis which harbored bft gene are more present in patients with diarrhea and IBDcompared to control patients with no diarrhea  .

Addition- ally we didn't analysis other species of Bacteroides and other virulence factor of it so maybe in our population need to study them.Based on the present data polysaccharide A PSA from the capsule of B. fragilis will be a good potential tar- get to be taken into consideration in the future study.ConclusionsIn conclusion considering the real time results for bft1 gene the high incidence of ETBF in mucosal biopsies of UC patients was statistically significant.

The Bacteroides fragilis toxin gene is prevalent in the colon mucosa of colorectal cancer patients.

The data from QRT-PCR were also used to determine the association of total mucosa- associated bacterial flora with disease state in UC patients.MethodsPatients and tissue specimensIn this study in total 95 biopsies were collected from Iranian UC patients n  35 as well as patients with non-inflammatory IBD nIBD n  60 using colonos- copy.

Our data demonstrated that ETBF was detected significantly and more frequently in the samples of UC patients with diarrhea symp- toms than in others without diarrhea and in control patients.

Some studies presented that Bacteroides can be exist more in IBD patients than normal controls in FISH and conventional culture methods that were commonly from European patients.

But some inves- tigations showed lower levels of Bacteroides in IBD patients compared to the controls that the samples were mostly obtained from Asian patients  .
