Results from other metrics of within- sample diversity are included in the supplemental materials.Using weighted UniFrac clustering significant differences in beta diversity were found for anxiety p  0.022 and fatigue interference p  0.01 at the latest time point suggesting shifts in taxa relative abundance while sleep dysfunction p  0.056 and fatigue intensity p  0.086 trended toward significance.

Using unweighted UniFrac clustering significant differences in beta diversity were found for cardiorespiratory fitness p  0.026 atTable 1Baseline participant characteristicsSocial demographicsBreast cancer survivorsn  12the lowest baseline cardiorespiratory fitness and the largest mag- nitude improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness showed strik- ing microbial diversity clustering at the latest time point Fig.

Additionally we found that the gut microbial composition was significantly associated with changes in anxiety fatigue interference and cardiorespiratory fitness and a trend was detected for changes in fatigue intensity and sleep dysfunction.

Weighted UniFrac anal- ysis shifts in taxa relative abundance revealed significant dif- ferences in between-sample beta diversity for changes in fa- tigue interference p  0.01 and anxiety p  0.022 with a trend observed for fatigue intensity and sleep dysfunction p  0.1.

Faecalibacterium Prevotella Bacteroides p  0.05.Conclusions Correlations may exist between alterations in gut microbiota composition and longitudinal changes in cardiore- spiratory fitness fatigue and anxiety in BCS.

Therefore our results support potential relationships between the gut microbiota diversity in post-primary treatment BCS and psychosocial and cardiorespiratory fitness outcomes.To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the potential associations between prospective changes in gut mi- crobiota and alterations in psychosocial outcomes and cardio- respiratory fitness among cancer survivors of any type.

To evaluate the relationship between changes in within-sample alpha diversities and changes in psychosocial and fitness outcomes t test was used to compare the mean change in alpha diversity from baseline to month 3 for each dichoto- mized outcome Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used when the assumptions of t test may not hold.

Quartile of magnitude change in cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with the frequency of genera Roseburia p  0.046 and SMB53 p  0.023 a subset of the family Clostridiaceae.

Prior to false discovery correction FDR changes in fitness fatigue anxiety and sleep dysfunction were associated with the frequency of certain gut bacteria genera e.g.
