This result suggests that VOCs production by soil filamentous microbes is tightly controlled in time and in space according to soil nutritional constraints.

Particularly they address the following questions 1 Are soil bacteria able to sense VOCs produced by microbial eukaryotes and modify their behaviors in response to them 2 What is the effect of those VOCs on bacterial fitness and survival 3 Does the nutritional status mattersBy using GC-Q-TOF analysis Schmidt et al.

Although different degrees of specificity have been observed spanning along the mutualism-antagonism continuum the molecular basis governing fungal-bacterial interactions remains poorly understood.Recent evidence indicates that low molecular weight metabolites such as Volatile Organic Compounds VOCs can be produced by taxonomically diverse groups of microorganisms and play important roles for long distance microbe-microbe interactions Effmert et al.

Microbial VOCs were mainly studied from the bacterial point of view acting as infochemical molecules in soil or protecting plants against pathogenic fungi and oomycetes Garbeva et al.

Since motility is an important trait of the bacterial root microbiota van Overbeek and Saikkonen 2016 it would be interesting to test whether particular rhizospheric fungi can alter endosphere colonization by specific bacteria taxa via long distance VOCs emission at the rootsoil interface.Interestingly Schmidt and collaborators also found that the soil fungus F. culmorum affects differently swimming motility of C. pratensis reduction and S. plymuthica induction likelydue to the production of a unique terpene blend.

Volatile mediated interactions between bacteria and fungi in the soil.

Volatile-mediated interactions between phylogenetically different soil bacteria.

However still very little is known regarding the chemical diversity of VOCs produced by filamentous microbes fungi and oomycetes as well as their ecological role for fungal-bacterial interactions.

2016 is an important contribution to the field that nicely illustrates the complexity of the molecular dialogue likely taking place among soil microbes.
