n  4-5 except tb group w20 time point where n 3 genetic background while distinct in detail from the pre- viously published data confirm that mtb exposure by itself causes only minor changes in the composition of the murine intestinal flora.anti-tuberculosis therapy induces a rapid alteration in the microbiota that persists during treatmentto address the primary question of this study we exam- ined the effects of antibiotic treatment on the microbiota composition in mtb infected mice in a three-way com- parison of the naive tb and tb  hrz groups using the same methodology described above.

this increased potency of rz versus hrz on the microbiota is consistent with the known efficacy of these drug combinations against mtb itself which is thought to be related to the negative effects of inh on rif availability a larger inference of these findings is that the presence of inh may be a dampening force that limits the potential severity of the dysbiosis induced by the entire tb drug treatment cocktail.the fascinating crosstalk between antibiotics in the targeting of the microbiota that we document here has been observed in other settings  and is not well understood.

although not yet directly investigated by us these observations suggest that if hrz treatment has any immunological consequences they will be distinct from those triggered by vanm.an important part of the present study was to compare the effects on the microbiota of the individual drugs admin- istered together in the hrz cocktail.

closely overlapping with the cluster formed from the data of the actively treated tb  hrz group at latter time points additional file figure s8a.a more detailed compositional analysis confirmed the close similarity of the microbiota in mice from the tb  hrz and post hrz groups additional file figure s8b with a few notable exceptions.

interestingly increases as opposed to de- creases in bacterial taxa due to hrz treatment were limited to genus erysipelatoclostridium and genus eggerthia in the naive versus tb  hrz comparison.having demonstrated that hrz induces highly signifi- cant alterations in the bacterial composition of the intes- tinal microbiome we went on to describe these changes longitudinally.

in this regard we observed a major post treatment increase in barnesiella a genus which when administered to mice was found to promote clearance of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus we are cur- rently using the murine model developed and character- ized here to address whether the changes in microbiota induced by tb antibiotic treatment are associated with altered local and systemic immune responses as well as susceptibility to experimental infectious and inflamma- tory diseases.

together these observations revealed that treatment with conventional anti-tuberculosis drugs causes a transient de- crease in the diversity of the intestinal microbiota along with persistent fluctuating changes in its composition and that this dysbiosis does not appear to be influenced by the presence or absence of mtb infection.the dysbiosis induced by att is maintained after cessation of treatmentto determine whether a standard regimen of anti- tuberculosis therapy has long-term effects on the micro- biota we monitored bacterial populations in stool samples at monthly intervals for 3 months' post cessation of therapy post hrz in comparison with samples from age- matched naive animals additional file figure s1.

similarly rif alone induced major compositional changes in the microbiota but these alterations were distinct in terms of the specific taxa affected andor their magnitude from those observed following hrz treatment fig.

our longitudinal studies on the stool microbiota demonstrate that treatment of mtb-infected mice with hrz using a regimen similar to that employed in patients results in a rapid but transient loss in bacterial diversity as well as persistent alterations in the microbiome composition that do not recover fol- lowing cessation of therapy.

for example we documented major decreases both during and after treatment in many members of the order clostridiales that have been previously reported to associate with altered treg function similarly we observed signifi- cant increases in erysipelotrichaceae changes in which have been linked with inflammatory and metabolic alter- ations -on the other hand while we did observea statistically significant increase during treatment in proteobacteria a phylum containing numerous patho- genic species the outgrowth was considerably lower than that documented following vanm treatment.

one of the infected groups of mice tb  hrz was started on hrz treatment 4 weeks' post infection w4 and switched to hr 2 months w12 into therapy additional file figure s1.

the subsequent change occurred at the first time point of stool collection w16 following the switch in the antibiotic regimen from triple hrz to double hr administration.longitudinal analysis revealed a dramatic alteration in the bacterial composition occurring 1 day indicated as w4 in additional file figure s1 following start of hrz treatment figs.

however striking differ- ences were observed in the proteobacteria which under- went a greater relative increase following vanm versus hrz administration and in erysipelatoclostridium which increased following hrz but not vanm treatment.

in agreement we found that in the comparison of uninfected-untreated naive to infected- treated tb  hrz animals and in the comparison of infected-untreated tb to infected-treated tb  hrz animals the majority of the taxa altered as a consequence of treatment are identical.
