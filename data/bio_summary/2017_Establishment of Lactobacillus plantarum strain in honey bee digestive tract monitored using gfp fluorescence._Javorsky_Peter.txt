The lyophilised L. plantarum B35 GFP marked strain was used for inoculating the honey bees by different routes as a model for monitoring the establishment of the strain in bee digestive tract in vivo.Materials and methodsBacteria plasmid and mediaStrain B35 of L. plantarum was originally isolated from the honey bee digestive tract and identified by analysis of protein profiles by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy MS using a Maldi Microflextm instrument Bruker Daltonics Bremen Germany in our institute.

The SHP intake was determined from the weight loss of SHP.Honey bee intestinal tract sampling48 h after L. plantarum B35-gfp administration experimental bees were anaesthetised with ether and the whole intestinal tracts expect oesophagus were collected.

The feeder was removed from the cage after two h and replaced with another one containing a 50 sucrose solution in water provided ad libitum.The bees in the second trial were anaesthetised with carbon dioxide in every cage separately and were afterwards collectively treated by aerosol application of lyophilised bacteria on the dorsal side of the thorax of each bee.

The use of Lactobacillus species has been found to enhance the immunity of honey bees helping them to survive the effects of pathogens and bring advantageous properties for honey bee health Asama et al.

The aerosol spray method tested here could be used not only for distributing potential probiotic bacteria to bees but also for dispersing the emulsions containing the natural antimicrobial substances effective against potential bee pathogens into the beehive body.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by Grant No.

The lyophilised bacterial samples were stored at 4 degC in the dark.The bees and experimental designThe summer adult bees were collected from two beehives at Veterinary University in Kosice East Slovakia.

The collected bees were randomly allocated to test cages ten bees per cage three cages per experimental or control trial.

Two days after administration the L. plantarum B35-gfp was present throughout the honey bee digestive tract with 104-105 cfubee with highest count observed for aerosol application.Keywords Lactobacillus plantarum green fluorescent protein honey bee digestive tract monitoringIntroductionThe lactic acid bacteria are symbiotic bacteria that naturally reside in the gastrointestinal tract of many animals including honey bee.

The establishment of this strain in honey bee digestive tract was monitored using GFP fluorescence.

The same procedure was applied to detect theMonitoring L. plantarum using gfp fluorescencepresence of L. plantarum B35-gfp directly in honey bee digestive tract samples.To analyse the stability of pAD43-25 plasmid in L. plantarum B35 the L. plantarum B35-gfp was cultivated without any antibiotic pressure for 10 days with transfer to the fresh medium every 24 h. After the last transfer the culture was serially diluted on MRS agar plates and selected colonies 20 were screened for GFP expression and chloramphenicol resistance.Lyophilisation of Lactobacillus plantarum B35-gfpThe bacterium was grown in MRS broth Difco containing 5 mgml Cm at 30 degC under aerobic conditions to stationary phase approx.
