genome features and sequencing data of these 11 bifidobacteriaceae ge- nomes are summarized in table in order to provide a complete genome analysis of the bifidobacteriaceae family a representative genome sequence for each of the currently described 67 sub species belonging to this family was retrieved from the ncbi public database table due to the incomplete genome sequences of candidatus ancillula trichonymphae imtpat recovered from the ncbi database and the impossibility to re- trieve this strain from any public bacterial culture collec- tion we decided to exclude the genome sequences of imtpat from our analyses.

such results con- firm previously reported findings for the genome of b. dentium bd1 .pan-genome core genome and unique genes of thebifidobacteriaceae familycomparative genome analyses involving the 67 sub species belonging to the bifidobacteriaceae family were performed to unveil the corresponding pan-genome core genome and unique genes of this bacterial family.

additionally we sequenced and analyzed the genome sequences of 11 bifidobacteriaceae strains depos- ited in the genbank sequence database table .bacterial strains and growth conditionbifidobacteriaceae pure cultures were inoculated in de man-rogosa-sharpe mrs medium scharlau chemie supplemented with 0.05 wtvol l-cysteine hydro- chloride and were grown in an anaerobic atmosphere 2.99 h2 17.01 co2 and 80 n2 in a chamber concept 400 ruskin at 37 degc for 16 h. dna was extracted as described previously  and subjected to further phenol-chloroform purification using a previ- ously described protocol genome sequencing and assembliesdna extracted from the various bifidobacteriaceae strains was subjected to whole genome sequencing using miseq illumina uk at genprobio srl parma italy following the supplier's protocol illumina uk.

fastq files of the paired-end reads obtained from targeted gen- ome sequencing of the isolated strains were used as in- put for genome assemblies through the megannotator pipeline the mira program version 4.0.2 was used for de novo assembly of each bifidobacteriaceae genome sequence sequence annotationprotein-encoding open reading frames orfs were pre- dicted using prodigal transfer rna genes were iden- tified using trnascan-se v1.4 4 while ribosomal rna genes were detected using rnammer v1.2 results of the gene-finder program were combined with data from rapsearch2 analysis reduced alphabet based protein similarity search  of a non-redundant protein databasetable 1 general features of bifidobacteriaceae genomestable 1 general features of bifidobacteriaceae genomes continuedtable 1 general features of bifidobacteriaceae genomes continuedanumbers in brackets indicate the numbers of assembled contigstable 2 sequencing data of the bifidobacteriaceae genomesanumbers in brackets indicate the numbers of assembled contigsprovided by the national center for biotechnology infor- mation ncbi and hidden markov model profile hmm search in the manually curated pfam- a protein family database the combined results were inspected by artemis  which was used for manual edit- ing purposes aimed at verifying and where necessary re- defining the start of each predicted coding region and to remove or add coding regions.bifidobacteriaceae pan-genome analysisfor the 67 genome sequences of each member of the bifidobacteriaceae family a pan-genome calculation was performed using the pgap pipeline .

in this study genome sequencing allowed us to explore the genome content of known members across the bifidobacteriaceae family as represented by 67 sub species and to scrutinize the phylogenetic re- latedness between each taxon belonging to this family.bifidobacteria exhibit a higher number of genes per genome compared to other members of the bifidobac- teriaceae family perhaps reflecting an increased com- petitiveness based on a broad spectrum of ecological niches from which they were isolated.

protein families shared between all genomes named core baecogs were defined by selecting the families that contained at least one protein member for each genome.phylogenetic comparisonthe concatenated core genome sequence of the family core baecogs was aligned using mafft  and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor- joining method in clustal w version 2.1 the core genome supertree was built using figtree e. values of average nucleo- tide identity ani were calculated using the program jspecies version 1.2.1 functional analysisthe prediction of genes encoding enzymes that possess structurally-related catalytic and carbohydrate-binding modules catalyzing hydrolysis modification or synthesis of glycoside bounds was performed by means of the cazy database functional annotation of each gene was performed employing the eggnog database a survey of complete pathways involved in both primary and secondary metabolism was performed by means of the metacyc metabolic pathways database .

gene function was predicted using a cutoff e-value of 1 x 10-10 to identify the best hit from each database.gene gainloss through evolution reconstruction predicting gene acquisition or gene loss as a result of evolution of the bacterial species with at least four avail- able genomes was performed with count software using dollo's parsimony.results and discussiongeneral genome features of bifidobacteriaceae genomes genome sequences of six bifidobacterial species i.e.

coagulans dsm 22924 and reinforce the importance of a phylogenomic approach as a tool for taxonomic validation .furthermore we investigated the occurrence of genespredicted to encode enzymes for anaerobic respiration in the pangenome of the members of the bifidobacteria- ceae as previously described for the genome of b. aster- oides prl2011 such in silico analyses highlight the presence of a cytochrome bd oxidase-encoding complex in the genome of bo.

the more com- plex genome content of bifidobacteria is also reflected by the capability of these microorganisms to degrade multiple carbon sources such findings were fur- ther validated in this study by the analyses of the pan- genome of the members of the bifidobacteriaceae family which highlights the occurrence of a higher abundance of tugs in bifidobacterial genomes dedicated to the carbohydrate metabolism and cell envelope biogenesis when compared to such numbers for other members of the bifidobacteriaceae family.

furthermore functional analyses based on genome content unveil connections between a given member of the family its carbohydrate utilization abilities and its corresponding host.

in this study we decoded the genome sequences of each member of the bifidobacteriaceae family.

while members of these species are present at high numbers in the saliva of adults their presence strongly correlates with other caries-associated organisms  3.notably comparative genome analyses of the genus bifi- dobacterium have been targeting the entire genus  or one specific bifidobacterial taxa i.e.

furthermore we performed an in depth comparative genomic analysis as well as a phylogenetic reconstruction of the 67 sub species currently assigned to the bifidobacteriaceae family.methodsbifidobacteriaceae strainswe retrieved the complete and partial genome sequences of 56 bifidobacteriaceae strains from the national center for biotechnology information ncbi public database table .

the combination of genomic data of 56 previously characterized bifidobacterial taxa   -with the chromosome sequences of the 11 bifidobacteriaceae species reported here resulted in the most comprehensive database of genome sequences of representative members of the bifidobacteriaceae family.

the bifidobacteriaceae genomes have an average gen- ome length of 2.25 mb and range in size from 1.55 mb for scardovia wiggsiae f0424 to 3.25 mb for bifidobac- terium biavatii dsm 23969 corresponding to 1244 and 2557 predicted protein-encoding open reading frames orfs respectively table average genomic gc content ranges from 41.36 for gardnerella vaginalis atcc 14018 to 65.53 for bifidobacterium choerinum lmg 10510 and revealed a higher average for the bifi- dobacterial strains 60.24 as compared to the other taxa of the bifidobacteriaceae genera 52.91 the average genome size of bifidobacterial strains is also higher than that observed for the other family members being 2.33 mb and 1.88 mb respectively highlighting a gene ratio of 1.24 obtained by dividing the average gene number of bifidobacterial sub species with that of the non-bifidobacterial taxa of the bifidobacteriaceae familyin favor of the bifidobacterial strains.
