both es and esm also led to marked restoration of the fecal acetic acid level compared to the corresponding hfd group figure b.both es and esm down-regulated gene expression of key proinflammatory cytokineshfd and hfd alteration of gut microbiota similarly resulted in significant up-regulation of the gene expression of mcp-1 and il-1b compared to the corresponding normal group.

consequently both hfd and hfd alteration of gut microbiota resulted in significantly increased fer compared to the corresponding normal group however es and esm did not change the hfd elevated fer.table 2. comparison of body fat and organ weights food intake and food-efficiency ratio.microbiota preparation experiment mpmicrobiota transfer experiment mt groupsmp normalmp hfdmp esmt normalmt hfdmt esinitial body weight g244.0 - 9.6248.0 - 7.7 244.9 - 10.2271.1 - 3.3268.2 - 4.9272.9 - 6.0final body weight g444.9 - 20.3553.6 - 61.7487.9 - 56.8 524.6 - 21.5587.3 - 5.6 532.8 - 14.1 body weight gain g200.9 - 23.8 305.6 - 59.9  249.1 - 42.9  253.5 - 18.2 319.1 - 10.3  260.0 - 12.0 food intake gday23.8 - 2.522.0 - 2.818.1 - 3.7 25.3 - 0.822.1 - 0.8 18.7 - 1.2 food efficiency ratio0.21 - 0.02 0.35 - 0.08 0.36 - 0.110.24 - 0.01 0.34 - 0.00 0.33 - 0.01total fat g46.0 - 4.982.3 - 19.2 63.1 - 6.7 52.5 - 9.883.1 - 5.9 58.5 - 2.8 relative of total fat 7.89 - 0.6611.75 - 2.90 10.06 - 0.7310.0 - 1.514.2 - 1.1 10.9 - 0.4 abdominal fat g10.8 - 1.417.9 - 5.1 13.1 - 2.3 11.3 - 4.117.1 - 1.416.3 - 2.0epididymal fat g9.8 - 0.917.8 - 3.9 13.6 - 2.1 17.3 - 2.428.0 - 1.8 15.0 - 1.2 perirenal fat g14.5 - 2.428.6 - 5.9 22.5 - 3.423.9 - 4.038.0 - 4.1 27.2 - 4.5 liver weight g12.9 - 1.516.4 - 2.1 14.1 - 2.315.0 - 0.815.2 - 0.715.5 - 1.6relative of liver weight 2.91 - 0.343.00 - 0.562.88 - 0.262.9 - 0.12.6 - 0.1 2.9 - 0.3cecum weight g5.6 - 0.84.6 - 0.2 5.0 - 0.3 4.2 - 0.14.6 - 0.1 5.3 - 1.3relative of cecum weight 1.26 - 0.20.84 - 0.08 1.04 - 0.09 0.80 - 0.040.79 - 0.020.99 - 0.27cecum contents g1.90 - 0.571.39 - 0.19 1.69 - 0.21 1.7 - 0.21.1 - 0.1 1.5 - 0.2 data are expressed as mean sd and statistically evaluated using one way anova followed by least significant difference lsd pos-hoc test.

rats in the mp hfd and mp es group were given commercial hfd with the same schedule as the mp normal group.

nevertheless it is still undetermined whether es itself or es altered gut microbiota esm effectively induce loss of body weight.therefore in the current study we tried to verify the anti-obesity effect of es through regulation of gut microbiota and to determine how gut microbiota can be modified by es.

as limitation of the study because the group of normal diet with es treatment is absent we are not able to confirm whether normal diet with es exert synergistic effect via gut microbiota regulation.conclusionsesm transplantation preserves the amelioration efficacy on hfd induced obesity and metabolic disorders by the association of modulating the distribution of intestinal microbiota enterogenous endotoxin and enteral acetic acid.supplementary materials the following are available online at  figure s1 comparison of gut microbiota figure s2 principal coordinate analysis pcoa plots figure s3 rarefaction curves table s1 fecal endotoxin concentration and quality control.acknowledgments this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea grant funded by the korean government nrf-2016r1a2b4014225.author contributions h.j.k.

the chromatograms were produced using a wavelength of 215 nm.both es and es altered gut microbiota changed body weight gain fats and organs weight and food intakees treatment significantly reduced body weight gain and food intake compared to the mp hfd group.

in the mp three types of gut microbiota from normal hfd or hfd together with es treatment respectively were transplanted by oral gavage to 3-week hfd fed rats.

similarly hfd feed for six weeks significantly increased serum tg level compared to the normal diet while es treatment resulted in noticeably reduced serum tg level compared to the mp hfd group.

before transplanting all cecal components in each mp group were separately pooled and dissolved with ten times the volume of phosphate buffered saline pbs.the second step was the gut microbiota transplantation study mt figure b the additional nine male sd rats 6 weeks 180-220 g orient bio seongnam-si korea were divided into three groups mt normal mt hfd and mt es group.
