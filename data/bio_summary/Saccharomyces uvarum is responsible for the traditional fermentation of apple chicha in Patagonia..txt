mapuche people exploited the fruits of these feral apple trees manshana's-aliwen in mapuche lan- guage as food but also to produce apple chicha a fresh low alco- holic beverage.although the microbiota responsible for most indigenous fer- mented beverages around the world remains undiscovered the fermented beverages produced in patagonia are unusual--based on current knowledge--in that they are generally produced at low temperatures lower than 20c.

how- ever the detection of the cryotolerant yeast species s. eubayanus or s. uvarum on a. araucana seeds and barks samples led us to consider the role of these species in the ancient mudai fermen- tations prior to the introduction of commercial yeasts for bak- ery rodri'guez et al.

for this purpose yeast dna was isolated according to standard pro- cedures querol et al.

total dna extraction was performed according to querol et al.

total yeast dna was subsequently digested with hinf i restric- tion enzyme roche diagnostics mannheim germany accord- ing to the supplier's instructions and the fragments separated in tae-containing 1 wv agarose gels.pcr-rflp analysis of nuclear genesthe detection of the different saccharomyces uvarum alleles was performed by pcr amplification and subsequent restriction analysis of 33 protein-encoding nuclear genes pe'rez-trave's et al.

the pcr-rflp profiles were compared with those reported by pe'rez- trave's et al.

for s. cere- visiae strains only cat8 and gal4 genes which resulted useful in previous studies peris et al.

nuclear genes were amplified by pcr as described above and the cox2 gene was amplified using primers and conditions described else- where belloch et al.
