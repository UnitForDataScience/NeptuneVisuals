The results of the gut microbiota analysis were submitted to NCBI and all files are available from the DNA Data Bank of Japan DDBJ database under the accession number DRA005300.Funding This study was supported by a grant E0150101-03 from the Korea Food Research Institute of South Korea .

The nutrikinetics of the individual metabolites at different time points were analyzed.

The relative abundance of species of the Para- bacteroides Dorea and Butyricimonas genera and Desulfovibrionaceaeunclassified Lachnospiraceaeunclassified and Rikenellaceaeunclassified families increased in the ovariectomy group while the relative abundance of 5237unclassified and Y52unclassifie- dunclassified increased in the sham group.

The animal studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea Food Research Institute KFRI-M-16014.

The supernatant was completely dried using a speed-vac the residue was resuspended in methanol filtered and then trans- ferred to the LC-MSMS system.

The ESI source was set in the negative ESI mode with a scan range of 50-1000 mz.

The mobile phases A and B which were com- posed of 10 mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile respectively both containing 0.1 for- mic acid were run on a gradient elution program of 0-14 min 2-95 B with a flow rate of0.35 mLmL with a 5 mL injection volume.

The capillary voltage and cone energy voltages were set at 1.0 and 40 V respectively.
