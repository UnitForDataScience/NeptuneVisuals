The liver transplant is not a perfect model because posttransplant patients are on antiviral antibiotic and immunosuppressive therapies however these patients still provide useful information on the impact that replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy liver has on the microbiota.

Inflammation in the oral cavity liver and the gut can lead to systemic inflam- mation thereby inducing endotoxemia as the result of an increase in the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic microbiota in the gut and oral cavity along with impaired mucosal and systemic immune response and a dampened ability of the liver to handle these insults.

While the studies are still limited and a link between periodontal and liver diseases is not as well established as asso- ciations between periodontitis and other systemic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease 78 it is likely that similar factors related to the oral microbiota and inflammation connect oral and liver disease as well.

It is possible that the link between the liver and the oral cavity could be via the gut through impaired intestinal permeability that in turn could allow direct translocation of bacteria andor their prod- ucts and inflammatory mediators from the oral cavity to the systemic circulation.In addition to periodontitis cirrhotic patients exhibit numerous oral issues such as petechiae 79 can- didiasis 79 and xerostomia 79 80.

An interesting aspect of liver disease-associated microbiota changes is the effect of liver transplant on the recipient's microbiota.

Therefore the tightly regulated interaction between the oral microbiota and the host immune system within the oral mucosa is key for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing adverse clinical outcomes.The emerging oral-gut axis and liver disease.

Similar to the gut microbiota the oral microbiota can be either beneficial or potentially pathogenic and is kept in balance by the natural defense mechanisms of the oral cavity 60.

Another study using oral capsules for FMT is now underway in the same population ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03152188.Manipulation of the gut microbiota has been shown to change oral microbiota composition.

An 8-week trial of twice-daily oral administration of 550 mg rifaximin in patients with compensated cirrhosis resulted in minor overall changes in microbiota composition as well as measurable changes in microbiota functionality 94.
