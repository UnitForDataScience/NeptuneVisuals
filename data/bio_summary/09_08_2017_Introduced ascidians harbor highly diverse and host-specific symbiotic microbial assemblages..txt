Received 11 May 2017OPEN Introduced ascidians harbor highly diverse and host-specific symbiotic microbial assemblagesJames S. Evans1 Patrick M. Erwin 1 Noa Shenkar2  Susanna Lopez-Legentil1Accepted 22 August 2017 Published xx xx xxxxMany ascidian species have experienced worldwide introductions exhibiting remarkable success in crossing geographic borders and adapting to local environmental conditions.

Partitioning of the ascidian microbial community data into abundant 0.1 relative abundance and rare 0.1 components resulted in 751 abundant OTUs that accounted for 96.9 of the total sequences and 4945 rare OTUs that accounted for 3.1 of the total sequences post singleton removal.

The core microbial community in P. anguinea consisted of 355 OTUs that comprised 90.4 of all sequences with the top 15 most prevalent core OTUs comprising 75.8 of all sequences Supplementary Table S2.

The core microbial community in P. zorritensis consisted of 552 OTUs that comprised 84.8 of all sequences with the top 15 most prevalent core OTUs accounting for 54.9 of all sequences Supplementary Table S2.

K kingdom P phylum C class O order F family G genus S species.the relative abundance of these universal core OTUs varied among hosts Table  these 103 OTUs represented just 1.81 of all detected ascidian OTUs but 79.1 of all sequences.

Studies using culture-independent DNA sequence-based techniques have revealed a high degree of microbial diversity in ascidians that is host-specific and appears to remain temporally consistent-.The functionality of diverse ascidian microbiomes may play an especially important role for introduced ascidians that must adapt to new environments.

To investigate thepotential role of microbial symbionts in these introductions we examined the microbial communities of three ascidian species common in North Carolina harbors.
