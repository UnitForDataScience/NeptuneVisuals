decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling pro- cesses in peatlands are performed by different groups of fungi such as saprotrophs ectomycorrhizal fungi endomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi archaea and bacteria  .

briefly since temperatures below 10 degc could not be reliably managed by the infrastruc- ture in the experimental chambers from november to april the ambient temperature was static at the average temperature of the growing season in the sample location 11.5 degc ele- vated temperature treatments were set at 15.5 and 19.5 degc.

from may to october the ambient temperature was set to a fluctuating average daily temperature per hour based on the past 5 years in london ontario the average summer temper- ature for the ambient treatment was 16.9 degc.

ascomycota richness demonstrated an overall in- crease over time but was significantly decreased under ele- vated temperature treatments such that the lowest ascomycota richness was observed under the  8 degc treatments after 12 months time x temperature f448  4.00 p  0.007 fig.

fungal diversity was also significantly reduced through time time f248  19.93 p  0.001 and highly affected by temperature increases of  8 degc temperature f248  7.26 p  0.001 fig.

the first pc axis for the ascomycota was significantly related to sampling time f2102  412.6 p  0.001 and temperature f2102  16.1p  0.001 while the second axis was significantly related to water table f1102  29.4 p  0.001 and temperature f2102  7.1 p  0.001 positive pc1 scores are related to litterbags collected from  8 degc and positive pc2 scores are associated with litterbags from saturated treatments fig.

examining the temperature treatment ef- fects closer otus 22 13 and 33 related to neofabraea an endophyte and mitrula respectively increased in proportional abundance with increased temperature treatment of  8 degc while otus 48 and 63 closely related to an ericoid mycor- rhizal root fungus and an entomopathogen respectively dem- onstrated increased ratios under  4 degc temperatures.

effect size for temperature treatments shows where a particular temperature treatment had a positive effect increased ratio of a particular fungus.

increased temperature of  8 degc was also favorable for otu 873 closely related to polyporus but only under saturated water table conditions however it was more strongly affected by temperature than hydrology.

both increased temperature and lowered water table position drove shifts in fungal community composition with a strong positive effect on endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi including one operational taxonomic unit otu tenta- tively identified as barrenia panicia and different groups of saprotrophs identified as mortierella galerina and mycena.

increases in temperature could directly increase the abundance and activity of competitive fungal species fa- vored by warm conditions and indirectly influence fungal communities through a lowering of the water table providing more habitat for aerobic fungi in particular saprotrophs that can accelerate the rate of decomposition especially of deep peat.

as such the results of many previous studies of fungal communities in boreal peatlands suggest that various groups of fungi and their func- tions have been under-represented possibly due to the choice of inappropriate genetic markers or improper data analyses  .here we take advantage of a manipulative experimental design in which intact peat cores were subjected to artificially altered temperature carbon dioxide concentration and hy- drology in a full factorial design in a state-of-the-art green- house at western the biotron.

otu richness of the other fungi decreased strongly over time time f248  47.62 p  0.001 with the largest decrease occurring in the  8 degc treatments after 12 months time x temperature f448  5.53 p  0.001 fig.

similarly the first axis of the pca biplot for other fungi was significantly related to sampling time f2102  926.3 p  0.001 and temperature f2102  108.58 p  0.001 while the second axis was significantly related to water table treatments f1102  129.1 p  0.001 positive pc1 scores are related to litterbags collected from  8 degc and positive pc2 scores are associated with litterbags collected from saturated treatments fig.
