Fourteen mesocosms were placed within each of six experimental greenhouse chambers seven replicates under a saturated water table condition where the water table was 5 cm below the peat surface and seven repli- cates under a lowered water table condition with the water table 25 cm below the peat surface.

Both positive  and negative effects   of water table drawdown on peatland fungal communities have been previously observed short-term water table drawdown can increase oxygen avail- ability and facilitate the cellular energy metabolism in fungi especially saprotrophs while long-term water table drawdown can impact the overall peat-soil environment.

The black dots in both a and b represent other OTUs present in peat samplesTable 1Indicator taxa significantly affected by hydrology and temperature treatments based on ALDEx resultsHydrology effectTemperature effectEffect size for water table treatments are positive values when indicating a positive effect of increased water table position and negative when indicating a negative effect of lowered water table.

While we did not explicitly link changes in plant communities with changes in below-ground fungal communities we suggest that early changes in fungal com- munities particularly endophytes and mycorrhizal root- associated fungi with their role in facilitating the development of their hosts   may signal impending changes in above-ground plant communities under climate changescenarios.Both increased temperature and lowered water table posi- tion drove shifts in fungal community composition overlying the shifts associated with degradative succession the commu- nity response to changes in water table appeared more strong- ly during early stage decomposition 4 months when labile carbon decomposers were prominent while elevated temper- ature treatments altered the cellulose and lignin decomposer fungal community at 8 and 12 months respectively.

PCA axis 2 in a is driven by temperature and water table while water table only is the driver of PCA axis 2 in b. Theeffects of CO2 treatments on fungal communities were not significant.

OTU 0 closely related to Mycena OTU 159 identified as Rhizophlyctis rosea and OTU 153 closely related to Phaffia increased under lower water table conditions while OTU 1 related to a Hypochnicium polypore and OTU 241 closely related to a Mesochytrium increased in abundance under saturated water table conditions.

Decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling pro- cesses in peatlands are performed by different groups of Fungi such as saprotrophs ectomycorrhizal fungi endomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi Archaea and Bacteria  .

Similarly the first axis of the PCA biplot for other fungi was significantly related to sampling time F2102  926.3 P  0.001 and temperature F2102  108.58 P  0.001 while the second axis was significantly related to water table treatments F1102  129.1 P  0.001 positive PC1 scores are related to litterbags collected from  8 degC and positive PC2 scores are associated with litterbags collected from saturated treatments Fig.

2 PCA biplot of Ascomycota a and other fungi b under increased temperature elevated atmospheric CO2 and altered water table conditions.

Both increased temperature and lowered water table position drove shifts in fungal community composition with a strong positive effect on endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi including one operational taxonomic unit OTU tenta- tively identified as Barrenia panicia and different groups of saprotrophs identified as Mortierella Galerina and Mycena.
