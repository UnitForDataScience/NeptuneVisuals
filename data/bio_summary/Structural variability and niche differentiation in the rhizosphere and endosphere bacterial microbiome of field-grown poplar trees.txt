finally we clearly observed a higher overlap in otus from the rhizosphere soil samples and the root samples 11.7 as compared to rhizosphere soil and the stem samples 1.8 and the rhizosphere soil and leaf samples 2.8.discussionquality of the pyrosequencing analysiswe used an optimized pcr approach to reduce co- amplification of chloroplast and mitochondrial 16s rrna in many studies the high homology between bacterial 16s rrna genes chloroplast 16s rrna genes and plant nuclear and mitochondrial 16s rrna genes and moreover the high abundance of chloroplast 16s rrna genes in these environments led to undesired co-amplification of non-target sequences  our optimized pcr approach resulted in very low co-amplification of these sequences and high retrieval of bacterial 16s rrna sequences table the highest re- trieval of chloroplast 16s rrna sequences was observed in the stem samples corroborating results from our pri- mer optimization and reinforcing our view that the balance between the amount of endophytic bacterial dna bacterial cell density and chloroplast dna seems to play a more important role than the absolute chloro- plast concentration.

for diversity and evenness estimates we found a clear separation between the rhizosphere soil samples and endosphere samples p  0.05. higher diversity andevenness measures were observed for the rhizosphere soil samples as compared to the samples of the endosphere plant compartments.

otu richness was highly dependent on plant compartment p 0.05 with high richness values for rhizosphere soil 848.9 - 7.9 and consistently decreased richness estimates in the root samples 243.7 - 9.6 and stem samples 126.7- 11.9. otu richness indices of the leaf samples 118.3 - 17.2 were comparable with those of the stem samples.

pcr cycling conditions were identical as described above except for the number of pcr cycles that was lowered to 25.subsequently quadruplicate pcr amplicon pools from the corresponding samples were grouped together resulting in 15 samples rhizosphere soil and root and 11 samples stem and leaf per plant compartment 15 biological replicates x 2 plant compartments  11 bio- logical replicates x 2 plant compartments  total of 52 samples.

betaproteobacteria were sig- nificantly p  0.05 enriched in the rhizosphere soil 24.84 and the root samples 15.56 whereas gam- maproteobacteria were depleted in these compartments rhizosphere soil  9.62 root  7.23 as compared to the stem and leaf samples.

full results of indicator species analysis are presented in additional file exclusively found in the rhizosphere samples compared to the root samples 7.1 the stem samples 3.2 and the leaf samples 5.5. around 6 of the total otus were exclusively observed in the endosphere compart- ments.

how- ever when we used a community matrix excluding otus with an average relative abundance of 1 we found 6 in- dicator otus in the rhizosphere soil arthrobacter nitros- pira norcardioides hyphomicrobiaceae mycobacteriump  0.01 and microvirga p  0.05 2 in the root samples novosphingobium and niastella p  0.05 2 in the stem samples alcaligenaceae and amnibacterium p  0.05 and 2 in the leaf samples sphingomonadales and auranti- monas p  0.05 table .finally to provide a complete overview of the otu distribution within the plant compartments we calcu- lated the proportion of otus uniquely identified in each specific plant compartment as well as the otus shared by the different plant compartments additional file the proportion of otus shared by all plant compart- ments was 16.4. approximately 26 of all otus wereassociations were calculated with the dufrene-legendre indicator species analysis routine indval indicator value in r. data table shows results for the analysis where rare otus 1 relative abundance were excluded.

pca and hierarchicalclusters were based on 15 biological replicates rhizosphere soil and root samples and 11 biological replicates stem and leaf samples and were constructed in primer 7 with 10000 iterationswe still observed a high relative abundance in the rhizo- sphere soil compartment.

fi- nally quadruplicate aliquots of each sample 1.5 ml of the homogenized plant material root stem or leaf  were stored for all poplar individuals at -80 degc until dna was extracted.dna extractionto minimize dna extraction bias dna was extracted in quadruplicate from the rhizosphere soil root stem and leaf samples approximately 250 mg of rhizosphere soil was used for each individual dna ex- traction.

the stem and leaf samples were clearly distin- guished from rhizosphere soil and root samples but did not cluster completely according to their respective plant compartment.

candidate division tm7 wassignificantly enriched p  0.05 in the root 14.49 and stem samples 10.29 as compared to the rhizosphere soil and the leaf samples.

as described above candidate division tm7 was significantly enriched in the root and stem samples as compared to the rhizosphere soil and leaf samples.

rhizobiales were significantly p  0.05 depleted in the stem 3.38 and leaf samples 3.23 whereas pseudo- monas stem  15.98 leaf  26.95 methylobacterium stem  6.52 leaf  8.28 and sphingomonas stem  3.19 leaf  5.29 were enriched in these compartments as compared to the rhizosphere soil and root samples.

to ensure high-quality and quantity dna from all studied plant compartments and reduce bias from low dna retrieval we opted for a different dna extraction kit for the rhizosphere soil samples and the endosphere samples.

rhizodeposition and root exud- ation by the host plant in the root zone fuels chemo- attraction and colonization of the rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane thereby leading to the formation of distinct- ive highly rich and diverse rhizosphere microbiomes - after rhizoplane colonization adaptation to anendophytic lifestyle is dependent on the ability of the soil-borne bacteria to pass actively or passively the endodermis and pericycle reach the xylem vessels and finally lead to systemic colonization of the plant systemic plant colonization by certain bacterial species is re-enforced by the proportion of otus shared by all the plant compartments 16.4 additional file the rhizosphere soil-root interface acts as a selective barrier and endophytic competencecolonization is limited to specific bacterial species.
