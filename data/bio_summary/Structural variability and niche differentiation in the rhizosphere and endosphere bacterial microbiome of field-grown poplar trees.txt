Finally we clearly observed a higher overlap in OTUs from the rhizosphere soil samples and the root samples 11.7 as compared to rhizosphere soil and the stem samples 1.8 and the rhizosphere soil and leaf samples 2.8.DiscussionQuality of the pyrosequencing analysisWe used an optimized PCR approach to reduce co- amplification of chloroplast and mitochondrial 16S rRNA In many studies the high homology between bacterial 16S rRNA genes chloroplast 16S rRNA genes and plant nuclear and mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes and moreover the high abundance of chloroplast 16S rRNA genes in these environments led to undesired co-amplification of non-target sequences  Our optimized PCR approach resulted in very low co-amplification of these sequences and high retrieval of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences Table The highest re- trieval of chloroplast 16S rRNA sequences was observed in the stem samples corroborating results from our pri- mer optimization and reinforcing our view that the balance between the amount of endophytic bacterial DNA bacterial cell density and chloroplast DNA seems to play a more important role than the absolute chloro- plast concentration.

Rhizodeposition and root exud- ation by the host plant in the root zone fuels chemo- attraction and colonization of the rhizosphere soil and rhizoplane thereby leading to the formation of distinct- ive highly rich and diverse rhizosphere microbiomes - After rhizoplane colonization adaptation to anendophytic lifestyle is dependent on the ability of the soil-borne bacteria to pass actively or passively the endodermis and pericycle reach the xylem vessels and finally lead to systemic colonization of the plant Systemic plant colonization by certain bacterial species is re-enforced by the proportion of OTUs shared by all the plant compartments 16.4 Additional file The rhizosphere soil-root interface acts as a selective barrier and endophytic competencecolonization is limited to specific bacterial species.

To statistically support the visual clustering of the bacterial communities in the above PCA analyses different plant compartments were exam- ined using ANOSIM an analog of univariate ANOVA with the Spearman rank correlation method Table All plant compartments rendered bacterial microbiota significantly dissimilar from each other P values listed in Table  at the phylum and OTU level see Additional file Top members of the bacterial microbiome within each plant compartmentFinally we took a closer look at the individual bacterial phyla and OTUs which differentiate the bacterial com- munities in the plant compartments.

Betaproteobacteria were sig- nificantly P  0.05 enriched in the rhizosphere soil 24.84 and the root samples 15.56 whereas Gam- maproteobacteria were depleted in these compartments rhizosphere soil  9.62 root  7.23 as compared to the stem and leaf samples.

The distribution of all identified OTUs across the different plant compartments Additional file also highlights several other aspects a the inability of a large number of OTUs to colonize the plant 25.7 of all OTUs b the existence of obligate endophytes which are only observed in the endosphere compartments 5.9 of all OTUs and are strictly dependent on their host plant for survival  c the existence of facultative endo- phytes which may exist inside endosphere and outside the host plant rhizosphere soil  and d although most endophytic bacteria colonizing the host plant origin- ate from the rhizosphere soil  some may originate elsewhere e.g.

Fi- nally quadruplicate aliquots of each sample 1.5 ml of the homogenized plant material root stem or leaf  were stored for all poplar individuals at -80 degC until DNA was extracted.DNA extractionTo minimize DNA extraction bias DNA was extracted in quadruplicate from the rhizosphere soil root stem and leaf samples Approximately 250 mg of rhizosphere soil was used for each individual DNA ex- traction.

were markably higher in the rhizosphere soil as compared to the endosphere samples.Do bacterial communities present in the endosphere differentiate within the plant niches and how do they relate to the rhizosphere communitiesTo control for differences in sampling effort across plant compartments we rarefied each sample to 2000 se- quences per sample although rarefying and using linear models of abundance have been scrutinized recently by McMurdie and Holmes Initially we estimated alpha diversity focussing on OTU richness evenness and diversity.

com- pared the bacterial and fungal microbiota of mature poplar Populus deltoides trees using 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene pyrosequencing and revealed highly different root endophytic bacterial communities as compared to the rhizosphere soil .

To a lesser extent we can also distinguish the bacterial colonization of the anthosphere flower the spermosphere seeds  and the carposphere fruit All these microenvironments provide specific biotic and abi- otic conditions for the residing bacterial communities.Within plant-bacteria research most attention hasbeen dedicated to niche differentiation of bacterial communities at the rhizosphere soil-root interface - - For example Gottel et al.

PCA and hierarchicalclusters were based on 15 biological replicates rhizosphere soil and root samples and 11 biological replicates stem and leaf samples and were constructed in PRIMER 7 with 10000 iterationswe still observed a high relative abundance in the rhizo- sphere soil compartment.
