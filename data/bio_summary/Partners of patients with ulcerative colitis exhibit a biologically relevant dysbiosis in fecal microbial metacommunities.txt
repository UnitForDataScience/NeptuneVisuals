TheActinobacteriaCoriobacteriaceae unclassified0.021entire microbiota of UC patients was not significantlyFigure 2 Significant differences in the fecal microbiota composition between ulcerative colitis patients and their healthy partners.

The down arrows indicate less abundant microbiota in ulcerative colitis UC patients and the up arrow represents the more abundant microbiota in UC patients compared with their healthy partners.16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing of fecal DNA samples was performed using next-generation sequencing NGS technology.

In addition the microbiota of the UC patients had fewer ABC transporters for membrane transport P  0.041.DISCUSSIONAlteration in the composition of the gut microbiota and decreases in community diversity are associated with the pathogenesis of UC20.

Although there was no direct evidence that gut microbiota could spread between IBD patients and normal individuals the results of this study suggested that fecal microbiota likely influence each other during long-term cohabitation with UC patients.

These findings further demonstrated that the gut microbiota composition and alterations to it plays a crucial role in the occurrence of UC.Although the cause of UC has many uncertain factors gut microbiota dysbiosis has been considered a major trigger of inflammation23.

Couples with UC have microbiota dysbiosistest R v3.1.2 was used to compare inter-individual differences.

Additionally the pathways involved in membrane transport and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were more abundant in the healthy partners.CONCLUSIONOur results suggested that the microbial composition might be affected in healthy partners cohabiting with UC patients especially in terms of microbiota dysbiosis.Key words Ulcerative colitis Patients Healthy partner Fecal microbial communities Microbiota dysbiosisc The Authors 2017.

Some alterations in the microbial community are shared in Crohn's disease CD and UC patients relative to healthy people including reduced gut microbiota diversity particularly Firmicutes the presence of non- commensals and increased abundance of pathogenic Proteobacteria strains78.

For example an increased presence of Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium spp group6 as well as a reduction in Clostridium coccoides group has been reported in UC patients9.Previous studies have demonstrated that environ- mental factors including dietary age9 habits10 and obesity11 impact the composition of the gut microbiota.
