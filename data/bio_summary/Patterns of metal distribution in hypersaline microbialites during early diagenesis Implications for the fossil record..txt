The accumulation of Cu Zn and As could thus be a by-product of microbial activity such as a detoxification process or linked to direct uptake by the micro- organisms for assimilatory or dissimilatory purposes.Micro-organisms produce diverse metabolic products which can bind andor react with metals alkali earth metals transition metals semimetals and metalloids as well as lanthanides and actinides result- ing in the precipitation of bioinorganic metal complexes Harrisson Ceri  Turner 2007.

XRF maps of Fe As Mn Zn Cu and Ti highlighting the bimodal distribution of these metals in the bottom section of the microbialite a homogeneous distribution of Fe As and Zn linked to the passive binding of the metals by the EPS at the surface of the mat and a heterogeneous distribution of metals as metal-enriched sulfidescopious amounts of organic carbon that support high metabolic rates of aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs notably sulfate-reducing bac- teria Fig.

By characterizing the micrometer- scale distribution of metals and microbial activities as well as the millimeter-scale distribution and major properties of organic matter and sulfur we were able to discuss based on similar processes in com- parable sedimentary ecosystems which processes control the accu- mulation and distribution of the metals in the different growth phases of a microbialite that aid in understanding early diagenetic processes.

As a consequence a small fraction of the metals near the surface of the Big Pond microbialite could be bound to AVS.Accordingly the distribution of the metals and metalloids in the biologically highly active upper centimeters of the microbialite is not controlled by a selective and direct process linked to the metabolicactivities of the microbial communities but by a non-selective and in- direct process.

Here we report the microscale depth distribution of metals microbial activity and EPS in a lithifying hypersaline microbial mat.

Black squared areas are the area mapped by SR-XRF Figures 5 and 6thin microbial mats more or less transient at the shoreline of the lake snake-like microbial mats thick flat microbial mats and stromatolitic build-ups in the deepest part of the lake Glunk et al.

In addition to binding to EPS metals can also adsorb directly to the cell surface possibly to sequester and shed del- eterious metals from the organism's microenvironment Douglas  Beveridge 1998.

The distribution of the metals is homogeneous in the organic layers reflecting the passive binding of metals within the mat 2.5 x 106 of pixels pixel size 5 mm2 acquired at the Australian Synchrotron at 15.53 keV.

Indeed a major role was attributed to EPS in the accumulation of metals in the upper 10 mm of a non-lithifying mat of Guerrero Negro Baja Sur Mexico where an unknown process different from co-precipitation with sulfides was invoked for concentrating metals in the mat Huerta-Diaz et al.

Notably as the mi- crobial mat grows upward oxidized trace metals that were trappednear the surface can be solubilized below the O2HS- interface and incorporated in Fe sulfides Huerta-Diaz  Morse 1992 Morse Luther 1999.The active microbial mat community produces an organic matrix extracellular polymeric substances EPS Decho Visscher  Reid 2005 which contains charged functional groups e.g.
