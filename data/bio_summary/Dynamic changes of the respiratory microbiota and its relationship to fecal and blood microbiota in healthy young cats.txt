using 16s rrna amplicon sequencing of dna extracted from rectal and oropharyngeal op swabs bronchoalveolar lavage fluid balf and blood our objective was to characterize the fecal op blood and lower airway microbiota over time in healthy cats.

similar to rectal swabs and in contrast to previ- ous reports in humans  bacteroidetes 67.60 - 1.36 and proteobacteria 22.26 - 0.56 were the predominant phyla detected in blood samples.from day 0 to week 10 there was a significant increase in the relative abundance of bacter- oidetes in feces from 18.8- 4.33 to 33.05- 3.46 p  0.001 in op from 17.6-2.63 to31.19-2.2 p  0.028 and in balf from 14.41-6.35 to 55.01-4.94 p  0.001. in con-trast there was a significant decrease in the relative abundance of proteobacteria from day 0 to week 10 in op from 74.28-3.15 to 54.78-2.89 p  0.016 and in balf from 81.65-6.63 to 27.26-1.33 p  0.001. the relative abundance of the phyla firmicutes and fuso- bacteria did not significantly change over time.resolved to the taxonomic level of family  the differences in microbial composition between sites are highlighted in particular when comparing rectal swabs with airway samples.

fecal and op swabs provided abundant dna yielding a mean-sem of 65653-6145 and 206323-4360 sequences per sample respectively while balf and blood sam- ples had lower coverage 1489-430 and 269-18 sequences per sample respectively.oropharyngeal and fecal swabs were significantly richer than balf mean number otus 93 88 and 36 respectively p  0.001 with no significant difference p  0.180 in richness between time points.

to date studies documenting the presence of and characterizing the healthy airway microbiota have not been published in cats.the primary aim of this study was to document the presence of and characterize the respi- ratory microbiota in healthy cats.

when samples from all sites were included in the analysis principal component 1 pc1 accounting for 33.51 of the variation among the samples showed complete separation of the fecal and op microbial populations from balf and blood .

fecal op and balf samples were collected from six healthy research cats at day 0 week 2 and week 10 blood was collected at week 10. dna was extracted amplified via pcr and sequenced using the illumina miseq platform.

as anticipated balf and blood had significantly lower coverage 1489 - 430 and 269 - 18 respectively compared to rectal and op swabs .for all samples even those with lower biomass and dna yield below the limit of detection consistent and interpretable data were obtained.the richness of rectal and op swabs was higher than that of balf and blood the mean number of operational taxonomic units otus groups of sequences sharing a minimum of 97 nucleotide identity was 88 93 36 and 15 respectively .

in rectal swabs the phylum bacteroidetes consisted primarily of organisms in the bacteroida- ceae family 30.12 - 3.60. in op swabs this phylum was represented by the porphyromona- daceae and paraprevotellaceae families 12.45 - 1.29 and 5.46 - 0.87 respectively.although microbes in the phylum bacteroidetes were present at much higher proportions in blood compared to balf the majority of the microbes in this phylum belonged to the family sphingobacteriaceae 64.24-2.38 and 22.56-5.08 in blood and balf respectively.microbes in the phylum firmicutes were represented by the families tissierellaceae and lachnospiraceae 10.31 - 3.87 and 10.00 - 1.87 respectively while the phylum fusobac- teria was dominated by the family fusobacteriaceae 11.68 - 2.40. these families were mainly found in fecal samples and were detected at relatively low abundance in other sample sites.
