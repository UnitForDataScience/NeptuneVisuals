Identification of selective sweepsWe defined robust populations of G. apicola or S. alvi as those that likely resisted antibiotic treatment based on a relative abundance of over 40 for each species of the total gut community following antibiotic treatment based on 16S rDNA gene profiling data from Raymann et al.

2017 recently showed that move- ment of tetR genes among strains of G. apicola and S. alvi is highly dynamic and is affected by recent history of antibiotic exposure.In agreement with a selective sweep scenario for G. apicola we observed three alleles in pflA that reached fixation in nearly all treated bees that displayed a high relative abundance of G. apicola.

In S. alvi the two gene markers gave similar results consistent with a previous study suggesting that S. alvi recombines less frequently than does G. apicola Moran et al.

In fact we did not observe a significant difference in G. apicola or S. alvi genetic diversity between control and treatment bees sampled on Day 0 post- treatment.

This find- ing further suggests that the treatment resulted in heterogeneous allelic compositions through differential variant survival.In some treated bees S. alvi and G. apicola did not appear to be affected by antibiotic treatment.

Therefore we defined a sub- group of bees that we refer to as robust bees based on their gut communities exhibiting an increase in relative abundance of S. alvi or G. apicola following antibiotic treatment.

species genus and not at the strain level.Unlike S. alvi the absolute number of G. apicola cells did not decrease in the bee gut after treatment and their relative abundance significantly increased Raymann et al.

However the impact of antibiotic treatment on the genetic diversity within these two species could not be characterized with this method.Here we applied deep amplicon sequencing of protein-coding gene loci to follow the fine-scale dynamics of two closely associatedand abundant members of the honeybee core gut microbiome S. alvi and G. apicola after antibiotic perturbation.

Two Gram-negative members of the honeybee gut microbiome Gilliamella apicola and Snograssella alvi dominate in the ileum region of the hindgut where they form a biofilm on the gut wall with S. alvi in direct contact with the host epithelium andG.

These results indicate that G. apicola is more frequently exchanged across bees andor that G. apicola engages in homologous recombination with other conspecifics more frequently than S. alvi Engel et al.
