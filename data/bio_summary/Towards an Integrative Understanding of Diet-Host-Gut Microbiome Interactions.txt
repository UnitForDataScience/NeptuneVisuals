The essential role of host processes was demonstrated through intra-peritoneal anti-inflammatories that reversed chronic microbial changes despite mice continuing the high-fat diet .Characteristic inter-individual microbiome differences reflect resilience in community structure tendency to return to a baseline state and long-term dietary shifts can trigger tipping points in this baseline.

The activity of the microbiome is supported by dietary nutrients that bypass host absorption and by host secretions.

For instance studies of ileostomy patients found that only 17 of dietary protein 2 of digestible dietary starch and 5 of dietary fat reaches the colon .

Yet unifying principles of microbiome assembly or function at levels required to rationally manipulate a specific individual's microbiome to their benefit have not emerged.

We posit that integrative approaches to teasing apart diet-microbe-host interactions will help bridge between experimental data sets and conceptual models and will be of value in formulating predictive models.Keywords gut microbiome digestion diet metabolite modeling host feedbackiNtrODUctiONBoth diet and the gut microbiome are strongly implicated in the global epidemics of chronic diseases including obesity and diabetes cardiovascular disease cancer autoimmunity allergies and asthma -.
