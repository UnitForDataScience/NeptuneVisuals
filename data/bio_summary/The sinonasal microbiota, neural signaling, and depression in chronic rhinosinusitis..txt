depression comprises a proinflammatory state associated with elevated biomarkers of inflammation such as interleukin-1 interleukin-6 tumor necrosis factor and c-reactive protein.3 5-8 accordingly interactions between the immune system the microbiota and the brain are now an additional focal point in the study of chronic inflamma- tory conditions.a shared language of signaling molecules between prokaryotes and eukaryotes has also become increasingly recognized.9 the field of microbial endocrinology emerged from the discovery of shared communication pathways-- including the production of signaling molecules as well as their receptors--between prokaryote and eukaryote kingdoms including a number with direct neuroactive potential.9 serotonin g -aminobutyric acid gaba cat- echolamines and acetylcholine for example can be micro- bially derived.10 tryptophan the precursor for serotonin can also be metabolized by microbes producing other neu- roactive metabolites and reducing the levels of tryptophan available for serotonin biosynthesis.11the gut has been a major focus of study on potential microbial-brain interactions termed the gut-microbiota- brain axis including in chronic inflammatory functional gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.12-15 in the gut interaction between the epithelium and bacterially derived molecules can stimulate the pro- duction of neuropeptides that then diffuse into the blood stream.3 furthermore increased permeability of the gut ep- ithelium may lead to increased translocation of microbes and microbially derived products including neuroactive substances which can have an indirect such as via in- creased inflammatory cytokine production and subsequent stimulation of the vagus nerve or direct such as neural effects of microbial products influence on the brain and behavior.3 16 17given the association between the gut microbiota and mental health in gastrointestinal gi conditions we hy- pothesized that the sinonasal microbiota may similarly in- fluence psychological symptom burdens associated with chronic inflammatory sinonasal disease as microbially in- fluenced neurotransmitter molecules in sinonasal mucus have direct potential access to the brain via olfactory andor trigeminal neural pathways.

the sinonasal microbiota neural signaling and depression in chronic rhinosinusitismichael hoggard bsc hons1 angela nocera2 kristi biswas phd3 michael w. taylor phd14 richard g. douglas md3 and benjamin s. bleier md facs2background the complex relationships between the hu- man microbiota the immune system and the brain play im- portant roles in both health and disease and have been of increasing interest in the study of chronic inflammatory mu- cosal conditions.

nonetheless although the influence may not be as great as that of the gut microbiota given the potential for the sinonasal microbiota to affect both the nature of inflam- mation in crs23 as well as neural signaling molecules such as those measured here this remains a worthwhile target of further investigation and remediation efforts and as a potential modifier of both the physical inflammatory and psychological burdens associated with chronic inflamma- tory conditions such as crs.conclusionthis study has identified associations between local sinonasal concentrations of the neurotransmitters sero- tonin dopamine and gaba depression severity and patterns in the sinonasal microbiota in a cohort of crs patients and healthy controls.

the25 bacterial otus with the highest relative abundance over the cohort as a whole were identified for subsequent analyses.bacterial community quantificationfinally total bacterial load for each sample was estimated via quantitative pcr of 16s rrna gene copy numbers as described elsewhere.22 38data analysesdemographics data and clinical scores neurotransmitter data and bacterial community data were compared be- tween controls and crs patients by wilcoxon rank sum tests in r version 3.3.0.39 tests were two-sided with a0.05.

the relative abundance of one otu of the genus anaerococcus was significantly re- duced in crs patients compared with controls p 0.006. whereas both groups showed a high degree of intersub- ject variability in bacterial community types there were no other noteworthy differences in bacterial community mem- bership structure or diversity or overall bacterial burden in crs patients compared with control subjects fig.

however crs has previously been associated with increased rates of asthma lower bacterial diversity increased bacterial com- munity dispersion and increased bacterial load.22 44 45 as in previous studies22 38 44 most variables in this study ex- hibited a high degree of intersubject variability in bothcontrols and crs subjects making it difficult to discern disease associations from natural variation.

furthermore crs subjects tended to represent more moderate cases of the condition many with lund-mackay scores 10. ob- served patterns and associations may be more pronounced in a larger crs cohort and in one with greater disease severity.potential mechanisms of sinonasal microbiota-brain communicationthe microbial production of neurotransmitters as well as metabolism of precursors such as tryptophan are impor- tant potential mechanisms of microbial-brain influence.3 mucosal dysfunction a feature of inflammatory conditions such as crs40-42 may enable increased translocation of neurotransmitters microbes their metabolites and other stimulants which can drive direct including potentially via local neuronal uptake pathways and indirect effects on neural signaling.disturbance of the intestinal microbiota has been linked to translocation of microbes andor microbially derived products across the mucosal barrier17 46 47 increased vul- nerability to inflammatory stimuli4 including lps16 and an increase in circulatory cytokines.2 17 circulatory lps and proinflammatory cytokines have both been associated with depression andor depressive symptoms.5 6 16 in crs multiple inflammatory parameters have been identified as elevated in different crs subjects including proinflam- matory cytokines known to be capable of neural effectssuch as interleukin-6 interleukin-1b and tumor necrosis factor.24 48 changes in the local microbiota may also influ- ence toll-like receptor activation21 associate with clinical severity scores and general markers of inflammation24 and even drive specific types of inflammatory processes in differ- ent crs subjects.23 thus both mucosal permeability and alterations to the microbiota in crs could subsequently in- fluence immunomodulation and ultimately brain function.

gi-related in- put into the sinonasal system including both gi-associated microbiota and general stomach contents may be an im- portant driver of change in the sinonasal microbiota and the upper airway mucosa in those crs patients with con- comitant gerd.the directions of effectoverall these data provide an early indication of poten- tial associations between the microbiota local concentra- tions of neurotransmitters and depression severity.

due to the massive abundance of the gut microbiota relative to the sinonasal microbiota as well as the well- reported connections between the gut and the brain these changes may indeed have a greater potential than those of the sinonasal microbiota to play a modifying role on sys- temic immune effects and signaling with the brain in crs.

fur- thermore microbial community dysbiosis and instability is also thought to play a role in crs20 with links ob- served between reduced bacterial diversity increased dom- inance by some taxa increased bacterial load inflamma- tory signaling cascades and markers of inflammation in crs.21-24the bidirectional influence of local disease severity and psychological states in crs can be substantial.

samples were rarefied to an even sequencing depth of 835 reads per sample with rarefaction curves indicating that this depth sufficiently accounted for the majority of the true diversity of the sampled bacterial communities supplementary figure 1. bacterial community alpha diversity for each sample was calculated in qiime including richness observed otus and shannon and simpson diversity indices.

3. these findings were corroborated by nonmetric multidi- mensional scaling analysis and analysis of dispersion the range of different bacterial community types where con- trol and crs subjects in this study were found to be largely overlapping and similarly dispersed p 0.91 indicating a comparable range of bacterial community types between the 2 groups supplementary fig.
