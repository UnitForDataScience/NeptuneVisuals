the higher the score is the more important the role is a. cladogram shows that brown dots are unimportant bacteria in any groups other colored dots are important bacteria in the group labeled with the same color b. lfd represents mice fed a low-fat diet hfd represents mice fed a high-fat diet and hfdl and hfdh represent mice fed hfd plus 100 and 300 mgkg gypenosides respectively.genase mcad p  0.05 b in a dose-dependent manner in the hfd-induced obese mouse model.it has been reported that beige adipocytes from wats are also ucp1 positive and may be induced to express thermogenic genes and stimulate respiration and energy expenditure besides the classical brown adipocytes from bats and the progress has been described as browning.

the effect of gypenosides on theselected bat thermogenic progress marker proteins including ppar-g coactivator-1a pgc-1a pr domain containing 16 prdm16 and ucp1 were investigated using a western-blot analysis and two representative sds-page results from eight animals in each dietary treatment group are reported in a. compared with the hfd mice supplementation with gypenosides significantly increased ucp-1 pgc-1a and prdm16 protein expressions in a dose-dependent manner p 0.05 a. ucp1 is important for bats in transforming stored chemical energy into heat a thermal energy and protecting mice from overweight and cold whereas increased pgc-1a and prdm16 are associated with adipocyte tissue energy expenditure.

the sequences were clustered with representative ones with a sequence identity cutoff of 97. at the phylum level 11 phyla were identified in the faeces a. firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the two most abundant bacterial phyla underthe experimental conditions and the switch from a low-fat diet to a high-fat diet changed the composition of the mouse gut microbiota b-d. in addition 300 mgkgday gypenosides treatment significantly increased verrucomicrobia content which played a role in prebiotics a. the gut microbiota of the hfd group mice was characterized by a significant 3.2-fold increase of the firmicutes to bacteroidetes ratio compared with that of the low-fat diet group and the ratio was decreased by 20 and 58.6 by the gypenoside treatmentat a dose of 100 and 300 mgkgday respectively p  0.05 d. firmicutes are gram-positive bacteria which are involved in energy resorption and obesity.
