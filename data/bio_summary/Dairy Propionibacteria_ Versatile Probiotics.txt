recent data also suggest the ability of some dairy propionibacteria metabolites to be used as prebiotics  such as 14-dihydroxy-2-naphtoic acid dhna a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes both in the composition andor activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confer benefits -.genome sequencing of p. freudenreichii and p. acidipropionici revealed the genetic basis of their great ability to adapt to various environments .

dairy propionibacteria such as p. freudenreichii produce the isomer cis-9 trans-11 octadecadienoic rumenic acid ra in culture and in fermented dairy products from la and isomerize also the c12-double bond of lna and g-linolenic acid .

the two branched-chain compounds produced by p. freudenreichii are 2-methylbutanoic acid and isovaleric acid.

however p. acidipropionici species were shown to produce a high amount of propionic acid by glycerol fermentation without acetic acid production .
