S.aureus culture-positive lesional skin had decreased bacterial diversity when compared to lesional skin that was S.aureus culture-negative Fig.

S. hominis A9 grown on agar generated a clear zone of inhibition of S.aureus growth thus confirming that this strain spontaneously secreted activity into culture medium at a level sufficient to directly inhibit S.aureus Fig.

To directly test whether this clone could reduce colonization by S.aureus on the skin we applied S. hominis A9 or an equal density of control S. hominis isolates without antimicrobial activity to the surface of sanitized pigskin 31 on which a defined amount of S.aureus had first been applied.

Similarly after colonization of the back skin of mice with a known amount of S.aureus a single application of S. hominis A9 reduced S.aureus but control strains of S. hominis had no effect Fig.

LL-37 alone 8 mM decreased S.aureus survival by 3-log whereas 4 mMNakatsuji et al.Page 6LL-37 alone did not affect S.aureus survival in vitro.

Combination with 4 and 8 mM LL-37 concentrations consistent with those measured on human skin enhanced the antimicrobial activity of each Sh-lantibiotic by 4-fold with 4 mM LL-37 and 16-fold Sh-lantibiotic-a with 8 mM LL-37 or 32-fold Sh-lantibiotic-b with 8 mM LL-37 respectively suggesting synergistic action between prokaryotic and host AMPs.Application of bacteria with antimicrobial activity decreased S.aureus in ADTo investigate the capacity of commensal bacteria to inhibit S.aureus on human skin we tested the effect of applying these bacteria to subjects with AD.

Indeed no subject was colonized by S.aureus if they also had a normal abundance of CoNS bacteria that produced antimicrobial activity and application of antimicrobial CoNS strains to animal or human skin greatly reduced S.aureus colonization.
