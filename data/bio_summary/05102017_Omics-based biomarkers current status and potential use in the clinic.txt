asimismo se senalan algunas de las recomendaciones que se han propuesto para acelerar su validacion e implementacion y se comenta sobre como la complejidad inherente a las enfermedades se combina con la complejidad de las tecnologias omicas de tal modo que el desarrollo de biomarcadores predictivos pronosticos y diagnosticos eficientes plantea retos importantes.c 2017 hospital infantil de me'xico federico go'mez.

published by masson doyma me'xico s.a. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-nd license  .biomarcadores basados en tecnologias omicas estado actual y su potencial uso en la clinicaresumen en los ultimos anos el uso de las tecnologias omicas de alta densidad de datos ha permitido el rapido descubrimiento de posibles biomarcadores.

con el objetivo de dar a conocer un panorama general de la situacion actual se comentan algunos ejemplos ilustrativos de biomarcadores genomicos transcriptomicos proteomicos metabolomicos y microbiomicos en el campo de la investigacion en oncologia.

patients were classified into two groups the lowmedium- and the high-risk groups six patients each plus a control group six patients as well with non-malignant hematological disorders.

compared the plasma metabolome from 34 patients with her-2 positive breast cancer with different responses to the trastuzumab- paclitaxel neoadjuvant therapy.the metabolomics profile before treatment showed that the patients with a high concentration of spermidine and low concentration of tryptophan had a higher probability of achieving a complete response compared to patients with the opposite trend in the balance of these two metabolites.

the information on these potential biomarkers must be interpreted in the context of all available information such as the probable diagnosis treatments undergone epidemio- logical information about the disease and health outcomes for the patients whose biospecimens were studied  ideally specimens must be collected from large prospec- tive case-control studies involving a clearly defined set of patients in a specific clinical context and as complete as possible information on the clinical characteristics inter- ventions and outcomes involved.since it is not always possible to have such ideal conditions which may also be costly and take a long time to achieve many studies make use of archived specimens or biological models.

using cell lines and bone marrow from 43 patients the authors concluded that the reduced expression of pcna after eight days of treatment represents a promising prognostic biomarker of good response.interestingly the use of prednisolone did not reduce the expression of vdac1 in the reh cell line however dexamethasone didsuggesting that changes in protein expression could be glucocorticoid-specific.quantitative proteomics analyses can also contribute to refining stratification of patients with all as demonstrated by xu et al.

moreover ctdna was detected in 82 of patients with metastatic can- cer in contrast to 55 of patients without metastasis.

although the initial genetic profiling of the tumor was nec- essary to track ctdna the proposed strategy allowed the detection of known clinically relevant k-ras mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer patients with a sensitivity of 87.2 the test was positive for 87.2 of patients and a specificity of 99.2 the test was negative in 99.2 of healthy volunteers used as a control group in tests with no previous solid tumor genetic profiling.metabolites in liquid biopsies like serum or urine may reflect the biochemical state of the patient which is the result of the complex interactions among drugs geneexpression proteins age microbiota environment and disease.

compared the urine profiles from138 patients with bladder cancer 69 healthy volunteers and 52 patients with hematuria due to non-malignant diseases.

an overview of the current state in this area is presented with exam- ples of genomics proteomics transcriptomics metabolomics and microbiomics biomarkers in the field of oncology along with some proposed strategies to accelerate their validation and translation to improve the care of patients with neoplasms.

at the end of several rounds of analytical and clinical validation biomarkers may be approved to be used in the clinic.the ability to produce a detailed characterization of a disease allows the stratification of patients into well-defined groups for tailored management and treatment which are the basis of precision medicine.biomarkers can be classified into four types diagnostic biomarkers are used to determine the specific health disor- der of the patient prognostic biomarkers help to chart the likely course of the disease predictive biomarkers indicate the probable response to a particular drug and predisposi- tion biomarkers indicate the risk of developing a disease.

biospecimens may derive from cell lines animal models biopsies from existing cohorts samples from patients enrolled in ongoing clinical trials or archived samples from finished prospective studies or biobanks besides the identification of candidate biomarkers this step may provide potential therapeutic tar- gets and knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which candidate biomarkers contribute to the pathological state.
