In addition potential therapeutic strategies targeting the intestinal micro-ecosystem in IBD are discussed.Keywords intestinal microbiota host immune response inflammatory bowel disease intestinal barrier function epithelial cellsiNTRODUCTiONInflammatory bowel disease IBD including ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn's disease CD is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal GI tract characterized by abdominal pain diarrhea and bloody stools -.

Consistently the dysfunction of the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and host can lead to an excessive inflammatory response and contribute to the initia- tion andor progression of IBD  intestinal bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia in humans  thus highlighting the critical role of the intestinal microbiota in health and IBD .

Manipulation of the gut microbiota can be achieved by antibiotics fecal microbiota transplantation FMT or probiotics.AntibioticsThe rationale for antibiotic therapy in IBD is based on evidence showing that intestinal microbes including luminal bacteria have an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD   .

Second IBD is a chronic disease associated with various factors such as gut microbiota impairment and genetic andor environmental factors thus the development of IBD is a synergetic effect of multiple factors instead of a single one  .

Herein we summa- rize the current literature that describes the association between gut microbiota and host immune response in the pathogenesis of IBD as well as the potential therapeutic strategies involving the modulation of the intestinal micro-ecosystem.iNTeSTiNAL MiCROBiOTA iN iBDA large number of studies have shown that the disturbance of normal microbial populations in the GI tract is linked to both acute infections such as Clostridium difficile infection CDI and to chronic diseases including IBD irritable bowel syndrome metabolic diseases and autoimmune disorders  .

Metagenomic studies demonstrated that microbial diversity and intestinal microbiota stability decrease in IBD patients compared with individuals without IBD .

An example of how spe- cific microbes induce intestinal inflammation and influence the pathogenesis of IBD was reported by Bloom et al.

Considering the effect of stress-induced microbiota dysfunction in the pathophysiology of IBD CRF antagonistic or anti-TNF-a agents have been found to result in favorable outcomes in IBD patients .

Further studies on the efficacy safety and underlying mechanisms of action are required before probiotics may be recommended for the treatment of IBD patients .PeRSPeCTiveThe role of the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and host immune response in the pathogenesis of IBD has attracted much attention because of the application of next-generationsequencing technology and the availability of genetically engi- neered animal models.

Similar results were observed when switching from a plant-based diet to a typical Western diet for 1 day  thus highlighting the possibility of restoring the gut microbiota in IBD by nutritional interventions.Dietary fibers can be converted to SCFAs by anaerobic bacteria Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes fermentation in the intestine which in turn could regulate the expression of genes involved in the proliferation differentiation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and affect the composition of the gut microbiota and host inflammatory response .
