in addition potential therapeutic strategies targeting the intestinal micro-ecosystem in ibd are discussed.keywords intestinal microbiota host immune response inflammatory bowel disease intestinal barrier function epithelial cellsintroductioninflammatory bowel disease ibd including ulcerative colitis uc and crohn's disease cd is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal gi tract characterized by abdominal pain diarrhea and bloody stools -.

although antibiotics are potent in regulating microbiome ecological diversity these issues should be carefully addressed for ibd treatment in the future.fecal microbiota transplantationfecal microbiota transplantation also known as fecal bacterio- therapy or fecal infusion is the transfer of intestinal bacteria from a healthy donor to restore the intestinal microbiota of a diseased individual  .

consistently the dysfunction of the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and host can lead to an excessive inflammatory response and contribute to the initia- tion andor progression of ibd  intestinal bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia in humans  thus highlighting the critical role of the intestinal microbiota in health and ibd .

herein we summa- rize the current literature that describes the association between gut microbiota and host immune response in the pathogenesis of ibd as well as the potential therapeutic strategies involving the modulation of the intestinal micro-ecosystem.intestinal microbiota in ibda large number of studies have shown that the disturbance of normal microbial populations in the gi tract is linked to both acute infections such as clostridium difficile infection cdi and to chronic diseases including ibd irritable bowel syndrome metabolic diseases and autoimmune disorders  .

manipulation of the gut microbiota can be achieved by antibiotics fecal microbiota transplantation fmt or probiotics.antibioticsthe rationale for antibiotic therapy in ibd is based on evidence showing that intestinal microbes including luminal bacteria have an important role in the pathogenesis of ibd   .

second ibd is a chronic disease associated with various factors such as gut microbiota impairment and genetic andor environmental factors thus the development of ibd is a synergetic effect of multiple factors instead of a single one  .

importantly immune responses induced by commensal flora can regulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota thus maintaining the dynamic balance between commensal bacteria and the host immune system and ensuring gut homeostasis and health .dysregulated interactionbetween intestinal microbiota and host immune response in ibddespite the mucus antimicrobial proteins and secretory iga are critical components for maintaining intestinal homeostasis several gi pathogens can penetrate the epithelial barrier and contribute to the pathogenesis of ibd if they are not eliminated through host immune reactions .

many susceptibility genes and environmental factors have been identi- fied to interfere with the interactions between the microbiota and host immune system through various signaling pathways in ibd patients     .genetic factors affecting the interactions between intestinal microbiota and host immune response in ibdnucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing pro- tein 2 plays an important role in intestinal homeostasis by activating nuclear factor-kb or the mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk-mediated immune response upon sensingspecific bacterial peptidoglycan motifs in the cytosol .

the evidence thus far indicates that the development of ibd is a combined effect of both genetic and non-genetic factors which act together and lead to changes in the structure and function of the human intestinal microbiota .environmental factors affecting the interactions between intestinal microbiota and host immune response in ibdthe composition of the intestinal flora is affected by various environmental factors such as diet stress age and antibiotic treatment .

similar results were observed when switching from a plant-based diet to a typical western diet for 1 day  thus highlighting the possibility of restoring the gut microbiota in ibd by nutritional interventions.dietary fibers can be converted to scfas by anaerobic bacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes fermentation in the intestine which in turn could regulate the expression of genes involved in the proliferation differentiation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and affect the composition of the gut microbiota and host inflammatory response .

additional studies onthe interplay between the microbiota and intestinal epithelium are of great importance to advance our understanding of the role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of ibd and to identify potential therapeutic strategies by manipulating the intestinal microbiota.author contributionsyy and zw designed the study mz and yw contributed to the literature search ks yw and pt generated the figures and discussed on the revision zw revised and finalized the manuscript.acknowledgmentsthis work was supported by the national basic research program of china no.

metagenomic studies demonstrated that microbial diversity and intestinal microbiota stability decrease in ibd patients compared with individuals without ibd .

considering the effect of stress-induced microbiota dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ibd crf antagonistic or anti-tnf-a agents have been found to result in favorable outcomes in ibd patients .

further studies on the efficacy safety and underlying mechanisms of action are required before probiotics may be recommended for the treatment of ibd patients .perspectivethe role of the interaction between the intestinal microbiota and host immune response in the pathogenesis of ibd has attracted much attention because of the application of next-generationsequencing technology and the availability of genetically engi- neered animal models.

an example of how spe- cific microbes induce intestinal inflammation and influence the pathogenesis of ibd was reported by bloom et al.
