Positive correlations with lactate production were observed for the genera Megamonas P  0.05 and Escheri- chiaShigella P  0.01 for the family Enterococcaceae P 0.05 and the genus Lactococcus P  0.01 phylum Fir- micutes and the genus Clostridium XIX P  0.05 phylum Fusobacteria.

Also the Prevotellaceae significantly changed across the diets P  0.05 being lower in MD and higher in CD compared with the RD.The abundance of the genera Clostridium XI Bacter- oides P  0.05 Fusobacterium Clostridium XIX Ceto- bacterium EscherichiaSighella and Lactococcus was significantly P  0.01 higher in MD diet compared to RD Fig.

In particular the J value of the RD group was significantly lower than the MD and CD groups P  0.05.Faecal Score and end products of fermentationThe MD treatment significantly P  0.05 lowered the Faecal Score and increased the lactic acid concentrationin the feces in comparison to the RD treatment P  0.01 Fig.

The bacterial annotations the relative abundance across the dietetic treatments and the results of the stat- istical analysis are reported for the taxonomic levels of the Phylum Family and Genus.Dietary treatments had a significant effect on the phylum Proteobacteria P  0.05 which was higher in the MD compared to the RD Table An increased abundance was measured in the MD Vs RD also for the phyla Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria P  0.05.

At the Genus level the relative abun- dance of Clostridium XI P  0.05 and Turicibacter P  0.01 significantly changed with time and for Sutterella a significant effect was also observed for treatment P  0.01 and time X treatment interaction P  0.05 Additional file  Table S3.The Shannon biodiversity Index H' at the genus level Fig.

The importance to consider the microbial commu- nity as a whole is evident from the concurrent effect on lactate proportion of EscherichiaShigella P  0.01 Enterococcaceae P  0.05 Clostridium XIX P  0.05 and especially of omeolactic bacteria Paralactobacillus Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.

Faeces were collected at the beginning of the study T0 after 14 days T14 before the change of diet and at the end of experimental period T28 for DNA extraction and analysis of metagenome by sequencing 16SrRNA V3 and V4 regions short chain fatty acids SCFA lactate and faecal score.Results A decreased proportion of Lactobacillus Paralactobacillus P  0.01 and Prevotella P  0.05 genera was observed in the MD group while Shannon biodiversity Index significantly increased 3.31 - 0.15 in comparison to the RD group 2.92 - 0.31 P  0.05.

The MD diet significantly P  0.05 decreased the Faecal Score and increased the lactic acid concentration in the feces in comparison to the RD treatment P  0.01.

No significant variations of molar content and pro- portion of the other SCFAs were observed.Table 4 Relative abundance 0 annotated reads1000 reads of microbiome at a family taxonomic level in the faeces of dogs fed a Reference diet RF Mixed diet MD or Control diet CDRD Reference Diet extruded diet fed until the beginning of the experimental period T0 CD The same RD diet used as Control Diet during the experimentMD Experimental Mixed Diet Ns Not significantSignificant for P  0.05Significant for P  0.01Correlations between metagenome lactate and SCFAs proportionsCorrelations analysis showed several significant effects be- tween microbiome and SCFAs or lactate Table .
