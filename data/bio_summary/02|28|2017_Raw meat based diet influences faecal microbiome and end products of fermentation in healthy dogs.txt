The administration of MD diet promoted a more balanced growth of bacterial communities and a positive change in the readouts of healthy gut functions in comparison to RD diet.Keywords Dog Diet Raw meat Feces Microbiome Short chain fatty acids Lactic acidBackgroundFaecal microbiome in humans as well in animals is affected by several factors - and among the others diet and clinical conditions are likely the most important in dogs .Clinical studies on dogs highlighted that the most re- current faecal microbiome changes associated to gastrointestinal pathological conditions are typically a drop of biodiversity an under or overgrowth of some distinct microbial communities and poor faecal quality - However an unequivocal identification of bad and good microbes at the different taxonomic level is not reported yet since clinical-observational studies can intrinsically be biased from the difficulty to control some of the sev- eral confounding factors affecting gut microbiome of healthy and unhealthy dogs as diet compositions breed Correspondence 1Department of AgroFood Environmental and Animal Sciences University of Udine Via delle Scienze 2908 33100 Udine ItalyFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlegender age environmental and living conditions.c The Authors.

The experimental diet Mixed Diet MD was composed by raw human grade beef meat representing about the 70 of the diet ww for chemical composition see Table  added with a com- plement specifically formulated and manufactured for the study and provided by Nutrigene srl Udine Italy.

Chemical composition of the foods is showed in Table The MD was formulated to cover macro and micro nutritional requirements according to NRC recommen- dations Daily feed amounts and relative macronu- trients supplied from the diets are reported in Table Dogs were fed once daily at around 800 am.

For the analysis frozen stools were carefully cleaned from external contaminants with a sterile blade then ground in a sterilized mortar under liquid nitrogenTable 1 Composition and nutritive value of diets and their constituentsChemical compositionRDCD MD Complement Beef meatRD Reference Diet extruded diet fed until the beginning of the experimental period T0 CD The same RD diet used as Control Diet during the experimentMD Experimental Mixed Dietto avoid thawing and mixed.

Plasma and serum were separated by centrifugation for 25 min at 3250 rpm hence stored in 2.5 ml tubes at -20 degC until biochemical analysis.Blood analysisPlasma and serum were sent under dry ice at the end of the trial to the certified laboratory of the Istituto Zooprofilattico delle Venezie Legnaro Padova Italy for biochemical analysis.Table 2 Daily dry matter and nutrients supplied by the dietsathe daily mixed diet was composed by 200 g complement plus 320 g beef meat RD Reference Diet extruded diet fed until the beginning of the experimental period T0 CD The same RD diet used as Control Diet during the experiment MD Experimental Mixed DietFaecal DNA extraction sequencing and taxonomic annotationPrior to DNA extraction faecal samples 150 mg were washed following a 3-step washing procedure as de- scribed by Fortin et al.
