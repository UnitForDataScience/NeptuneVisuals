positive correlations with lactate production were observed for the genera megamonas p  0.05 and escheri- chiashigella p  0.01 for the family enterococcaceae p 0.05 and the genus lactococcus p  0.01 phylum fir- micutes and the genus clostridium xix p  0.05 phylum fusobacteria.

the genera lactobacillus and paralacto- bacillus in this study resulted negatively correlated with lactate p  0.01. for the scfas isoformspositive correlations were calculated for isovalerate with the genus turicibacter p  0.01 and for isobutyrate with the genera blautia and sutterella p  0.05.discussionthe influence of diet compositions on the modification of gut microbiome in dogs has been recently reviewed by deng and swanson many of the reported studies concern changes in nutrients content as proteins or fibers in dry extruded formulations but only one study investigated the composition of faecal microbiome in diets containing beef or chicken raw meats however also in this study a comparison with extruded kibbleswas not carried out.

at the genus level the relative abun- dance of clostridium xi p  0.05 and turicibacter p  0.01 significantly changed with time and for sutterella a significant effect was also observed for treatment p  0.01 and time x treatment interaction p  0.05 additional file  table s3.the shannon biodiversity index h' at the genus level fig.

the importance to consider the microbial commu- nity as a whole is evident from the concurrent effect on lactate proportion of escherichiashigella p  0.01 enterococcaceae p  0.05 clostridium xix p  0.05 and especially of omeolactic bacteria paralactobacillus lactobacillus and lactococcus.

the aim of the study was to investigate in dogs the influence of a raw based diet supplemented with vegetable foods on faecal microbiome in comparison with extruded food.methods eight healthy adult boxer dogs were recruited and randomly divided in two experimental blocks of 4 individuals.

however in these studies a large inter individual vari- ability has been observed suggesting that several other factors can influence the intestinal microbiome of dogs which require to be understood and consid- ered in population studies.dietary intervention studies are thus required to in- vestigate the composition and the fluctuations of mi- crobial community in healthy animals to better understand the variability of gut microbial ecosystem under different feeding conditions to improve diet design to identify disease biomarkers and to develop target drug therapy considering that several factors can affect gut micro- biota we sought to examine the effect of an abrupt change from extruded to raw meat based diet on the fluctuation of faecal microbial community end product of fermentations and stool quality in a case control study in adult boxer dogs.

for dogs fed with raw meat.as a further evaluation of microbiome community in the gut we measured faecal scfas and lactate since their concentration depends upon the colonic fermenta- tion of the nutrients by microorganisms dogs can digest starch in the small intestine  and bacteria can ferment undigested starch and others com- plex carbohydrates in the large intestine producing scfas.

observed that faecal lactate is related with lactic acid-producing microorganisms which can inhibit the development of proteolytic bac- teria in the gut of the dogs.conclusionsthe studies on the composition and variation of faecal microbiome in healthy dogs offer a promising opportunity to better understand the factors affecting the microbial communities and the end products of fermentations but further efforts from the scientific community are required to clarify if a reference compositions for healthy dogs can be assessed.from our results and from the comparison with existing scientific evidences it appears that the modification of microbiome can be attained when a considerable variation of dietary regimes is applied.
