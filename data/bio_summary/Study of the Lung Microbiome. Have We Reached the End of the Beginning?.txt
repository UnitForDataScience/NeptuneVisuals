As African HIV-infected populations with less access to antiretroviral drugs and higher burden of coinfections such as tuberculosis have an increased risk for mortality after hospitalization for pneumonia it is important to understand the role of the lung microbiome in this setting as a potential tool to modify pneumonia risk and outcome.The current study by Shenoy and colleagues expands on prior work in the HIV-infected population with pneumonia by examining a large cohort of individuals from Uganda undergoing bronchoscopy for acute pneumonia 8.

These studies primarily focused on outpatients who were not experiencing acute pulmonary complications and explicitly excluded individuals with pneumonias to study the microbiome of healthy individuals.Because HIV-infected individuals remain at risk for bacterial pneumonia as a result of persistent innate and acquired immune deficits even when treated with antiretroviral therapy there has been recent interest in alterations of the HIV lung microbiome in the setting of acute pneumonia.

A growing body of evidence implicates the importance of the gut microbiome in shapingthe immune response in the lung and its response to insults 11-13 and infections in the lung may influence the gut microbiome as has been shown in animal models of tuberculosis 14.The implications of the study by Shenoy and colleagues extend beyond the investigation of the lung microbiome during pneumonia in HIV-infected individuals 8.
