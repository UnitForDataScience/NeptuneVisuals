As African HIV-infected populations with less access to antiretroviral drugs and higher burden of coinfections such as tuberculosis have an increased risk for mortality after hospitalization for pneumonia it is important to understand the role of the lung microbiome in this setting as a potential tool to modify pneumonia risk and outcome.The current study by Shenoy and colleagues expands on prior work in the HIV-infected population with pneumonia by examining a large cohort of individuals from Uganda undergoing bronchoscopy for acute pneumonia 8.

These studies primarily focused on outpatients who were not experiencing acute pulmonary complications and explicitly excluded individuals with pneumonias to study the microbiome of healthy individuals.Because HIV-infected individuals remain at risk for bacterial pneumonia as a result of persistent innate and acquired immune deficits even when treated with antiretroviral therapy there has been recent interest in alterations of the HIV lung microbiome in the setting of acute pneumonia.

In addition to shedding light on the bacterial communities in the lung during pneumonia in HIV in particular the work is important for its broader implications for the field of the lung microbiome in general.
