The exact nature of these events is summarised in .Notably the pivotal US ENDO trial EndoBarrier vs sham procedure was terminated in July 2015 after only 325 subjects were randomised n216 EndoBarrier subjects due to a higher than expected hepatic abscess HA rate of 3.5 compared with a global incidence of 0.73.

Total costs will be estimated for each patient over the 24-month trial period.Patient-level cost and QALY estimates will be combined to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the EndoBarrier device compared with standard medical therapy over the 24-month trial period.

The non-surgical and reversible nature of these devices represents an attractive therapeutic option for patients with obesity and T2DM by potentially improving glycaemic control and reducing their weight.Methods and analysis In this multicentre randomised controlled non-blinded trial male and female patients aged 18-65 years with a body mass index 30-50 kgm2 and inadequately controlled T2DM on oral antihyperglycaemic medications glycosylated haemoglobin HbA1c 58-97 mmolmol will be randomised in a 11 ratio to receive either the EndoBarrier device n80 for 12 months or conventional medical therapy diet and exercise n80.The primary outcome measure will be a reduction in HbA1c by 20 at 12 months.

Our primary endpoint therefore is a reduction in HbA1c by 20 after 12 months of treatment.extrapolated through modelling.Data will also be obtained to investigate the mechanism of action of the EndoBarrier device via changes in the followinggut hormones bile acids microbiome and intestinal gene expressionfood hedonics and preference taste appetite eating behaviour and brain reward system responses to food evaluation and addictive behaviours using functional MRI fMRItotal body and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity and body fat content.Safety objectiveThe safety of the EndoBarrier DJBS will be evaluated during this trial and the type and frequency of adverse events shall be reported.research approvalThis study shall be conducted in full conformity with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and all subsequent revisions.

In addition to routine follow-up visits all patients will receive regular telephone counselling froma specialist dietitian to assess their well-being and motiva- tion in the trial.study populationThe study population will include male and female patients aged 18-65 years with a BMI 30-50 kgm2 and confirmed diagnosis of T2DM for at least 1 year who have inadequate glycaemic control and are on oral antihyper- glycaemic medications see for complete inclusion and exclusion criteria.study recruitmentParticipants will be identified from several areas across primary secondary and tertiary healthcare and commu- nity settingsdiabetes research registers eg Diabetes Alliance for Research in England REC 20027118 hospital or general practice patient databases participant identification centres patients referred to diabetes and bariatric specialist clinics and other research studies within the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and the Local Clinical Research Networkstudy websites local and national media--websites radio newspaper articles and adverts posters diabetes obesity and other support groups and social media websites.Potential patients who after reading a summary Patient Information Sheet PIS would like to enter the trial will give their verbal consent for preliminary telephone screening to check basic inclusion and exclusion criteria.
