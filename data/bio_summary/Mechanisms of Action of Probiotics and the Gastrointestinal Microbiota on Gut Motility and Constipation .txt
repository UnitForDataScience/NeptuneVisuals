The aim of this review was to summarize existing evidence on the mechanisms through which probiotics may exert an effect on gut motility and constipation.Current Status of KnowledgeIn order to understand the mechanisms through which pro- biotics exert an effect on gut motility and constipation first the physiology of gut motility and its pathophysiology in constipation must be reviewed including the role of thecentral and enteric nervous systems the gastrointestinal mi- crobiota and fermentation and immune system function.CNS and ENSENS CNS gut motility and constipation.

Alteration in gut motility can also be a result of a primary defect in CNS modulation 28 al- though impaired gut motility can develop through dysfunc- tion of control mechanisms at any level from the gut to the CNS 1.ENS CNS gut motility and constipation effects of probiotics.

Preliminary results show that the administra- tion of some probiotics affects the composition of some mi- crobiota and SCFA production but the mechanisms of the subsequent effect on motility and constipation are not yet fully understood.Other luminal factors gut motility and constipation effects of probiotics.

Although there is no clear consensus to date on using pro- biotics for symptoms of constipation a recent survey of 1830 health professionals in primary care showed that 18 recommend probiotics to patients with constipation showing that clinicians have started incorporating probi- otics as a management option in clinical practice 109.ConclusionThe gut luminal environment immune system ENS and CNS are highly interrelated and control gut motility distur- bance in any of these overlapping systems may contribute to symptoms of constipation.

Several factors are vital to normal gut motility including immune and nervous system function bile acid metabolism and mucus secretion and the gastrointestinal microbiota and fermentation an imbalance or dysfunction in any of these components may contribute to aberrant gut motility and consequently symptoms of constipation.

There is now increasing evidence to support the existence of the bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain axis 26 which has a key role in regulating gut motility 27.Probiotics gut motility and constipation 485TABLE 1 A selection of human studies investigating the effect of probiotics specifically on gut transit time in healthy and constipated individuals12002 8Agrawal et al.

Probiotics may have beneficial effects regarding some components of the immune system that could poten- tially influence gut motility but the effect regarding consti- pation has not been investigated.Clinical implication of probiotics in constipationTo this point animal studies have suggested that various probiotic species and strains may have beneficial effects on gut motility and constipation however there are still limited data for human studies and hence it is difficult to extrapolate which probiotic strain is likely the most clinically efficacious.

More specifically activation of toll-like re- ceptor 4 expression by LPSs restored these effects suggesting that the presence of bacteria containing LPSs such as pro- teobacteria may contribute to maintaining normal gutmotility 58.Probiotics gut motility and constipation 487FIGURE 2 Interrelated factors involved in the pathophysiology of constipation as potential targets for the therapeutic role of probiotics.

These data suggest that different probiotic species and strains have different effects on mucin production and may in part explain the variation in the effectiveness of probiotics in constipation reported in the literature.In summary bile acid metabolism and the mucus layer contribute to normal gut motility and both appear to be al- tered in constipation although the true cause-and-effect relation or whether this represents an epiphenomenon re- mains unclear.
