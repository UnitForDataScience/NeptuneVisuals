this anatomical niche has been found to have a highly diverse microbiota consisting of over 600 bacterial species peterson et al.

2016. furthermore host genetic factors may have additional effects on the oral bacteria.pathogenic oral bacteria are involved with periodontal diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis mattila et al.

2005. in addition to local inflammation many epidemiological studies have found an association between the presence of periodontal diseases and systemic disordersincluding coronary heart disease janket et al.

2009. for the mechanism between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease it is hypothesized that either direct invasion of oral bacteria or bacteria-mediated cytokines induce local inflammation in the cardiovascular system armitage 2000 demmer and desvarieux 2006 koren et al.

2011. this is further supported by the observation that infective endocarditis is caused by granulicatella and neisseria bacteria that originate from the oral cavity valenzuela et al.
