ChIP-seq data is similar to RNA-seq data involving quantifying the data as read count per peak instead of per gene.

However the complexity of power computations is much greater for sequencing data than for the simpler genotyping array data.

Most importantly we review the methods of power analysis for several types of sequencing data and guide the reader to the relevant methods for each data type.Key words high-throughput sequencing power sample sizeIntroductionRecent advancement in high-throughput sequencing HTS technology has stimulated a range of new possibilities for bio- medical research.

At the same time these advances have intro- duced a series of bioinformatics challenges including quality control data storage and complexity in data analyses.

Currently those are the only two available methods that can assess power for tests of differential expression from RNA-seq data based on a Poisson model.Negative binomial modelIt has been repeatedly shown that RNA-seq data exhibit an overdispersed read count distribution   which means that the variance of sequence counts exceeds the mean.

Combined with the complex format of HTS data and the distinct statistical assumption behind the differ- ent types of HTS data analysis the power analysis for HTS- based experiments has been a challenging problem.
