the bacterial diversity and richness represented by the shannon indexes of most samples from three bafs was lower than that of as except for the one from baf 1 with initial arb concentration of 100 mg l-1 sample 1-100. in bafs 1 and 2 the diversity and richness of bacterial consortiums increased from 3.27 to2.41 with influent arb concentration of 50 mg l-1 to 4.15and 3.65 with 100 mg l-1 arb respectively.

by contrast the corresponding effluent toxicity of baf 3 had much lower toxicity against v. fischeri than that of bafs 1 and 2 as indicated by the ir of less than 10. it was suggested that the baf bioaugmented with the yeast lh-f1 could remarkably detoxify 50 mg l-1 arb as well as effectively remove the color and cod.

three col- umns named as 1 2 and 3 were inoculated with as 6 g l-1 dry weight at 105 degc the yeast lh-f1 4 g l-1 wet weight at 10000xg for 10 min and both of them 3 g l-1 as and 2 g l-1 the yeast lh-f1 respectively.

they were acclimatized with simulated arb wastewater which contains glucose 2.0 g l-1 nh42so4 0.5 g l-1 k2hpo40.5 g l-1 mgso47h2o 0.25 g l-1 and arb 10 mg l-1for formation of biofilm for 50 days.

meanwhile the corresponding ir of the efflu- ent from baf 2 was about 49 which was lower than that from baf 1 suggesting that the yeast lh-f1 was able to degrade or even mineralize arb tan et al.

in comparison proteobacteria including alphaproteobacte- ria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria and fir- micutes were dominant phyla in three bafs which were expected due to their common occurrence in the micro- bial communities for treating azo dyes miran et al.

the effluent arb concentrations of baf 2 were about 5 3 5 and 18 mg l-1 at the ends of phases i-iii and vi respectively which were higher than those of baf 1 dur- ing corresponding phases.

the effluent cod levels of baf 2 during each phase was higher than those of baf 1 which were about 600 570 670 and 670 mg l-1 at the ends of phases i-iii and vi respectively.

as represents the original activated sludge 1 2 and 3 represent the numbers of bafs 50 and 100 represent the initial arbconcentration mg l-1discussionthe results of bafs operation showed that baf 3 which was bioaugmented with the yeast strain lh-f1 displayed higher efficiency and stability during color removal pro- cesses than the other two.

this method was also potentially useful and meaningful for treating other recalcitrant organic pollutants in practical applications.keywords azo dye  biological aerated filter  bioaugmentation  magnusiomyces ingens lh-f1  miseq sequencing liang tantanliang1210lnnu.edu.cn 1 school of life science liaoning normal university dalian 116081 chinaintroductionazo dyes which contain one or more azo linkages -nn- are the major class of dyes and widely used in textile food paper and leather industries waghmode et al.

the effluent arb concentration of baf 1 was about 4 mg l-1 at the end of phase i. then though the hrt was shortened from 48 to 24 h in phase ii the effluent arb concentration gradually decreased and was finally stabilized at about 2 mg l-1 due to the long-time adaptation.

b. it was demonstrated that the effluent cod of baf 1 decreased gradually from 500 to 350 mg l-1 in phase i when the influent cod was about 2010 mg l-1.

likewise the abun- dance of bacteroidetes decreased after treating 50 mg l-1 arb and increased again after treatment of 100 mg l-1 arb in three bafs.

the abundances of citrobacter and enterobac- ter in three bafs with 50 mg l-1 influent arb were higher than the corresponding ones with 100 mg l-1 influent arb suggesting that they might be inhibited by higher organic loading.
