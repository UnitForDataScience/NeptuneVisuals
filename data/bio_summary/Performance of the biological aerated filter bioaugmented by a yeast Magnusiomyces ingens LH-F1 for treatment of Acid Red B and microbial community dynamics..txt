Three col- umns named as 1 2 and 3 were inoculated with AS 6 g l-1 dry weight at 105 degC the yeast LH-F1 4 g l-1 wet weight at 10000xg for 10 min and both of them 3 g l-1 AS and 2 g l-1 the yeast LH-F1 respectively.

They were acclimatized with simulated ARB wastewater which contains glucose 2.0 g l-1 NH42SO4 0.5 g l-1 K2HPO40.5 g l-1 MgSO47H2O 0.25 g l-1 and ARB 10 mg l-1for formation of biofilm for 50 days.

When the influent ARB concentration increased to 50 mg l-1 in phase III the effluent ARB concentra- tion firstly increased to about 9 mg l- 1 and subsequently decreased to about 4 mg l-1 in the end.

The abundances of Citrobacter and Enterobac- ter in three BAFs with 50 mg l-1 influent ARB were higher than the corresponding ones with 100 mg l-1 influent ARB suggesting that they might be inhibited by higher organic loading.

Likewise the abun- dance of Bacteroidetes decreased after treating 50 mg l-1 ARB and increased again after treatment of 100 mg l-1 ARB in three BAFs.

It was shown that under the optimal condi- tions the growing cells of strain TL-F1 could completely decolorize 100 mg l-1 Acid Brilliant Scarlet GR within 24 h and could tolerate up to 500 mg l-1 of the dye.

Similarly in phase IV with influent ARB concentration of 100 mg l-1 the effluent ARB concentration was increased at first and then decreased to about 6 mg l-1 which suggested that the color removal percentages gradually increased at the end of each phase probably due to the extending acclimatization time.

It was demonstrated that the effluent COD of BAF 1 decreased gradually from 500 to 350 mg l-1 in phase I when the influent COD was about 2010 mg l-1.

Though the HRT was reduced from 48 to 24 h in phase II the efflu- ent COD gradually decreased from about 340 mg l-1 to about 300 mg l-1 also as a result of the long-time adapta- tion.
