Regard- ing host physiological attributes the majority of heritable OTUs were positively corre- lated with RFI DMI and milk protein.These findings raised the question of whether the portion of heritable microbes that are correlated with host physiology and rumen metabolism is different from the one found in the overall rumen microbiome as in our recent study we found that the rumen microbiome is tightly linked to many of the host attributes and rumen metabolism parameters .

The OTU correlation odds ratio is hchnncnn where hc is the count of heritable OTUs correlated with the index hn is the count of heritable OTUs not correlated with the index nc is the count of nonheritable OTUs correlated with the index and nn is the count of nonheritable OTUs not correlated with the index.

Additionally five other heritable OTUs with the phylogenetic associations of Bacteroidales Prevotella Clostridiales and Flavefaciens were found to be highly correlated with milk protein in our previous study and one OTU of the genus Prevotella mentioned above was also found to be significantly correlated with dry matter intake DMI in our previous study .FIG 5 A portion of heritable OTUs were found to be associated with host physiology in a previous study .

Following our recent work in which we found microbiome components that are connected to energy-harvesting efficiency and other physiological parameters of the host  we hypothesized that heritable taxa that are correlated with the host genome will potentially be related to rumen metab- olism as well as to host physiology.

After identifying heritable microbial species that exhibit correlation with host traits we were interested in estimating the heritability of the different important host and rumen metabolism traits with which we found the heritable microbes to be correlated Fig.

Hence it is tempting to speculate that the apparent relatedness of the heritable microbial species suggests that they occupy similar ecological niches within the host and potentially share mechanisms of interaction with it which are affiliated with their phylogenetic association .We observed that the metabolites and physiological parameters measured are generally clustered together according to their category based on hierarchical clustering of their correlation profile for the different heritable OTUs columns in the heat map .

This was especially true for the parameters with which these heritable microbes showed high correlation .One of the heritable OTUs with the phylogenetic association of Bacteroidales which was found to be heritable and highly correlated with the feed efficiency trait in this study was independently found to be correlated with this trait in our previous study  .

Only OTUs that exhibited a significant heritable component heritability estimate of 0.7 and P value of 0.05 in all three individual sampling days were considered heritable OTUs.

In 94 of the permutations the number of OTUs detected as heritable was smaller than 22 while in most permu- tations the number of OTUs detected as heritable was under 5 Fig.

At the same time from the heritable OTU perspec- tive even within the distinct niche of heritable OTUs identified in this study one can see that the clustering of OTUs according to their abundance profiles rows in the heat map  separates them to a high degree according to their taxonomic affiliations e.g.
