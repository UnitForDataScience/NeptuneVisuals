regard- ing host physiological attributes the majority of heritable otus were positively corre- lated with rfi dmi and milk protein.these findings raised the question of whether the portion of heritable microbes that are correlated with host physiology and rumen metabolism is different from the one found in the overall rumen microbiome as in our recent study we found that the rumen microbiome is tightly linked to many of the host attributes and rumen metabolism parameters .

after identifying heritable microbial species that exhibit correlation with host traits we were interested in estimating the heritability of the different important host and rumen metabolism traits with which we found the heritable microbes to be correlated fig.

following our recent work in which we found microbiome components that are connected to energy-harvesting efficiency and other physiological parameters of the host  we hypothesized that heritable taxa that are correlated with the host genome will potentially be related to rumen metab- olism as well as to host physiology.

this was especially true for the parameters with which these heritable microbes showed high correlation .one of the heritable otus with the phylogenetic association of bacteroidales which was found to be heritable and highly correlated with the feed efficiency trait in this study was independently found to be correlated with this trait in our previous study  .

our study addressed the question of whether species in the bovine rumen are heritable and the taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships of species that show measurable heritability.finally we asked whether the heritable microbial species may be associated with important host physiological traits and metabolic traits of the rumen.resultsexperimental design and data.

s2.with relation to rumen metabolism the strongest correlations for the heritable otuswere with propionateacetate ratio highest-magnitude r  0.86 mean r  0.64 methane metabolism highest-magnitude r  0.69 mean r  0.49 propionic acid highest-magnitude r  -0.6245274 mean r  0.44 and valeric acid highest- magnitude r  -0.57 mean r  0.39 as well as with the concentration of several amino acids namely glycine aspartate and tyrosine with highest-magnitude r  0.51 0.5fig 4 heritable otus are more closely connected to host physiology and rumen metabolites than other rumen microbes.

additionally five other heritable otus with the phylogenetic associations of bacteroidales prevotella clostridiales and flavefaciens were found to be highly correlated with milk protein in our previous study and one otu of the genus prevotella mentioned above was also found to be significantly correlated with dry matter intake dmi in our previous study .fig 5 a portion of heritable otus were found to be associated with host physiology in a previous study .

hence it is tempting to speculate that the apparent relatedness of the heritable microbial species suggests that they occupy similar ecological niches within the host and potentially share mechanisms of interaction with it which are affiliated with their phylogenetic association .we observed that the metabolites and physiological parameters measured are generally clustered together according to their category based on hierarchical clustering of their correlation profile for the different heritable otus columns in the heat map .

another noteworthy finding is the milk protein trait which was correlated with heritable microbes and exhibited the highest odds ratio pointing to enrichment of heritable bacteria connected to this host trait .

this finding corresponds with our previous study where we show that specific microbial lineages are correlated with specific physiological traits of the host .some of the heritable bacteria that were found to be correlated with specific host traits notably dmi energy-harvesting efficiency rfi and milk protein were also found independently in our recent study to be connected to these traits further strengthening these findings .

a more direct approach to tackle the question of causality would be to apply transplantation of rumen microbes in different host genetic back- grounds.our study presented here sheds light on yet-unanswered questions regarding host microbiome interactions and highlights that host genetic variation is associated with specific microbes.

the first step in our analysis was to identify heritable bacterial species that is in our context to identify microbial species where significant propor- tions of their variation in abundance profiles could be attributed to heritable genetic factors.

only otus that exhibited a significant heritable component heritability estimate of 0.7 and p value of 0.05 in all three individual sampling days were considered heritable otus.

in 94 of the permutations the number of otus detected as heritable was smaller than 22 while in most permu- tations the number of otus detected as heritable was under 5 fig.

the abundance profile of the heritable microbes was correlated with their presence profile spearman correlation between the presence counts and abundance sums r  0.75 p  5 x 10-5.fig 1 the heritable portion of the bovine rumen microbiome is phylogenetically closely related.
