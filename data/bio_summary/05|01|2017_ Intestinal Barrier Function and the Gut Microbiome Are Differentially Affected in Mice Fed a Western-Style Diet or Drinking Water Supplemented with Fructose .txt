Mucus thickness in the colon was reduced to 10.5 6 1.3 mm in mice that had received a WSD  fructose compared with 19.4 6 2.2 mm in CD mice and Muc2 mRNA expression was reduced in CD  fructose 2.2 6 0.4 AUs and WSD 2.8 6 0.8 AUs-fed mice compared with CD mice 10.1 6 2.6 AUs Figure 1.

Bifidobacterium abundance was greater in the WSD mice than in the CD mice 63-fold and in the WSD  fructose mice than in the CD  fructose mice 330-fold.Conclusions The consumption of a WSD or high fructose intake differentially affects gut permeability and the microbiome.

LPS concentrations were 2.6-fold higher in mice fed a CD  fructose and 5.7-fold higher in mice fed a WSD  fructose than mice fed a CD or a WSD respectively P  0.001 for both.

These changes in Bacteroidetes abundance resulted in higher Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratios in the CD  fructose and WSD  fructose groups than the CD group Figure 5. qPCR confirmed this effect with significantly lower ratios in the CD group 0.69 6 0.44 than the CD  fructose 1.38 6 0.93 and WSD  fructose groups 1.25 6 0.45 P  0.05 for both.

However in our study we did not find an effect on the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio of WSD treatment compared with CD whereas fructose induced a clearly significant increase in both the CD  fructose and WSD  fructose groups compared with the CD group.

When fructose solution was offered to the mice instead of plain water diet intake strongly decreased but total energy intakes did not differ between the CD and CD  fructose groups or between the WSD and WSD  fructose groups Table 2.
