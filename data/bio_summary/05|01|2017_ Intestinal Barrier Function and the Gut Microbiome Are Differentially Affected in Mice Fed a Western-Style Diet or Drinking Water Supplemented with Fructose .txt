mucus thickness in the colon was reduced to 10.5 6 1.3 mm in mice that had received a wsd  fructose compared with 19.4 6 2.2 mm in cd mice and muc2 mrna expression was reduced in cd  fructose 2.2 6 0.4 aus and wsd 2.8 6 0.8 aus-fed mice compared with cd mice 10.1 6 2.6 aus figure 1. mucus thickness in the colon was negatively correlated with weight gain r  20.47 p  0.01.fructose intake but not a wsd resulted in an increase of endotoxin concentration in portal vein blood independent of whether the mice were fed a cd or wsd figure 2a.

bifidobacterium abundance was greater in the wsd mice than in the cd mice 63-fold and in the wsd  fructose mice than in the cd  fructose mice 330-fold.conclusions the consumption of a wsd or high fructose intake differentially affects gut permeability and the microbiome.

when fructose solution was offered to the mice instead of plain water diet intake strongly decreased but total energy intakes did not differ between the cd and cd  fructose groups or between the wsd and wsd  fructose groups table 2. consequently body weight gain over the 12-wk intervention was significantly higher in mice fed the wsd than with the cd supplemental figure 1a table 2. body weight gain was closely correlated with the mean energy intake per day r  0.72 p  0.001 supplemental figure 1b.liver weight measured after the intervention correlated withbody weight gain data not shown.

lps concentrations were 2.6-fold higher in mice fed a cd  fructose and 5.7-fold higher in mice fed a wsd  fructose than mice fed a cd or a wsd respectively p  0.001 for both.

these changes in bacteroidetes abundance resulted in higher firmicutes bacteroidetes ratios in the cd  fructose and wsd  fructose groups than the cd group figure 5. qpcr confirmed this effect with significantly lower ratios in the cd group 0.69 6 0.44 than the cd  fructose 1.38 6 0.93 and wsd  fructose groups 1.25 6 0.45 p  0.05 for both.

au arbitrary unit.778 volynets et al.have reported that high-fat diets increase this ratio 45 46. however in our study we did not find an effect on the firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio of wsd treatment compared with cd whereas fructose induced a clearly significant increase in both the cd  fructose and wsd  fructose groups compared with the cd group.

mice were fed either a high-fat and very-high- sugar wsd td88137-modified wsd or a high-sugar control diet cd cd88137-modified cd to td88137 ssniff spezialita ten gmbh table 1 supplemental tables 1 and 2 and had free access toeither plain tap water or water containing 30 d2-fructose 99.5 purity carl roth for 12 wk.

the combination of both fructose and the wsd also induced a severe increase in liver weight 80 and in theliverbody weight ratio 37 compared with a cd table 2. elevated concentrations of plasma tgs and intestinal fa-binding protein 2 were only measured in wsd  fructose-fed mice whereas fructose intake alone and wsd alone caused elevated concentra- tions of claudin-3 in urine compared with cd table 2.fructose intake and a wsd caused several changes in intestinal barrier function.

the lactulosemannitol ratio in the wsd  fructose mice was 1.8-fold higher than in the cd mice.

in mice fed fructose a wsd and the combination thereof a-defensin 1 mrna expression in the small intestine was lower than in mice fed a cd figure 2e whereas a-defensin 4 mrna expression did not change data not shown.

although these findings derive from female mice only the results are most likely not sex-specific because previous perme- ability studies have found no sex-dependent differences in mice 32. we have shown previously that the intake of glucose at high amounts induces a pronounced body weight gain and only minor liver weight gain whereas fructose acts the other way around 16. in another set of experiments we found that toll- like receptor-4 knockout mice are protected from fructose- induced liver steatosis indicating that translocated endotoxin is a major trigger for fructose-induced liver steatosis 36. we subsequently studied not only the effects of sugars but also those of the wsd combining a high load of fat and sugar 17. the data herein reveal that a wsd leading to a higher energy intake resulted in a pronounced weight gain but only weak liver weight gain whereas a wsd combined with a high fructose load promoted body weight gain and higher liver weight.

in contrast high fructose intake increased endotoxin translocation 2.6- and 3.8-fold in the groups fed the cd  fructose and wsd  fructose respectively compared with the cd group.
