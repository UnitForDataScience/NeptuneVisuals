The recombinant strain L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcDI induced with nisin A displayed full resistance to PlcA while strains L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcD and L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcI induced with NisAFIG 3 A Antimicrobial activity of the CFS of L. plantarum NI326 and nisin A-induced L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlc against A. acidoterrestris sp1.

The immunity of wild-type L. lactis NZ9000 and recombinantstrains L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcD L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcI and L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcDI was tested against the CFS from Lb.

The whole genome was analyzed with the Web-based bacteriocin genome mining tool BAGEL3   to search for known andor potential novel bacteriocins.Cloning of the plc gene cluster in L. lactis NZ9000.

In this study we describe a circular antimicrobial peptide PlcA for a Lactobacillus plantarum strain.KEYWORDS circular bacteriocin Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Lactobacillus plantarum immunityacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by bac- teria to inhibit the growth of other often closely related strains .

plantarum NI326 the entire plc cluster was cloned into the nisin-inducible plasmid pNZ8048 pNZPlc and transformed into L. lactis NZ9000 a naturally non-bacteriocin-producing strain.

plantarum NI326 and L. lactis pNZPlc was purified by using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography RP-HPLC and the molecular mass was analyzed by using matrix- assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF MS.

plantarum NI326 and L. lactis NZ9000 was transformed with pNZPlc as described previously  with modifications.

This novel bacteriocin named plantaricyclin A PlcA was grouped into the circular bacteriocin subgroup II due to its high degree of similarity with other gassericin A-like bacterio- cins.
