The recombinant strain L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcDI induced with nisin A displayed full resistance to PlcA while strains L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcD and L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcI induced with NisAFIG 3 A Antimicrobial activity of the CFS of L. plantarum NI326 and nisin A-induced L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlc against A. acidoterrestris sp1.

The immunity of wild-type L. lactis NZ9000 and recombinantstrains L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcD L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcI and L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcDI was tested against the CFS from Lb.

plantarum NI326 against cultures of L. lactis NZ9000pNZ8048 L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcD L. lactis NZ9000pNZPlcI andL.

This novel bacteriocin named plantaricyclin A PlcA was grouped into the circular bacteriocin subgroup II due to its high degree of similarity with other gassericin A-like bacterio- cins.

The plc gene cluster was cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 resulting in the production of an active 5570-Da bacteriocin in the supernatant.

PlcA has a predicted mass of 5588 Da and represents a new bacteriocin within the subgroup II and the first predicted circular bacteriocin isolated from Lb.

The whole genome was analyzed with the Web-based bacteriocin genome mining tool BAGEL3   to search for known andor potential novel bacteriocins.Cloning of the plc gene cluster in L. lactis NZ9000.

PlcA is believed to be produced as a 91- amino-acid precursor with a 33-amino-acid leader peptide which is predicted to be removed followed by joining of the N and C termini via a covalent linkage to form the mature 58-amino-acid circular bacteriocin PlcA.

We report the characterization of a circular bacteriocin produced by Lb.
