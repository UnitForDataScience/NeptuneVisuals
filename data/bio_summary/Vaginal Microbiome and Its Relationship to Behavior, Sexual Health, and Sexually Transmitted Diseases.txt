There is a consistent association between oral contraceptive use and a decrease in prevalent bacterial vagino- sis.293940 Some studies have shown a decrease in prevalent bacterial vaginosis in women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection or implant40 however depot medroxyprogesterone acetate has also been found to decrease vaginal lactobacilli3941 and is associated in some studies with an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus HIV acqui- sition and transmission possibly in part mediated by the effects of the microbiota on cervicovaginal inflam- mation.42 However a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a robust negative associ- ation between any hormonal contraception regardless of type excluding intrauterine devices and prevalent incident or recurrent bacterial vaginosis.43Sexual BehaviorThere has been debate about whether bacterial vaginosis can be classified as an STD as opposed to a sexually associated condition however the pre- ponderance of evidence demonstrates that bacterial vaginosis can be sexually transmitted from women to male and female partners.4445 Epidemiologic studies have consistently associated bacterial vaginosis with risk factors associated with STD.4446 More frequent vaginal intercourse is associated with increased risk of bacterial vaginosis.30 Multiple new or increased number of male partners are strongly associated with bacterial vaginosis in multiple studies.3444 Recent unprotected sex as evidenced by the presence of prostate-specific antigen in vaginal fluid has been asso- ciated with a more than twofold increased risk of bac- terial vaginosis47 and recurrent bacterial vaginosis48 and is negatively associated with the presence and concentration of healthy Lactobacillus species.34 Addi- tionally there is a significant association between bac- terial vaginosis and female sex partners29 because women who have sex with women appear to be at increased risk when compared with women who have sex with men only.2946 There is a strong inverse asso- ciation between bacterial vaginosis and condom use.44 In one study bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria were detected more commonly in the urine and cor-onal sulcus of men with asymptomatic STDs than in healthy men.49 Finally both bacterial vaginosis by Nugent scoring50 and detection of bacterial vaginosis- associated anaerobes29 are far less frequent in sexually inexperienced than in sexually experienced women.Data on the influence of specific sexual practices on bacterial vaginosis are relatively few in one study vaginal intercourse immediately after receptive anal intercourse was associated with bacterial vaginosis30 other studies demonstrated an association between receptive oral sex and bacterial vaginosis.46 The increased detection and gene copies of G vaginalis in the oral cavity among women who have sex with women with bacterial vaginosis adds some biological plausibility to this association51 however several other studies have not demonstrated an association with receptive oral sex.46 One study has found an association between bacterial vaginosis and receptive oral or anal sex whereas several others did not46 receptive digital sex either vaginal or anal does not seem to be associated with bacterial vaginosis.46 One well-designed longitudinal study found that recurrent bacterial vaginosis was nearly twice as likely in women who had the same sex partner before and after treatment regardless of coital frequency.52Male circumcision may play a role in male-to- female transmission of bacterial vaginosis as it does in other STDs.44 Circumcision has been shown to signif- icantly decrease the load of anaerobic bacteria includ- ing bacterial vaginosis-associated species on the coronal sulcus53 and other studies have correlated circumcision with a decrease in bacterial vaginosis among female partners.3054 A recent study showed that uncircumcised men with a higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes in their penile microbiota were significantly more likely to have a partner with a high Nugent score moreover this type of microbiota was significantly associated with having two or more extramarital partners.55Intravaginal PracticesVaginal douching has long been associated with the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis and longitudinal data suggest that those who douche are at increased risk of incident bacterial vaginosis.56 The effects of other in- travaginal practices are not well-studied although some have been shown to kill vaginal bacteria and may be more associated with bacterial vaginosis than others.5758Studies of the effect of intravaginal practices are likely to be confounded by ethnicity and may be of limited statistical power as a result of heterogeneity of the practices.313234 Because use of intravaginal646 Lewis et alVaginal Microbiome Behavior and STDsOBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYproducts and practices is widespread in many cul- tures more investigation is needed.SmokingCigarette smoking has been strongly associated with increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in multiple epidemiologic studies sometimes in a dose-dependent manner.3059 Several compounds from cigarette smok- ing are detectable in the cervical mucus of smokers one of which has been associated with the induction of bacteriophages in lactobacilli.59 Recent data using sequence analysis have shown a correlation between smoking and dysbiosis even after adjusting for other factors.31 A 2014 study found that the vaginal micro- biota of smokers was significantly more likely to be in a low-lactobacillus state and that there was a significant trend in increasing amounts of smoking metabolites with a high Nugent score.59DietResearch into the gut microbiome has consistently demonstrated the striking effect of diet on bacterial community composition and function which seems to have a profound influence on human health including obesity and metabolic disorders inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.60 The proinflammatory effects of disrupted gut microbiota on distal body systems is increasingly recognized60 moreover the gut may serve as an extravaginal reservoir for both lactobacilli and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria.51 Subclinical deficiencies of iron and vitamin D in pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of bacterial vagi- nosis6162 although a large longitudinal study found no association between vitamin D and bacterial vaginosis using the proxy variable of season.63 Other analyses performed on subsets of women from this study dem- onstrated an association among increased dietary fat higher glycemic load and lower nutritional density6465 with bacterial vaginosis and an inverse association between bacterial vaginosis and an increased intake of folate vitamin E and calcium.64 Additionally glycemic load was significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis progression and persistence.65 Bacterial vaginosis has also been epidemiologically associated with obesity.29Network-Level Risk Factors Built Environment Poverty and Likelihood of Partnerships Based on EthnicityLimited research suggests that social determinants often associated with STD such as sexual and social milieu may be associated with the composition of the microbiome.

A meta-analysis of 23 studies showed that bacterial vaginosis was associated with a 60 increase in risk of acquiring HIV-1 this included four longitudinal studies that examined incident HIV-1 infection.89 A vaginal mucosal model demonstrated that lactobacilli particularly L crispatus suppressed HIV-1 replication.90 Cervicovaginal mucus with high levels of D-lactic acid and an L crispatus- dominated microbiome effectively trapped HIV-1 sig- nificantly better than did mucus dominated by other microbes91 and lactic acid at concentrations found in the vagina can inactivate HIV far more potently in vitro than can other acids.92 Importantly a recent study among Rwandan sex workers showed that those with L crispatus-dominant microbiota had the lowest prevalence of both HIV and sexually transmitted in- fections and that dysbiosis increased the risk of acquiring HIV and STD in a dose-response relation- ship moreover significantly fewer of the HIV-positive women with Lactobacillus spp.-dominant microbiota had detectable cervicovaginal levels of HIV-1.33Bacterial Vaginosis and Bacterial Sexually Transmitted DiseaseEpidemiologic studies have associated bacterial vag- inosis with increased risk of both gonorrhea andchlamydia infection.78 Vaginal lactobacilli in vitro inhibit growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae9394 as well as other bacterial pathogens.95 One cross-sectional study found that Nugent scores higher than 3 were associ- ated with a fourfold increase in risk for gonorrhea and a threefold increase in risk for chlamydia infection.96 Well-designed longitudinal studies have also demon- strated the association with the largest study showing an increased risk for incident chlamydia and gonor- rhea in women with Nugent scores higher than 3.97 A randomized trial showed that the treatment of asymp- tomatic bacterial vaginosis with intravaginal metroni- dazole was significantly associated with a more than a threefold decrease in incident chlamydia98 how- ever more recent data from a prospective randomized trial showed that home screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis did not decrease incidence of either chlamydia or gonorrhea.99Bacterial Vaginosis and TrichomonasTrichomonas vaginalis infection has been strongly asso- ciated with bacterial vaginosis.97 In the 2001-2004 National Health and Examination Survey co- occurrence occurred in approximately half of women infected with T vaginalis.100 T vaginalis alters vaginal pH has been associated with lower levels of healthy vaginal lactobacilli and has been positively associated with increased Nugent score.101 In vitro evidence indicates that T vaginalis presence reduces epithelial-associated lactobacilli but not bacterial vaginosis-associated spe- cies.102 Recent longitudinal analyses have demon- strated that a Nugent score higher than 3 was associated with a significantly increased risk of acquiring T vagi- nalis.103 Studies of T vaginalis and the microbiome using sequencing techniques are few however one study found that CST-IV was significantly associated with T vaginalis detection.104 Furthermore T vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis are independently associated with increased vaginal shedding of HIV-1 and their co- occurrence has been associated with greatly increased odds of vaginal shedding.105Bacterial Vaginosis and Pelvic Inflammatory DiseaseThere is some question whether bacterial vaginosis can cause pelvic inflammatory disease PID or whether the epidemiologic association between them is the result of the increased attributable risk of bacterial vaginosis to STD acquisition.9 Although it is typically associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia infection PID has been shown to frequently occur in the absence of known STD and can be of multimicro- bial etiology.106-108 The anaerobic organisms foundVOL.

when compared with HPV-negative women8687 furthermore women with microbiota dominated by L gasseri seemed to have increased rates of HPV clearance.86 Other studies have demonstrated that severity of cervical intraepithelial dysplasia was significantly associated with increasing vaginal micro- bial diversity regardless of HPV status demonstrated that community-state type was significantly associated with prevalent HPV and CST IV-B was associated with HPV positivity although not at a significant level that severity of cervical intraepithelial dysplasia was significantly associated with increasing vaginal microbial diversity regardless of HPV status88 and that severity of cervical intraepithelial dysplasia was significantly associated with increasing vaginal micro- bial diversity regardless of HPV status.88Bacterial Vaginosis and Human Immunodeficiency VirusThere is considerable evidence associating vaginal dysbiosis with increased risk of acquisition and trans- mission of HIV-1.

Certain community types are more associated with poor reproductive outcomes and STDs communities dominated by Lactobacillus species particularly Lactobacillus crispatus are most associated with vaginal health.

However a number of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors have been shown to affect the vaginal microbiome.Race-EthnicityBacterial vaginosis prevalence varies by ethnic group in essentially all of the populations studied to date.27 Acquisition of bacterial vaginosis in the United States has long been associated with black race27-30 this association has been shown to persist even after adjustment for sexual practices and other confound- ers.28-31 Bacterial vaginosis prevalence in the United Kingdom and Canada was higher in Afro-Caribbeans and aboriginal populations respectively whereas in Spain and China Gypsy and Tibetan ethnicity had higher prevalence respectively.27 Interestingly all of these groups represent a minority population within the country studied.More recent studies of the vaginal microbiome of U.S.-born black and white women show a significant difference in microbiota between the two groups with black women having more microbial diversity and less likelihood of colonization with lactobacilli than white women.1531 Multiple studies performed in several sub-Saharan African countries have shown a far lowerproportion of women with vaginal communities dom- inated by L crispatus when compared with women of European or Asian ancestry.153132 Rather the com- munities of the African women were dominated by L iners and a variable mix of facultative anaerobic bac- teria.32-34 Microbiome composition was significantly associated with ethnic origin in a Dutch study with women of African descent having the highest preva- lence of clusters dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis or dysbiosis Borgdorff H. The vaginal microbiome of women residing in Amsterdam association with eth- nicity.

Cultivation- independent methods have shown that vaginal bacte- rial communities cluster into anywhere from three to nine discrete groups most of which are dominated by lactobacilli.12-14 A widely used method of classifying sequencing data was described by Ravel et al15 who used next-generation molecular sequencing techniques to characterize the vaginal microbiota of 396 asymp- tomatic North American women from four ethnic groups.
