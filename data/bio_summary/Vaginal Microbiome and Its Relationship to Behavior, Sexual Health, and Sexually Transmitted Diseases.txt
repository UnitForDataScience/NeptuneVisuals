Cultivation- independent methods have shown that vaginal bacte- rial communities cluster into anywhere from three to nine discrete groups most of which are dominated by lactobacilli.12-14 A widely used method of classifying sequencing data was described by Ravel et al15 who used next-generation molecular sequencing techniques to characterize the vaginal microbiota of 396 asymp- tomatic North American women from four ethnic groups.

These bac- teriocins can kill urogenital pathogens in vitro under various conditions24 and lactic acid may act as an anti- microbial agent beyond maintaining highly acidic pH by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and stimulating host immunity in the presence of bacterial lipopolysac- charide.22 Interestingly the healthy yet diverse vaginal microbial communities seen in a minority of women are dominated by taxa that also produce lactic acid25 the conservation of lactic acid production across all healthy vaginal communities may indicate that its pres- ence is key to maintaining healthy vaginal function.8The different isomers of lactic acid may also have unique roles in the human vagina L-lactic acid which is produced by both bacteria and vaginal epithelial cells activates certain immune cells and can induce vaginal epithelial cells to release proinflammatory cy- tokines.26 The role of D-lactic acid produced almost exclusively by bacteria is less well-known however the ratio of L- to D-lactic acid may modulate the expression of host signaling molecules and affect the risk of infection-related preterm birth.26DETERMINANTS OF THE VAGINAL MICROBIOMEIt has been known for more than a century that disrupting vaginal Lactobacillus species can result in644 Lewis et alVaginal Microbiome Behavior and STDsOBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYFig.

There is a consistent association between oral contraceptive use and a decrease in prevalent bacterial vagino- sis.293940 Some studies have shown a decrease in prevalent bacterial vaginosis in women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection or implant40 however depot medroxyprogesterone acetate has also been found to decrease vaginal lactobacilli3941 and is associated in some studies with an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus HIV acqui- sition and transmission possibly in part mediated by the effects of the microbiota on cervicovaginal inflam- mation.42 However a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a robust negative associ- ation between any hormonal contraception regardless of type excluding intrauterine devices and prevalent incident or recurrent bacterial vaginosis.43Sexual BehaviorThere has been debate about whether bacterial vaginosis can be classified as an STD as opposed to a sexually associated condition however the pre- ponderance of evidence demonstrates that bacterial vaginosis can be sexually transmitted from women to male and female partners.4445 Epidemiologic studies have consistently associated bacterial vaginosis with risk factors associated with STD.4446 More frequent vaginal intercourse is associated with increased risk of bacterial vaginosis.30 Multiple new or increased number of male partners are strongly associated with bacterial vaginosis in multiple studies.3444 Recent unprotected sex as evidenced by the presence of prostate-specific antigen in vaginal fluid has been asso- ciated with a more than twofold increased risk of bac- terial vaginosis47 and recurrent bacterial vaginosis48 and is negatively associated with the presence and concentration of healthy Lactobacillus species.34 Addi- tionally there is a significant association between bac- terial vaginosis and female sex partners29 because women who have sex with women appear to be at increased risk when compared with women who have sex with men only.2946 There is a strong inverse asso- ciation between bacterial vaginosis and condom use.44 In one study bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria were detected more commonly in the urine and cor-onal sulcus of men with asymptomatic STDs than in healthy men.49 Finally both bacterial vaginosis by Nugent scoring50 and detection of bacterial vaginosis- associated anaerobes29 are far less frequent in sexually inexperienced than in sexually experienced women.Data on the influence of specific sexual practices on bacterial vaginosis are relatively few in one study vaginal intercourse immediately after receptive anal intercourse was associated with bacterial vaginosis30 other studies demonstrated an association between receptive oral sex and bacterial vaginosis.46 The increased detection and gene copies of G vaginalis in the oral cavity among women who have sex with women with bacterial vaginosis adds some biological plausibility to this association51 however several other studies have not demonstrated an association with receptive oral sex.46 One study has found an association between bacterial vaginosis and receptive oral or anal sex whereas several others did not46 receptive digital sex either vaginal or anal does not seem to be associated with bacterial vaginosis.46 One well-designed longitudinal study found that recurrent bacterial vaginosis was nearly twice as likely in women who had the same sex partner before and after treatment regardless of coital frequency.52Male circumcision may play a role in male-to- female transmission of bacterial vaginosis as it does in other STDs.44 Circumcision has been shown to signif- icantly decrease the load of anaerobic bacteria includ- ing bacterial vaginosis-associated species on the coronal sulcus53 and other studies have correlated circumcision with a decrease in bacterial vaginosis among female partners.3054 A recent study showed that uncircumcised men with a higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes in their penile microbiota were significantly more likely to have a partner with a high Nugent score moreover this type of microbiota was significantly associated with having two or more extramarital partners.55Intravaginal PracticesVaginal douching has long been associated with the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis and longitudinal data suggest that those who douche are at increased risk of incident bacterial vaginosis.56 The effects of other in- travaginal practices are not well-studied although some have been shown to kill vaginal bacteria and may be more associated with bacterial vaginosis than others.5758Studies of the effect of intravaginal practices are likely to be confounded by ethnicity and may be of limited statistical power as a result of heterogeneity of the practices.313234 Because use of intravaginal646 Lewis et alVaginal Microbiome Behavior and STDsOBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYproducts and practices is widespread in many cul- tures more investigation is needed.SmokingCigarette smoking has been strongly associated with increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in multiple epidemiologic studies sometimes in a dose-dependent manner.3059 Several compounds from cigarette smok- ing are detectable in the cervical mucus of smokers one of which has been associated with the induction of bacteriophages in lactobacilli.59 Recent data using sequence analysis have shown a correlation between smoking and dysbiosis even after adjusting for other factors.31 A 2014 study found that the vaginal micro- biota of smokers was significantly more likely to be in a low-lactobacillus state and that there was a significant trend in increasing amounts of smoking metabolites with a high Nugent score.59DietResearch into the gut microbiome has consistently demonstrated the striking effect of diet on bacterial community composition and function which seems to have a profound influence on human health including obesity and metabolic disorders inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.60 The proinflammatory effects of disrupted gut microbiota on distal body systems is increasingly recognized60 moreover the gut may serve as an extravaginal reservoir for both lactobacilli and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria.51 Subclinical deficiencies of iron and vitamin D in pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of bacterial vagi- nosis6162 although a large longitudinal study found no association between vitamin D and bacterial vaginosis using the proxy variable of season.63 Other analyses performed on subsets of women from this study dem- onstrated an association among increased dietary fat higher glycemic load and lower nutritional density6465 with bacterial vaginosis and an inverse association between bacterial vaginosis and an increased intake of folate vitamin E and calcium.64 Additionally glycemic load was significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis progression and persistence.65 Bacterial vaginosis has also been epidemiologically associated with obesity.29Network-Level Risk Factors Built Environment Poverty and Likelihood of Partnerships Based on EthnicityLimited research suggests that social determinants often associated with STD such as sexual and social milieu may be associated with the composition of the microbiome.

Longitudinal studies have shown an increased association of prevalent and incident HPV in women with both intermediate flora and648 Lewis et alVaginal Microbiome Behavior and STDsOBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYbacterial vagionsis84 a small but significant increase in risk for prevalent HPV an increase in odds of incident HPV and delayed clearance of HPV in women with Nugent scores 7 or greater.85 Two more recent molec- ular analyses found that women who were HPV- positive had a lower proportion of protective vaginal Lactobacillus spp.

Several studies have begun to elucidate the functionality of the microbiome123 further assessment of protein transcription of both microbes and host will help address gaps in knowledge about the pathogen- esis of dysbiosis microbial and host interactions that lead to adverse clinical outcomes and the evaluation650 Lewis et alVaginal Microbiome Behavior and STDsOBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYof interventions that aim to maintain or restore a healthy vaginal milieu.REFERENCESTurnbaugh PJ Ley RE Hamady M Fraser-Liggett C Knight R Gordon JI.
