there is a consistent association between oral contraceptive use and a decrease in prevalent bacterial vagino- sis.293940 some studies have shown a decrease in prevalent bacterial vaginosis in women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection or implant40 however depot medroxyprogesterone acetate has also been found to decrease vaginal lactobacilli3941 and is associated in some studies with an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus hiv acqui- sition and transmission possibly in part mediated by the effects of the microbiota on cervicovaginal inflam- mation.42 however a recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a robust negative associ- ation between any hormonal contraception regardless of type excluding intrauterine devices and prevalent incident or recurrent bacterial vaginosis.43sexual behaviorthere has been debate about whether bacterial vaginosis can be classified as an std as opposed to a sexually associated condition however the pre- ponderance of evidence demonstrates that bacterial vaginosis can be sexually transmitted from women to male and female partners.4445 epidemiologic studies have consistently associated bacterial vaginosis with risk factors associated with std.4446 more frequent vaginal intercourse is associated with increased risk of bacterial vaginosis.30 multiple new or increased number of male partners are strongly associated with bacterial vaginosis in multiple studies.3444 recent unprotected sex as evidenced by the presence of prostate-specific antigen in vaginal fluid has been asso- ciated with a more than twofold increased risk of bac- terial vaginosis47 and recurrent bacterial vaginosis48 and is negatively associated with the presence and concentration of healthy lactobacillus species.34 addi- tionally there is a significant association between bac- terial vaginosis and female sex partners29 because women who have sex with women appear to be at increased risk when compared with women who have sex with men only.2946 there is a strong inverse asso- ciation between bacterial vaginosis and condom use.44 in one study bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria were detected more commonly in the urine and cor-onal sulcus of men with asymptomatic stds than in healthy men.49 finally both bacterial vaginosis by nugent scoring50 and detection of bacterial vaginosis- associated anaerobes29 are far less frequent in sexually inexperienced than in sexually experienced women.data on the influence of specific sexual practices on bacterial vaginosis are relatively few in one study vaginal intercourse immediately after receptive anal intercourse was associated with bacterial vaginosis30 other studies demonstrated an association between receptive oral sex and bacterial vaginosis.46 the increased detection and gene copies of g vaginalis in the oral cavity among women who have sex with women with bacterial vaginosis adds some biological plausibility to this association51 however several other studies have not demonstrated an association with receptive oral sex.46 one study has found an association between bacterial vaginosis and receptive oral or anal sex whereas several others did not46 receptive digital sex either vaginal or anal does not seem to be associated with bacterial vaginosis.46 one well-designed longitudinal study found that recurrent bacterial vaginosis was nearly twice as likely in women who had the same sex partner before and after treatment regardless of coital frequency.52male circumcision may play a role in male-to- female transmission of bacterial vaginosis as it does in other stds.44 circumcision has been shown to signif- icantly decrease the load of anaerobic bacteria includ- ing bacterial vaginosis-associated species on the coronal sulcus53 and other studies have correlated circumcision with a decrease in bacterial vaginosis among female partners.3054 a recent study showed that uncircumcised men with a higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes in their penile microbiota were significantly more likely to have a partner with a high nugent score moreover this type of microbiota was significantly associated with having two or more extramarital partners.55intravaginal practicesvaginal douching has long been associated with the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis and longitudinal data suggest that those who douche are at increased risk of incident bacterial vaginosis.56 the effects of other in- travaginal practices are not well-studied although some have been shown to kill vaginal bacteria and may be more associated with bacterial vaginosis than others.5758studies of the effect of intravaginal practices are likely to be confounded by ethnicity and may be of limited statistical power as a result of heterogeneity of the practices.313234 because use of intravaginal646 lewis et alvaginal microbiome behavior and stdsobstetrics  gynecologyproducts and practices is widespread in many cul- tures more investigation is needed.smokingcigarette smoking has been strongly associated with increased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in multiple epidemiologic studies sometimes in a dose-dependent manner.3059 several compounds from cigarette smok- ing are detectable in the cervical mucus of smokers one of which has been associated with the induction of bacteriophages in lactobacilli.59 recent data using sequence analysis have shown a correlation between smoking and dysbiosis even after adjusting for other factors.31 a 2014 study found that the vaginal micro- biota of smokers was significantly more likely to be in a low-lactobacillus state and that there was a significant trend in increasing amounts of smoking metabolites with a high nugent score.59dietresearch into the gut microbiome has consistently demonstrated the striking effect of diet on bacterial community composition and function which seems to have a profound influence on human health including obesity and metabolic disorders inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.60 the proinflammatory effects of disrupted gut microbiota on distal body systems is increasingly recognized60 moreover the gut may serve as an extravaginal reservoir for both lactobacilli and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria.51 subclinical deficiencies of iron and vitamin d in pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of bacterial vagi- nosis6162 although a large longitudinal study found no association between vitamin d and bacterial vaginosis using the proxy variable of season.63 other analyses performed on subsets of women from this study dem- onstrated an association among increased dietary fat higher glycemic load and lower nutritional density6465 with bacterial vaginosis and an inverse association between bacterial vaginosis and an increased intake of folate vitamin e and calcium.64 additionally glycemic load was significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis progression and persistence.65 bacterial vaginosis has also been epidemiologically associated with obesity.29network-level risk factors built environment poverty and likelihood of partnerships based on ethnicitylimited research suggests that social determinants often associated with std such as sexual and social milieu may be associated with the composition of the microbiome.

a meta-analysis of 23 studies showed that bacterial vaginosis was associated with a 60 increase in risk of acquiring hiv-1 this included four longitudinal studies that examined incident hiv-1 infection.89 a vaginal mucosal model demonstrated that lactobacilli particularly l crispatus suppressed hiv-1 replication.90 cervicovaginal mucus with high levels of d-lactic acid and an l crispatus- dominated microbiome effectively trapped hiv-1 sig- nificantly better than did mucus dominated by other microbes91 and lactic acid at concentrations found in the vagina can inactivate hiv far more potently in vitro than can other acids.92 importantly a recent study among rwandan sex workers showed that those with l crispatus-dominant microbiota had the lowest prevalence of both hiv and sexually transmitted in- fections and that dysbiosis increased the risk of acquiring hiv and std in a dose-response relation- ship moreover significantly fewer of the hiv-positive women with lactobacillus spp.-dominant microbiota had detectable cervicovaginal levels of hiv-1.33bacterial vaginosis and bacterial sexually transmitted diseaseepidemiologic studies have associated bacterial vag- inosis with increased risk of both gonorrhea andchlamydia infection.78 vaginal lactobacilli in vitro inhibit growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae9394 as well as other bacterial pathogens.95 one cross-sectional study found that nugent scores higher than 3 were associ- ated with a fourfold increase in risk for gonorrhea and a threefold increase in risk for chlamydia infection.96 well-designed longitudinal studies have also demon- strated the association with the largest study showing an increased risk for incident chlamydia and gonor- rhea in women with nugent scores higher than 3.97 a randomized trial showed that the treatment of asymp- tomatic bacterial vaginosis with intravaginal metroni- dazole was significantly associated with a more than a threefold decrease in incident chlamydia98 how- ever more recent data from a prospective randomized trial showed that home screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis did not decrease incidence of either chlamydia or gonorrhea.99bacterial vaginosis and trichomonastrichomonas vaginalis infection has been strongly asso- ciated with bacterial vaginosis.97 in the 2001-2004 national health and examination survey co- occurrence occurred in approximately half of women infected with t vaginalis.100 t vaginalis alters vaginal ph has been associated with lower levels of healthy vaginal lactobacilli and has been positively associated with increased nugent score.101 in vitro evidence indicates that t vaginalis presence reduces epithelial-associated lactobacilli but not bacterial vaginosis-associated spe- cies.102 recent longitudinal analyses have demon- strated that a nugent score higher than 3 was associated with a significantly increased risk of acquiring t vagi- nalis.103 studies of t vaginalis and the microbiome using sequencing techniques are few however one study found that cst-iv was significantly associated with t vaginalis detection.104 furthermore t vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis are independently associated with increased vaginal shedding of hiv-1 and their co- occurrence has been associated with greatly increased odds of vaginal shedding.105bacterial vaginosis and pelvic inflammatory diseasethere is some question whether bacterial vaginosis can cause pelvic inflammatory disease pid or whether the epidemiologic association between them is the result of the increased attributable risk of bacterial vaginosis to std acquisition.9 although it is typically associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia infection pid has been shown to frequently occur in the absence of known std and can be of multimicro- bial etiology.106-108 the anaerobic organisms foundvol.

families particularly sexual partners in a household have been demonstrated to have sharedmicrobiota in the fecal and oral compartments.66 ani- mal studies have demonstrated that social group membership and frequent physical contact and social interaction among individuals correlate with shared gut microbiome.67 emerging research shows that the influence of the built environment has an effect on the composition of human microbiota68 as might the influence of stress.6970 a combination of unhealthy neighborhood diet social conditions stress and other factors such as is seen in poverty may contribute to a less healthy vaginal microbiome in multiple ways the association of neighborhood with std71 and low birth weight72 is intriguing when viewed in this light.population-level parameters affect the prevalence of std73 and the structure of social and sexual net- works may be important in explaining the difference in prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among different ethnic groups.2774 although research is limited there is a strong ecologic-level association between the prevalence of concurrency among men and bacterial vaginosis prevalence.74 bacterial vaginosis prevalence is higher in minority populations of different ethnic- ities in multiple different countries additionally the populations with more bacterial vaginosis also had markers of higher risk sexual behaviors than those of majority ethnicity.2775 another study performed with historical data from uganda the united states and thailand demonstrated that hiv prevalence dif- ferentials aligned perfectly with differences in preva- lence duration and coital exposure of concurrent partnerships among males.76consequences of dysbiosisan unhealthy vaginal microbiome in addition to its significant psychosocial effect on symptomatic women77 is an important risk factor for acquisition of stds and adverse reproductive and obstetric sequelae.78 increasingly diverse vaginal microbiota seem to demonstrate increasingly less resilience to disturbance and more susceptibility to disease81133 fig.

this associ- ation may be bidirectional hsv-2 infection was asso- ciated with an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis episodes in female sex workers in burkina faso82 and this meta-analysis also demonstrated a relative risk of 1.55 for incident bacterial vaginosis in hsv- 2-infected women.80 a recent study found that antibiotic-induced vaginal dysbiosis in mice resultedin severe impairment of antiviral protection against hsv-2 infection.83bacterial vaginosis and human papillomavirusthe literature exploring the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and human papillomavirus hpv is consistent.

1. however a number of modifiable and nonmodifiable factors have been shown to affect the vaginal microbiome.race-ethnicitybacterial vaginosis prevalence varies by ethnic group in essentially all of the populations studied to date.27 acquisition of bacterial vaginosis in the united states has long been associated with black race27-30 this association has been shown to persist even after adjustment for sexual practices and other confound- ers.28-31 bacterial vaginosis prevalence in the united kingdom and canada was higher in afro-caribbeans and aboriginal populations respectively whereas in spain and china gypsy and tibetan ethnicity had higher prevalence respectively.27 interestingly all of these groups represent a minority population within the country studied.more recent studies of the vaginal microbiome of u.s.-born black and white women show a significant difference in microbiota between the two groups with black women having more microbial diversity and less likelihood of colonization with lactobacilli than white women.1531 multiple studies performed in several sub-saharan african countries have shown a far lowerproportion of women with vaginal communities dom- inated by l crispatus when compared with women of european or asian ancestry.153132 rather the com- munities of the african women were dominated by l iners and a variable mix of facultative anaerobic bac- teria.32-34 microbiome composition was significantly associated with ethnic origin in a dutch study with women of african descent having the highest preva- lence of clusters dominated by gardnerella vaginalis or dysbiosis borgdorff h. the vaginal microbiome of women residing in amsterdam association with eth- nicity.

for the purposes of this review the term bacterial vaginosis or bv is used when discussing research into bacterial vaginosis as diagnosed by amsel's or nugent's criteria.

4 april 2017lewis et alvaginal microbiome behavior and stds 649in many cases of acute salpingitis and endometritis are often bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms.108 one large longitudinal cohort study found that vagi- nal carriage of bacterial vaginosis-associated organ- isms was associated with a twofold increase in incident pid risk.109 another study did not demonstrate an association between incident pid and bacterial vagi- nosis carriage in the prior 6 months however dense growth of anaerobic pigmented gram-negative rods was significantly associated with pid.9 detection of similar organisms was associated in another study with a more than fourfold increase in pid risk other anaerobes or nugent scores of 7-10 were also signif- icantly associated with pid.108 a small molecular study of patients with and without found dna of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria and un- characterized species in most viable case samples but none in control patients moreover only one case sample was positive for bacterial std.bacterial colonization of the upper cervix and uterus may be physiological110 however one study demonstrated that at least one bacterial species was found 95 of the time in the upper cervix and uterus of women without endometritis undergoing hysterec- tomy for benign conditions and bacterial composition varied significantly by race.111 whether this reflects vaginal contamination or true upper tract commensal organisms is not yet known.111bacterial vaginosis and preterm birthbacterial vaginosis has long been associated with adverse birth outcomes although the mechanism by which dysbiosis affects pregnancy remains unclear112 and certain organisms may affect pregnancy outcomes differently at different gestational ages.10 molecular studies have consistently shown pregnancy to be asso- ciated with decreased microbial diversity lactobacillus spp.

additionally further investi- gation into the effect of the order of sexual acts and coital frequency on the composition of the microbiota could provide practical risk reduction advice for women.more effective treatments for bacterial vaginosis are necessary because current cure rates range from 50-80 after metronidazole treatment and recurrence is very common.118 the role of biofilm disruption119 and probiotic administration120 in achieving a better cure and preventing recurrent infection should be fur- ther explored although the efficacy of different com- binations or strains of probiotic species on restoring the vaginal flora is an area of active research.22 treat- ing the sex partners of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis has not decreased recurrence in several ran- domized controlled trials however this may be the result of study design limitations and ineffective treat- ment.55 more research into the efficacy of treating sex partners is needed.22given that cesarean deliveries have been shown to significantly affect the composition of the gut microbiome121 investigation on the effect of mode of birth on establishment and maintenance of a healthy vaginal microbiome may be important.
