Three models of antibacterial action of chitosan have been proposed so far 1 interaction between positively-charged chitosanmolecules and negatively-charged microbial cell membranes 2 binding of chitosan with microbial DNA and 3 chelation of metals suppression of spore elements and binding to essential nutrients to microbial growth .

Since chitosan hydrosol has to be prepared by dissolution of powdered chitosan in lactic acid solution the effect of this acid on antimicrobial properties must be considered.

demonstrated that chitosan nanoparticles exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than chitosan solution due to their small particles and high surface charge .

The aim of this work was to improve the quality of rawcooked meat by coating it with sodium alginate A chitosan C and sodium alginate-chitosan polyelectrolyte complex PEC hydrosols.

Application of PEC on the meat surface resulted in reducing the total number of micro-organisms psychrotrophs and lactic acid bacteria by about 61 and yeast and molds by about 45 compared to control after a two-week storage.Keywords meat quality chitosan alginate polyelectrolyte complex coating antimicrobial antioxidant propertiesIntroductionThe main cause of sensory functional and nutritional quality deterioration in meat during storage are microbial spoilage and lipidprotein oxidation .

developed chitosan coatings enriched with cinnamon oil to increase the shelf-life of cold-stored trout fillets .

discovered that chitosan coatings were effective in protecting lipids from oxidation when applied to herring and cod fillets .

showed that coating ground beef patties with chitosan reduced TBARS thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values and improved the surface red colour of patties compared to non-coated samples .

showed that chitosan can be used to extend the shelf-life of fresh pork sausages due to its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties .

In earlier studies we confirmed the desirability of connecting alginate and chitosan due to the improvement of their thermal and mechanical properties as well as chemical stability .
