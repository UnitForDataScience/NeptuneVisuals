When comparing the intersection of differentially regulated genes between the groups we found that most genes differentially regulated in 2 week WD vs. ND comparisons were also different in 4 week WD vs. ND comparisons  400 Figure S2C first vertical bar.Collectively WD induces highly consistent and robust alterations of hepatic gene expression between biological replicates and time points.

Together we show that 2 weeks of WD are sufficient to induce global changes in hepatic gene expression which are still present and largely unchanged after 4 weeks of WD feeding with a strong enrichment for transcripts involved in innate immunity and oxidative stress response.Microbiota are not required for development of hepatic steatosis and inflammationTo test whether the presence of microbiota is a requirement for diet-induced hepatic inflammation in hypercholesterolemic mice we fed conventionally-raised CONV-R and germ-free GF Ldlr-- mice a WD for 2 weeks and analyzed their livers for the presence of inflammation.

Thus feeding a WD to Ldlr-- mice induces hepatic ROS production and accumulation of MDA mainly presented on dying Kupffer cells.To identify the specific proteins carrying MDA epitopes and thereby mediating pro- inflammatory effects we performed immunopurification of homogenized liver samples from mice fed a WD for 4 weeks using LR04 and an isotype control antibody and analyzed the obtained protein fraction by mass spectrometry.

In addition GO analysis of the significantly downregulated transcripts in livers after 2 weeks of WD revealed a strong enrichment of genes involved in the biological process oxidation reduction Figure 1C suggesting the activation of oxidative stress response pathways.Indeed a set of genes implicated in oxidative stress response was found to be deregulated upon WD in our global analysis Figure 1E.

We found that a range of transcripts involved in inflammatory responses that were highly upregulated due to WD in our global analysis was also upregulated in GF Ldlr-- mice upon WD Figure 2D.

To investigate factors and mechanisms contributing to diet-induced hepatic inflammation in an unbiased manner we fed Ldlr-- mice a ND or a WD for 2 or 4 weeks and performed transcriptomic profiling of liver tissue using RNA sequencing.
