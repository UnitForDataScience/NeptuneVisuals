The heritability ofgut microbiome diversity has been estimated to range from 0.30 to 0.37 which means that over 60 of the variation in microbiome diversity is environmentally determined and under- standing how to increase microbiome diversity should be a focus of future research.Our results also suggest that the beneficial effect of fibre on weight may be more pronounced in individuals with higher microbiome diversity although this may reflect at least in part the fact that individuals which higher fibre have a greater microbiome diversity.

The healthy effects of a diverse gut microbiome on several phenotypes have already been demon- strated in humans in various settings.Experimental work in animals has shown that fibre intake reduces the energy density of diet and the resulting short chain fatty acids promote intestinal gluconeogenesis incretin formation and subsequently satiety whereas at the same time short chain fatty acids also deliver energy to the host and support liponeogenesis.Our data suggest that increasing microbiome diversity may be itself a desirable outcome and that an effect of fibre intake on reduced weight gain is seen more strongly in individuals with higher microbiome diversity.We note several study limitations the major one being thelack of measures of microbiome composition at baseline that would enable us to assess the predictive value of diversity with regards to weight gain.

The association remains even after adjusting for saturated fat intake OR  0.978 0.96-0.99 P  0.03.Stratifying the sample between those in the top tertile of Shannon's diversity and those in the bottom tertile we found that dietary fibre intake is associated with lower of weight gain among individuals with high gut microbiome diversity OR  0.954 0.92-0.98 P  0.003 c. A similar although not significant effect is observed for individuals in the low gut microbiome diversity group OR  0.977 0.94-1.01 P  0.16.

The ORs for association with weight gain per gram per day of fibre intake are also shown.If lower bacterial diversity was indeed directly linked to lower weight gain this would be in agreement with what has been found in murine models regarding the effect of the gut microbiota on energy metabolism in the hostand would suggest that gut microbes may be viewed as 'novel' future therapeutic target to treat obesity.We report that microbiome diversity could be influencing theobserved relation between dietary fibre and weight gain.

However this suggests that changes in the microbiome in response to weight loss over a short period of time that is 4 months may not reflect differences in microbiome composition associated with lower risk of weight gain over a period of many years.Not only is weight gain in large part because of non-genetic factorsbut an individual's gut microbiome diversity is only in part determined by the hosts' genetic make-up.

Whenwe stratified the sample between those in the top tertile of Shannon's diversity and those in the bottom tertile we found that fibre intake is significantly associated with a decreased risk of being in the high weight gain group among individuals in the high microbiome diversity group but not in those with low microbiome diversity.We also identified nine OTUs to be significantly associated withweight gain.

Our results on longitudinal weight gain are consistent with several studies that have provided evidence of associations between the gut microbiome and cross-sectional measures of body weight.In this study the lack of microbiome data at baseline precludes us from being able to assess if higher diversity is a cause or a consequence of higher weight gain.

The suggestion that this ratio may not be particularly informative regarding the role of the microbiome in determining body weight had already been put forward by others.The association between some Ruminococcaceae and lower risk of weight gain and Bacteroides and higher risk of weight gain may be simply because of their respectively positive and negative correlations with microbiome diversity although in two instances the OTUs remain associated even after adjustment for diversity.In mice the gut microbiota is altered during suppression of obesity in a cold environment.

We repeated the analysis adjusting for the above covariates as well as for use of proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics.Linear regressions were also undertaken to determine the association between dietary fibre and microbial diversity adjusting for age BMI calorie intake family relatedness and multiple testing.As we hypothesised that microbiome diversity could be influencing the relation between dietary fibre and weight gain we repeated the analysis by stratifying the sample between those in the top tertile of Shannon's diversity a metric that accounts for abundance and represents species evenness and those in the bottom tertile.Logistic regressions were also used to investigate the association between OTU and weight again adjusting for covariates familiar relatedness and multiple testing using false discovery rate.Finally we run partial least square discriminant analysis on OTUs to identify the effects of weight gain and weight loss on the bacterial community using the R package MixOmics.

Heritability analysis809 monozygotic pairs and 1050 dizygotic pairs found that long- itudinal weight change has a heritability h2 of 0.41 95 confidence interval 0.31 0.47 meaning that 59 of the variance in its levels is not defined by a common genetic component.We then proceeded to investigate the contribution of gut microbiome diversity to this phenotype.Alpha diversityIndividuals in the weight gain group had a significantly lower diversity P o0.05 for the Shannon and Simpson indexes as well as with the observed number of species in spite of having similar BMI at baseline 2.
