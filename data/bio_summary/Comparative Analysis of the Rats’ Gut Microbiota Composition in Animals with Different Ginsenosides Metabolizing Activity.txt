distinct clustering of the microbiota composition bet- ween the lem and hem groups was observed following unifrac- based principal coordinates analysis pcoa and is presented in a. the multivariate analysis of the pcoa matrix scoresshows a statistically notable separation between the microbiota of the 2 groups b. these results suggested that the samples in the hem group were well separated from the lem group.then taxonomy-based analysis revealed the populations of the dominant intestinal microbiota in the 2 groups.

additionally they are also involved in diverse processes including the metabolic function of tcms.panax ginseng is a type of tcm that is widely used as a func- tional food and is found in tea powder and capsules.the major pharmacological components in panax ginseng are ginsenosides which possess various biological functions including antidia- betic immunomodulatory antitumor antiaging and anti-infla- mmatory activities.-following oral intake of panax ginseng major ginsenosides are metabolized to deglycosylated ginseno- sides via intestinal microbiota before absorption into the blood.

research into the in vitro bioconversion of american ginseng extract via human gut microbiota reveals that ginsenosides rg3 and compound k are the major metabolites.according to the metabolism of ginsenosides detected in this study and other reports of metabolic pathways in previous studies we speculated the pathway of ginsenosides by intestinal microbiota .

to understand the correlation between the intestinal microbiota composition and the gut micro- biota metabolism of ginsenosides in individuals we analyzed thegut microbiota composition in the colonic content of the lem and hem groups by performing illumina hiseq sequencing- based analysis of bacterial 16s rrna v3-v4 region.

the con- ditions of the host such as diet stress and even environmentalexposure could lead to the differences of gut microbiota com- position and function which affect the efficiency of metabolism and absorption of ginsenosides.therefore studies on the relationship between the community structure of gut microbiota and the metabolism of ginsenosides are significant.in this study we used lc-msms to analyze the colonic content samples of 60 rats after oral administration of panax ginseng extract.

in lem the amount of ginsenosides re rg1 rf rb1 rc rb2 and rd was significantly higher than in hem whereas metabolites f2 ppt and compound k were significantly lower than in hem c. of the 14 ginsenosides in the colonic content the concentrations of ppt and compound k were significantly higher than the rest which indicates that ginsenosides ppt and compound k were the principal metabolites of panax ginseng extract after oral administration.
