Dimethyl disulfide altered phenomena range from plant growth reduction ISR reduced seed germination fungal discoloration mycelium growth reduction and also include contradictory results such as seedling and plant growth promotions Table 1 2.

A sim- ilar wide array of physiological parameters were addressed by 23-butanediol ISR PR gene activation improved drought survival stomata closure and aperture affected and growth promotion and by 2-undecanone growth promotion salinity tolerance fungal mycelium growth promotion as well as inhibi- tion reduced sclerotia formation.

Regarding plants observations and results obtained from various experiments range from for example strong growth inhibitions to significant growth promotions.

Moreover several mVOC compound classes have dual functions and cause growth promotion and growth reduction at certain experimental conditions Table 2.First steps elucidating the potential effects of discrete bioac- tive mVOCs were performed however more detailed and spe- cific experiments are needed to unravel the respective targets and cellular and molecular reactions.

2016 for instance explored the potential influence of CO2 on plant growth promotion by comparing sealed system with non-sealed systems and observed no difference in plant growth.
