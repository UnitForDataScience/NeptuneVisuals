specifically propionate can regulate the de novo proliferation of t-reg cells and jointly with acetate drive their homing in the colon.12 on the other hand butyrate exerts a protective role on the gut epithelium as it stim- ulates the release of mucins13 and has a local immunomodulatory func- tion regulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.1415finally butyrate can control both the extrathymic t-reg production13and the differentiation of colonic t-regs.16when the gm is challenged with pressure deriving from the environment it is able to reconfigure itself in different steady states resulting in an adaptive response that maintains host health and pre- serves homeostasis.17 one of the major factors resulting in these adap- tive gm changes is diet.18 however in certain circumstances such as a high-fat high-sugar diet typical of western countries diet can have adeleterious impact on the gm-host mutualism19 forcing ecosystemdysbiosis which can contribute to the onset of metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes t2d.20-22 indeed the faecal microbiota in t2d subjects consuming a high-fat high-sugar diet is characterized by a lower biodiversity and an increased amount of pro-inflammatory microorganisms in comparison to healthy peo- ple.23 for this reason the gm has been recently considered a target for the control of t2d and other metabolic disorders.24 in this sce- nario different studies demonstrated that long-term nutritional inter- ventions are effective in achieving a structural and functional modulation of the gm in t2d patients favouring the recovery of the host metabolic homeostasis.23-25interestingly the gm has been recently demonstrated to be a fast responder to short-term 5-day dietary interventions in a very diet-specific manner.1826 thus to explore the possibility of a short- term modulation of the gm dysbiosis in metabolic diseases here we investigate the impact of short-term nutritional interventions on thegm composition and function in 12 subjects affected by reactive hypoglycemia rh a metabolic disorder that provokes severe hypo- glycemic episodes after meals.

according to our findings the 2 intervention groups showed no separation in the pcoa space p value  0.1 permutation test with pseudo f ratio indicating a comparable gm profile of rh patients at the enrollment supplementary figure 1. with the purpose to investigate whether bmi had an impact on the pre-intervention gm structure of rh subjects we compared the gm profiles at t0 between normal weight 4 patients bmi range 21.7-23.2 kgm2and overweight 8 patients bmi range 26.0-37.4 kgm2 rh patients.no significant segregation p value  0.2 permutation test with pseudo f ratio of the gm compositional structures according to bmi was observed supplementary figure 2. the gm ecosystem of the 12 rh patients was dominated by firmicutes 78.2 and bacteroidetes 14.9 while actinobacteria 5.9 and proteobacteria 0.6 were subdominant components.

this suggests that short-term dietary interventions are not sufficient to overcome the individuality of the gm layout contrary to what observed for lon- ger dietary intervention periods where a compositional convergence according to the diet regimen was detected.23 interestingly the 3-daydietary intervention with the ma-pi 2 diet resulted in a greater gmdynamic response in terms of structure variation compared with cmed while a minimal level of fluctuation was observed in control healthyfigure 1 principal coordinates analysis of the gm variation in response to short-term dietary interventions.

the fact that before dietary treatment no differences in the gm compositional structure were observed between rh patients assigned to the 2 inter- vention groups supports the reliability of the different behaviour of the respective gm structures according to the diet intervention.strikingly the 3-day intervention with the ma-pi 2 diet was enough to prompt a functional convergence of the gm ecosystem in terms of production of acetate propionate and butyrate reaching higher absolute values compared with the other study groups.

in order to assess whether the rh subjects assigned to the 2 dietary intervention groups had a comparable gm structure at the enrollment we performed a pcoa based on bray-curtis distances of their respective gm compositionaltable 1 daily intake of energy and macronutrients fat protein carbohydrate and fibre of rh patients for both short-term dietary interventions ma-pi 2 and cmed and healthy controls following a free mediterranean diet.

finally because the majority of the gm compositional variation in response to the short-term dietary interventions was expressed by the mds2 axis of the pcoa plot in order to compare the magnitude of the gm response to the short-term dietary challenge we calculated the distance between t1 and t0 samples on mds2 for all study groups figure 2. only the ma-pi 2 diet resulted in a significantly higher change of mds2 coordinates between t0 and t1 compared with free mediterranean diet group p value  0.03 wilcoxon signed rank sum test.

in addition 7 healthy people following a constant free mediterranean diet were followed for gm composition and function for 3 days allowing us to monitor the basal level of the short-term physiological gm fluctuation in the absence of any dietary changes.

results  gut microbiome response to short-term dietary interventionswith the purpose to explore the phylogenetic variation of the gm after short-term nutritional interventions in subjects affected by rh in this retrospective observational study we analysed the stool sam- ples collected from 12 rh patients before t0 and after t1 3 days of dietary intervention.

changes in the scfa production in response to the short-term dietary interventionswe explored the impact of the short-term dietary changes on the gm metabolic functionality by assessing variations in the pattern of scfa production.

according to our data only the ma-pi 2 short-term dietary intervention was successful in increasing the production of scfas acetic acid 77 propionic acid68 and butyric acid 165 p value  0.01 wilcoxon signed rank sum test while no variation was observed for cmed and free mediterranean diet groups table 3. taken together these findings suggest the potential of the short-term ma-pi 2 dietary intervention to favour a functional convergence of the gm ecosystem of the enrolled patients that still preserving the individual ecosystem layout witness an increased production of acetate propionate and butyrate.

aiming at highlighting compo- sitional differences in the gm between rh patients and healthy con- trols we computed a pcoa based on bray-curtis distances of their respective gm phylogenetic profiles at t0.

our data demonstrate a significant separation of the gm compositional structures between the 2 groups p value  0.04 permutation test with pseudo f ratio supplementary figure 3. specifically rh subjects were enriched in veillonellaceae and streptococcaceae and depleted in lachnospiraceae and bifidobacteriaceae.with the aim to explore the short-term variation in the gmcompositional structure in the 2 study groups ma-pi 2 and cmed a pcoa based on bray-curtis distances of the patient gm ecosystem profiles obtained at t0 and t1 was performed.

specifically the short- term nutritional intervention does not drive to a diet-specific gm compositional convergence but rather for both ma-pi 2 and cmed diets the individual gm fingerprint leads to an individual specific response to the short-term diet intervention.

differently the cmed diet mainly results in changes in abundance ofsecondary fermenters as dorea of generalist gm components as bacteroides and minor microbiota members such as campylobacter brenneria and veillonella.interestingly when measuring the short-term gm dynamics inhealthy subjects under constant mediterranean diet we observed a little ecosystem variation in the period of 3 days figure 1c.
