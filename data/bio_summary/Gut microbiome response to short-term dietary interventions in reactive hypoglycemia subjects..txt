Specifically propionate can regulate the de novo proliferation of T-reg cells and jointly with acetate drive their homing in the colon.12 On the other hand butyrate exerts a protective role on the gut epithelium as it stim- ulates the release of mucins13 and has a local immunomodulatory func- tion regulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.1415Finally butyrate can control both the extrathymic T-reg production13and the differentiation of colonic T-regs.16When the GM is challenged with pressure deriving from the environment it is able to reconfigure itself in different steady states resulting in an adaptive response that maintains host health and pre- serves homeostasis.17 One of the major factors resulting in these adap- tive GM changes is diet.18 However in certain circumstances such as a high-fat high-sugar diet typical of Western countries diet can have adeleterious impact on the GM-host mutualism19 forcing ecosystemdysbiosis which can contribute to the onset of metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes T2D.20-22 Indeed the faecal microbiota in T2D subjects consuming a high-fat high-sugar diet is characterized by a lower biodiversity and an increased amount of pro-inflammatory microorganisms in comparison to healthy peo- ple.23 For this reason the GM has been recently considered a target for the control of T2D and other metabolic disorders.24 In this sce- nario different studies demonstrated that long-term nutritional inter- ventions are effective in achieving a structural and functional modulation of the GM in T2D patients favouring the recovery of the host metabolic homeostasis.23-25Interestingly the GM has been recently demonstrated to be a fast responder to short-term 5-day dietary interventions in a very diet-specific manner.1826 Thus to explore the possibility of a short- term modulation of the GM dysbiosis in metabolic diseases here we investigate the impact of short-term nutritional interventions on theGM composition and function in 12 subjects affected by reactive hypoglycemia RH a metabolic disorder that provokes severe hypo- glycemic episodes after meals.

With the purpose to investigate whether BMI had an impact on the pre-intervention GM structure of RH subjects we compared the GM profiles at T0 between normal weight 4 patients BMI range 21.7-23.2 kgm2and overweight 8 patients BMI range 26.0-37.4 kgm2 RH patients.No significant segregation P value  0.2 permutation test with pseudo F ratio of the GM compositional structures according to BMI was observed Supplementary Figure 2.

The fact that before dietary treatment no differences in the GM compositional structure were observed between RH patients assigned to the 2 inter- vention groups supports the reliability of the different behaviour of the respective GM structures according to the diet intervention.Strikingly the 3-day intervention with the Ma-Pi 2 diet was enough to prompt a functional convergence of the GM ecosystem in terms of production of acetate propionate and butyrate reaching higher absolute values compared with the other study groups.

In addition 7 healthy people following a constant free Mediterranean diet were followed for GM composition and function for 3 days allowing us to monitor the basal level of the short-term physiological GM fluctuation in the absence of any dietary changes.

In order to assess whether the RH subjects assigned to the 2 dietary intervention groups had a comparable GM structure at the enrollment we performed a PCoA based on Bray-Curtis distances of their respective GM compositionalTABLE 1 Daily intake of energy and macronutrients fat protein carbohydrate and fibre of RH patients for both short-term dietary interventions Ma-Pi 2 and cMed and healthy controls following a free Mediterranean diet.

Aiming at highlighting compo- sitional differences in the GM between RH patients and healthy con- trols we computed a PCoA based on Bray-Curtis distances of their respective GM phylogenetic profiles at T0.

Specifically the short- term nutritional intervention does not drive to a diet-specific GM compositional convergence but rather for both Ma-Pi 2 and cMed diets the individual GM fingerprint leads to an individual specific response to the short-term diet intervention.

Differently the cMed diet mainly results in changes in abundance ofsecondary fermenters as Dorea of generalist GM components as Bacteroides and minor microbiota members such as Campylobacter Brenneria and Veillonella.Interestingly when measuring the short-term GM dynamics inhealthy subjects under constant Mediterranean diet we observed a little ecosystem variation in the period of 3 days Figure 1C.

Finally because the majority of the GM compositional variation in response to the short-term dietary interventions was expressed by the MDS2 axis of the PCoA plot in order to compare the magnitude of the GM response to the short-term dietary challenge we calculated the distance between T1 and T0 samples on MDS2 for all study groups Figure 2.
