These findings not only broaden the potential clinical utility of TMAO as an independent prognostic marker to those presenting with sus- pected ACS but also suggest in combination with the recent studies linking this metabolite to platelet function a potential basis for a novel therapeutic target in the management of ACS patients.In the quest to improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular heart disease which still remains the leading cause of death world--.are unclear but it is noteworthy that the negative studies have tended.to be both smaller than comparable alternative positive studies and in.general to have lower event rates and often TMAO levels..Interestingly a recent large n  1000 clinical study exploring the prog-.nostic value of TMAO in subjects on haemodialysis observed that the.strength of the association between TMAO and adverse events dif-.fered somewhat by race with whites showing a significant association.between higher TMAO levels and heightened incident risk of cardiac.death sudden cardiac death first cardiovascular event and any-cause.death whereas in blacks elevated TMAO levels were only significantly.associated with cardiac death.It is also noteworthy that in an alterna-.tive recent study genetic variants in the flavin monooxygenase 3 gene.the host hepatic enzyme primarily responsible for conversion of TMA.into TMAOwere reported to be associated with both rate of chronic.kidney disease progression and mortality risk in patients with impaired.renal function.Trimethylamine N-oxide exerts pro-atherosclerotic.effects via a variety of effects including changes in macrophage and tis-.sue sterol metabolism and endothelial cell activation.

The inclusion of TMAO as a variable resulted.in a significant improvement in risk estimation over traditional risk.factors for MACE at 30 days as monitored by net reclassification im-.provement NRI 0.36 0.19-0.53 P  0.001 C statistic 0.94 0.92-.0.96 with TMAO vs. 0.92 0.88-0.96 without TMAO P  0.05.and similar results at 6 months NRI 0.34 0.17-0.5 P  0.001.C statistic 0.92 0.9-0.94 vs. 0.91 0.87-0.95 P  0.08 and 7-year.mortality NRI 0.52 0.33-0.71 P  0.001 C statistic 0.82 0.78-.0.86 vs. 0.81 0.77-0.85 P  0.09 Supplementary material online.Table S2.The relation of trimethylamine N-oxide levels and incident major adverse cardiovascular events risks among patients initially negative for troponin T at presentationGiven the recent demonstration that TMAO impacts platelet func- tion fostering hyperreactivity and enhanced thrombosis potential we sought to evaluate whether knowledge of TMAO levels at initial presentation may provide added potential clinical utility in risk stratifi- cation among patients initially cTnT negative at presentation.

The 5-95 confidence interval is indicated by line length.elevated levels of TMAO remained a significant predictor of MACE Q4 adjusted HR 1.57 95 CI 1.03-2.41 P  0.05 while the associ- ation of TMAO levels with mortality was attenuated following the adjustments Figure C and D. The inclusion of TMAO as a variable to the model prediction of MACE resulted in a significant improvement in risk estimation over traditional risk factors NRI 0.3 0.16-0.44 P  0.001 but no significant improvement in C-statistic C-statistic 0.66 0.62-0.7 with TMAO vs. 0.64 0.6-0.68 without TMAO P 0.15.

Inclusion of TMAO in the model for predicting 1-year mortality resulted in significant improvement in NRI 0.45 0.25-0.65 P  0.001 but no significant improvement in C-statistic 0.78 0.72-0.84.with TMAO vs. 0.77 0.71-0.83 without TMAO P  0.26.Supplemental material online Table S2..Plasma TMAO levels were higher on average in the Cleveland.cohort compared with the Swiss cohort and the quartile cut-offs.used for each cohort were thus different.

Of the initial 530 patients 112 were TnT-.positive cTnT  0.1 ngmL at initial presentation baseline and the 418.initially negative for cTnT were monitored for outcomes MACE  MIpathogenesis of both atherosclerotic heart diseaseand its adverse .thrombotic events.Trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO is a plasma metabolite shown to be formed through a metaorganismal pathway involving nutrient precursors abundant in a Western diet choline phosphatidylcholine and L-carnitine and the sequential action of both gut microbiota initially forming trimethylamine TMA followed by host hepatic flavin monooxygenase-dependent conversion into trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO.Numerous studies reveal an as- sociation between systemic TMAO levels and cardiovascular risks in a variety of stable cohorts.--The relationship between TMAO levels and incident risks in sub- jects with acute coronary syndromes has not yet been examined.

This is particularly relevant given that recent human platelet and ani- mal model studies reveal that TMAO interacts with platelets altering stimulus-dependent calcium signalling fostering platelet hyperreactiv- ity and enhanced thrombosis potential in vivo.Numerous studies have reported platelet hyperreactivity is a risk factor for incident car- diovascular events.Trimethylamine N-oxide was also recently shown in animal models to promote vascular inflammation inducing aortic endothelial cell activation and up-regulation of adhesion pro- teins.Finally recent clinical studies have shown that elevated sys- temic levels of TMAO among stable subjects n  4007 undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations predict incident thrombotic.stroke need for revascularization or death at 1 month and 6 month and.all-cause mortality annually in the continuing TMAO study.
