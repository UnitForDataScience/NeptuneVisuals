these findings not only broaden the potential clinical utility of tmao as an independent prognostic marker to those presenting with sus- pected acs but also suggest in combination with the recent studies linking this metabolite to platelet function a potential basis for a novel therapeutic target in the management of acs patients.in the quest to improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular heart disease which still remains the leading cause of death world--.are unclear but it is noteworthy that the negative studies have tended.to be both smaller than comparable alternative positive studies and in.general to have lower event rates and often tmao levels..interestingly a recent large n  1000 clinical study exploring the prog-.nostic value of tmao in subjects on haemodialysis observed that the.strength of the association between tmao and adverse events dif-.fered somewhat by race with whites showing a significant association.between higher tmao levels and heightened incident risk of cardiac.death sudden cardiac death first cardiovascular event and any-cause.death whereas in blacks elevated tmao levels were only significantly.associated with cardiac death.it is also noteworthy that in an alterna-.tive recent study genetic variants in the flavin monooxygenase 3 gene.the host hepatic enzyme primarily responsible for conversion of tma.into tmaowere reported to be associated with both rate of chronic.kidney disease progression and mortality risk in patients with impaired.renal function.trimethylamine n-oxide exerts pro-atherosclerotic.effects via a variety of effects including changes in macrophage and tis-.sue sterol metabolism and endothelial cell activation.

this is particularly relevant given that recent human platelet and ani- mal model studies reveal that tmao interacts with platelets altering stimulus-dependent calcium signalling fostering platelet hyperreactiv- ity and enhanced thrombosis potential in vivo.numerous studies have reported platelet hyperreactivity is a risk factor for incident car- diovascular events.trimethylamine n-oxide was also recently shown in animal models to promote vascular inflammation inducing aortic endothelial cell activation and up-regulation of adhesion pro- teins.finally recent clinical studies have shown that elevated sys- temic levels of tmao among stable subjects n  4007 undergoing elective diagnostic cardiac evaluations predict incident thrombotic.stroke need for revascularization or death at 1 month and 6 month and.all-cause mortality annually in the continuing tmao study.
