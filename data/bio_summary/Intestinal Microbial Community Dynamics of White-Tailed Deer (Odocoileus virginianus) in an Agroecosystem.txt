Further stud- ies evaluating the microbiota in other seasons would be im- portant to evaluate the seasonal dynamics and to determine deer intestinal microbiota stability which can enable detection of when the community is in dysbiosis.We hypothesized that demographic factors such as sex levels of host genetic relatedness and spatial locations would have an effect on deer intestinal microbiota diversity and com- position however results showed no significant difference of the microbiota associated with sex and host genetic related- ness.

This observed microbial compositional shift to a Proteobacteria dominant community has been seen before in murine model individuals treated with antibi- otics  and in calves antibiotics have shown to impact the composition of fecal microbiota  however livestock in KBS were not reported to be under antibiotic treatment.Analyses comparing microbial communities in March and June showed that microbiota diversity and composition changed between seasons.

Previous studies in humans and model organisms have shown that the intestinal microbi- ota is distinct from the microbiota of the mouth and stomach however intestinal microbiota has been shown to be more similar to fecal microbiota .

Similarly the presence of some pathogens has been linked to reductions in the microbiota diversity by displacing the niche of commensal mi- croorganisms    while other pathogens contribute to an overgrowth of less beneficial phyla like Proteobacteria .Unlike humans and domestic animals few studies have been conducted to examine the intestinal microbiota compo- sition in different wildlife species and to identify factors that impact compositional changes.

In our previous microbial studies of wildlife we also used fecal material as a viable sampling source to char- acterize the presence of pathogens such as diarrheagenic Escherichia coli .Given that the intestinal microbiota has been shown to be important for maintaining host health  there has recently been a marked increase in the number of studies that have characterized the intestinal microbiota of different species.

Thus in this study we sought to characterize microbial community diversity and composition of fecal samples collected from white-tailed deer using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing and to compare the micro- bial diversity and composition among samples as a function of sampling period Marchwinter vs Junesummer sex levels of host genetic relatedness and spatial location.

The rarefaction plot of the Shannon alpha diversity showed that microbial communities of Salmonella-positive samples were less diverse than negative samples from June mean diversity positive  5.04 nega- tive  5.56.

This study's main findings revealed that deer intestinal microbial diversity and composi- tion appear to be influenced by season and vary with the presence of diarrheagenic E. coli and Salmonella.Our results showed that the intestinal microbiota of deer is composed primarily of three phyla Firmicutes Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes.

Nevertheless there is a lack of knowledge of white-tailed deer intestinal microbiota diversity and taxonomic composition.

Consequently studies in humans and animals have used fecal samples as a non-invasive sampling approach to gain insights into factors asso- ciated with intestinal microbiota diversity and composition  .
