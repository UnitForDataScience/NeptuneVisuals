further stud- ies evaluating the microbiota in other seasons would be im- portant to evaluate the seasonal dynamics and to determine deer intestinal microbiota stability which can enable detection of when the community is in dysbiosis.we hypothesized that demographic factors such as sex levels of host genetic relatedness and spatial locations would have an effect on deer intestinal microbiota diversity and com- position however results showed no significant difference of the microbiota associated with sex and host genetic related- ness.

this observed microbial compositional shift to a proteobacteria dominant community has been seen before in murine model individuals treated with antibi- otics  and in calves antibiotics have shown to impact the composition of fecal microbiota  however livestock in kbs were not reported to be under antibiotic treatment.analyses comparing microbial communities in march and june showed that microbiota diversity and composition changed between seasons.

similarly analyses comparing the composition and relative abundance of taxa between sexes were not signif- icantly different anosim r  0.001 p  0.05 and no significant association was observed between sexes by sam- pling periods march and june separately data not shown.inter-individual genetic relatedness between deer hosts was not correlated with the microbiota composition mantel r  0.099 p  0.05. by sampling period results showed no significant association between microbiota taxonomic compo- sition and inter-individual host relatedness in march mantel r  0.084 p  0.05 and in june the correlation was signifi- cant but the r value was close to 0 mantel r  0.013 p  0.05.significant correlation was observed between spatial loca- tion and microbial composition when analyses were conduct- ed by sampling period mantel march r  0.309 p  0.05 june r  0.126 p  0.05.correlation between pathogen presence and deer microbiota profilestwenty of the 66 samples 30.3 were positive for at least one of the four pathogens examined two samples were posi- tive for ehec 14 were positive for epec 8 atypical and 6fig.

the mean shannon alpha diversity index from march samples was 6.79 and only three samples had a diversity index less than 6. the mean shannon alpha diversity index for samples from june was 5.64.pcoa also revealed that the microbial communities of samples collected in june were taxonomically more differentiated than samples collected in march which tended to cluster close together fig.

previous studies in humans and model organisms have shown that the intestinal microbi- ota is distinct from the microbiota of the mouth and stomach however intestinal microbiota has been shown to be more similar to fecal microbiota .

in our previous microbial studies of wildlife we also used fecal material as a viable sampling source to char- acterize the presence of pathogens such as diarrheagenic escherichia coli .given that the intestinal microbiota has been shown to be important for maintaining host health  there has recently been a marked increase in the number of studies that have characterized the intestinal microbiota of different species.

similarly the presence of some pathogens has been linked to reductions in the microbiota diversity by displacing the niche of commensal mi- croorganisms    while other pathogens contribute to an overgrowth of less beneficial phyla like proteobacteria .unlike humans and domestic animals few studies have been conducted to examine the intestinal microbiota compo- sition in different wildlife species and to identify factors that impact compositional changes.

this study's main findings revealed that deer intestinal microbial diversity and composi- tion appear to be influenced by season and vary with the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli and salmonella.our results showed that the intestinal microbiota of deer is composed primarily of three phyla firmicutes proteobacteria and bacteroidetes.

thus in this study we sought to characterize microbial community diversity and composition of fecal samples collected from white-tailed deer using 16s rdna pyrosequencing and to compare the micro- bial diversity and composition among samples as a function of sampling period marchwinter vs junesummer sex levels of host genetic relatedness and spatial location.

the rarefaction plot of the shannon alpha diversity showed that microbial communities of salmonella-positive samples were less diverse than negative samples from june mean diversity positive  5.04 nega- tive  5.56. when comparing the composition of the 10 most abundant bacteria genera in salmonella infected and non- infected samples the prevalence of the most predominant ge- nus ruminococcaceae family was lower average nega- tive  33 positive  26 in samples with salmonella.

different parts of an organism are characterized by distinct microbial taxonomic composition based on the source of acquisition resource availability and microbiota function .

still in few studies conducted on wildlife species microbiota has been shown to include novel microbial species increasing interest in investigating these wild hosts .

results from these eight individuals confirm the dy- namic nature of microbial communities as all eight individ- uals showed temporal shifts in their microbial community composition fig.
