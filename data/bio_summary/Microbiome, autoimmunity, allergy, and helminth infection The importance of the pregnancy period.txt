Differences in gut microbiome be- tween normal and obese pregnant women suggest that the microbiome might be important in weight management during pregnancy.36-38 The changes observed in women during T3 of pregnancy with increasedlevels of Enterobacteriaceae and reduced bacterial diversity are similar to those of the obesity-associated microbiome shown to be more ef- ficient at energy extraction.39 Furthermore after transferred the gut microbiome of T3 into bacteria-free mice the animals developed signs of metabolic syndrome including weight gain but these changes might be beneficial in expectant women to support the growth of the fetus.64  THE MATERNAL MICROBIOME SETSTHE OFFSPRING'S MICROBIAL STRUCTURE The composition of the mother's microbiome and other perinatal fac- tors play an important role in the microbial colonization of the infant gut.4041 The transfer of T3 maternal microbiota may prevent the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as Ureaplasma urealyticum which are related to an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.42 Meanwhile the delivery mode may also shape the acquisition and structure of the initial microbiota in newborns.40 The vaginally delivered infants acquire microbes resembling their mother's vaginal microbiome while cesarean-delivered infants harbor bacterial communities similar to those found on the maternal skin surface.40 The size and gestational age of the neonate also influences the com- position of the infant microbiome.

found that the mice infected with the human periodontal pathogens Campylobacter rectus and Porphyromonas gingivalis had decreased fecundity and increased resorption.31 These studies demonstrate that the oral cavity plays an important role in preterm birth.The gut microbiome not only influences the host metabolism but also associates with preterm premature rupture of membranes which causes one-third of preterm births and contributes to significant peri- natal morbidity and mortality.3233  Cardiometabolic complications of pregnancyThe gut microbiome could influence on metabolic processes such as energy harvest energy expenditure and fat storage which contrib- utes to obesity and its comorbidities such as insulin resistance diabe- tes and cardiovascular disease.34 The gut microbiota may affect host metabolism by altering adipose tissue inflammation since by feeding lipopolysaccharide to mice the adipose tissue inflammation increased and the insulin sensitivity reduced.18 The gut microbiome from women who developed gestational diabetes has the least diversity during the T1 of pregnancy.6 There is mounting evidence indicating that the gut microbiota may be a target for treating metabolic diseases.35 The therapies can include supplementing the diet with non-digestible food ingredients or pre-biotics which stimulate the expansion of specific microbes to improve metabolic regulation.

Dysbiosis of the gut is associated with several disease states including inflammatory bowel disease IBD in which the loss of mucosal tolerance toward the commensal microbiota results in ulcerative inflammatory responses.66 Likewise dysbiotic in- testinal microbiota is associated with RA and is found in genetically RA- susceptible murine models.67 Besides oral commensals are also were found to be associated with RA.56 A recent study indicated that pso- riasis is also triggered by dysbiotic microbiota.68 Although the mecha- nisms of human microbiome influencing the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases remain to be determined evidence from animal models of autoimmune diseases demonstrates that local and systemic bidirectional interactions with the microbiome may play a signaling or promoting role through the immune system.69 Altogether the complex interaction between the human body and its microbiome affect our health and disease as presented here in the context of autoimmunity.

Many factors are important in pathogenesis of these diseases such as lifestyle changes exposure to pollutants drugs and changes in nutri- tion.70 Limited microbial exposure in developed countries has also been suggested to underlie the allergy development.7071 Recent studies indi- cate that a low intestinal microbial diversity during the first month of life is associated with subsequent atopic eczema and asthma.7273 It seems that bacterial diversity might be more important than specific bacteria taxa.Furthermore there is a strong evidence suggesting that the ma- ternal microbiota during pregnancy has long-lasting influences on the offspring's microbial structure and subsequently on its susceptibility to diseases.74 Prospective studies indicate that the gut microbiota composition during the first months of life influences allergy devel- opment7275 and support the theory that factors influencing the early maturation of the immune system might be important for subsequent allergic disease.76 An experimental piglet model reported that estab- lishment and development of the normal gut microbiota and immune system seem to require continuous microbial exposure during the early stages of life and that this process is compromised under condi- tions of excessive hygiene.77 Moreover altering the intestinal microbi- ota during a critical development window in early life using low-dose antibiotics also induces long-term host metabolic effects in a murine mode.78 Antibiotic treatment during pregnancy is also associated with asthma in the offspring.79 However recent study demonstrates that prenatal supplementation seems to be even more crucial for the pre- ventive effect of probiotics on infant eczema.7580 Hence it seems that the pre- and postnatal environment may represent a window of oppor- tunity for allergy and asthma intervention.Until recently it has been speculated that the presentation of ma- ternal bacterial components to the fetus during pregnancy is very im- portant for the maturation of the immune system and the induction of oral tolerance to allergens.81 A study on human newborns shows that bacterial DNA in amniotic fluid and in the placenta can affect TLR gene expression in the fetal intestine collected at elective cesarean section.82 Furthermore exposure to A. lwoffii during gestation resulted in a sup- pression of TLR expression in placental tissue in a mice asthma model.83 The prenatal programming of the immune system by the maternal bac- terial components may be required for a tolerogenic immune response to the abundant bacterial load occurring immediately after birth.7  HELMINTH INFECTION DURING PREGNANCY Approximately one-third of the world's population is infected withhelminths the majority of whom reside in the poorest communities ofthe developing world.

examined the vaginal microbiome longitudinally during pregnancy at the posterior fornix and also found the predominance of Lactobacillus species in normal pregnancy suggesting the relationship between vaginal micro- biome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.13When the T1 and T3 microbiotas were transferred into germ- free wild-type mice levels of inflammation markers were significantly higher in the stool and cecal samples from the T3 sample recipients compared to those of T1 recipients.6 Furthermore the T3 recipients have reduced oral glucose tolerance and more adiposity gains indi- cating that the T3 microbiota particularly has the capacity to induce metabolic changes in the host.3  THE MICROBIOME AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES There is growing evidence that the maternal microbiome plays an important role in pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth car- diometabolic complications of pregnancy and gestational weight gain.characterized by the deficiency of Lactobacillus species.2728 A recent study by Hyman et al.29 has examined the vaginal microbiome in pre- term birth and found that the high-risk subjects previous unexplained preterm birth has a lower prevalence of lactobacilli when compared with low-risk subjects all other gravid.

The results suggests that filarial infection during pregnancy leads to an expansion of func- tionally active regulatory T cells that keep Th1 and Th17 in check.97 It also has been demonstrated that cord blood exposure to parasite an- tigens from the helminth-infected mother induces a Th2-predominant response.89 The lack of an optimal Th1 response leads to impaired im- munity to helminth and mycobacterial infection.A study showed an inverse association between helminth parasites at delivery and infantile eczema and hypothesized that maternal hel- minth infection protects against infantile eczema and this protection would be modified by deworming.988  CONCLUSIONS The maternal microbiome is being shown to play a critical role in the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes that greatly influence the health of the neonate and infant.

have reported on a profound alteration of the gut microbiota changes during pregnancy by charactering the fecal bacteria of 91 pregnant women which have variable pre-pregnancy body mass index BMI and gestational diabetes status and their chil- dren.6 The gut microbiotas during the first trimester T1 are similar to one another but the phylogenetic composition and structure shift substantially over the course of pregnancy.

Recently it has been suggested that the microbiome undergoes profound changes during pregnancy that are associated with host physiological and im- munological adaptations.6 It also has been proposed that microbiome remodeling during pregnancy is an active response of the mother pos- sibly to alter immune system status and to facilitate metabolic and immunological adaptations which are needed for a successful preg- nancy.7 Furthermore the profound immunological adaptations during and after pregnancy have an influence on maternal autoimmune diseases in several ways.89 However the underlying mechanisms of pregnancy-related microbiome are not well understood.
