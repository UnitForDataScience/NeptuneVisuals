differences in gut microbiome be- tween normal and obese pregnant women suggest that the microbiome might be important in weight management during pregnancy.36-38 the changes observed in women during t3 of pregnancy with increasedlevels of enterobacteriaceae and reduced bacterial diversity are similar to those of the obesity-associated microbiome shown to be more ef- ficient at energy extraction.39 furthermore after transferred the gut microbiome of t3 into bacteria-free mice the animals developed signs of metabolic syndrome including weight gain but these changes might be beneficial in expectant women to support the growth of the fetus.64  the maternal microbiome setsthe offspring's microbial structure the composition of the mother's microbiome and other perinatal fac- tors play an important role in the microbial colonization of the infant gut.4041 the transfer of t3 maternal microbiota may prevent the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria such as ureaplasma urealyticum which are related to an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.42 meanwhile the delivery mode may also shape the acquisition and structure of the initial microbiota in newborns.40 the vaginally delivered infants acquire microbes resembling their mother's vaginal microbiome while cesarean-delivered infants harbor bacterial communities similar to those found on the maternal skin surface.40 the size and gestational age of the neonate also influences the com- position of the infant microbiome.

examined the vaginal microbiome longitudinally during pregnancy at the posterior fornix and also found the predominance of lactobacillus species in normal pregnancy suggesting the relationship between vaginal micro- biome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.13when the t1 and t3 microbiotas were transferred into germ- free wild-type mice levels of inflammation markers were significantly higher in the stool and cecal samples from the t3 sample recipients compared to those of t1 recipients.6 furthermore the t3 recipients have reduced oral glucose tolerance and more adiposity gains indi- cating that the t3 microbiota particularly has the capacity to induce metabolic changes in the host.3  the microbiome and pregnancy outcomes there is growing evidence that the maternal microbiome plays an important role in pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth car- diometabolic complications of pregnancy and gestational weight gain.characterized by the deficiency of lactobacillus species.2728 a recent study by hyman et al.29 has examined the vaginal microbiome in pre- term birth and found that the high-risk subjects previous unexplained preterm birth has a lower prevalence of lactobacilli when compared with low-risk subjects all other gravid.

recently it has been suggested that the microbiome undergoes profound changes during pregnancy that are associated with host physiological and im- munological adaptations.6 it also has been proposed that microbiome remodeling during pregnancy is an active response of the mother pos- sibly to alter immune system status and to facilitate metabolic and immunological adaptations which are needed for a successful preg- nancy.7 furthermore the profound immunological adaptations during and after pregnancy have an influence on maternal autoimmune diseases in several ways.89 however the underlying mechanisms of pregnancy-related microbiome are not well understood.

1 of 7published by john wiley  sons ltd2  alterations to the microbiome during pregnancy during a normal and healthy pregnancy the body undergoes a spec- trum of hormonal immunological and metabolic changes.1011 these changes are accompanied by concomitant changes in the microbiome especially in the vagina and gut.61213 the gut microbiota which is  preterm birththe vaginal microbiome influences the risk of preterm birth.

found that the mice infected with the human periodontal pathogens campylobacter rectus and porphyromonas gingivalis had decreased fecundity and increased resorption.31 these studies demonstrate that the oral cavity plays an important role in preterm birth.the gut microbiome not only influences the host metabolism but also associates with preterm premature rupture of membranes which causes one-third of preterm births and contributes to significant peri- natal morbidity and mortality.3233  cardiometabolic complications of pregnancythe gut microbiome could influence on metabolic processes such as energy harvest energy expenditure and fat storage which contrib- utes to obesity and its comorbidities such as insulin resistance diabe- tes and cardiovascular disease.34 the gut microbiota may affect host metabolism by altering adipose tissue inflammation since by feeding lipopolysaccharide to mice the adipose tissue inflammation increased and the insulin sensitivity reduced.18 the gut microbiome from women who developed gestational diabetes has the least diversity during the t1 of pregnancy.6 there is mounting evidence indicating that the gut microbiota may be a target for treating metabolic diseases.35 the therapies can include supplementing the diet with non-digestible food ingredients or pre-biotics which stimulate the expansion of specific microbes to improve metabolic regulation.

dysbiosis of the gut is associated with several disease states including inflammatory bowel disease ibd in which the loss of mucosal tolerance toward the commensal microbiota results in ulcerative inflammatory responses.66 likewise dysbiotic in- testinal microbiota is associated with ra and is found in genetically ra- susceptible murine models.67 besides oral commensals are also were found to be associated with ra.56 a recent study indicated that pso- riasis is also triggered by dysbiotic microbiota.68 although the mecha- nisms of human microbiome influencing the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases remain to be determined evidence from animal models of autoimmune diseases demonstrates that local and systemic bidirectional interactions with the microbiome may play a signaling or promoting role through the immune system.69 altogether the complex interaction between the human body and its microbiome affect our health and disease as presented here in the context of autoimmunity.

the microbiome of breastfed infants is characterized by higher abundance of bifidobacteria while for the infants who are exclusively fed formula e. coli clostridium difficile bacteroides fragilis and lactobacilli remain predominant.415  microbiome and autoimmunity during pregnancy autoimmune diseases include more than 70 different disorders affect- ing approximately 5 of the population of the western countries.44 most autoimmune diseases more frequently occur in women than in men.

pregnancy woman with multiple sclero- sis ms typically have reduced relapse rate in the latter half of preg- nancy whereas disease activity often returns greater severity after the delivery than in pregnancy.49 in the case of rheumatoid arthritis ra two-thirds of pregnant women also experience an improvement in their ra disease activity.50 for system lupus erythematosus sle the changes in the disease state during pregnancy appear to be more varied.51 thus it can be seen that the relationships between pregnancy and autoimmunity are represented by a bidirectional model.recently it has been reported that the microbiome undergoes pro- found changes during pregnancy that are associated with host phys- iological and immunological adaptations.7 what is more it has been proposed that microbiome remodeling during pregnancy is an active response of the mother possibly to alter immune system status and to facilitate metabolic and immunological adaptations which are import- ant factors for successful pregnancy.7 fetal as well as maternal factors influence the local mucosal immune system so that the fetus is not rejected by the mother.

by the third trimester t3 the between-subject diversity has greatly expanded although the within-subject diversity is reduced.6 as the remodeling of the gut mi- crobiota over the course of pregnancy is not related to diet the gesta- tional diabetes status bmi or treatment with antibiotics other factors such as the host immune or endocrine systems may contribute to the observed shift.another study using 454 pyrosequencing technology revealed that the vaginal microbial community differed in pregnancy by gestational age and proximity to the cervix.12 furthermore although the alpha di- versity was reduced in late gestation the lactobacillus species which play a role in preventing the growth of pathogenic bacteria helping human digestion and shaping the host innate and adaptive immune system responses increased among pregnant individuals compared with non-pregnant subjects.12 recently romero et al.
