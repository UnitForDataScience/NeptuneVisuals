plasma 2-clfa levels for both 2-clpa and 2-clsa seem to reflect the activity of circulating neutrophils since plasma 2-clfa levels were reduced in septic neutropenic subjects table 4. we also tested total and free plasma 2-clfa concentrations in a small number of healthy volun- teers n  4 and observed significantly lower plasma concentrations in nonsepsis controls compared with sepsis survivors and sepsis nonsurvivors nonparametric test of trend p  0.007 for total 2-clpa p  0.003 for free 2-clpa p  0.001 for free 2-clsa 3. in a subgroup analysis of 110 of the subjects with sufficient plasma volume to measure mpo described in 4 we observed a strong correlation between plasma mpo levels and free 2-clfas and a modest correlation between mpo and total 2-clfa levels spearman rank correlation total 2-clpa rho 0.385 p  0.001 free 2-clpa rho 0.402 p  0.001 total 2-clsa rho 0.497 p  0.001 and free 2-clsa rho 0.535 p  0.001. neutropenic subjects had significantly lower plasma levels of mpo p  0.001. however whereas 2-clfa levels were associated with ards and mortality tables 1 and 2 mpo levels for these 110 subjects were not signifi- cantly associated with ards p  0.19 table 1 or mortality p  0.99 table 2. among the small subgroup with neutropenia n  31 plasma 2-clfa concentrations did not differ by ards status and were very similar to control subjects without sepsis 5. plasma 2-clfa concentrations did not distinguish gram-negative bacteria sepsis from non-gram-negative bacteria sepsis 6.multiorgan failure associated with sepsis is mediated by microcirculatory collapse including dysfunc- tion at the blood-endothelial interface where neutrophils interact with endothelial cells leading to injury.

we sought to elucidate one potential mechanism of leukocyte-mediated damage during human sepsis by characterizing the plasma 2-chlorofatty acid 2-clfa profile and testing the clinical prog- nostic utility of plasma 2-clfas for prediction of ards.dysregulated balance between the antimicrobial host defense action of leukocytes and leukocyte-mediated tissue injury characterizes sepsis and may have a key role in sepsis-associated organ failure autopsy specimens from human sepsis patients reveal neutrophil aggregation and infiltration of the kidney and lung and the amount of neutrophil infiltration in ards patients correlates with lung dysfunction moreover the gene expression signature of sepsis-associated ards is dominated by neutrophil-related genes a major antimicrobial mechanism of neutrophil-associated phagosomes is the generation of reactive oxi- dant species myeloperoxidase mpo the most abundant granule protein released from neutrophilsfigure 1. septic patients with ards display higher day 0 plasma concentrations of free 2-clfas.

when exposed to hocl an oxidant specifically generated by mpo the plasmalogen oxidation product formed has been shown to be a corresponding free 2-chlorofatty aldehyde 2-clfald 2-clfalds were among the first chlorinated lipids found in response to both neutrophil and monocyte acti- vation plasmalogens are abundant phospholipids in the heart lung brain kidney and smooth muscle tissues as well as neutrophils monocytes and endothelial cells the vinyl ether-linked aliphatic groups of plasmalo- gens are predominantly 16 and 18 carbons in length which are released as 16and 18 carbon 2-clfald molecular species following hocl targeting subsequent investigations demon- strated that 2-clfalds are oxidized to 2-clfas which can be further metabolized furthermore hocl produced by neutrophils has been shown to target plasmalogen in neighboring endothelial cells and extracellular lipoproteins leading to 2-clfald production and endothelial cells metabolize 2-clfald to 2-clfa which is released from endothelial cells 2-clfalds are short-lived in plasma samples but our group has detected 2-clfas in plasma and demonstrated that plasma 2-clfa levels are elevated in lps-treated rats and in sendai virus-infected mice these rodent studies suggest that chlorinated lipids are a component of the response to bacterial and viral infection.

previous studies have shown local concentrations of 2-clpa produced bytable 4. total and free plasma 2-clfa molecular species levels are significantly lower in neutropenic subjects with sepsistable 5. plasma concentrations of 2-clfa correlate with ang-2 e selectin and soluble thrombomodulinspearman rank correlation rho and p values between plasma endothelial markers and plasma-free 2-clfa molecular species.

taken together these data are consistent with neutrophil activation as a rational mechanism for producing the elevated plasma 2-clfa levels during sepsis.the association of plasma 2-clfa levels with ards as well as with plasma ang-2 levels led to further investigations of the direct role of free 2-clfa on pulmonary microvascular endothelial function.

leukocyte-mediated chlorinated lipid products have been shown to be biologically active species capable of causing cardiac contractile dysfunction nf-kb signaling in endothelial cells endoplasmic reticulum stress hydrogen peroxide production and apoptosis accordingly the pres- ent study was designed to investigate the role of 2-clfas in human sepsis with a focus on ards given evidence for the contribution of neutrophils to ards resultsto test the hypothesis that 2-clfa levels are associated with outcomes in human sepsis plasma samples were collected upon intensive care unit icu admission day 0 from 198 sequential subjects enrolled in the molecular epidemiology of sepsis in the icu messi cohort see for mes- si study population characteristics supplemental material available online with this article https informed consent was obtained from patients or their proxies as previously described plasma was examined for two molecular species of both free unesterified 2-clfa and total esterified  unesterified 2-clfa content 2-chloropalmitic acid 2-clpa and 2-chlo- rostearic acid 2-clsa by stable isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry.

these molecular species were chosen because they represent the major aliphatic groups derived from plasmalogens in mammali- an tissues additionally free and total 2-clfa were determined to assess short and long half-life forms of 2-clfa respectively admission plasma levels of both free and total 2-clfas were higher in subjects who developed ards median 2-clsa 1.12 nm interquartile range iqr 0.48-2.54 nm compared with median 0.43 nm iqr 0.22-0.98 nm for non-ards p  0.001 or who died withintable 1. day 0 plasma 2-clfa concentrations associate with ardsthe odds for ards increase significantly among 198 subjects with sepsis for each log increase in free or total 2-clpa or 2-clsa independent of apache iii score age sex european descent or pulmonary source of infection.

the development of ards accounted for 41-51 of the mortality risk of higher 2-clfa levels.to test whether admission plasma concentrations of 2-clfa had incremental value for predicting ards among septic subjects we calculated receiver operating characteristic roc curves and assessed the area under the roc curve auroc for predicting ards based on the apache iii score alone or in combination with plasma 2-clfa concentrations 2. the addition of free 2-clsa levels to apache iii improved the auroc from 0.66 95 ci 0.59 0.74 to 0.76 95 ci 0.69 0.82 a signifi- cant improvement p  0.0042. using the 50th percentile of free 2-clsa as a threshold the net reclassifi- cation index for ards was 0.17 compared with apache iii score alone p  0.026 and the integrated discrimination improvement idi was 11 p  0.001. results were similar for the predictive utility of free 2-clpa concentrations compared with apache score alone.

we measured plasma concentrations of angiopoietin-2 ang-2 vwf e selectin soluble thrombomod- ulin stm and soluble icam-1 sicam-1 in messi subjects to determine the degree of correlation between markers of endothelial activation and plasma 2-clfa concentrations.

several soluble factors indi- cating blood-endothelial interface dysfunction including ang-2 e selectin and stm were correlated with 2-clpa or 2-clsa though the degree of correlation was very weak to weak rho 0.16-0.27 table 5. in contrast plasma levels of vwf and sicam-1 did not correlate with 2-clfa levels in the messi cohort.to provide better insights into whether the observed association between 2-clfa and endothelial dysfunction may be mechanistically linked human lung microvascular endothelial cells hmvec-l were exposed to pathophysiologically relevant levels 10 mm of 2-clpa and indicators of endothelial function were examined.
