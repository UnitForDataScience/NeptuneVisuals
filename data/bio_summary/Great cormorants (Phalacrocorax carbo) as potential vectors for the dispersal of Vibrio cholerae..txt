The presence of culturable V. cholerae was examined in the intestine content samples from the seven wild cormorants described above the cormorants' feces samples feed- ing experiments and from fish intestine samples fish from the feeding experiments.

Recently cormorants have increased in number of individuals thereby causing trouble for commercial and sports fisheries in lakes and rivers all over Eurasia and North America Phalacrocorax auratus.A rise in the numbers of great cormorants arriving from Europe to over-winter in Israel from October to March has been demonstrated.

To demonstrate that fish infected with V. cholerae transfer the bac- teria to cormorants we used cormorants n  8 hand-reared in captivity.

In all cases the feces of the cormorants fed on goldfish and koi were V. cholerae-negative while most of the feces of the cormorants fed on tilapia were V. cholerae-positive.

A very interesting result was the direct detection of ctxA in three wild cormorants demonstrating that the birds harbored pathogenic strains of V. cholerae.On migrating great cormorants can cover distances of 500 to 1000 kmday and thus potentially transfer V. cholerae across and between continents.

The different cormorant individuals were found to differ significantly in the intestine microbiome ANOSIMn 7 R  0.505 p 0.01.experiment for the feces of cormorants that were fed on these fish species.

The persistence of V. cholerae in the cormorants' feces days after their diets were switched from tilapia to golden fish or koi.

The results demonstrate that V. cholerae can survive in the cormorants' digestive tract up to 72 h after ingestion of tilapia fish colonized by V. cholerae.Table 3.

The large-scale movements of cormorants as well as many other fish-eating waterbirds provide a potential mechanism for the global distribution of V. cholerae.

The feeding of each group on a given diet lasted two to three weeks with the cormorants fed four timesweek.
