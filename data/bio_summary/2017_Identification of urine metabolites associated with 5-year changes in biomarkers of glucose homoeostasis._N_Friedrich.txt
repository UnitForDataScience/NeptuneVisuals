Associations of baseline metabolite levels with longitudinal changes in continuous markers of glucose homoeostasis during the 5-year follow-up in the whole studypopulation black squares and healthy subpopulation red squares no diabetes or use of diabetes medication HbA1c  5.7 and estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR  60 mLmin.

A more recent study based on 2400 subjects confirmed the increased betaine excretion in diabetes patients and also found a non-linear association between betaine excretion and HbA1c with a strong positive association for HbA1c levels  6.Interestingly among diabetes patients betaine excretion was inversely linked to plasma betaine levels  thereby providing a further explanation for the above-mentioned discrepant findings for plasma and urine betaine levels in cases of incident diabetes .

- Higher baseline levels of urinary alanine betaine NN-dimethylglycine DMG creatinine and trimethylamine were associated with an increase in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up.

Of these subjects with missing values for baseline follow-up HbA1c or baseline confounders were excluded resulting in a total of 3986 subjects included in the analyses.MeasurementsInformation on lifestyle such as smoking habits and coffee consumption were assessed by questionnaire.

Correlation between metabolites at baseline or follow-up as well as metabolite-specific correlation between baseline and follow-up values are presented in Fig.

This means that subjects with low HbA1c levels at baseline generally deteriorate more than subjects with high baseline HbA1c levels.

In the first-step linear regression analyses of the 5- year follow-up HbA1c levels as outcome and baseline urine metabolite levels as exposure adjusted for baseline HbA1c levels were performed.

Higher baseline levels of alanine betaine DMG creatinine and TMA were associated with an increase in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up.

In the present study higher urinary baseline levels of betaine as well as its metabolite DMG were linked to an increase in HbA1c over time.Our findings are in concordance with a study reporting positive associations with incident diabetes for both urine metabolitesFig.

In the present study higher baseline urinary MNA levels were related to increases in HbA1c fasting glucose and HOMA-IR values during the 5-year follow-up.Higher NNMT expression was previously described in adipose tissue in diabetic mice and in patients with either diabetes or insulin resistance .
