other recent strategies also6  carrasco-hernandez et al.include the use of modern molecular techniques such as rna silencing which consists in the use of rna sequences sirna complementary to specific messenger rna sequences base pairing of these complementary sequences drives the forma- tion of double-stranded rna and induces the degradation of the original messenger rna.

each hiv-1 virion contains two copies of the genomic rna strand  during the reverse-transcription process the rt dissociates from the rna template several times switching to another rna strand to use as a template making a chimeric dna strand.

in investigating the tridimensional structure of the ebov rna polymerase indicate that certain conserved subdomains in the architecture of these proteins may help to explain the broad antiviral activity of certain nucleotide analo- gues even against different types of rna viruses including ss - and ss rna genomes.

mutation and substitution rates have shown that viruses move in a very wide range of mutability with single-stranded rna viruses in one end and double-stranded dna viruses on the other table 1 examples of spontaneous mutation rates for microorganismscerevisiae has been reported as an emergent infectious disease  .ilar journal 2017  3figure 1 genome size against substitution rate of dna and rna viruses.

it is commonly accepted thatthere is a trade-off between the rna viruses' genome lengthand the high mutation rate for very long rna genomes the number of mutations accumulated during each replication cycle would be so elevated that inviable virions would rapidly outnumber the viable ones leading to a loss of fitness andor viral extinction.

in the following section the medical challenges posed by the rapid adaptation of rna viruses will be discussed.efforts to control rna viral diseases fight diversity with diversitymedical efforts to control viral diseases comprise a variety of strategies at different levels ranging from the design of drug substances to field surveillance.
