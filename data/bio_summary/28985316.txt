Viruses and their corresponding abbreviations and references are as follows RNA viruses Dengue 2 virus DENV  Zika virus ZIKV  Ebola virus EBOV  Chikungunya virus CHKV  Influenza virus A H1N1 IVA H1N1  Influenza virus A H5N1 IVA H5N1  SARS coronavirus SARS-CoV  MERS-coronavirus MERS-CoV  West Nile virus WNV .

Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus EBOV Marburg virus SARS-CoV MERS-CoV Lassa fever virus Nipah virus Rift Valley fever virus CHIKV in .Constant monitoring of RNA viral diseases and preventive pharmaceutical production are therefore crucial for timely detection and intervention to avoid severe outbreaks in the future.

Other recent strategies also6  Carrasco-Hernandez et al.include the use of modern molecular techniques such as RNA silencing which consists in the use of RNA sequences siRNA complementary to specific messenger RNA sequences base pairing of these complementary sequences drives the forma- tion of double-stranded RNA and induces the degradation of the original messenger RNA.

For a more pro- found analysis on the fundamental differences between these two evolutionary rates their calculations and an extensive comparison between DNA and RNA viruses please refer to .The Lack of Proofreading Ability of RNA Polymerases and Reverse TranscriptasesThe single protein present in all RNA viruses and which seems to be homologous in all cases at least from the crystal struc- tures that have been obtained as of today  is the RNA-dependent polymerase either an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase i.e.

The authors reported that attenuated strains pro- vided protective immunity to mice after challenge.Although treatments against poliovirus influenza hepatitis C and HIV infections have achieved important advances in the last decades specific drugs are yet to be designed to control several of the remaining--and highly pathogenic--RNA viruses .Is It Possible to Target Unknown or Recently Emerged RNA VirusesIn some cases when confronting a new virus or one for which specific drugs have not yet been designed the best option is to use known drug substances against other RNA viruses.

Each HIV-1 virion contains two copies of the genomic RNA strand  during the reverse-transcription process the RT dissociates from the RNA template several times switching to another RNA strand to use as a template making a chimeric DNA strand.

In investigating the tridimensional structure of the EBOV RNA polymerase indicate that certain conserved subdomains in the architecture of these proteins may help to explain the broad antiviral activity of certain nucleotide analo- gues even against different types of RNA viruses including ss - and ss RNA genomes.

Discovery of an RNA virus 3'- 5' exoribonuclease that is critically involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis.

1.5 x 10-3 mutations per nucleotide per geno- mic replication mngr in the single-stranded RNA phage Qb10 versus 1.8 x 10-8 mngr in the double-stranded DNA virus herpes simplex virus type 1 .RNA viruses are often highlighted as the most common class of pathogens behind new human diseases with a rate of2 to 3 novel viruses being discovered each year .

Table shows examples of the mutation rates of well-studied RNA viruses including dengue virus DENV influenza virus H3N2and HIV-1 compared to other species of microorganisms exem- plifying the mutation rates of bacteria fungi and protozoans.
