using this directory we confirmed the highest levels of hsd11b2 in the placenta followed by the kidneys with very little expression seen in other tissues figure a which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on human term placental samples figure c. we next aimed to validate the use of the humantime pcr confirmed the expression of hsd11b2 mrna in jeg-3 cells with placental rna used as positive control figure b. immunohistochemical staining preformed 24 hours after seeding also confirmed abundant expression ofpan-hdac inhibition increases 11 -hsd2 expression in jeg-3 cells.

we used the in vitro placental model jeg-3 cells as despite their limitations they are a well-established cell line commonly used to mimic placental trophoblast cells 30. we employed pharmacological inhibitors of hdacsto modulate histone acetylation and examined theimpactfirst study to examine the effects of class-specific inhibitorson hsd11b2 expression it is interesting to note that previous studies have demonstrated a class-specific effect of hdacs on the regulation of other placental genes.

specifically matrix metalloproteinase 9 has been shown to be regulated by classexpression under conditions of stress and inflammation cells were exposed to biological mediators of these conditionsnumber of adverse pregnancy conditions including anxietystress and infection as elevations in proinflammatorynamely exogenous cortisol and il-1 .cytokines and steroids are observed in these conditions 39trophoblast cells with highest expression observed in thestress and inflammation.

additionally interaction of hdacs with the stat-1 tf may contribute to inhibition-inducible gene expression in trophoblast cells thereby protecting the placenta cells from maternal immuneinhibition could result in detrimental effects therefore aor overexpression of individual hdacs would allow the development of a more targeted approach.

this relationship further highlightslandscape and confirms the need for more studies examining how placental 11 -hsd2 protein is controlled under both basal and pathological conditions.here we provide evidence of a role for histone acetylation in the regulation of 11 -hsd2 in the placenta a limitationinternational journal of cell biology9confirmed 11 -hsd2 to be abundantly expressed in this cell line and that hsd11b2 levels are comparable between jeg- 3 cells and the human placenta there are potential caveats associated with using jeg-3 cells .

hdacs remove them thereby repressing transcription 19. in humans 18 hdacs have been discovered and they are classed into four main families class i hdacs 1 2 3 and 8 class ii hdacs 4 5 6 7 9 and 10 class iii sirt1 sirt2 sirt3 sirt4 sirt5 sirt6 and sirt7 and class iv hdac 11 20.recently a significant emphasis has been placed on in vitro studies to tease apart the precise epigenetic mechanismsknock down of dna methylation using the demethylating agent 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine 5-aza in jeg-3 cells has been shown to increase the expression of a number steroido- genic genes including hsd11b2 indicating a direct link for regulation of hsd11b2 expression by methylation despite advancements being made in understanding the-hsd2 expression little focus has been placed on examining the role that hdacs play in-hsd2.
