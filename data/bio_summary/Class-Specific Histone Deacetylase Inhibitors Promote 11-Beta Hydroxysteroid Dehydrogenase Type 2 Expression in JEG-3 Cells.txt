This relationship further highlightslandscape and confirms the need for more studies examining how placental 11 -HSD2 protein is controlled under both basal and pathological conditions.Here we provide evidence of a role for histone acetylation in the regulation of 11 -HSD2 in the placenta a limitationInternational Journal of Cell Biology9confirmed 11 -HSD2 to be abundantly expressed in this cell line and that HSD11B2 levels are comparable between JEG- 3 cells and the human placenta there are potential caveats associated with using JEG-3 cells .
