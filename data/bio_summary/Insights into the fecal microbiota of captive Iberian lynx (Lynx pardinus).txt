Results grouped microbiota in two main clusters I and III which included DGGE patterns of 19 out of 36 specimens cluster I being the most frequent in La Olivilla 50 and cluster III in El Acebuche 55.55  specimens.

However the level of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in fecal and intestinal mi- crobiota of cats has been reported that is affected by different conditions 15.The main difference observed between the fecal microbi- ota of animals from the two breeding centers studied was the frequency of detection of DGGE patterns corresponding toclusters I and III.

Functional diversity of fecal microbiota of Iberian lynx specimens included in clusters I and III was assessed by determining the community catabolic profiles CLCPs using Biolog EcoPlater Biolog Hayward CA USA.

Contribution of each bacterial species identified from sequencing of DGGE bands to similarity percentages SIMPER between clusters I and III was determined by using PAST software.ResultsClustering analysis was applied to fecal microbiota DGGE bands of Iberian lynx specimens and the dendrogram ob- tained showed a high group similarity percentage.

Clusters I and III grouped 19 out of 36 specimens sampled cluster I being the most frequent DGGE pattern de- tected in lynx from La Olivilla 50.

Community metabolic diversity of fecal microbiota of Iberian lynx specimens included in clusters I and III based on the utilization of different carbon sources.

Clusters I and III included profiles of 19 out of 36 specimens these clusters displaying the most frequently DGGE patterns detected inlynx specimens from La Olivilla and El Acebuche re- spectively.

Cluster III included 55.55 of the specimens from El Acebuche percentage clearly higher than that 5.55detected in specimens from La Olivilla for which the most frequently DGGE pattern detected corresponded to cluster I.

Phyla detected in all the sam- ples included Actinobacteria 0.96 to 5.86 Bacteroidetes 0.11 to 6.03 Firmicutes from 33.58 to 42.38 and Proteobacteria specifically g-Proteobacteria ranging from 54.95 to 61.76.In order to break down the contribution of each bacterial group to the observed dissimilarity between clusters I and III fecal microbiota samples similarity percentage analysis SIMPER was carried out.

5.3.Finally metabolic analysis of fecal microbiota included in clusters I and III showed ability to use 24 and 30 out of 31 carbon sources assayed respectively Fig.
