However the level of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in fecal and intestinal mi- crobiota of cats has been reported that is affected by different conditions 15.The main difference observed between the fecal microbi- ota of animals from the two breeding centers studied was the frequency of detection of DGGE patterns corresponding toclusters I and III.

In order to contribute to the knowledge of the Iberian lynx intestinal micro- biota fecal microbiota of captive specimens from two breeding centers La Olivilla and El Acebuche located in Southern Spain were studied by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis DGGE.

For this reason further studies with a high- er number of animals are necessary to increase the understand- ing of the Iberian lynx intestinal microbiota.The objective of this study was to assess the composition of the predominant microbial groups in the fecal microbiota of Iberian lynx specimens from two breeding centers whereMilli-Q 5 ul of DNA template and 1 U DreamTaq Polymerase Life-Tech- nologies Eugene Oregon USA.

A total of 36 fecal samples of captive Iberian lynx specimens were kindly supplied by Centro de Analisis y Diag- nostico de la Fauna Silvestre de Andalucia Malaga-Spain within the context of the routine program of coprologic analysis of this species.

Functional diversity of fecal microbiota of Iberian lynx specimens included in clusters I and III was assessed by determining the community catabolic profiles CLCPs using Biolog EcoPlater Biolog Hayward CA USA.

Contribution of each bacterial species identified from sequencing of DGGE bands to similarity percentages SIMPER between clusters I and III was determined by using PAST software.ResultsClustering analysis was applied to fecal microbiota DGGE bands of Iberian lynx specimens and the dendrogram ob- tained showed a high group similarity percentage.

Clustering analysis based on pair wise similarity index of DGGE patterns obtained from fecal samples of Iberian lynx specimens from El Acebuche and La Olivilla centers.terns clearly defined clusters were detected.

Community metabolic diversity of fecal microbiota of Iberian lynx specimens included in clusters I and III based on the utilization of different carbon sources.

Thus although time span between defecation and freezing of the feces was short different environmental conditions in these areas could have some effect which may be considered for future re- search.This study is the first report comparing the composition ofbacterial fecal microbiota of Iberian lynx specimens from twobreeding centers of captive Iberian lynx where they are con- fined.

Results grouped microbiota in two main clusters I and III which included DGGE patterns of 19 out of 36 specimens cluster I being the most frequent in La Olivilla 50 and cluster III in El Acebuche 55.55  specimens.
