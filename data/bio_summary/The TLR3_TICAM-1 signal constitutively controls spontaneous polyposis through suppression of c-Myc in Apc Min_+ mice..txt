apc-min mice were crossed to myd88-- or ticam1-- mice to generate apcmin-myd88- apcmin-myd88-- apcmin-ticam1- and apcminticam1-- littermates.

error bar represent the standard deviation sd between samples.resultsticam1 deficiency results in short survival of apcmin mice tlr transmits signal through two major adaptors myd88 and ticam-1 we generated apcminmice on myd88- or ticam1-deficient background by crossing apcmin mice to myd88-- or ticam1-- mice respectively.

apcmin myd88-- mice survived longer than apcmin mice consistent with previous reports  in contrast survival times for apcminticam1-- mice were significantly shorter at 20 weeks fig.

the mrnas of these immune cells were only marginally increased in the normal non-polyp region of the small intestine in apcmin and apcminticam1-- polyps additional file figure s3.inflammatory parameters were also increased in the polyps of apcminticam1-- mice fig.

thustumor-related inflammation was induced to a greater extent in the intestine of apcminticam1-- mice than in apcmin mice.high expression of c-myc in apcminticam1-- polyps previous reports suggest that c-myc mrna is not increased in epithelial cells in response to myd88 activa- tion  .

apcminmyd88-- mice reportedly have fewer polyps in the intestine than apcmin mice .

apcminticam1-- mice had more polyps than apcmin mice in the distal small intestine fig.

thus the incidence of tumor formation is high in the middle and distal intestine of apcminticam1-- mice compared to apcmin mice.

only a few polyps were ob- served in the proximal intestine and colon of apcmin mice and no or minimal increases in polyp numbers was observed in apcminticam1-- mice fig.

cd8 and cd4 mrnas were minimally detected in unaffected mucosa in apcmin and were slightly increased in apcminticam1-- mice at 22 weeks age fig.

a. cd11b and cd11c mrnas levels were more in- creased in polyps of apcminticam1-- mice than apcmin mice fig.

a. we detected more accumulation of cd8a- positive cells in polyps of apcminticam1-- mice com- pared to apcmin mice by immunohistological staining fig.

the facs profiles of the cd4- cd8- cd11b- and cd11c-positive cells in the intestine of apcminticam1-- mice vs. apcmin mice are shown in additional file figure s2.

mrna ex- pression of inos nos2 was highly induced in apcminticam1-- polyps compared to apcmin polyps fig.
