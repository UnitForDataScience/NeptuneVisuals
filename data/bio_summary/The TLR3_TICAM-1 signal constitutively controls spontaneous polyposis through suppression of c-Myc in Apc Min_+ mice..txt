Apc-Min mice were crossed to Myd88-- or Ticam1-- mice to generate ApcMin-Myd88- ApcMin-Myd88-- ApcMin-Ticam1- and ApcMinTicam1-- littermates.

Error bar represent the standard deviation SD between samples.ResultsTicam1 deficiency results in short survival of ApcMin mice TLR transmits signal through two major adaptors MyD88 and TICAM-1 We generated ApcMinmice on MyD88- or Ticam1-deficient background by crossing ApcMin mice to Myd88-- or Ticam1-- mice respectively.

ApcMin Myd88-- mice survived longer than ApcMin mice consistent with previous reports  In contrast survival times for ApcMinTicam1-- mice were significantly shorter at 20 weeks Fig.

The mRNAs of these immune cells were only marginally increased in the normal non-polyp region of the small intestine in ApcMin and ApcMinTicam1-- polyps Additional file Figure S3.Inflammatory parameters were also increased in the polyps of ApcMinTicam1-- mice Fig.

Thustumor-related inflammation was induced to a greater extent in the intestine of ApcMinTicam1-- mice than in ApcMin mice.High expression of c-Myc in ApcMinTicam1-- polyps Previous reports suggest that c-Myc mRNA is not increased in epithelial cells in response to MyD88 activa- tion  .

ApcMinMyd88-- mice reportedly have fewer polyps in the intestine than ApcMin mice .

ApcMinTicam1-- mice had more polyps than ApcMin mice in the distal small intestine Fig.

Thus the incidence of tumor formation is high in the middle and distal intestine of ApcMinTicam1-- mice compared to ApcMin mice.

Only a few polyps were ob- served in the proximal intestine and colon of ApcMin mice and no or minimal increases in polyp numbers was observed in ApcMinTicam1-- mice Fig.
