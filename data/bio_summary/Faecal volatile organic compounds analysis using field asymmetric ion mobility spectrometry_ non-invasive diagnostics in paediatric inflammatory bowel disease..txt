the exclusion criteria were a diagnosis of an unclassified type of ibd use of antibiotics or immune modulating agents within the last six months prior to the study culture-proven infectious gastroenteritis in the last six months prior to inclusion history of surgery of the gastrointestinal tract except appendectomy and a previous diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal disease such as inflamma- tory bowel disease celiac disease functional constipa- tion or short bowel syndrome.the control group consisted of asymptomatichealthy volunteers in the age range of 4-17 years attending primary and secondary schools in similar regions of the netherlands noord-holland zuid- holland flevoland.

the apparently high specificity of faecal vocs compared to faecal calprotectin underlines the poten- tial of this method to serve as a complementary non- invasive technique in the diagnosis of paediatric ibd possibly limiting the number of endoscopies needed in a subset of children suspected for ibd.conflict of interestnonefinancial disclosurenonegrand supportnonedeclaration of funding interestnonereferencescuffari c 2009 c c diagnostic considerations in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease management gastroenterology  hepatology 5 775-83canavese g et al 2013 inflammatory bowel disease a proposal to facilitate the achievement of an unequivocal diagnosis worldj.
