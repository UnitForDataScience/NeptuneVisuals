Taking into account the frequent combination of multiple risk factors in the elderly this could be considered one of the important factors contributing to the high risk of CVD in the elderly 129.Gut Microbiota and AtherothrombosisGut microbiota is emerging as a novel player in the process of atherosclerosis as it is implicated in the development of atherosclerotic risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension 166.

In particular prospective studies are necessary to assess whether BM-derived PC are actually decreasing by aging independently or not by classic atherosclerotic risk factors and their potential role to halt atherosclerotic progression.In contrast with this hypothesis a recent work showed that clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential CHIP which is a common aging-related phenomenon characterized by the presence of an expanded somatic blood-cell clone in people without hematologic disease which may lead to an increase in circulating myeloid cells was significantly asso- ciated with the risk of coronary events in 4726 participants with coronary heart disease CHD and 3529 controls and with accelerated atherogenesis in a murine model of athero- sclerosis 159.Pro-Oxidant PathwaysMyeloperoxidaseMPO is an enzyme belonging to the mammalian heme peroxidase superfamily which is detectable in neutrophils monocytes and macrophages.

The pro-atherogenic role of iNOS was documented in ApoE-- iNOS-- mice which showed a significantly reduced ath- erosclerotic lesion area and lipid peroxidation compared with ApoE-- mice 182 242.The activity of NOS profile seems to be modified in the elderly.

Recently gut-derived products such as trimethylamine N-oxide TMAO and lipopolysaccharide are emerging as novel atherosclerotic risk factors and gut microbiota composition has been shown to change by aging and may concur with the increased cardiovascular risk in the elderly.Critical Issues Antioxidant treatment is ineffective in patients at risk or with cardiovascular disease.

Thus 1215-LOX-- mice on a high-fat diet dis- closed reduced ox-LDL plasma and urinary isoprostanes levels and atherosclerotic lesion initiation was signifi- cantly delayed in the double-knockout mice compared with ApoE-- mice 70.

PON2-deficient ApoE-- mice developed enhanced mito- chondrial oxidative stress and exacerbated atherosclerosis when fed with chow and Western diet 85.Similar to PON1 PON-3 prevents oxidative modification of LDL humanized PON3 transgenic mice fed with an ath- erogenic diet exhibited decreased atherosclerotic lesion areas compared with nontransgenic animals 333.Serum PON1 concentration decreased in the atheroscle- rotic ApoE-- mice during aging and was inversely corre- lated to the development of atherosclerotic lesions 13.

The antioxidant activity of PON1 has been detected in vitro where it inhibited LDL and HDL oxidation 12 13 and in PON1-knockout mice which dis- played higher levels of oxidized phospholipids and increased aortic atherosclerosis compared with wild type 331 332.

Among ROS generated by Nox2 O - and H O seem to play a relevant role in redoxtribute to oxidative stress in human coronary atherosclerotic lesions 131.Experiments performed in subjects affected by chronic granulomatous disease CGD which is characterized by hereditary deficiency of Nox2 subunits allowed to investi- gate the role of this Nox in human atherosclerosis.
