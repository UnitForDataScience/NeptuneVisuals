we also measured proliferation and apoptosis at 10 weeks after resection and found that while there was no difference in apoptosis however proliferation was significantly increased in the tlr4 ko mice p  0.005 a-b.resection-associated steatosisat 10 weeks after sbr wt mice had significant liver steatosis 4.6 - 1 compared to unoperated mice 0.14 - 0.03 p  0.001 or sham-operated mice 0.0013 - 0.03. in the tlr4 ko micefig.

these findings have been previously reported in rats in which intestinal resection increases tlr-4 mrna and ligand protein expression in the remnant bowel .we have previously described significantly greater culturable gram- negative organisms in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes in mice after sbr when compared to mice undergoing sham operation transection of the bowel with reanastomosis alone .

since sbr is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome the purpose of this study was to determine whether tlr4 signaling is critical to the development of resection-associated hepatic steatosis.methods male c57bl6 control and tlr4-knockout ko mice underwent 50 proximal sbr.

whole bowel containing both intestinal epithelial and many other cell types demonstrated a similar temporal trend in tlr4 expression increasing by 5-fold at day 7 after sbr p b 0.001 andreturning to baseline at week 10. compared with isolated epithelial cells the whole bowel expression of tlr4 was markedly greater more than 20-fold p  0.0001. there was no difference in tlr4 expression between sbr and unoperated mice at 10 weeks in the whole bowel .discussionin the present study we have demonstrated that resection- associated liver steatosis is prevented by disrupting tlr4 expression.

so we designed an experiment in which we operated on tlr-4 global knockout mice and control mice gave them a 50 bowel resection waited ten weeks and sacrificed the an- imals.

when we looked up their livers of the control mice you see significant steatosis but in the tlr4 knockout mice there was no steatosis.

we recently demonstrated accelerated hepatic steatosis after 50 small bowel resection sbr in mice.

intestinal tlr4 mrna expression was measured at 7 days and 10 weeks.results compared to controls tlr4 ko mice demonstrated similar weight gain and morphological adaptation after sbr.

at present it remains unknown whether ifald and nafld nash share the same mechanistic pathways to induce liver steatosis.recently we discovered significant liver steatosis after sbr compared with unoperated mice with similar food intake and body weight .

our recently published model is most similar to the high-fat diet models with the striking difference that after sbr mice have more severe steatosis sooner 10 weeks with less fat 35 in their diet .

given the many similarities between the models the purpose of this study is to elucidate the role of tlr4 in resection-associated hepatic steatosis.methodsexperimental designmale c57bl6 wt or tlr4 ko mice underwent 50 sbr and were placed on liquid diet for 7 days or 10 weeks.

this study was approved by the washington university animal studies committee protocol 20130308 in accordance with the national institute of health laboratory animal care and use guidelines.operations and sample collectionall operated mice underwent a 50 proximal sbr as we have previ- ously described .
