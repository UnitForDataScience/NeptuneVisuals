Bacteroidetes which are present in 16S rRNA sequences throughout LHC are present in several other lithifying microbialite systems.These organisms are known to be able to degrade high molecular weight organic matter and biopolymersand are often found as they are at Cone Pool in close relation to Cyanobacteria and other primary producers.The possible symbiotic relationship between primary producers such as Cyanobacteria and hetero- trophic Bacteroidetes at Cone Pool warrants further exploration since these groups may contribute to biologically induced lithification.Relevance to ancient microbialitesUnlike the conical incipient stromatolites found in Lake Untersee Antarcticaand modern stromatolites from Obsidian Pool Prime Yellowstone- the dendrolitic cones in Cone Pool are not laminated and thus comparisons with the most common conical stromatolites e.g.

The saturation state of stream water from Cone Pool and the Outflow Pool with respect to calcium carbonate OCa was calculated using measured calcium ion concentrations temperature a saturation product Ksp of 9.81 x 10-9 and PHREEQC modeling software.Inorganic and organic carbon and 13C bicarbonate uptake Samples of individual dendrolitic cones with the underlying mat from Cone Pool and the microbial mat in the Outflow Pool were cored with a10 mm diameter plastic drinking straw and placed into individual testtubes 25 ml.

Cone Pool and the Outflow Pool contain microbial mats yet uniquely Cone Pool contains partially lithified dendrolitic cones that emerge from an underlying laminated microbial mat foundation.

Cone Tip Cone Middle and Cone Base labeledoutflow pool LHC Outflow pool were determined by sequencing amplified libraries of small subunit ribosomal 16S rRNA genes.

Each dendrolitic cone was sectioned into the Cone Tip Cone Middle Cone Base and Adjacent Mat Fig.

The geothermal spring upwelling that originates in Cone Pool trickles downstream to a second larger pool Outflow Pool.

Physical and chemical characteristics of Cone Pool and the Outflow Pool spring water are presented in Table .

At the time of sampling Cone Pool was substantially warmer 45.6 degC than the downstream LHC Outflow Pool 34.1 degC.

Cone Pool and the Outflow Pool exhibited similar slightly alkaline pH 8.08 and8.29 respectively and both were super-saturated with respect tocalcite OCa  4.08 and 3.40 respectively Figure S1.
