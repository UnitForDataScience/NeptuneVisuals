kaijusorts all of the resulting protein fragments by length and com- pares each against the protein database longest to shortest finding and returning maximum exact matches.metagenomic assemblyillumina sequencing technology which is the most widely used sequencing method for metagenomics experiments today gen- erates read lengths in the range of 100-250 bp with a typical sequencing run producing tens of millions of reads.

common contaminants include sequencing vectors and adaptors nucleic acids that are commonly present in laboratories such as from e. coli and phix174 a phage used as illumina sequencing control and of course human dna which creeps into many sequencing pro- jects by accident.

these and other issues mean that metagenomic methods for viruses sometimes require dif- ferent methods from bacteria which are beyond the scope of this discussion a recent review of such methods can be found in .microbial genome resourcesthe most commonly used reference genome databases are the complete and draft genomes at genbank  which for more than a quarter century has been the repository for genome se- quence data from around the world.
