Kallisto then infers strain abundances using an expectation- maximization EM algorithm 67. k-SLAM  is a novel k-mer- based approach that uses local sequence alignments and pseudo-assembly which generates contigs that can lead to more specific assignments.Centrifuge  is a fast and accurate metagenomics classifier using the Burrows-Wheeler transform BWT and an FM-index to store and index the genome database.

We begin with a review of termin- ology and a comparison of marker gene sequencing shotgun metagenome sequencing and meta-transcriptome sequencing all of which are sometimes included in the term metagenomics.Metataxonomics metagenomics metatranscriptomicsThe most widely used sequencing-based approaches for micro- biome research are metataxonomics and metagenomics .

Kaijusorts all of the resulting protein fragments by length and com- pares each against the protein database longest to shortest finding and returning maximum exact matches.Metagenomic assemblyIllumina sequencing technology which is the most widely used sequencing method for metagenomics experiments today gen- erates read lengths in the range of 100-250 bp with a typical sequencing run producing tens of millions of reads.
