Environmental effects may point towards potentially modifiable factors leading to more effective prevention methods.We found a low heritability of neopterin in the Old Order Amish with genetic factors accounting for only 7 of the neopterin variance.

In this report we estimate the heritability of plasmaneopterin levels in the Old Order Amish a rural population ideal for studying heritability because of their relative lifestyle homogeneity and limited alcohol tobacco and substance use disorders that reduce the regular major environmental sources of variation.MethodsRecruitmentThe Amish Wellness Study was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of providing wellness screening for cardiometabolic health to members of the Old Order Amish community in Lancaster County Pennsylvania USA and performing genetic research related to cardiometabolic health.
