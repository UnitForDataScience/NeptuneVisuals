The four strains with BLAST total scores over 5.5e06 were selected strains FORC 003 JP55 FORC 025 and JP838.

The cysteine protease alpha-clostripain is not essential for the patho- genesis of Clostridium perfringens-mediated myonecrosis.

The virulence factors were searched using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST in the virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria database  with default parameters and predicted with zero e-value.Comparative genomic analysisThe C. perfringens strains for comparative genomic analy- sis were selected using Microbial Nucleotide BLAST in the NCBI complete genome database.

The intersections and differ- ences of POG sets of the different strains were visualized as a Venn diagram using the jvenn program .Quality assuranceThe single colony of strain CBA7123 was transferred more than three times to obtain a pure culture and confirmed using a variable pressure field emission scanning electron microscope Chuncheon Center Korea Basic Science Institute Korea Additional file  Figure S1 and a PCR-sequencing approach targeting 16S rRNA gene as described by Min et al.

The dendrogram created based on the presence of POGs indicated that strain CBA7123 was clustered with strains JP55 FORC 003 and FORC 025 Fig.

The key virulence factors of strain CBA7123 were predicted to be exo-alpha-sialidase nanI sialidase nanH collagenase colA kappa-toxin perfringolysin O pfoA theta-toxin phospholipase C plc alpha-toxin and alpha-clostripain cloSI with 96 95 98 98 and 96 identity respectively in the chro- mosome and all of which were also present in the four reference strains.
