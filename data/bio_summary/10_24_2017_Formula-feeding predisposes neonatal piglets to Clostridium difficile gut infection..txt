Here we found that treatment of study piglets with clindamycin before C. difficile infection diminished the C. difficile and toxin loads as compared to levelsFormula Feeding and C. difficile in Piglets  JID 2017XX XX XXXX  5AB150SP125100FP7550SP1.201.000.800.600.40FPFP-CDFP-CDLactobacillus Mitsuokella Megasphaera Oscillibacter Subdoligranulum Desulfovibrio FusobacteriumC1.5Prevotella Ruminococcus Methanobrevibacter Alistipes Escherichia Shigella TuricibacterPhascolarctobacterium Bifidobacterium RoseburiaDorea Streptococcus EnterococcusOther genera n  108Clostridium Blautia Bacteroides Collinsella Lachnoclostridium Butyricimonas0.200SP0.250.20FPFP-CDEscherichiaLactobacillusRoseburiaMegasphaeraClostridium OscillibacterStreptococcusLachnoclostridiumBifidobacterium Methanobrevibacter0.15EnterococcusMitsuokellaPrevotella AlistipesShigellaTuricibacterSubdoligranulumBustyricimonas0.10BlautiaDoreaPhascolarcobacterium0.05RuminococcusCollinsellaFusobacteriumBacteroides Desulfovibrio0SPFPFP-CD-1.0-1.00.621.5Figure 3.

High background levels of C. difficile and toxin were detected in formula-fed piglets prior to infec- tion while suckling piglets carried about 3-fold less C. difficile and toxin was not detected.

Spores of C. difficile ribotype 078 were produced and purified according to the protocol of Grzeskowiak et al  and the concentration of inoculum in each trial was verified on chromID agar Biomerieux France.Animal groups consisted of formula-fed piglets FP formu- la-fed piglets with CDI FP-CD and formula-fed piglets with CDI pretreated with antibiotics FP-CD-Ab.

Fecal specimens from suckling piglets formula-fed piglets and formula-fed C. difficile-infected piglets were used for metagenomics analysis.

However the calprotectin level cor- related positively with the toxin level Spearman rho  0.708 P  .05 n  8 and there was a trend toward a positive corre- lation between the calprotectin level and C. difficile burden in fecal specimens Spearman rho  0.634 P  .091 n  8.DISCUSSIONWe assessed the conditions for C. difficile colonization and CDI development by feeding naturally born neonatal pig- lets with milk formula and challenging the animals with the hypervirulent C. difficile ribotype 078 or antibiotics.

To study the conditions for C. difficile colonization and CDI development 48 neonatal piglets were moved into isolators fed bovine milk-based formula and infected with C. difficile 078.

The C. difficile burden in noninfected piglets fed formula or sow milk in the last experiment defined as the log C. difficile 16S rRNA gene copy number was deter- mined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis .

In our studies FP animals were char- acterized by earlier colonization with toxigenic C. difficile and infection development as assessed by postmortem examination C.difficileandtoxinscouldalreadybedetectedatpostpartumday1 while in suckling piglets C. difficile was detectable at day 2 and toxins at day 4 after birth .
