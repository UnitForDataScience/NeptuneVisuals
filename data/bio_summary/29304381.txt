S2.The biofilm surface concentration hereafter biofilm concen- tration was measured using the biofilm suspension from the 90- cm section of hose.

the hose with the highest relative abundance of Mycobacterium 35 only had the 17th highest concentration by calculated absolute abun- dance 5.9 105 cellscm2 because biofilm TCC was low.When Legionella was detected biofilm TCC was significantly higher Kruskal-Wallis p  .001 A indicating that Legionella is more likely to be found with a higher biofilm TCC.

While some genera that may contain potential opportunistic pathogens Legionella detected in 2178 shower hoses were positively correlated with biofilm cell concentration others Mycobacterium Pseudomonas had surprisingly non- existent or negative correlations with biofilm cell concentrations.

Shower hose age was related to metal accumulation but not biofilm cell concentration while frequency of use appeared to influence biofilm cell concentration.

Water TCC was used directly cellsmL and biofilm TCC was calculated using the hose surface area cellscm2.Elemental analysisHomogenized 100 mL aliquots of the biofilm suspensions were acid-digested in 4 mL concentrated ultrapure HNO3 Carl Roth GmbH Karlsruhe Germany and 1 mL ultrapure concentrated hydrogen peroxide Sigma-Aldrich Buchs Switzerland in 15 mL Teflon-tetrafluormetoxil PTFE-TFM tubes in an MLS ultraClave 4 Milestone Inc. Shelton USA at 230 oC and 130 bar for 35 min.Subsequently digestates were diluted 10-fold with ultrapure deionised water.

Other measures of biofilm concentration including intact cells and adenosine tri-phosphate correlated well with biofilm TCC Spearman's r 0.95 and 0.87 respectively p  .001 Fig.

When comparing biofilm TCC between countries that used disinfectant Belgium Latvia Portugal Serbia UK and US N 39 and those that did not Denmark Germany South Africa Spain and Switzerland N 39 biofilm TCC was significantly higher without disinfectant p  .001 Kruskal-Wallis A.

While water quality did not correlate well with biofilm TCC data not shown biofilm TCC correlated positivelywith the frequency of use Pearson's R 14 0.72 p 14 .004 Table S8.Metals accumulate in biofilmsGlobal surveyColor was notably variable across biofilms e.g.

This measure of diversity correlated significantly but weakly with biofilm TCC Spearman's r 0.28 p .01 and was lower amongst biofilms in countries that use disinfectant p .01 Kruskal-Wallis B.Some similarities could be seen in biofilm microbiome compo- sitions from the same country A but the origin of the hose country only explained 24 of variation in microbiome compo- sition Adonis p  .001.

Although a literature comparison of biofilm data is complicated by differences in sampling and analysis methods  our study indicates that biofilm TCC tends to be higher on shower hoses average 107 cellscm2 than on hard pipe materials typically used in building drinking water plumbing copper and PEX pipes5.7 105 cellscm2  or drinking water plumbing simulators Pe-Xc 2 106 cellscm2  .
