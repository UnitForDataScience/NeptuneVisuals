Fecal microbiota diversity in preterm infants born at a gestational age of 32 wk who are at the highest risk of NEC increases much more slowly than in more mature infants and composition is dominated by staphy- lococci enterobacteria and enterococci with a very low abun- dance of anaerobes except clostridia 15.

Eligible children were those born at 24- 31 wk of gestation admitted to the NICUs recruiting .10 infants to be able to characterize the nutritional strategies of the NICU and alive at day 7 including transferred infants.

Similarly we compared the proportion of infants in contact with the breast of the mother during the first week and the proportion of directly breastfed infants at discharge between the 3 NICU profiles concerning direct-breastfeeding policy.

N is the number of preterm infants with the characteristic   N3161 infants.2 n is the number of preterm infants with necrotizing enterocolitis   nN.3 Crude OR assessed by logistic regression.4 OR adjusted for all individual variables included in the table assessed by logistic regression.5 Birth weight is not included in logistic regression.6 Mean 6 SD.Clostridiaceae.

The rate of infants in contact with the mother's breast during the first week and the rate of breastfed infants at day 28 partial direct-breastfeeding and at discharge total direct-breastfeeding were compared between NICU profiles according to gestational age.

Design We performed a prospective nationwide population-based study EPIPAGE 2 Etude Epide'miologique sur les Petits Ages Ges- tationnels including preterm infants born at 32 wk of gestation in France in 2011.

An ancillary propensity- matched case-control study EPIFLORE Etude Epide'miologique de la flore in 20 of the 64 NICUs analyzed the intestinal micro- biota by culture and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.Results Among the 3161 enrolled preterm infants 106 3.495 CI 2.8 4.0 developed NEC.

All infants were prospectively monitored for signs and symptoms of NEC.

The expected percentage of infants with a low enteral volume for each NICU was estimated by the average individual probability of each infant hospitalized in the NICU see supplemental material.

We calculated for each NICU the difference between the observed percentage and expected percentage of infants receiving a low enteral volume.
