Incidence of and risk factors for anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic ante- rior resection with intracorporeal rectal transection and double-stapling technique anastomosis for rectal cancer.

Anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection for rectal cancer is different between minimally invasive surgery and open surgery.

Despite a large multicentre multinational study involv- ing 1180 patients 33 and a prospective multicentre study reporting leakage rates of just over 3 34 the device has not gained widespread application.Research challengesIdentification of new materials and methods for per- forming anastomosis with minimal collateral tissue trauma.Development of devices that accommodate the con- fines of the pelvis and facilitate low rectal anastomosis.Anastomotic reinforcementSeveral innovations have been tried to reinforce an anas- tomosis and thus reduce the occurrence of leakage.

Many patients will be left with a stoma for several months because of the low clinical priority for reversal 42 and 20 of patients are left with a permanent stoma owing to postoperative complications of anterior resection 43.Several studies have suggested that a defunctioningstoma decreases the incidence of clinical leakage of a colorectal anastomosis 4445 conversely other authors have reported no difference in leakage but a reduced incidence of reoperation has been recorded 46.

In a meta-analysis of three studies including 943 patients the use of an omental wrap resulted in a significant three-fold reduction in the rate of clinical AL but no difference in the reoperation rate or mortality 39.Research challenge1 Improved methods to seal an anastomosis and sup- port tissue healing.Defunctioning stomaA defunctioning stoma is used to protect a rectal anastomosis by diverting the faecal stream.

In the era of increasing use of laparoscopic surgery stapled low rectal anastomosis pre- sents a particular problem because of the confines of the bony pelvis.

Using a collagenase inhibitor aprotinin they were able to demonstrate an increase in anastomotic burst pressure and breaking strength in a rat model 78 and a significant reduction of radiological and clinical AL in an RCT involving 100 patients 79.Another interesting observation with relevance to rectal cancer surgery is the change in composition and virulence of the rectal flora following radiotherapy 80.

Other studies have confirmed the lack of association between MBP and AL in rectal surgery 8889 and suggested that a rectal enema alone may be as effective 90.

This is the focus of an ongoing Italian RCT in which patients are randomized to either full MBP or rectal enema alone clinicaltrials.gov identi- fier NCT00940030 74.Research challengeOptimal method of bowel cleansing before rectal sur- gery.Clarification on the role of MBP when an upstream stoma is to be fashioned.Preoperative antibiotics and selective gut decontaminationThe preoperative administration of nonabsorbable oral antibiotic preparations OAP has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of AL following elective GI surgery OR  0.42 95 CI 0.24-0.73 91.

Evidence against the use of routine MBP in colonic surgery includes a meta-analysis per- formed in 2009 and a subsequent Cochrane review 8687.The evidence for MBP in rectal surgery is less clear- cut.
