investigation of microbial changes associated with hiv infection has the potential to aid in the development of thera- peutic interventions that could improve many of the pathologic consequences of chronic hiv infection.chronic systemic immune activation in hiv infectiondespite advancements in hiv antiretroviral therapy art average life expectancy in hiv-infectedpotential role of hiv-associated gut microbial changes in hiv disease progressionhiv-associated changes to the enteric microbiome may lead to systemic inflammation by disrupting the balance of metabolic functions performed by the microbiota such as short-chain fatty acid or bile acid metabolism  or causing increased trans- location of bacterial products into the systemic circulation elevated plasma kynurenine a tryptophan metabolite has been found to be associ- ated with cd8th t-cell activation and mortalityin hiv-infected individuals and hiv infection was associated with the presence of a gut microbial community with both the genetic capacity to metabolize tryptophan into kynurenine and demonstrable kynurenine production in vitro 21 in a similar paradigm independent of hiv the enteric microbiome can drive cvd pathogenesis by transforming dietary constituents such as phos- phatidylcholine and bile acids into reactive inter- mediates such as trimethylamine n-oxide that can lead to macrophage and platelet activation throm- bosis and arterial plaque formation hiv-associated enteric microbiome changes gootenberg et al.figure 1. alterations in the gut microbiota reported in hiv microbiome studies.

bacteriophages which are the most abundant enteric viruses can initiate changes in the bacterial community that influence gut health and may also be able to directly interact with the host immune system in ibd diversity of the bacteriophage virome increases whereas diversity of the bacterial microbiome decreases suggesting a potential competitive relationship between bacteria and bacteriophages during enteric inflammation in light of the emerging recognition of the potential role of the enteric virome in gastrointestinal pathology there is now a growing focus on characterizing the gut virome associated with hiv infection.nonhuman primate simian immunodeficiency virus models of hiv infection have shown expan- sion of the enteric virome with significant increases in picornaviridae adenoviridae and parvoviridae abundance in pathologic simian immunodeficiency virus infection of rhesus macaques .

il-22-producing ilc3 and th17 cells it is believed that such a loss of immune surveillance may result in impaired intes- tinal epithelial barrier function increased gut per- meability and the translocation of gut bacterial products into systemic circulation theseproducts could trigger persistent systemic immune activation and drive turnover of cd4th and cd8th t cells leading to clonal exhaustion and progressive impairment of t-cell function hiv-associated chronic systemic immune activation secondary to a loss of gut epithelial homeostasis may then lead to disease progression in both treated and untreated hiv infection.

cvd which constitutes a large proportion of hiv- associated ncd is increased in hiv infec- tion and associated with systemic immune activation as measured by markers such as serum il-6 scd163 and c-reactive protein in hiv-uninfected individuals microbiota-induced inflammation has been shown to drive cvd patho- genesis  suggesting that this disorder could occur in hiv as well.further supporting the connection between systemic inflammation and chronic pathogenesis individuals with the highest degree of persistent elevated immune activation while on suppressive art experience higher overall mortality even with cd4th t-cell reconstitution more than 500 cellsml although systemic immune activation declines after initiation of art it remains persist- ently elevated in the majority of study participants even after years of therapy and has also been observed in individuals with undetectable viral loads in a cohort of hiv-infected ugandans a 1.6-fold increased hazard of death was associated with each 10 increase in cd8th t-cell activation following initial viral suppression with art immune cells a wide range of changes in the enteric microbial community have been reported during hiv infection 171819 2021222324-27 28-3233 fig.

in addition microbiota-targeted probiotic interventions have produced mixed results with some therapeutics reducing inflammatory markers and others lacking efficacy 162. further understanding of the enteric microbial changes associated with hiv infection especially among developing world populations that bear the greatest burden of hiv infection is therefore necessary to design thera- peutic strategies that could alleviate the sequelae of systemic inflammation and ncd in chronic hiv infection.acknowledgementsthe authors would like to acknowledge dr herbert w. virgin dr scott handley and dr guoyan zhao for informative discussions regarding the content of this review.financial support and sponsorshipfunding received from nih niddk and niaid and the burroughs wellcome fund.conflicts of interestthere are no conflicts of interest.references and recommended readingpapers of particular interest published within the annual period of review havebeen highlighted asof special interest of outstanding interestdelwart e. a roadmap to the human virome.
