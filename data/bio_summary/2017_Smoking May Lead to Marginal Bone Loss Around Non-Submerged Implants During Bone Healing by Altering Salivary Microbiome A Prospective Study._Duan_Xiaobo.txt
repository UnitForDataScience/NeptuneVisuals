According to the literature smokers have been demonstrated to have poorer oral hygiene compared with non- smokers.17 The concentration of the oligoelement composition in saliva is affected by smoking and these elements may unlock various metabolic processes that lead to functional or infectious diseases.18 Salivary antioxidant levels may also be changed by smoking which can generate deleterious effects on oral health.19 In addition smoking has been suggested to favor early acquisition and colonization of pathogens in oral bio- films and a positive correlation between commensal bacteria and proinflammatory cytokine level has been demonstrated in smokers.20 Tobacco smoke can change the salivary environment in various ways however there are limited studies on its influences on constituents of the salivary microbiome.The large community of microbes residing in theoral cavity constitutes a dynamic and symbiotic ecosystem that has a major role in maintaining oral and systemic health.21 Disruption of the ecology of oral bacteria might cause oral infectious and systemic diseases.22 Previous studies have taken unstimulated saliva samples as representative of the entire oral ecosystem.23 Studies have already demonstrated correlations among the salivary microbiome and periodontal diseases24 oral lichen planus25 and even oral cancers.26 The salivary microbiome can trigger an inflammatory and immune response resulting in an immuno-osteolytic reaction.27 This accounts for ongoing bone resorption and is often a final de- termination of the fate of implants.

Some species promote healthy conditions whereas others contribute to disease.34 The oral mi- crobiome is one of the first ecosystems to come into contact with tobacco smoke and can be affected by smoking.19 Various studies have shown that smoking affects composition of the subgingival microbialflora2035 and alters bacteria acquisition and coloni- zation in oral biofilms in favor of periodontopath- ogens.20 Increased levels of salivary periodontal pathogens have been proposed as risk indicators for future peri-implant disease.36 Moreover evidence demonstrated that levels of proinflammatory cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid samples and peri-implant sulcus fluid samples were observed to be higher in smokers.2037 However limited studies have focused on the influence of smoking on the composition of the salivary microbiome which is more responsible for maintaining the integrity of the oral cavity.38 The impact of smoking on shifting the balance from health to disease cannot be understood without a compre- hensive view of the oral microbiome.Furthermore peri-implant bone healing is a com- plex phenomenon.

Elucidating effects of smoking on this ecosystem is critical to un- derstanding the impact of smoking on bone healing around implants and also on whole oral health.The present study was designed to test the hy- pothesis that the habit of smoking can lead to sig- nificant changes in the structure and composition of the salivary microbiome and further affect MBL around implants during bone healing.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy PopulationThe study protocol was approved by the Institution Review Board of the West China Hospital of StomatologySichuan University Chengdu China before initiation authorization numbers WCHSIRB-ST-2016 to 072.

platform-switching.42 The detrimental role of smoking on bone healing has been demonstrated to be due to less collagen pro- duction43 reduced peripheral blood flow and nu- trient delivery44 and compromised function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages.45 Bacteria in saliva are the primary etiologic agents of oral diseases.46 Increases in salivary periodontal pathogen and host inflammatory biomarker burden are associated with periodontal attachment loss.47 Microbiology and immunopathology are two impor- tant aspects for peri-implant diseases.48 The goal of the present study therefore was to investigate whether a smoking habit can lead to significant changes in structure and composition of the salivary microbiome and whether species that are more or less frequent in smokers can be correlated with MBL during bone healing.NMDS analysis graphically displayed different bac- terial profiles between smokers and non-smokers Fig.

These results indicate that tobacco smoking caused an alteration in the density of oral bacteria in healthy status and cigarette smoking is composed of over 4000 toxinsthat may cause an ecologic catastrophe for the commensals.At the phylum level Fig.

Patients were asked to fill out information on smoking status current past never and frequency of smoking number of cigarettes per day week or month.

HOT351 P  0.004 Pseudomonas orientalis P  0.04 Vibrio gigantis P  0.02 and some unclassified phylotypes were only detected in non-smoking sam- ples showing significantly higher proportions com- pared with smoking samples.Species Associated With DiseasesConsidering that smoking is a significant risk factor for periodontal health3 and dental implant therapy11 species that are the important periodontal pathogens belonging to the ''red complex'' and ''orange com- plex''33 were evaluated Table 2.

Chronic exposure to various chemical compounds is responsible for numerous diseases according to WHO data.2 Tobacco smoking is also an ac- cepted potential risk factor for oral health.

In addition it has been reported that presence of bacteria is one of the important aspects for determining peri-implant bone loss and long-term stability of an implant.14 Smoking has been dem- onstrated to negatively affect subgingival microbial communities15 and recent evidence also indicates that smoking shapes the peri-implant microbiome even in states of clinical health by supporting a pathogen-rich community.16The oral cavity is exposed to the external environ- ment and saliva is the first biologic medium encoun- tered during inhalation of cigarette smoke.

Members of the red and orange complex were already shown to be the most im- portant microbiota for progression of periodontitis53 and also for peri-implantitis.54 The high abundance of these pathogens in healthy smokers suggests smoking creates a pathogen-rich oral environment and warrants further investigation.Considering that the overall composition of the salivary microbiome has been shown to be quite stable after a single antibiotic treatment55 antibiotics have been prescribed postoperatively to reduce early dental implant failure.
