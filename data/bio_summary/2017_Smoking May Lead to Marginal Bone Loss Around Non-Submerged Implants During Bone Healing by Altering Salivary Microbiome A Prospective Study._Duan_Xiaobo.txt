hot351 p  0.004 pseudomonas orientalis p  0.04 vibrio gigantis p  0.02 and some unclassified phylotypes were only detected in non-smoking sam- ples showing significantly higher proportions com- pared with smoking samples.species associated with diseasesconsidering that smoking is a significant risk factor for periodontal health3 and dental implant therapy11 species that are the important periodontal pathogens belonging to the ''red complex'' and ''orange com- plex''33 were evaluated table 2. it was found that porphyromonas gingivalis pg p  0.04 was signifi- cantly more abundant in smokers.

compared with non-smokers the relative abundance of genus streptococcus p  0.02 lachnoanaerobaculum p  0.03 stomato- baculum p  0.04 and eubacterium nodatum group p  0.02 were significantly increased in smokers.

in contrast selenomonas g-3 p  0.03 catonella p  0.01 and selenomonas p  0.02 showed a signifi- cant overabundance in non-smokers.changes in core microbiota between non-smokers and smokersan attempt was made to determine the core micro- biota of saliva in non-smokers and smokers based on a previous study.16 it was found that some species had significantly different abundance levels between non- smokers and smokers.

although many species were prevalent in both groups streptococcus parasanguinis p  0.01 streptococcus salivarius p  0.01 eu- bacterium infirmum p  0.02 and megasphaera micronuciformi p  0.04 were significantly more abundant in smokers.

the phyla gracilibacteria p  0.004 saccharibacteria p  0.001 and the total relative abundance of the other phyla p  0.01 were found at significantly higher levels in non-smokers.

catonella morbi p  0.01 oribacterium asaccharolyticum p  0.04 and solo- bacterium moorei p  0.02 were significantly more abundant in non-smokers.

smokers demonstrated significantly greater mbl during the bone-healing period compared with non-smokers p  0.003. there were no significant differences between smokers and non-smokers in other clinical characteristics or demographics p 0.05. clinical characteristics of the implants after the 3-month bone-healing period are shown in supplementary table 1 in online journal of periodontology.to investigate changes in structure and composition of salivary microbial communities 20 samples were sequenced.

only the core mi- crobiome with average relative abundance 1 or species with statistical differences between smokers and non-smokers are demonstrated in figure 4. both smokers and non-smokers exhibited a core micro- biome comprising 23 of the 527 species 78 species were common to both smokers and non-smokers 23 species were unique to smokers and 23 species were unique to non-smokers.

according to the literature smokers have been demonstrated to have poorer oral hygiene compared with non- smokers.17 the concentration of the oligoelement composition in saliva is affected by smoking and these elements may unlock various metabolic processes that lead to functional or infectious diseases.18 salivary antioxidant levels may also be changed by smoking which can generate deleterious effects on oral health.19 in addition smoking has been suggested to favor early acquisition and colonization of pathogens in oral bio- films and a positive correlation between commensal bacteria and proinflammatory cytokine level has been demonstrated in smokers.20 tobacco smoke can change the salivary environment in various ways however there are limited studies on its influences on constituents of the salivary microbiome.the large community of microbes residing in theoral cavity constitutes a dynamic and symbiotic ecosystem that has a major role in maintaining oral and systemic health.21 disruption of the ecology of oral bacteria might cause oral infectious and systemic diseases.22 previous studies have taken unstimulated saliva samples as representative of the entire oral ecosystem.23 studies have already demonstrated correlations among the salivary microbiome and periodontal diseases24 oral lichen planus25 and even oral cancers.26 the salivary microbiome can trigger an inflammatory and immune response resulting in an immuno-osteolytic reaction.27 this accounts for ongoing bone resorption and is often a final de- termination of the fate of implants.

elucidating effects of smoking on this ecosystem is critical to un- derstanding the impact of smoking on bone healing around implants and also on whole oral health.the present study was designed to test the hy- pothesis that the habit of smoking can lead to sig- nificant changes in the structure and composition of the salivary microbiome and further affect mbl around implants during bone healing.materials and methodsstudy populationthe study protocol was approved by the institution review board of the west china hospital of stomatologysichuan university chengdu china before initiation authorization numbers wchsirb-st-2016 to 072. participants provided written informed consent via a signed statement before participation.

some species promote healthy conditions whereas others contribute to disease.34 the oral mi- crobiome is one of the first ecosystems to come into contact with tobacco smoke and can be affected by smoking.19 various studies have shown that smoking affects composition of the subgingival microbialflora2035 and alters bacteria acquisition and coloni- zation in oral biofilms in favor of periodontopath- ogens.20 increased levels of salivary periodontal pathogens have been proposed as risk indicators for future peri-implant disease.36 moreover evidence demonstrated that levels of proinflammatory cytokines in gingival crevicular fluid samples and peri-implant sulcus fluid samples were observed to be higher in smokers.2037 however limited studies have focused on the influence of smoking on the composition of the salivary microbiome which is more responsible for maintaining the integrity of the oral cavity.38 the impact of smoking on shifting the balance from health to disease cannot be understood without a compre- hensive view of the oral microbiome.furthermore peri-implant bone healing is a com- plex phenomenon.

proteobacteria p  0.05 was also more abundant in non-smokers whereas synergistetes p  0.58 showed a slight in- crease in smokers.the microbial shift was investigated in more detail at the genus level.

platform-switching.42 the detrimental role of smoking on bone healing has been demonstrated to be due to less collagen pro- duction43 reduced peripheral blood flow and nu- trient delivery44 and compromised function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages.45 bacteria in saliva are the primary etiologic agents of oral diseases.46 increases in salivary periodontal pathogen and host inflammatory biomarker burden are associated with periodontal attachment loss.47 microbiology and immunopathology are two impor- tant aspects for peri-implant diseases.48 the goal of the present study therefore was to investigate whether a smoking habit can lead to significant changes in structure and composition of the salivary microbiome and whether species that are more or less frequent in smokers can be correlated with mbl during bone healing.nmds analysis graphically displayed different bac- terial profiles between smokers and non-smokers fig.

smokers had a lower diversity and shared smaller numbers of species than did non-smokers p 0.05. uncultivated phylotypes accounted for an average mean - se of 18.40 - 2.27 and 10.52 - 1.05of the salivary microbiome in non-smokers and smokers respectively.
