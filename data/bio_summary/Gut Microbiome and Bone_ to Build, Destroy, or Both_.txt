Paradoxically animals receiving mi- crobiota from undernourished donors showed increased fem- oral cortical bone volume and bone mineral density compared with animals receiving microbiota from healthy donors .Nevertheless these data demonstrate that in cases of nutrition- al deficiency changes in the microbiota may contribute to bone growth and development.Mechanisms Underlying Microbiota-Mediated Effects on BoneThere is no simple explanation for the reported effects of gut microbiota on bone.

Moreover microbiota could al- ter bone resorption through effects on B-cell production of theosteoclast inhibitor osteoprotegerin as microbiota are known to affect B-cell development .Growth Factor and Hormone-Mediated Mechanisms Another proposed mechanism by which gut microbiota may affect bone is through modulation of growth factor and hor- mone production.

Here we review recent reports addressing the effect of gut microbiota on bone health discuss potential reasons for discrepant findings and explore potential mechanisms for these effects.Recent Findings Manipulation of microbiota by colonization of germ-free mice antibiotics or probiotic supplementation significantly alters bone remodeling bone development and growth as well as bone mechanical strength.

Investigation of the impact of gut microbiota on bone physiology primarily involves studies performed in mice uti- lizing either germ-free GF mice or manipulation of the gut microbiota in conventionally raised mice.

As more data become available a more comprehensive view of the effects of microbiota on bone and an appreciation of the complexity of the microbial-host interaction is beginning to emerge.By comparing GF mice with either conventionally raised mice or GF mice colonized with normal microbiota at weaning 3 weeks of age Sjogren et al.

It is possible that differ- ences in either microbiota composition or host response to microbiota are driven by sex hormones or other sex-specific factors.

Since cortical bone is the major determinant of fracture risk the effect of microbiota on cortical bone indicates a critical role for micro- biota in bone health.Studying the Effects of Microbiota on Bone Using AntibioticsAlthough GF animals are powerful tools to study the effects of microbiota GF individuals do not exist outside the laboratory.

Therefore antibiotic treatment has been used by some investigators to study the effects of microbiota on bone .To test whether endogenous microbiota contribute to the regulation of bone remodeling under homeostatic conditions in adulthood our group treated female SPF mice with broad- spectrum antibiotics for 1 month depleting over 99 of the resident bacteria in the gut.

Interestingly mice treated with oral vancomycin which is poorly systemically absorbed was sufficient to in- crease bone mass and decrease P1NP suggesting that Gram- positive resident bacteria may play important roles in regula- tion of bone remodeling by microbiota .Several studies investigated the effects of microbiota per- turbation by antibiotic treatment on bone growth in early post- natal development in mice.

testthe impact of therapeutic-dose pulsed antibiotic treatment PAT on microbiota diversity and host growth in mice with the goal of mimicking microbiota perturbation by intermittent antibiotic usage which is common in children.
