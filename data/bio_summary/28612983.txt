showed that compared with donors pre-FMT UC patients had significantly lower abundance of members of Clostrid- ium cluster IV XIVa and XVIII and higher abundance ofBacteroidetes Bacilli Proteobacteria and Clostridium clusters IX andXI.38 The stool microbial diversity of UC patients and donors did not differ at baseline however the Shannon diversity index for respon- ders increased significantly following FMT.

Study SelectionEligible studies were RCTs and cohort studies that investigated FMT as induction of remission for active UC in both paediatric and adult patients with clearly described measures of remission.Studies were excluded if enrolled patients did not have clearly defined active disease there was no definition of remission clinical endpoints were not reported or the study included only patients with comorbid infections such as CDI.

Randomised controlled trialsFour placebo controlled RCTs were identified reporting on a total of 277 patients with UC enrolled between 2011 and 2016 of whom 140 51 received donor FMT and 137 49 received placebo.37-40 Two RCTs used autologous stool as placebo3840 and two used water with and without discolourant.3739 The RCTs ranged in size from 50 to 81 patients.

Remission was variably defined as per Table 3In cohorts of patients who have undergone FMT to treat CDI the choice of donor does not have an important impact on the effi- cacy of therapy.42 Similarly it seems that neither anaerobic vs aero- bic stool preparation nor fresh or frozen stool significantly influences the efficacy of FMT for CDI.1043 It seems that stool from any healthy person processed under many different conditions is likely to be effective in treating CDI.

study that did not demonstrate efficacy were treated with fresh stool38 and the major- ity of the patients who achieved remission in the other RCTs were treated with frozen stool.373940 There was also a higher rate of remission reported in the cohort studies using frozen stool 30 vs fresh stool 22.Given the success of FMT as an agent to induce remission in UC there is now a need to investigate the mechanisms by which this effect is achieved.

DISCUSSION In the meta-analysis of four published RCTs performed to date FMT was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of remis- sion of active UC achieving clinical remission in 28 of patients with mild-moderate UC OR 3.67 95 CI 1.82-7.39 P.01 Fig- ure 2.37-40 This effect appears to be robust as it is seen despite variation in stool processing and delivery methods between the tri- als.

A recent FMT study for the treatment of CDI had a high placebo response and there is the possibility that processing and storage of the autologous stool could have influenced the placebo response.11 The Rossen and Paramsothy studies had central reading of the colonoscopy images which minimises bias in the blinding of outcome the other RCT did not use central reading of colonoscopy images.37-40TABL E 5 Summary of microbiome analysis of randomised controlled trials of FMT for UCFMT faecal microbiota transplantation UC Ulcerative colitis.The optimal route of FMT delivery in UC whether via the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract is uncertain although it is likely to influ- ence the success of the procedure.

There is increas- ing evidence implicating the colonic microbiome in the pathogenesis of UC with luminal bacterial antigens contributing to immune cell activation.1 Many of the genetic risk alleles associated with UC relate to immunological handling of microbes and mucosal defence.2 The microbiome in UC both active and remission is less diverse than that of healthy subjects.3 This loss of diversity is predominantly attributable to a decrease in gram-positive Firmicutes especially Clostridium clusters IV and XIV whereas some species in the Pro- teobacteriae group particularly Escherichia coli and Enterobacteri- aceae are relatively overabundant.4 However the relative paucity of many other bacteria has also been implicated in IBD including Fae- calibacterium prausnitzii a butyrate producer with independent anti- inflammatory properties sulphate-reducing bacteria and mucosal associated Akkermansia muciniphila Ruminococcus torques and Ruminococcus gnavus that have possible roles in mucus barrier integ- rity.35 Colonic enterocyte health is also fundamentally dependent on microbial metabolites with butyrate a product of anaerobic bacterial fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrates being a primary source of enterocyte nutrition with anti-inflammatory effects.6Despite evidence implicating microbial factors in the pathogenesis of UC most medical therapies target the immune response without modifying the luminal microbial environment.
