Therefore it is interesting to understand the antimicrobial activity forall six strains against P. nicotianae and P. palmivora which cause root rot both species and foot rot P. nicotianae only.

RAST annotation identified 8366 7722 and 4615 features in Burkholderia territorii Burkholderia metallica and P. geniculata draft genomes respectively.Genes Responsible for Beneficial TraitsThe PATRIC database was used to search for genes typically involved in beneficial traits for the four strains.

For instance the presence of cellulase gene in Bacillus pumilusstrain 104 Burkholderia metallica strain A53 and Burkholderia territorii strain A63 could potentially explain the antagonistic activity against P. nicotianae in vitro that was not seen forP.

Among the antimicrobial-producingisolates Burkholderia metallica A53 and Burkholderia territorii strain A63 which were isolated from a mandarin rhizosphere belong to the Burkholderia cepacia complex BCC.

Inhibition of P. nicotianae growth by VOCs was significant for R. jialingiae strain 108 P. geniculata strain 95 and B. pumilus strain 104.

Also they would like to acknowledge Dr. James H. Graham for providing P. nicotianae and P. palmivora and Diane Bright for her help and suggestions.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at REFERENCESAziz R. K. Bartels D. Best A.

Notably Burkholderia metallica strain A53 was able to solubilize phosphate and P. granadensis strain 100 was positive for siderophore production.Antimicrobial Activity against Phytophthora spp.

nicotianae and P. palmivora  whereas Burkholderia spp.

Alpha alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase are two enzymes important for the synthesis of trehalose and both genes are present in P. geniculata strain 95 and the two Burkholderia strains A53 and A63.Phytohormone Production1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase ACC deaminase is known to regulate plant development by reducing levels of the plant hormone ethylene  .

However indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase were found in the two Burkholderia strains and in P. geniculata strain 95.
