In order to be able to analyze whether there were differences in the microbiota based on diagnosis or not samples were collected from different diagnosed individuals.For cultivable microbiome analysis 42 adults were included in the study 16 first-degree relatives of CD patients R mean age 41.7 years range 28e65 years 10 men and 6 women 7 healthy volunteers H mean age 42.7 years range 23e63 years 6 men and 1 woman 14 treated CD TCD patients on a gluten- free diet GFD mean age 43.6 years range 18e69 years 5 men and 9 women and 5 untreated CD patients UCD mean age 35 years range 25e44 years 1 man and 4 women.For PCR-DGGE analysis 52 adults were included in the study 26 CD relatives R mean age 42.3 years range 28e65 years 14 men and 12 women 7 healthy volunteers H mean age 42.7 years range 23e63 years 6 men and 1 woman 14 treated CD TCD patients on a GFD mean age 44.6 years range 18e69 years 5 men and 9 women 5 untreated CD patients UCD mean age 35 years range 25e44 years 1 man and 4 women.Inclusion criteria of the volunteers were H First-degree relatives of CD patients in whom CD was ruled out had no genetic susceptibility for CD and did not show signs of any other gastrointestinal disease UCD CD patients who were diagnosed by positive tTG antibodies HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 phenotype and a positive duodenal biopsy Marsh IIIa par- tial villous atrophy increased intra-epithelial lymphocytes  40 25100 enterocytes and a villouscrypt ratio 11  TCD Treated CD patients who were instructed by the gastroenterology department to comply with a strict GFD and had recovered the normal architecture of the duodenal biopsy and normal tTG antibody levels after a GFD of at least one year.

described a rod- shaped bacterium attached to the small intestine epithelium of some untreated CD patients but not to the epithelium of healthy controls  that the possible implications of the intestinal microbiota in the development of CD were hypothesized.Several researchers have since attempted to find a dysbiosis pattern in the intestinal microbiota of different individuals based on diagnosis with contradictory conclusions although most studies describe an imbalance in the bacteria composi- tion between CD and healthy individuals e some studies conclude that there are no differences between these groups .

Previous studies have shown intestinal dysbiosis in CD patients including some of the gluten-degrading bacterial groups reported in this work such as Lactobacillus Staphylococcus and Bifidobacterium e. Recent works have also shown differences in bac- terial metabolism between healthy volunteers and CD patients that could implicate different gluten hydrolytic patterns .

While some of the resulting peptides could be innocuous for CD individuals digestion could also lead to generation of harmful immuno- genic peptides that activate CD .

To date gluten is the only known environmental factor implicated in the development of CD.

This results in incomplete diges- tion of gluten and the generation of immunogenic peptides such as the 33-mer  which are deaminated by tissue trans- glutaminase TGt the molecule considered to be the auto- antigen of CD.
