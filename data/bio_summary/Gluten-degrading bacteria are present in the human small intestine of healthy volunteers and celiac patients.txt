previous studies have shown intestinal dysbiosis in cd patients including some of the gluten-degrading bacterial groups reported in this work such as lactobacillus staphylococcus and bifidobacterium e. recent works have also shown differences in bac- terial metabolism between healthy volunteers and cd patients that could implicate different gluten hydrolytic patterns .

while some of the resulting peptides could be innocuous for cd individuals digestion could also lead to generation of harmful immuno- genic peptides that activate cd .

to date gluten is the only known environmental factor implicated in the development of cd.

this results in incomplete diges- tion of gluten and the generation of immunogenic peptides such as the 33-mer  which are deaminated by tissue trans- glutaminase tgt the molecule considered to be the auto- antigen of cd.

the presence of anti-ttg anti- bodies plays an important role in the serological work-up for cd .

the main genetic factors affecting cd are histocompatibility complex ii class hla-dq2 and hla-dq8 which are present in 90 and 10 of patients respectively .

it is important to consider that 30e40 of the overall population carries either hla-dq2 or dq8 and only a small proportion of them develop cd .

despite the fact that hla molecules dq2dq8 are high risk factors their presence is not sufficient for development of the disease important aspects regarding the development of cd remain unclear.

why do some individuals who eat gluten and carry the hla dq2dq8 complex develop cd and others do not what makes the differencethroughout a number of years several additional risk factors have been postulated.
