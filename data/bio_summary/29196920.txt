Co-administration of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 with protein has been shown to increase protein absorption and to maximize the health benefits associated with protein supplementation.Keywords Bacillus coagulans .

The recommend- ed daily protein intake to maintain nitrogen balance muscle mass is 0.8 g proteinkg body weightday however people trying to increase muscle mass should increase their daily protein intake to 1.4-2.0 g protein kg body weightday.

Optimal protein intake per serving for people trying to maximize MPS are 20-25 g of a high-quality protein containing 2-3 g of leucine to be consumed every 3-4 h. Ingestion of higher amounts of protein does not further stimulate MPS.

coagulans GBI-30 6086 has a history of safe use and is safe for chronic human consumption based upontoxicology testing even when the product is consumed in high quantities  .Here we review the effect of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 on protein digestion and utilization.Increasing Protein and Carbohydrate Metabolism in an In Vitro Gut ModelThe survival and the ability to aid the digestion of protein and carbohydrates of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 was tested in an in vitro model of the stomach and small intestine TIM-1 .

The addition of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 to milk protein increased the amount of digested milk protein available for absorption.Increasing Protein Absorption in a Mini-swine Animal ModelB.

Healthy subjects consumed either whey protein or whey protein plus 1 billion CFU B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 for 2 weeks.

B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 increased absorption of amino acids of specific importance to athletes and people interested in muscle health including BCAAs leucine iso- leucine valine or amino acids involved in blood flow regu- lation such as citrulline or recovery glutamine.Increasing Muscle Health in Athletes Reduced Exercise-Induced Muscle Damageand Increased RecoverySkeletal muscle mass is the sum of muscle protein breakdown MPS and muscle protein synthesis MPS.

Mechanical stimulation of mTOR through weight- bearing exercise or dietary activation through protein ingestion both stimulate MPS and are additive when protein consumption follows exercise.

Probiotic supplementation in athletes has been reported to reduce the number severity and duration of upper respiratory infections and gastrointestinal distress in athletes .Concluding RemarksThe probiotic B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 improves protein absorption and utilization and thereby optimizes the health benefits associated with protein supplementation.

Based on the improved digestion of protein B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 could be used to improve muscle health in various pop- ulations and reduce quality differences of protein sources nat- urally lower in leucine such as plant proteins.Compliance with Ethical StandardsCompeting Interests RJ and MP have received research grants from Ganeden Biotech Inc.
