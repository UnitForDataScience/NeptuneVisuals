coagulans gbi-30 6086 has a history of safe use and is safe for chronic human consumption based upontoxicology testing even when the product is consumed in high quantities  .here we review the effect of b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 on protein digestion and utilization.increasing protein and carbohydrate metabolism in an in vitro gut modelthe survival and the ability to aid the digestion of protein and carbohydrates of b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 was tested in an in vitro model of the stomach and small intestine tim-1 .

co-administration of b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 with protein has been shown to increase protein absorption and to maximize the health benefits associated with protein supplementation.keywords bacillus coagulans .

the addition of b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 to milk protein increased the amount of digested milk protein available for absorption.increasing protein absorption in a mini-swine animal modelb.

b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 has been shown to increase eaa absorption including leucine absorption by 20. the potential beneficial effects of co-administration of the probiotic b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 with a slow digested protein on body composition and sports performance has been studied in a pilot trial .

healthy subjects consumed either whey protein or whey protein plus 1 billion cfu b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 for 2 weeks.

b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 increased absorption of amino acids of specific importance to athletes and people interested in muscle health including bcaas leucine iso- leucine valine or amino acids involved in blood flow regu- lation such as citrulline or recovery glutamine.increasing muscle health in athletes reduced exercise-induced muscle damageand increased recoveryskeletal muscle mass is the sum of muscle protein breakdown mps and muscle protein synthesis mps.

probiotic supplementation in athletes has been reported to reduce the number severity and duration of upper respiratory infections and gastrointestinal distress in athletes .concluding remarksthe probiotic b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 improves protein absorption and utilization and thereby optimizes the health benefits associated with protein supplementation.

based on the improved digestion of protein b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 could be used to improve muscle health in various pop- ulations and reduce quality differences of protein sources nat- urally lower in leucine such as plant proteins.compliance with ethical standardscompeting interests rj and mp have received research grants from ganeden biotech inc. sf hc and dk are employed by ganeden biotech inc. which engages in business trade of b. coagulans gbi-30 6086.open access this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4 .0 international license http creativecommons.orglicensesby4.0 which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appro- priate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.referencesworld health organization 2001 food and agricultural organization of the united nations and world health organization.

the recommend- ed daily protein intake to maintain nitrogen balance muscle mass is 0.8 g proteinkg body weightday however people trying to increase muscle mass should increase their daily protein intake to 1.4-2.0 g protein kg body weightday.

optimal protein intake per serving for people trying to maximize mps are 20-25 g of a high-quality protein containing 2-3 g of leucine to be consumed every 3-4 h. ingestion of higher amounts of protein does not further stimulate mps.

coagulans gbi-30 6086 has been shown to increase pro- tein utilization in a mini-swine animal model by 10 after 4- 5-month-old male mini-swine were fed either a certified diet only or certified diet plus 1 billion cfu b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 per pig per day for 4 weeks.increasing amino acid appearance in the blood in humansb.

this review focused on the rationale of using the probiotic bacillus coagulans gbi-30 6086 to aid protein absorption and utilization.

under the tested condition the survival of strain was high 70. b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 produces enzymes that have been shown to aid the breakdown of protein and a wide variety of carbohydrates .

the benefits of b. coagulans gbi-30 6086 on protein absorption overserved in the in vitro model and an animal model were confirmed in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover human clinical trial.
