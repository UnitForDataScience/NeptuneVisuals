inactive t cells differentiate into t helper 1 th1-type t cells as a result of il-12 stimulation 11. th-1-type t cells natural killer t cells or killer t cells have important roles in cancer therapy for example they remove virus and cancer cells therefore dcs are the most important apcs in the innate immune system.there are various toll-like receptors tlrs that recognize antigens according to their chemical structure tlr2 recognizes lipoteichoic acids lipoproteins and peptidoglycans of gram-positive bacteria tlr4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide lps from gram-negative bacteria tlr9 recognizes bacterial cpg-dna.

cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 in immunomodulation 1. in particular dendritic cells dcs which are apcs have a strong antigen presenting activity they are located in various organs such as the stomach intestine and skin and have the capacity to induce a primary immune response in inactive t cells.

4 tnf-a production induced by caps was completely abrogated both in tlr4-- and myd88-- mice.discussiondcs are widely distributed in peripheral tissues such as the skin nasal cavity and intestine they are antigen- presenting cells that play an important immunological role in mammalians and transmit antigen signals to other immunological cells through lymphocytes in bmdc activation experiments caps did not affect cell viability fig.

first we found that caps activated dendritic cells dcs.

however we were not able to determine that caps has an effect on dc activation and molecular recognition patterns.antigen-presenting cells apcs have an important rolecorresponding author.

flt-3l-induced dcs were generated as previously described in berief bm cells were extracted from icr mice and erythrocytes were removed by brief exposure to 168 mm nh4cl.
