in this section we review expanded evidence that microorganisms confer local protection directly through microbetomicrobe interactions see direct hostindependent protection and indirectly through the host immune system see indirect hostmediated protection through colonization resist ance containment and disease tolerance.direct host-independent protection colonization resistance beyond niche competition and antagonismrecent reviews have focused on a few aspects of colonization resistance.

coimmunity can include the protection of the youngby maternal antibodies  microbiotamediated immunity as detailed in the present review but also populationlevel phenomena such as social immunity in insects  and herd immunity in particular through vaccination   in humans and cattle.rohwer and colleagues use the term nonhost derived immunity to describe bacteriophagemediated immunity .

local protection is ensured by mechanisms that are directly targeted against microorganisms or indirectly through the host immune system.long-reaching protectionwe now turn to protective microbes that help the host from a distance by either inducing systemic protection that is a protection realized in the entire organism or protection at a particular remote site.

antibiotictreated mice before lymphocytic choriomenin gitis lcmv infection elicited an impaired innate and adaptive immune response to lcmv infection and an increased mortal ity after influenza infection .systemic to systemic protectionmicrobiota or its components that are normally distributed across the host system can also induce systemwide coloniza tion resistance in the host.

typhimurium infection through promotion of inflammatory th1 and th17 type immunity .in the skin microbiota could be considered an endogenous adjuvant of the skin immune system exerting its influence via the release of products such as antimicrobial peptides or metabolites andor via the modulation of innate and adaptive immunity without invoking inflammatory responses -.

the host is protected against pathogens both by its own immune system and by the direct or indirect action of microorganisms not only at a local scale but also between local communities and systemically.it is generally assumed that immunity is the immunity of one organism and that this immunity is bounded by the con ventional frontiers of that organism e.g.

two main modes of protection have been proposed resident microorganisms can protect the host either through direct microbe-microbe competition which involves niche competition or direct antagonism or by the indirect induction or priming of host metabolism or immunity thanks to which the host is better protected against pathogen infections.colonization resistance constitutes an expanded sense of traditional protective immunity as these mechanisms can in fact be considered part of the host's defensive repertoire.

more fundamentally we propose a series of conceptual clarifications in support of the idea of a co-immunity where an organism is protected by both its own immune system and components of its microbiota.keywords host-microbiota symbiosis colonization resistance microbial ecology disease tolerance pathogens containment infectious diseasesintroductionthe immune system is never at rest nor is it ever isolated from its environment.

siga can help trap and exclude pathogens immune exclusion but when bound to certain microorganisms can also selectively promote commensal biofilms that confer colonization resistance against pathogens immune inclusion -.

in localtosystemic protection micro organisms at a single location such as the gut microbiota can confer protection through systemic immune responses or leave the local site and disseminate to other regions.

in a mouse model of mcmvassociated lung disease the frequency of virus specific cd8 t cells in the mcmvinfected lungs of germfree mice was restored by fecal bacteria from specific pathogenfree mice likely through crossactivity between gut microbiota pep tides and epitopes of mcmvspecific memory t cells .furthermore mice challenged with pulmonary staphylococ cal infection but lacking segmented filamentous bacteria intheir gut microbiota showed more severe infection with higher bacterial load and mortality associated with diminished lung concentration of th17 immune effector cells.

in this case a microbe at one location h. pylori in the stomach could modu late longdistance immunity at yet another location in the lungs in response to infection.antibiotictreated mice exhibit impaired innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses to influenza infection with increased damages and host mortality .

we highlighted how common types of ecological interactions give rise to the resistance and tolerance against harmful microor ganisms as well as the containment of microorganisms and how the innate and adaptive immune systems are activated by protec tive microbes leading to resistance tolerance or containment toward pathobionts and pathogens.

although evidencefor longreaching microbeconferred protection is scarce we examined possible ways protective microbes can reach beyond their local sites in part by investigating how pathogens spread their influence across the host.why is there so little evidence for longreaching microbial protection first evidence for longreaching protection is lim ited in part because microbiome research is still in its infancy.
