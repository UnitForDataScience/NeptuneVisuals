c. This indicates that while longitudinal samples of one individual's fecal bacterial microbiome are more similar to each other than those of another individual this does not appear to be the case for the fecal mycobiome.Stability of the mycobiomeTo investigate the stability of the mycobiome we mea- sured the recurrence of fungal OTUs across all samples as well as across each volunteers' longitudinal samples.

This study represents the first time the fecal mycobiome has been described in a large cohort of healthy individuals over 100 volunteers with longitu- dinal samples provided by each volunteer up to three samples per volunteer totaling 317 samples.

However the myco- biome was not investigated in initial HMP studies.Using DNA previously extracted from longitudinally collected stool samples two to three samples per volun- teer collected over an approximately 1-year period from HMP volunteers recruited at Baylor College of Medicine Houston TX we characterized the healthy human gut mycobiome.

Understanding what constitutes a normal or healthy gut mycobiome could assist in future research efforts to determine contributions of commensal fungi to the health of the host or the exacerbation of disease.MethodsSample collection and DNA extractionStool samples were collected and DNA was extracted as previously described In brief stool samples were collected and approximately 2 ml of stool was homoge- nized by vortexing in 5 ml of MO BIO lysis buffer PowerLyzer PowerSoil Bead solution MO BIO Labora- tories.

albicans were detected at all visits in 92.2 78.3 and 63.6 of volunteers respectively n  129 Table Although we observed great variability in the gut myco- biome among healthy volunteers these three fungal spe- cies present in a majority of longitudinally collected samples suggest they may be resident commensals in the human gastrointestinal tract and part of our core gut mycobiome.

examining the mycobiome of the gut in relation to diet in a smaller set of healthy volunteers recognized Saccharomyces and Candida as prevalent members of the gut mycobiome but did not identify Malassezia as a member of the gut mycobiota  The discrepancy between the Hoffmann study and the re- sults in the current study are likely due to differences in study methodologies while this study amplified the ITS2 region of the fungal rRNA operon Hoffmann et al.

Additionally a human gut mycobiome study comprised of 24 individuals with two sampling time points found that detection of the same fungus at both time points occurred less than 20 of the time While the gut mycobiome was found to be variable within individuals others have shown that the oral mycobiome stays fairly stable over time within an individual These results prompt a fundamental un- answered question in the field which if any fungi are truly colonizing the human gut It is known that the hu- man microbiome is greatly impacted by diet environ- ment and lifestyle -.

Altogether 701 fungal OTUs were detected in the sample set capturing 247 named genera.Observed OTUs within samples ranged from 2 to 92 Table The Shannon diversity index which measures evenness and richness of communities within a sample var- ied between 0.004 and 2.94 indicating low alpha diversity for most samples Table There was a significant differ- ence between bacterial and fungal communities in both the number of observed OTUs and the Shannon diversity index values Fig.

Pairwise comparisons of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values between longitudinal samples donated by the same volunteer and between samples donated by differ- ent volunteers for the 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 sequen- cing data were performed.
