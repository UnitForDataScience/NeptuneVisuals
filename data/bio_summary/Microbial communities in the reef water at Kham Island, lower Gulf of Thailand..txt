an absence of coral pathogens might involve many genera in kham such as haliea pseudoalteromonas and several genera in actinobacteria  that confer antibacterial properties and thus keep the pathogens in low prevalence   .to attempt visualization of the marine microbial pattern that might represent tropical fringing reef ecosystems we compared the kham kra and other global coral reef and ocean sites microbiota and found the coral marine microbiota of varying reef types and climates latitudes share an extent of similarity supported by community similarity indices and upgma dendrogram clustering and .

the coral reef size at kham was ten-fold smaller than at kra kham 56000m2 kra 560000 m2.materials  methodssample collectionswater samples were collected into separate sterile containers from 1 m above the coral reefs equal to approximately 1 m below the seawater surface at kham island on two occasions once in may 2011 and once in january 2012 between 1100-1400 h. this represents the summer and winter or dry low tide and wet high tide seasons respectively.

subsequently the data indicated the community structure at kham summer was closer to that at kra in winter than at kra in summer and .global comparison of marine prokaryotic microbiota and the metabolic potentialsthe species composition of the microbiota at kham at the phylum and genus levels were compared with the available global datasets that include five coral atolls kingman fanning palmyra kirtimati and gs051 one barrier reef gs048 three fringing reefs kra gs025 and gs148 one lagoon reef gs108 and 73 global ocean sampling gossites.

indeed kham only missed 3-5 functional groups of total denoted in kra .eukaryotic compositions of kham summer and winterthe free-living marine eukaryotic species in the summer and winter seasons at kham were analysed.

this might involve some dissimilar water properties between kham and kra  such as the much higher amount of tss in kham and also in an opposite trend to the report in kra where kham has the lower level of tss in the summer than the winter .

the similar trend between the kham and kra eukaryotic community structure changes in summer and in winter confirmed the seasonal dynamics of the marine eukaryotes given the change in the community structure likely affects the species-species interaction and hence the metabolic networks in a way to intercalate with the coral ecosystems in each season respectively   .discussionthis study successfully obtained marine microbial prokaryotic and eukaryotic databases for one naturally healthy fringing reef site in the lower gulf of thailand kham island.

this helps fulfil the knowledge of coral reef marine microbiome ecology and perhaps points to coastal effects on the microbial diversity at kham compared to the more open-sea kra locality .for the prokaryotic community bacteria of phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria planctomycetes and uncultured bacteria in gn02  are common in kham as well as in the prokaryotic profiles of kra in the summer and winter seasons  and also of global coral sites  .

to increase the understanding of the coral reef ecosystem in the lower gulf of thailand this study utilized 16s and 18s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing to identify the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiota present in the reef water at kham island trat province thailand n6.97 e100.86.

lennon similarity index yue  clayton similarity index indicated that the prokaryotic composition of kham was closely related to that of kra another fringing reef site in the lower gulf of thailand followed by coral reef water microbiota at gs048b cooks bay fr.

this disease outbreak has been reported among mussels and flounder species harvested from this area in the late spring to summer consistent with our seasonal finding   .conclusionsthis report compares the coral reef marine microbiota in the lower gulf of thailand between kham and kra islands with 13 other coral sites and gos sites which unveiled some patterns of diversity that might be essential to the coral reef ecosystem.

the study methods were established elsewhere including by global ocean sampling gos expedition and human microbiome project hmp for examples   .coral reefs worldwide are categorized into four types fringing reef the most common type barrier reef lagoon reef and coral atoll.

the slightly lower biodiversity in kham than at kra might reflect the partly habitat difference due to coastal anthropogenic activities and minor water circulation as kham locates close to the mainland and is surrounded by islands e.g.

the coral habitat and condition at kham and kra are parallel   except kham locates 14 km closer to the shore  which might have some impact on the microbial diversity due to human activities e.g.

metal or oil or polluted marine sites   no finding in undisturbed coral site like kham is suggestive of the undisturbed condition of kham waters.
