The study methods were established elsewhere including by Global Ocean Sampling GOS Expedition and Human Microbiome Project HMP for examples   .Coral reefs worldwide are categorized into four types fringing reef the most common type barrier reef lagoon reef and coral atoll.

An absence of coral pathogens might involve many genera in Kham such as Haliea Pseudoalteromonas and several genera in Actinobacteria  that confer antibacterial properties and thus keep the pathogens in low prevalence   .To attempt visualization of the marine microbial pattern that might represent tropical fringing reef ecosystems we compared the Kham Kra and other global coral reef and ocean sites microbiota and found the coral marine microbiota of varying reef types and climates latitudes share an extent of similarity supported by community similarity indices and UPGMA dendrogram clustering and .

To increase the understanding of the coral reef ecosystem in the lower Gulf of Thailand this study utilized 16S and 18S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing to identify the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiota present in the reef water at Kham Island Trat province Thailand N6.97 E100.86.

Lennon similarity index Yue  Clayton similarity index indicated that the prokaryotic composition of Kham was closely related to that of Kra another fringing reef site in the lower Gulf of Thailand followed by coral reef water microbiota at GS048b Cooks Bay Fr.

Subsequently the data indicated the community structure at Kham summer was closer to that at Kra in winter than at Kra in summer and .Global comparison of marine prokaryotic microbiota and the metabolic potentialsThe species composition of the microbiota at Kham at the phylum and genus levels were compared with the available global datasets that include five coral atolls Kingman Fanning Palmyra Kirtimati and GS051 one barrier reef GS048 three fringing reefs Kra GS025 and GS148 one lagoon reef GS108 and 73 Global Ocean Sampling GOSsites.

The coral reef marine microbiota lie mostly in cluster ii for 1 m reef surface water and cluster i for 10 m coral atoll water .

This disease outbreak has been reported among mussels and flounder species harvested from this area in the late spring to summer consistent with our seasonal finding   .CONCLUSIONSThis report compares the coral reef marine microbiota in the lower Gulf of Thailand between Kham and Kra Islands with 13 other coral sites and GOS sites which unveiled some patterns of diversity that might be essential to the coral reef ecosystem.

The obtained result was then compared with the published microbiota from different coral reef water and marine sites.

Together this study provided the second marine microbial database for the coral reef of the lower Gulf of Thailand and a comparison of the coral-associated marine microbial diversity among global ocean sites.2017 Somboonna et al.
