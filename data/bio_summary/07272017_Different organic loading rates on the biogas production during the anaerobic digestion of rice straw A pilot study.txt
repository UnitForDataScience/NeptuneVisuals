These results indicated that the continuous 300 m3 volume completely mixed reactor run well at the four different OLRs for biogas production.Overall difference in prokaryote diversity at different OLRsTo evaluate the prokaryotic community diversity and shifts in di- versity at different OLRs samples were collected from the biogas plant at the OLRs of 1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg VSsubstratem3d.

Most studies have reported straw biogas fermentation in the laboratory using small-scale reactors with relatively few studies using commercial reactors in particular the relationship between the biogas potential and microbial diversity under different OLRs has not been investigated in a commercial reactors.Straw biogas plants in China have the problems of low volumetric biogas production rates low material conversion rates and difficulties in importing and exporting straw from the reactor.

Meanwhile Environmental factors OLRs COD NH4 pH and VFAs had a great impact on the microbial community at the OLRs of 1.70 and 2.00 kg VSsubstratem3d ZJ-3 ZJ-4 ZJ-5 ZJ-6 while COD and OLRs have more influence on microbial community at the OLRs of 1.22 and 1.46 kg VSsubstratem3dZJ-1 ZJ-2.different OLR samples were also assessed by PcoA a.

The biogas production rates were 332.8 327.6 324.6 and 319.3 m3t dry rice straw when the OLRs were1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg VSsubstratem3d respectively and the total biogas production rate reached 323 m3t dry rice straw over the whole process.

The structure of the microbial community at the OLRs of 1.22 S1 S2 S3 and 1.46 S4 S5 S6 kg VSsubstratem3d were similar and the structure of the microbial community in 2.00 S10 S11 S12 2.00 S13 S14 S15 and 2.00 S16 S17 S18 kg VSsubstratem3d were similar at different times for the same OLR.

co-digested rice straw and pig manure with optimal organic loadings at OLRs of 3.0 3.6 4.2 4.8 6.0 8.0 and 12.0 g VSL d and a specific biogas pro- duction of 413 mLg VS was achieved at a range of OLRs from 3 to Corresponding author at College of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering Nanjing Tech University Box 77 No.
