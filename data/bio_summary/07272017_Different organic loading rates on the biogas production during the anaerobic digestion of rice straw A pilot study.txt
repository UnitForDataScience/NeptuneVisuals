1. dynamics of daily volumetric biogas production a methane and carbon dioxide concentration b during the anaerobic digestion of rice straw at 39 - 1 degc.the feeding pump due to the high total solid concentration of the feed liquid.the methane and carbon dioxide concentrations during the ad process of rice straw at different olrs are shown in b. at olrs of 1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg vssubstratem3d the methane con- centration was stable between 50.4 and 53.8 and the carbon dioxide concentration was stable between 44.1 and 47.8. this indicated that the biogas yield improved with increased olr a and the methane concentration of biogas was stable b which indicated that the methane yield increased synchronously.

meanwhile environmental factors olrs cod nh4 ph and vfas had a great impact on the microbial community at the olrs of 1.70 and 2.00 kg vssubstratem3d zj-3 zj-4 zj-5 zj-6 while cod and olrs have more influence on microbial community at the olrs of 1.22 and 1.46 kg vssubstratem3dzj-1 zj-2.different olr samples were also assessed by pcoa a. the points with different numbers in the figure represent samples taken at an olr of 1.22 s1 s2 s3 1.46 s4 s5 s6 1.70 s7 s8 s9 2.00 s10 s11 s12 2.00 s13 s14 s15 and 2.00 s16 s17 s18 kgvssubstratem3d.

these results indicated that the continuous 300 m3 volume completely mixed reactor run well at the four different olrs for biogas production.overall difference in prokaryote diversity at different olrsto evaluate the prokaryotic community diversity and shifts in di- versity at different olrs samples were collected from the biogas plant at the olrs of 1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg vssubstratem3d.

the biogas production rates were 332.8 327.6 324.6 and 319.3 m3t dry rice straw when the olrs were1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg vssubstratem3d respectively and the total biogas production rate reached 323 m3t dry rice straw over the whole process.

most studies have reported straw biogas fermentation in the laboratory using small-scale reactors with relatively few studies using commercial reactors in particular the relationship between the biogas potential and microbial diversity under different olrs has not been investigated in a commercial reactors.straw biogas plants in china have the problems of low volumetric biogas production rates low material conversion rates and difficulties in importing and exporting straw from the reactor.

from the relative abundance of methanogens it could be concluded that a suitable microenvironment was created at the olrs of 1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg vssubstratem3d which resulted in a high growth rate of methanogens with a stable relative abundance and then lead to the high methane production rate from rice straw.overall difference in prokaryotes associated with straw and slurrythe differences in prokaryotic communities between rice straw and slurry samples were also analyzed in order to reveal the spatial dis- tribution of microbiota that participated in the ad of rice straw .

daily biogas production volume and its composition at the different olrs are shown in a b. when the olr was 1.22 1.46 1.70 and 2.00 kg vssubstratem3d the average volumetric biogas production was 0.35 0.43 0.71 and 0.86 m3m3d respectively.

the objectives were1 to investigate the effects of olr on biogas production from rice straw 2 to determine the variations of the volatile fatty acid vfa concentration ph chemical oxygen demand cod and straw com- ponents and 3 to identify the microbial community structure at dif- ferent olrs during ad through high-throughput sequencing analysis.materials and methodsfeedstock preparationbriquettes of rice straw with a moisture content of 6-10 were collected from siyang jiangsu province and then ground to a particle size of approximately 10 mm.

the structure of the microbial community at the olrs of 1.22 s1 s2 s3 and 1.46 s4 s5 s6 kg vssubstratem3d were similar and the structure of the microbial community in 2.00 s10 s11 s12 2.00 s13 s14 s15 and 2.00 s16 s17 s18 kg vssubstratem3d were similar at different times for the same olr.

biogas plants for agricultural waste are classified as small medium large and super large with biogas production of 5-150 150-500 500-5000 and more than 5000 m3d while the annual average volumetric biogas production rates were only 0.214 0.276 0.512 and 0.485 m3m3d respectively .lignocellulosic straw has a high cn ratio strong floatation in areactor high lignin content and a cellulosic crystallinity that creates a harsh environment for anaerobic bacteria .

the biogas yield of this study was similar with the re- sults reported by  and they found that the biogas yields were 328.4 and 322.1 m3t dry rice straw when using steam explosion or citricacid pretreatment respectively.

therefore in this work a continuous 300 m3 completely mixed reactor was used to digest rice straw at different olrs for biogas production.
