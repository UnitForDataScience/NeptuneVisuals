whilst isola- tion of multiple colonies from a single sample is a laborious endeavour these studies reinforce the need to collect multiple isolates from individual samples to maximise capture of population diversity.the megaplasmid pc3 is nonessential to b. ubonensis replicationgene presenceabsence analysis of the 264 b. ubonensis genomes against the msmb0022 refer- ence showed that 2.78mbp 39 of the b. ubonensis reference genome was variably present with the remaining 4.41mbp conserved across these strains.

ubonensis rf23-bp41 does not cause disease in the immunocompetent balbc mouse modelunlike other bcc species or b. pseudomallei b. ubonensis is thought to rarely if ever cause dis- ease in humans  as evidenced by b. ubonensis being the only bcc species not yet retrieved from cystic fibrosis sputum .

however another possibility is that certain b. ubonensis strains are in fact capable of causing disease with such cases remaining unreported due to insufficient or inaccurate differentiation of b. ubonensis from other bcc species.to further examine the virulence potential of b. ubonensis we inoculated balbc mice via sc injection using 1.7x 104 105 and 106 cfu of the thai strain rf23-bp41.

antibiotic resistance in b. ubonensis particularly towards drugs used to treat the most severe b. pseudomallei infections has also been poorly characterised.this study examined the population biology of b. ubonensis and includes the first reported isolates from the caribbean.

in addition it has been reported that the atypical b. pseudomallei o-antigen type b is found in 25 of b. ubonensis strains from australia  fur- ther complicating the differentiation between these species due to their immunological cross- reactivity.little is currently known about the population biology and genomics of b. ubonensis although a clearer picture is emerging.

ubonensis murine challengethe ability of b. ubonensis to cause disease via the subcutaneous sc route of infection was examined in a murine balbc model using a thai environmental isolate rf23-bp41   collected by northern arizona university in 2007. we compared the results to sc infec- tion with b. thailandensis type strain e264 which is known to cause death in mice at high doses 106 colony forming units or cfu when delivered via the intraperitoneal intranasal   or aerosol  routes.

it remains to be determined whether b. ubonensis is found in other melioidosis-endemic regions such as africa central america the indian ocean islands south america or south asia.a b. ubonensis phylogeny was reconstructed from 264 genomes derived from australian thai png and puerto rican isolates to determine the existence of a continental phylogeo- graphic signal a phenomenon that has been described in b. pseudomallei   .

due to limited availability of b. ubonensis from png it could not be determined whether other png isolates group with a21 although we hypothesise that png b. ubonensis strains will be related based on the relatively narrow genetic diversity observed in png b. pseudomallei populations  .

taken together these results demonstrate that like b. pseudomallei b. ubonensis populations exhibit a continental phylogeographic signal although more samples from asia and png would be needed to improve resolution of subclades within clade i.comparison of phylogenomic structure and mlstwe compared b. ubonensis mlst genotypes obtained using both the b. pseudomallei and bcc mlst schemes with phylogenomic assignment to determine whether the sts reflected isolate relatedness on the genome level  or whether homoplasy was evident among sts as has been observed with certain b. pseudomallei sts  .

alternatively resistance may have arisen multiple times or through multiple mechanisms during the evolu- tion of b. ubonensis due to similar environmental pressures.many other bcc species strains can exhibit high-level meropenem resistance   indi- cating that this trait is not specific to b. ubonensis although the basis for this resistance and its persistence in bcc populations is not clear.

the selective forces acting upon bcc strains in patients receiving meropenem or other antibiotics may encourage this phenotype to persist in the population although the lack of human b. ubonensis infections and the identification of high-level meropenem resistance in environmental samples argue against this route of selec- tion in the context of b. ubonensis.

determining the molecular basis for high-level meropenem resistance in b. ubonensis and inother bcc species should be a focus of future studies to not only promote a better understand- ing of resistance mechanisms in these species but to also provide a basis for proactive moni- toring of b. pseudomallei populations in the event of carbapenamase acquisition.genetic diversity of b. ubonensismlst revealed that b. ubonensis is a highly diverse species.

of the 51 samples where two or more b. ubonensis isolates were retrieved 26 51 exhibited two or more sts revealing that multiple b. ubonensis geno- types commonly exist within single environmental samples.
