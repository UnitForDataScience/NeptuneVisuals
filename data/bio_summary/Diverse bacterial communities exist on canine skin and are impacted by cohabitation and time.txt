The study by has improved our knowledge on the composition of the skin microbiome of healthy dogs previously based only on culture-dependent methods.However there is still much to be learned regarding the structure of the microbial communities that live on the skin of healthy dogs and the factors that shape these communities.The primary aims of this study were to evaluate if there is a core bacterial community living on the skin of healthy domestic dogs from Minnesota USA and if body sitedog cohabitation and seasonality have an impact on this community.METHODSStudy designHealthy privately owned paired dogs n  40 of various breeds from 20 households were enrolled in this study through the University of Minnesota Veterinary Medical Center.

This study showed that the canine bacterial community is diverse and quite variable across different body sites within the same dog and across the same site in different dogs suggesting that the skin microenvironment in dogs does not substantially impact the composition of its bacterial community.

To be included in the study the dogs were required to 1 be healthy based on a thorough history and clinical signs2 not receive any systemic or topical antimicrobial therapy for at least three months prior to enrollment and 3 not be bathed for at least 30 days before inclusion.Furthermore in order for a household to participate in the study none of the animals in the household could have skin or ear disease and cohabiting dogs had to be living together for at least six months and spend at least 80 of the time together.

Interestingly a study using culture-based methods found P. acnes in the epidermis and hair follicles of seven of 11 63.6 dogs suggesting that this bacterium is indeed an important skin resident of dogs .

That is dogs that live together have significantly more similar bacterial communities than dogs not living together.

Moreover the temporal stability of the healthy human skin microbiome was recently investigated and diversity skin site and individuality were all determinants of stability  .Despite the wealth of information regarding the skin microbiome of healthy humans current knowledge in healthy domestic dogs Canis familiaris comes primarily from a study by .

Similar to human skin the most abundant phyla identified in dogs were Proteobacteria Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Bacteroides.

However Actinobacteria has been shown to predominate in humans whereas it was less abundant in dogs     .

Host and environmental factors such as age sex breed fleas and time spent outside do not appear to influence the composition of the bacterial community in dogs.

Owners signed an informed consent at the time of enrollment and were allowed to withdraw their dogs at any time during the study.
