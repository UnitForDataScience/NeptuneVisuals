The human gut virome composed mainly of bacteriophages  and the mycobiome composed of yeasts and other fungi  have the potential to modify and regulate bacterial communities and hence modify and regulate human health.

Although some findings from metagenomic and metabolomic approaches to neglected tropical diseases are already available  meta-omic developments in the study of human gut parasitome are still in their infancy.In this review omic technologies  applied to the study of human gut parasites i.e.

Based on these pivotal discoveries Schistosoma FABPs and GSTs were selected by the World Health Organization as anti-Schistosoma vaccine candidates .ESP-induced early changes in host cells highlighted by proteomics were also confirmed for Opisthorchis viverrini   and indeed plasma actin-related protein 3 ARP3 autoantibody and 14-3-3 eta protein were identified as putative new diagnostic markers of opisthorchiasis  .Below omics-based investigations on human gut protozoa and worms will be discussed to update the state of the art on gut parasitome citizens by omic technologies.MethodsLiterature searches in PubMed until October 31 2016 were performed using a search strategy designed to identify relevant studies for this review from the following 2 categories i evaluat- ing genes transcripts proteins and metabolites of parasites colonisinginvading the human gut and ii approaches in omics-based research methodologies.

Moreover new metaproteomic procedures MS differential profiling by multiple reaction monitoring-like acquisition now available for prokaryotic communities need to be applied to eukaryotic citizens the parasitome of the gut ecological system in order to greatly improve the distinction between host and parasite proteins as well as to iden- tify as-yet unknown proteins.Therefore omic technologies are now promising tools capable of leading to the discovery of new key pathways which may improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for parasite- linked GI diseases within the context of microbiotaparasitomehost co-metabolism and response to infections .AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank the English-speaking experts from BioMed Proofreading LLC for man- uscript revision.ReferencesYatsunenko T Rey FE Manary MJ Trehan I Dominguez-Bello MG Contreras M et al.
