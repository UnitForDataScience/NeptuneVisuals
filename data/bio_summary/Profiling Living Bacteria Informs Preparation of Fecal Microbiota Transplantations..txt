We then evaluated the replicates' resulting microbial composition using standard 16S rRNA sequencing  and PMA-seq which selectively sequences DNA from bacteria with intact cell mem- branes--a proxy for living cells -.From our sequencing data we generated two tables of operational taxonomic units OTU one with 1362 OTUs clustered at 97 similarity  and another with 77 high-confi- dence OTUs--ones present in all sequencing samples--clustered at 100 similarity .Oxygen exposure during fecal homogenization alters the composition of living fecal bacteriaTo test the effects on fecal bacteria of oxygen exposure during stool sample homogenization we prepared subsamples from two stool samples from a single donor using five different proce- dures each with a different level of oxygen exposure  .

We used qPCR results from the initial qPCR of each DNA sam- ple to normalize our relative-abundance results.Identifying OTUs that changed significantly in abundanceTo identify OTUs that differed significantly in abundance between transplant preparations we built an analysis pipeline that involved two primary steps first fitting OTU abundance data from each DNA sample to the Poisson log-normal distribution which allows for cross com- parisons and second fitting these comparisons to a generalized normal distribution which provides a null model against which we could compare and thereby identify OTUs with sig- nificant changes in abundance.For the first analysis step we started by creating an OTU table with high-confidence OTUs.

If F. prausnitzii has therapeutic effects--as has been posited for inflammatory bowel disease --aerobic processing of fecal transplants may decrease therapeutic effi- cacy for treating inflammatory diseases.Degradation of the microbial community with increasing oxygen exposure indicates that therapeutic efficacy for fecal microbiota transplants--particularly in diseases other than C. dif- ficile infection--may be best preserved by maintaining anaerobic conditions during sample processing for example by using anaerobic chambers and oxygen-free buffers and storage for example by using oxygen-impermeable containers and monitoring for oxygen exposure.

Other methods to quan- tify bacterial communities--such as 16S-rRNA sequencing qPCR or fluorescence microscopy--either fail to identify individual bacterial taxa or fail to target only living cells which are presumably the therapeutic agent of fecal microbiota transplants.

For example the most abundant OTUs within the genus Oscillospira did not all exhibit the same dynamics in response to oxygen exposure .Freeze-thaw cycles and lag time have smaller effects on fecal bacterial compositionIn addition to oxygen exposure during homogenization we also used PMA-seq to evaluate the effects of freeze-thaw cycles and lag time--common concerns when working with gutPMA-seq registers little alteration of the living bacterial community with more freeze-thaw cycles.

These results confirmed that PMA-seq more clearly reflects changes in bacterial composition due to differential oxygen exposure than does standard 16S sequencing.Given that PMA-seq reflects only living bacteria and standard 16S rRNA sequencing ought to more closely reflect the entire bacterial community we hypothesized that comparingsequencing results from each of these methods might provide a proxy for how much a bacterial community has been degraded.

We considered those OTUs whose Dz and DF values fell outside of 95 of the null model distribution--values that had only a 5 chance of occurring in compari- sons of technical replicates--as putatively significant .

In addition our results validate PMA-seq as a useful tool for comparing fecal microbiota samples.MainTo understand how transplant handling might alter fecal microbial communities--which may affect therapeutic efficacy--we investigated three potential sources of degradation oxygen exposure during homogenization freeze-thaw cycles during transplant storage and transport and lag time between defecation and transplant preparation.

By addressing these short- comings PMA-seq could provide quality control and reduce sources of variability in fecal microbiota transplants.Materials and MethodsSample preparationTo prepare fecal microbiota transplants for PMA-seq analysis we used modified protocols based on standard practices at OpenBiome  the largest stool bank in the United States.
