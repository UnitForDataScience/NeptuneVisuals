we then evaluated the replicates' resulting microbial composition using standard 16s rrna sequencing  and pma-seq which selectively sequences dna from bacteria with intact cell mem- branes--a proxy for living cells -.from our sequencing data we generated two tables of operational taxonomic units otu one with 1362 otus clustered at 97 similarity  and another with 77 high-confi- dence otus--ones present in all sequencing samples--clustered at 100 similarity .oxygen exposure during fecal homogenization alters the composition of living fecal bacteriato test the effects on fecal bacteria of oxygen exposure during stool sample homogenization we prepared subsamples from two stool samples from a single donor using five different proce- dures each with a different level of oxygen exposure  .

if f. prausnitzii has therapeutic effects--as has been posited for inflammatory bowel disease --aerobic processing of fecal transplants may decrease therapeutic effi- cacy for treating inflammatory diseases.degradation of the microbial community with increasing oxygen exposure indicates that therapeutic efficacy for fecal microbiota transplants--particularly in diseases other than c. dif- ficile infection--may be best preserved by maintaining anaerobic conditions during sample processing for example by using anaerobic chambers and oxygen-free buffers and storage for example by using oxygen-impermeable containers and monitoring for oxygen exposure.

otus from the genus bac- teroides were most often identified as oxygen resistant in our data which aligns with previous evidence that some bacteroides species can survive or even grow during short periods of oxy- gen exposure .to identify individual otus that significantly changed in abundance between different transplant preparations we created an analysis pipeline based on texmex  which modelspma-seq reveals changes in bacterial community composition with oxygen exposure.

using this pipeline and our table of high-confidence otus we found that otus that decreased significantly in abundance during oxygen exposure most often belonged to the genera faecalibacterium megamonas and bifidobacterium mirroringresponses to oxygen exposure cluster taxonomically.

for example the most abundant otus within the genus oscillospira did not all exhibit the same dynamics in response to oxygen exposure .freeze-thaw cycles and lag time have smaller effects on fecal bacterial compositionin addition to oxygen exposure during homogenization we also used pma-seq to evaluate the effects of freeze-thaw cycles and lag time--common concerns when working with gutpma-seq registers little alteration of the living bacterial community with more freeze-thaw cycles.

we used qpcr results from the initial qpcr of each dna sam- ple to normalize our relative-abundance results.identifying otus that changed significantly in abundanceto identify otus that differed significantly in abundance between transplant preparations we built an analysis pipeline that involved two primary steps first fitting otu abundance data from each dna sample to the poisson log-normal distribution which allows for cross com- parisons and second fitting these comparisons to a generalized normal distribution which provides a null model against which we could compare and thereby identify otus with sig- nificant changes in abundance.for the first analysis step we started by creating an otu table with high-confidence otus.

in addition our results validate pma-seq as a useful tool for comparing fecal microbiota samples.mainto understand how transplant handling might alter fecal microbial communities--which may affect therapeutic efficacy--we investigated three potential sources of degradation oxygen exposure during homogenization freeze-thaw cycles during transplant storage and transport and lag time between defecation and transplant preparation.

otus that increased often belonged to bacteroides including b. ovatus b. uniformis and b. caccae .although responses to oxygen exposure by individual otus largely reflected the patterns of larger taxonomic groups pma-seq detected some heterogeneity in these responses .

notably the abundance of faecalibacterium prausnitzii--an anti-inflammatory commensal bacte- rium whose absence is linked to inflammatory bowel disease--decreased with oxygen exposure.

thus by decreasing the viability of f. prausnitzii cells during oxygen exposure we may be compromising the therapeutic value of fecal trans- plant material.we also identified oxygen-resistant bacteria--such as bacteroides parabacteroides barne- siellaceae and rikenellaceae--that increased in relative abundance figs and  .

in contrast the same distributions for different oxygen preparations diverged dramatically  emphasizing a shift in community composition.our results suggest that moderate numbers of freeze-thaw cycles and moderate lag times-- particularly if stool samples are covered--do not alter fecal microbial communities as much as oxygen exposure during homogenization and may in fact not greatly affect therapeutic efficacy.discussionalthough previous studies have evaluated the effects of various collection and storage methods on 16s rrna extraction - to our knowledge ours is the first analysis of how these vari- ables alter the representation of living bacteria.

oxygen exposure disproportionately affected bacteria from the phylum firmicutes--particularly the genera megamonas and faecalibacter- ium--while bacteria from the genus bacteroides appeared to be more oxygen-tolerant .

the funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.introductionfecal microbiota transplantation--the transfer of fecal microbes from a donor to a patient-- has emerged as an extremely effective therapy for recurrent infections of clostridium difficile 90 cure rate a common hospital infection that kills nearly 30000 patients each year .

other methods to quan- tify bacterial communities--such as 16s-rrna sequencing qpcr or fluorescence microscopy--either fail to identify individual bacterial taxa or fail to target only living cells which are presumably the therapeutic agent of fecal microbiota transplants.

we considered those otus whose dz and df values fell outside of 95 of the null model distribution--values that had only a 5 chance of occurring in compari- sons of technical replicates--as putatively significant .
