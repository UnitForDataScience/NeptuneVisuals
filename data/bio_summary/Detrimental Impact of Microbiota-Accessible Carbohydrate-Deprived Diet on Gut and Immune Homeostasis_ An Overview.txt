While most studies focus on SCFAs as critical in promoting beneficial effects of MACs in diseases it is important to note that beneficial changes in the microbiota by itself is also critical as treatment with SCFAs in drinking water only partially recapitulates the effects of MACs  .TABLe 1  Microbiota changes in mice fed on low dietary microbiota-accessible carbohydrates MACs.StudiesMice studied Method used for gutanalysisLow-MAC dietComparator dietChanges observed in low-MAC diet groupDecreaseincreaseDesai et al.
