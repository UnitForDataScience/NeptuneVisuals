an- other recent study reported that in 2010-2011 among correspondence 1department of obstetrics and gynaecology the irish centre for fetal andneonatal translational research infant university college cork cork ireland3department of epidemiology and public health university college corkcork irelandfull list of author information is available at the end of the articlethe 21 countries included the rate of cs in countries with a high human development index hdi was 40.0 in countries with moderate hdi it was 32.4 and in countries with low hdi it was 20.3 given such a large and growing rate of cs it is becoming of increas- ing interest to understand potential long-term effects of birth by cs  as even a small increase in risk could potentially have a large impact globally.it has been hypothesised that birth by cs leads to changes in psychological development due to early term birth  or alterations in microbiota or stress response in animal models birth by cs and changes in microbiota have been associated with changes inc the authors.

therefore if cs has an impact on behavioural development it may lead to changes in overall school performance.elective cs has been associated with delays in personal social skills and gross motor function at age 9 months and early term birth has been associated with in- creased special education requirements  however to our knowledge no one has examined the potential asso- ciation between obstetric mode of delivery more specif- ically birth by cs and school performance.

to that end the objective of the current study was to investigate the possible impact of birth by cs on school performance in a large population-based swedish cohort.methodsdatastudy populationwe included data from 4 swedish registers medical birth register national school register multi-generation register and national patient register.

similarly there seemed to be no family effect seen by creating a random intercept for maternal id or restricting the population based on family size and birth order data not shown available on request.when school performance was divided into subjects the association was similar to the overall association between birth by cs and poor school performance additional file  table s4.quantile regressionthere was little difference in the distribution of grades by mode of delivery fig.

however it is also possible that birth by cs may lead to sub-clinical changes in behavioural development for example increased anx- iety that are not included in official diagnoses.

the medical birth register was established in 1973 and includes data on over 98 of all births in sweden .

for our cohort we in- cluded all live singleton births in the swedish medical birth register that occurred between 1982 and 1995. as both mode of delivery and school performance are likely to be highly correlated in multiple births these were ex- cluded.

informed consent was waived by the ethics committee.exposure-obstetric mode of deliveryobstetric mode of delivery extracted from the medical birth register consisted of unassisted vaginal deliveryvd assisted vd elective cs and emergency cs.

we also excluded children born through a secondary cs children born by cs whose mothers' had previously given birth through cs and children with a low apgar score at 5 min.

children who did not complete the compulsory years of schooling.additionally we conducted logistic regression to as- sess the association between birth by cs and school per- formance in five subject categories  natural sciences biology chemistry and physics social sciences geog- raphy religion history and society knowledge arts art and handicraft sports and swedish.

adjusting for birth year year of receiving grades and parental education for those born after 1990 had no effect on results additional file table s1 and additional file  table s2.

excluding scores of 0 did not change results data not shown available on request.discussionmain findingswe assessed the impact of obstetric mode of delivery and in particular birth by cs on school performance atage 16 using a large population-based cohort.

there was a slight association between birth by cs and a reduc- tion in school performance in both analyses.

with quantile re- gression analysis there again appeared to be a slight association between birth by cs and school perform- ance primarily in adjusted results.
