An- other recent study reported that in 2010-2011 among Correspondence 1Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology The Irish Centre for Fetal andNeonatal Translational Research INFANT University College Cork Cork Ireland3Department of Epidemiology and Public Health University College CorkCork IrelandFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlethe 21 countries included the rate of CS in countries with a high Human Development Index HDI was 40.0 in countries with moderate HDI it was 32.4 and in countries with low HDI it was 20.3 Given such a large and growing rate of CS it is becoming of increas- ing interest to understand potential long-term effects of birth by CS  as even a small increase in risk could potentially have a large impact globally.It has been hypothesised that birth by CS leads to changes in psychological development due to early term birth  or alterations in microbiota or stress response In animal models birth by CS and changes in microbiota have been associated with changes inc The Authors.

Similarly there seemed to be no family effect seen by creating a random intercept for maternal ID or restricting the population based on family size and birth order Data not shown available on request.When school performance was divided into subjects the association was similar to the overall association between birth by CS and poor school performance Additional file  Table S4.Quantile regressionThere was little difference in the distribution of grades by mode of delivery Fig.

Therefore if CS has an impact on behavioural development it may lead to changes in overall school performance.Elective CS has been associated with delays in personal social skills and gross motor function at age 9 months and early term birth has been associated with in- creased special education requirements  However to our knowledge no one has examined the potential asso- ciation between obstetric mode of delivery more specif- ically birth by CS and school performance.

To that end the objective of the current study was to investigate the possible impact of birth by CS on school performance in a large population-based Swedish cohort.MethodsDataStudy PopulationWe included data from 4 Swedish Registers Medical Birth Register National School Register Multi-Generation Register and National Patient Register.

Excluding scores of 0 did not change results Data not shown available on request.DiscussionMain findingsWe assessed the impact of obstetric mode of delivery and in particular birth by CS on school performance atage 16 using a large population-based cohort.

There was a slight association between birth by CS and a reduc- tion in school performance in both analyses.

Children born by elective or emergency CS had a 1-5 point decrease in score across the distribution translating to a 0.31- 1.56 decrease.InterpretationThere are several possible explanations for an observed association between birth by CS and a small reduction in school performance.

A range of characteristics influ- ence school performance including not only behaviour and personality but also cognitive ability and external factors such as ethnic diversity in the dis- trict It is possible that rather than having an effect across this wide range of factors and behaviours birth by CS is having an effect on only one aspect such as anxiety.

With these robust analysis methods we have concluded there is a slight association between birth by CS and poor school performance.
