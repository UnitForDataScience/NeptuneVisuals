in multicellular bodies cheating on the foundations of multicellular cooperation typically gives rise to cancer or cancer-like phenomena  these forms of cheating often lead to radical performance improvements for the cheating cells and change their microenvironment which establishes new ecological space for further cellular evolution thus cooperation and cheating in multicellular life can be considered a sort of arms race between cellular societies evolving to promote cooperation and suppress cheating within while the cells within evolve to 'break' the rules of multicellularity in order to maximize cell-level fitness.the innovation of growth control in the evolution of mul- ticellularity created the opportunity for cells to cheat by not regulating their growth while their neighbours do.

this vulnerability is inherent to our bodies because cells within us including both cancer cells and pathogens can innovate as well some- times exploiting those very innovations that enabled us to become multicellular.complex multicellularity evolved as a result of many innovations for cellular cooperation being brought together under one umbrella internal pentagon in 1. these include innovations for economic cooperation among cells division of cellular labour resource sharingtransportation systems and the creationmaintenance of the extracellular environment.

mutation and natural selection have generated a suite of innovations in cellular cooperation including division of labour resource allocation and inhi- bition of cellular reproduction that made multicellular life possible as reviewed in these complex forms of cellular cooperation gave rise to many opportunities for cellular cheating which cells then evolved to take advantage of through new innovations for cheating.

dysregulation of the insulin system in the form of diabetes leads to an increased risk of cancer thought to be due to a loss of growth control there is evidence that metformin a diabetes drug prevents cancer  similarly crespi  semeniuk have argued that the complexity in the reproductive system is due to the difficulty of managing cooperation and cheating in parent-offspring conflict looking at multicellularity we see that innovations in cooperation led to more opportunities for cheating and cheating spurs the need for more complex and well-coordi- nated forms of cooperation and conflict management cell cycle controls help regulate multicellular phenotypes but can be disrupted by cells that proliferate too quickly and exploit the body.

this can tip the scales in favour of mechanisms that increase cellular cooperation within the multicellular body and reduce conflict among cells within the body these multicellular life cycles also open up new ecological space with cells creating and maintaining an extracellular environment that is both their ecological niche and the substrate through which they express their life-history strategy.

for example during the evolution of multicellu- larity cells evolved seemingly minor innovations such as the inhibition of proliferation in response to environmental stres- ses and controlled cell death but these more minor innovations set the stage for a much larger qualitative shift in cellular sociality--allowing cells to form proper multicellular bodies that regulate their growth and size rather than just being a collection of cells.innovations occur in large and diverse societiessocieties innovate new ideas and inventions arise that are adopted and spread through the population through a process of memetic selection - sometimes to the benefit of that society and other times to its detriment but it is not just human societies that innovate societies of cells--in our bodies and in our environment--innovate as well.

the difficulty of controlling cheat- ing when genetically diverse cells come together to form an organism probably explains why multicellular aggregates such as dictyostelium are generally smaller and less complex than multicellular organisms that develop as a clone from a unicellular bottleneck in fact one viable strategy for stabilizing cooperation in aggregative multicellularity is for the cooperating cells to 'walk away' from aggregates where the burden of cheaters is too high the ability to walk away also applies to cheaters which may spread fromone multicellular aggregate to another clonal multicellu- 4 lar organisms avoid this problem by passing through a unicellular life stage e.g.

both innovations in cellular cooperation and innovations in cellular cheating have shaped multicellularity in important ways enabling the evolution of large body size long lifespan  the adaptive immune system and even sexual ornamentation - but biological innovations have also introduced new challenges leaving multicellular bodies susceptible to cancer infectious disease and autoimmune disorders.

evolution within cellular societies can occur rapidly with generation times as short as 20 min in bacteria and 24 h in cancer cells in comparison to evolution at the level of the multicellular organism.

this includes the evolution of multicellularity itself the con- trol of cellular cheating in the form of cancer the evolution of the adaptive immune system to counter exploitation from pathogens and also the evolution of cooperative partnerships between multicellular bodies and the microbial species that reside in and on them.

by understanding innovations in cooperation and cheating that occur in cellular societies we can more effec- tively promote and protect the cellular cooperation that makes us viable multicellular organisms.data accessibility.

cycles realized through coordination of the foundations of multicellular cooperation appear to represent a key inno- vation in the evolution of life.the five foundations of multicellular cooperation arose every time organismal multicellularity evolved.

innovations that enhance multicellular fit- ness are referred to as cooperative those that comprise multicellular fitness are referred to as cheating.innovations in cellular cooperation spurred the evolution of multicellularitynatural selection is perhaps the most powerful force shaping biological innovation.

then approximately 2 billion years ago evolution generated one of the most spectacular innovations in the history of life multicellularity  complex multicellularity with tissue differentiation inter-cellular communi- cation and cells that are not in direct contact with the environment evolved only 1 billion years ago and has evolved independently since then at least seven times the evolution of multicellularity required the constraint of evol- ution and innovations at the cell level which if left unchecked can lead to cancer and the death of the organism - multicellularity itself is an inno- vation that spawned further innovations in the organization specialization and regulation of those cells.
