since animals suffer from similar oral biofilm infections phages can first be commercialised for oral veterinary medicine and later gradually introduced to human oral healthcare.biocontrol of oral biofilms and systemic healththere is increasing evidence that pathogens from oral biofilms can directly and indirectly impact systemic health  oral pathogens can often enter a blood stream during dental procedures and spread systemically  precise phage-based elimination of these pathogens from the mouth may be desirable.

engineered lysins exhibit a wider host range  the specificity of the lysins was attributed to the requirement for the substrate interpeptide bridge sequence - either lysine-alanine1-3 ph15 or lysine-alanine2-3 cpo1205 - or the requirement for the choline- bound teichoic acid receptor ph10  some lysins may not be suitable as therapeu- tics one from phage sm1 interacts with fibrinogen and in this way contributes to platelet binding  in summary lysins are a novel type of antimicrobials that can be used to target oral bacteria.the use of bacteriophages to biocontrol oral biofilmsthe reviewed studies provided the evidence that phages and their enzymes possess antimicrobial properties against oral bacte- ria here the effect of phages on bacteria organised in biofilms is described.effect of bacteriophages on oral biofilmsthe five studies that investigated the effect of phages on oral biofilms of a. actinomycetemcomitans e. faecalis and s. mutans are listed in in all studies counts of viable bacteria were signif- icantly reduced in the presence of phages ranging from 2.3 log10 reduction to complete clearing.

urology dermatology  here we argue that phages can be used to biocontrol the pathogens in oral biofilms.phages for oral bacteriawe reviewed the studies that describe the detection isola- tion and characterisation of phages for oral bacteria as well as the composition and activity of the oral phage commu- nity.

the research on streptococcal phages and their enzymes has led to patents on phage-based biocontrol of oral infections  bacteriophages for oral anaerobesoral anaerobes representing the genera fusobacterium phylum fusobacteria porphyromonas prevotella tannerella all phylum bacteroidetes treponema phylum synergistetes and veillonella phylum firmicutes contribute to periodontal disease and have also been reported in other oral and extra-oral infections in total 31 phages for oral anaerobes have been reported fusobacteriumtwo virulent phages infecting fusobacterium nucleatum have been isolated from saliva samples one of these siphovirus fnpcp02 targeted three subsp.

three stud- ies reported phage typing of the staphylococci isolated from the oral cavity temperate phages were induced from the fresh oral isolate of staphylococcus epidermidis putative phages for oral members of genera campylobacter car- diobacterium gemmella granulicatella haemophilus leptotrichia and oribacterium have been detected by metagenomics but have not been isolated so far  in summary the oral cavity is inhabited by hundreds of bacterial species of which more than half have been cultured.

the oral microbiome is one of the best studied human- associated habitats oral bacteria archaea viruses fungi and protozoa can thrive in biofilms that are normally controlled by saliva flow the host immune defence and daily oral hygiene.

dental implants used to replace teeth are also readily colonised by periodontopathogens that can even quicker damage peri-implant tissue and ultimately cause implant failure dental caries and periodontitis affect 91 and 46 of adult west- ern populations respectively  prevalences of 43 and 22 have been estimated for peri-implant mucositis inflammation in the soft tissue surrounding a dental implant and peri-implantitis characterised by the loss of bone supporting the dental implant respectively  the oral biofilm-associated diseases greatly influence qual- ity of life systemic health and expenditure  good oral hygiene low dietary carbo- hydrate intake and non-smoking favours but does not guarantee oral health.

in the following sections we describe phages for oral members of genera actinomyces aggregatibacter enterococcus streptococcus oral anaerobes and other oral bacteria.actinomyces spp.

are usually associated with oral health but are also commonly found in oral abscesses and rarely cause the oral and extra-oral chronic suppurative infections called actinomycosis in total 87 mostly strictly lytic phages targeting a. naeslundii sensu lato have been reported they were classified into the families siphoviridae 61 podoviridae 11 or their morphol- ogy was not characterised.

myoviruses cpaa originally named cpaa17 and aacp23 are the two best studied aggregatibacter phages phage cpaa has a relatively broad host range since it was able to lyse all 8 tested indicator strains in another study more than 80 of 65 indicator strains were targeted usually by several phages in summary aggregatibacter phages are surprisingly common and easy to isolate but mostly temperate and their potential impact on pathogenesis is unknown.table 1characteristics of selected bacteriophages for oral bacteria.table 1 continueda m myoviridae p podoviridae s siphoviridae t temperate u unknown v virulent strictly lytic.b names created from the last digits of the lysogen collection number.c full name vb smm gec-smitism 2.d genome accession number of phage or lysogen.enterococcus bacteriophagesenterococcus faecalis is an extra-oral commensal that can be occasionally found in tooth root canal infections and on ailing implants both strictly lytic and temperate phages have been shown to infect oral isolates of e. fae- calis  genetics of three phages cpef11 efdg1 and eflk1 were studied by full genome sequencing  passage of phage cpef11 through the e. faecalis strain jh2-2 harbouring a defective prophage produced a new vari- ant with superior antimicrobial properties in summary lysogeny was commonly observed among the e. faecalis strains of oral origin.

lac- tobacillus species that opportunistically colonise the oral cavity have been linked to dental caries the iso- lation of phages for the caries-associated lactobacillus casei and6 additional lactobacillus species was reported earlier  subsequent broad screening of 189 salivary lacto- bacillus strains for potential lysogens failed  .the authors then reported the isolation of lactobacillus phages and phage-like molecules but it was unclear which fraction of the studied strains was of oral origin  more recently two non-functional prophages were detected in the genome of l. plantarum strain wcfs1 isolated from human saliva  oral commensal neisseria spp.

on the basis of viral dna sequencing studies we know that a diverse group of phages dominate the oral viral community  the members of the phyla actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmi- cutes fusobacteria and proteobacteria are the predominant phage hosts depending on individual biogeographical and clinical status siphoviruses are prevailing persistent and are expected to be mostly temperate  rodriguez in periodontal disease however mostly strictly lytic myoviruses replace siphoviruses in subgingival plaque as assessed by dna sequencing but not confirmed by rna profil- ing oral phages are generally harmless for human cells but can be a reservoir for virulence genes involved in immune evasion and extra-oral coloni- sation profiling phage hosts can provide additional information about phage dynamics and specificity.

enterococci are occasionally involved in oral infection and can be controlled with the wide range of available phages.streptococcus bacteriophagesstreptococci are the most abundant constituent of the indige- nous health-associated oral flora colonising enamel and soft tissues a few streptococcus species e.g.
