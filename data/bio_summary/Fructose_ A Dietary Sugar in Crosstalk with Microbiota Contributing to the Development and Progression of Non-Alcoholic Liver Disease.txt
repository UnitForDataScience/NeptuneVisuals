In line a diet enriched in fructose not only induced NAFLD but also negatively affected the gut barrier and the microbiota leading to dysbiosis .In addition the microbiota itself was shown to contribute to the progression of liver disease and injury and diet-induced NAFLD resulted in dysbiosis and a strong decrease in microbial diversity .

While a Western- diet high in sucrose primarily promoted weight gain the intake of fructose especially in combination with a Western diet caused barrier dysfunction accompanied with loss of mucus thicknessand endotoxin translocation .Mice with a knockout in the F11r gene encoding the tight junction adhesion molecule A showed increased infiltration of intrahepatic macrophages elevated recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the liver upregulation of TLRs and higher contentTABLe 1  Fructose in the crosstalk with microbiota in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.Species TreatmentFindingsConclusionReferenceMouseDiet high in saturated fatfructose and cholesterol for 8 weeksF11r-- mice with defects in intestinal epithelial permeability developed more severe steatohepatitis than control mice.Diet-induced microbial dysbiosis contribute to the development of NASH.Rahman et al.

Fructose-rich diet in combination with antibiotics for 8 weeksDiet enriched in copper combined with drinking water containing 30 fructose60 isonitrogenous fructose diet for 4 weeksHFD for 5 weeks with or without a synbiotic composed out of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 and fructooligosaccharides70 ww high-fructose diet for 3 weeks with or without oral addition of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus plantarumFructose-rich diet for 8 weeks combined with oral treatment with either antibiotics or fecal samples from control ratsAfter 4 weeks of treatment fructose-fed rats exhibited higher values of fasting plasma insulin and homeostatic model assessment HOMA index.

Therefore the authors suggested exercise as a factor for remodeling micro- biota and gut health which is negatively influenced by highfat diets preventing microbiota differentiation in response to exercise .CONCLUSiONNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a systemic disease induced and modulated by different metabolic components in which the liver is the main affected organ.

RatDiet enriched in fat and fructose The diet induced a marked i increase in A. muciniphila in cecal microbiota ii dramaticchanges in the colon mucosa-associated microbiota with a significant decrease in total bacteria Clostridium leptum BacteroidesPrevotella and LactobacillusLeuconostoc iii decreased expression of claudin-1 and iv increased expression of Tnf-a and Tlr4.Diets enriched in fructose reduce bacterial colonization lead to dysbiosis increase numbers of mucin-degrading bacteria and provoke inflammation in colon mucosa thereby supporting NAFLD progression.Jegatheesan et al.

In a kind of circle the increase in body fat mass correlated with shifts in the gut microbiota and gut-brain communication possibly providing the basis for the pathogenesis of obesity .Jegatheesan reported about alterations in colon mucosa- associated microbiota feeding a Western diet high in fat and fructose for 8 weeks .

Triggers that provoke intestinal leakage such as fructose cause a shift in this homeostasis favoring proinflammatory microbiota suppression of anti-inflammatory microbiota and reduction of their overall diversity.FRUCTOSe-iNDUCeD PRODUCTiON OF URiC ACiD FURTHeR PROvOKeS LiveR DAMAGeIt was demonstrated that a Western diet leads to an increase in uric acid within the blood and that measured serum levels of uric acid directly correlate to the intake of fructose .

A synbiotic composed of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 and FOS prevents the development of fatty acid liver and glycemic alterations in rats fed a high fructose diet associated with changes in the microbiota.

showed that a shift from a Mediterranean diet MD rich in polysaccharides to a Western diet high in fat and sugar low in fiber is able to alter microbiota within a day .
