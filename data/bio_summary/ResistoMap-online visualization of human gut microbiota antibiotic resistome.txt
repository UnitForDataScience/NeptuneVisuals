the pool of antibiotic resistance ar genes that increases in abundance during antibiotic treatment becomes a 'tinderbox' the transmission of these genes to a pathogen has dire consequences for both the patient and society.semi-quantitative analysis of the functional composition of micro- biota using 'shotgun' metagenomics allows the assessment of relative abundance of ar genes in human microbiota and thus provides a per- sonalized prediction for the capacity of microbiota to contribute to the onset of resistant pathogens.

although the preci- sion of the resistome profile comparison between different studies may be limited due to variations in sample preparation protocols the exploratory analysis of global gut resistome using resistomap shows global trends that will gain new insights and contribute to the spread of antibiotic stewardship and rational use of antimicrobial substances in agriculture.user contributionsit is possible to contribute published datasets to resistomap by fol- lowing the instructions on the site add your data button.data processingthe relative abundance of resistance-conferring genes was evaluated by mapping the metagenomic reads to the card database v.1.0.5  and normalizing the gene coverage.

the values were precomputed by classifying the gut metage- nomic reads from 12 publicly available studies see section 2.2. the number of metagenomes included in the cohort is displayed on the left from the heatmap below the colour key.the heatmap contains four vertical sections corresponding to dif- ferent types of resistome quantificationlevels of ar-conferring geneslevels of mutations in target geneslevels of genes conferring resistance to biocides totallevels of genes conferring resistance to heavy metal totalusing the drop-down lists at the top of the screen users can choose the antibiotic group of interest the study-ies andor the country -ies to be displayed on the heatmap.

however there is a lack of visual tools for exploratory analysis of such data moreover there is no integrated database of gut resistome profiles.here we present resistomap an interactive tool for comprehen- sive visualization of the gut resistome in populations of the world.

the geographic map navigation layer allows to state hypotheses regarding the global trends of antibiotic resistance and correlates the gut resistome variations with the national clinical guidelines on antibiotics application.availability and implementation resistomap was implemented using angularjs coffeescript d3.js and topojson.

the displayed features include the relative abundance of ar genes ar-conferring mutations as well as genes conferring resistance to bio- cides and heavy metals.

multiparameter display filters allow visual assess- ment of the associations between the meta-data and proportions of resistome.

vast volumes of metagenomes have been published that provide the opportunity to estimate the variation of resistome between the subjects healthy populations of the world as well as the clinical cohorts.

although resistant pathogens are the main concern the glo- bal microbial channels of gene exchange existing between unrelated microbial taxa allow commensal microbes to share resistance genes with opportunists.human gut microbiota is increasingly viewed as a clinically im- portant reservoir of drug resistance .
