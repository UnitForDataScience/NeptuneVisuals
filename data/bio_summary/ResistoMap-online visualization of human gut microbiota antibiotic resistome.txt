The pool of antibiotic resistance AR genes that increases in abundance during antibiotic treatment becomes a 'tinderbox' the transmission of these genes to a pathogen has dire consequences for both the patient and society.Semi-quantitative analysis of the functional composition of micro- biota using 'shotgun' metagenomics allows the assessment of relative abundance of AR genes in human microbiota and thus provides a per- sonalized prediction for the capacity of microbiota to contribute to the onset of resistant pathogens.

Although the preci- sion of the resistome profile comparison between different studies may be limited due to variations in sample preparation protocols the exploratory analysis of global gut resistome using ResistoMap shows global trends that will gain new insights and contribute to the spread of antibiotic stewardship and rational use of antimicrobial substances in agriculture.User contributionsIt is possible to contribute published datasets to ResistoMap by fol- lowing the instructions on the site Add your data button.Data processingThe relative abundance of resistance-conferring genes was evaluated by mapping the metagenomic reads to the CARD database v.1.0.5  and normalizing the gene coverage.

The displayed features include the relative abundance of AR genes AR-conferring mutations as well as genes conferring resistance to bio- cides and heavy metals.

The geographic map navigation layer allows to state hypotheses regarding the global trends of antibiotic resistance and correlates the gut resistome variations with the national clinical guidelines on antibiotics application.Availability and Implementation ResistoMap was implemented using AngularJS CoffeeScript D3.js and TopoJSON.

However there is a lack of visual tools for exploratory analysis of such data moreover there is no integrated database of gut resistome profiles.Here we present ResistoMap an interactive tool for comprehen- sive visualization of the gut resistome in populations of the world.

ResistoMap is a perspective tool for exploring the global landscape of gut resistome in order to identify nationalVC The Author 2017.

Multiparameter display filters allow visual assess- ment of the associations between the meta-data and proportions of resistome.

The tool is publicly available at Contact Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.IntroductionMicrobial drug resistance is a global healthcare problem caused by the extensive uncontrolled use of antibiotics in medicine and agricul- ture.

Vast volumes of metagenomes have been published that provide the opportunity to estimate the variation of resistome between the subjects healthy populations of the world as well as the clinical cohorts.
