We present both preclinical and clinical ev- idence wherever possible and focus our discussion on peripheral and central immune processes and the interaction of these processes with the gut microbiotic environment.PERIPHERAL IMMUNE TARGETS FOR ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG DEVELOPMENTOver the past three decades affective disorders research has increasingly focused on peripheral sys- tems particularly the peripheral immune system as potential mediators of mood disorder patho- physiology.

Endothelial cellsmay also play an active role in recruiting peripheral cells to the BBB and transducing stress-induced inflammatory signals to microglia as endothelial cell-specific IL-1R1 knockdown in mice pre- vented recruitment of peripheral myeloid cells to CNS tissue and reduced mRNA expression of IL-1b TNF-a IL-6 and CCL2 in brain CD11b cells 65.Preclinical studies further highlight the potential therapeutic opportunity of targeting cen- tral inflammatory processes particularly those mediated by microglia.

BBB-modulating interventions are untested in human affective disorders but as the BBB is an emerging focus of neuropsychiatric research we anticipate further preclinical and clinical insights on this important interface of the peripheral immune system and CNS.HARNESSING THE ANTIDEPRESSANT AND IMMUNOMODULATORY POTENTIAL OF GUT MICROBIOTARecent evidence suggests a role for another peripheral system--the gut microbiome--in im- munomodulation and depression.

In this section we provide an overview of stress effects on the peripheral immune system and discuss recent findings in both humans and animal models that are relevant to antidepressant drug development.The peripheral immune system is composed of several cell types traditionally assigned to ei- ther the innate or adaptive immune systems.

The gut microbiome is tightly linked to inflammatory processes and gut microbiota mediate both the development and function of central and peripheral immune cells.

They further found that pharmacological modulation of the sympathetic nervous system with antagonists of b- adrenergic receptors blocked bone marrow myelopoiesis and stress-induced monocytosis in mice Figure 1 demonstrating that manipulation of the sympathetic nervous system can alter the downstream peripheral innate immune processes characteristic of mood disorders.

The field of psychoneu- roimmunology is one of great therapeutic opportunity yielding experimental therapeutics for mood disorders such as peripheral cytokine targeting anti- bodies microglia and astrocyte targeting therapies and probiotic treatments for gut dysbiosis and producing findings that identify therapeutic targets for future development.411INTRODUCTIONMood disorders are highly prevalent afflicting 1 in 5 Americans at some point during their lives 1.

First is intestinal permeability altered in patients with mood disorders and does this affect peripheral and central inflammation Furthermore do existing antidepressant therapies alter intestinal permeability and gut microbiota composition Many preclinical stud- ies utilize unstressed animals or rodents exposed to acute stress and therefore more research is necessary in chronic stress models that more closely recapitulate human affective disorders.

However imipramine does not affect the stress-related increased frequency of granulocytes in spleen and these cells may prime the organism for increased stress-induced inflammation 34.Subsets of patients suffering from mood disorders have circulating immune cells characterizedby proinflammatory transcriptional profiles 29 and potential priming to stress-induced signals.

Reduced exposure to and colonization by diverse microbes in industrialized Western societies is thought to underlie the increased prevalence of autoimmune and allergic disorders such as IBS and asthma within the past three decades 98.Preclinical studies have employed probiotic administration fecal microbiotal transplantationFMT and germ-free GF mice to both investigate the functional importance of gut bacteria in behavior and evaluate the therapeutic utility of modulating the gut microbiome.
