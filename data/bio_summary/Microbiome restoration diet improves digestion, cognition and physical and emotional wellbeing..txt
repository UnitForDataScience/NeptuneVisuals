A four-week gut bacteria restoration program The Gut Makeover' is a dietary protocol which attempts to manipulate gut bacteria by restricting processed high grain carbohydrate foods sugar and artificial sweeteners which may cause dysbiosis together with increasing the consumption of vegetables and fermented foods which promote beneficial bacteria .

Of the participants 20 were Caucasian and one Asian.As a part of routine group nutritional therapy participants had followed the dietary pro- gram designed to optimise gut bacteria for 4 weeks completing a questionnaire about their health and well-being before the diet and after the diet.Dietary program to optimise gut bacteriaThe Gut Makeover  is a dietary program that was designed to improve the health and diversity of the microbiome leading to weight loss and subsidiary health benefits primarily digestive.

The intervention designed to manipulate gut bacteria had a significant impact on digestion reducing IBS type symptoms in this non-clinical population.

The diversity and strains of these bacteria vary dramatically between individuals.

Low diversity of fecal bacteria was recently connected specifically with visceral fat in human twin studies  with visceral fat being linked with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes .Gut bacteria have been hypothesized to influence weight by signalling satiety to the brain in animal studies  and by influencing caloric extraction from food .

The Lactobacillus genus of bacteria in particular would appear to play a role in weight regulation  perhaps mediated by its involvement in the fermentation of sugars into acids .Despite some inconsistency in study findings orally administered probiotics have also been reported to help alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms in IBS .

The make-up of our gut bacteria does not necessarily remain stable through- out life  and can be influenced by factors such as parasites disease and our environment  .

Individuals are encour- aged to eat probiotic foods to plant beneficial bacteria in the gut  and prebiotic foods to feed gut bacteria .
