Some portion of the bile acids escape enterohepatic circulation and flow into the large intestine approximately 400e800 mgday where they undergo extensive biotransformations such as deconjugation and subse- quent conversion into secondary bile acids SBAs by gut mi- crobes .Transformation of bile acids generally involves oxidation and epimerization of the hydroxy groups at the C-3 C-7 and C-12 positions .

Hama- matsu Japan were individually housed in standard wire-bottomed cages in a controlled environment 22 - 2o C with 55 - 5 humidity and a light period from 0800 to 2000 and allowed ad libitum access to food and water.

In addition bile acids have been known to act as signaling molecules to regulate host glucose lipid and en- ergy metabolism via interaction with a farnesoid X receptor andor a G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 .

Structural vari- ation of each bile acid as the result of biotransformation strongly affects the affinity of the bile acid molecule to these receptors and thus determines their efficiency as signaling molecules .

Thus improving our knowledge of bacterial bile acid metabolism and SBA formation in the intestines is essential to host health maintenance.However despite this necessity the number of SBA-producing bacteria that have been characterized in terms of their physiolog- ical and biochemical properties is still not sufficient thus it is difficult to fully understand the mechanism that determines bile acid composition in the intestine.

Then 28 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was added carefully.Analysis of bile acids by the UPLCESI-MS system For identification and quantification of SBA products and substrate bile acids UPLCESI-MS analysis was conducted.

After evaporation to dryness the extracted bile acids were re-dissolved in 1 mL methanol and 100 mL of this bile acid extract was subjected to purification with the Oasis HLB Extraction Cartridge Waters Corp. Milford MA USA according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Our findings will facilitate the elucidation of bile acid biotransformations by gut microbiota and provide further insights into the dynamics of bile acids in the complex gut environment.Supplementary data related to this article can be found at .ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported in part by the Regional Innovation Strategy Support Program of the Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology of the Japanese Government.
