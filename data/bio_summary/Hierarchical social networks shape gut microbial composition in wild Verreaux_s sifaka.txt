Sifaka are morphological folivores with dentition and gastrointestinal tracts that are anatomically specialized for consuming and processing fibrous leaf material  and for detoxifying secondary plant compounds Their sacculated caecum contains mutualistic bacteria that use fermentation to break down otherwise indigestible plant polysaccharides into digestible volatile fatty acids Sifaka live in small cohesive mixed-sex social groups with small overlapping home ranges  Females tend to be philopatric whereas males disperse from their natal group upon reaching sexual maturity Sifaka regularly groom one another with their toothcombs and tongues to remove ectoparasites Grooming relationships vary by sex dominance rank and reproductive season and primarily occur within social groups Intimate grooming contacts particularly near the anogenital region electronic supplementary material video S1 likely facilitate the direct oral exchange of gut bacteria within groups Sifaka also communicate via scent-marking in which they rub their throat males only or anogenital region both sexes on trees Males com- monly overmark and inspect the scent-marks of both group and extra-group members thus scent-marking locations potentially serve as fomites for enteric bacterial transmission as proposed by and Because sifaka groups tend to have a high degree of home range overlap scent-marking is not necessarily effective for deterring extra-group individ- uals from entering a home range .

Further assuming that gut bacteria are transmitted between groups primarily via scent-marking during intergroup encounters and habitat over- lap we hypothesized that sifaka groups with overlapping home ranges should cluster more closely in microbial compo- sition than non-adjacent groups.

We found that dietary profiles did not predict microbial similarity between individuals  plant parts Mantel r 14 0.01 p 14 0.44 plant species r 14 0.1 p 14 0.09 electronic supplementary material figure S11.Although adjacent social groups shared more bact- erial phylotypes than non-adjacent groups Kruskal- Wallis p  0.05 electronic supplementary material figure S12 the microbial clustering of groups did not correspond to habitat overlap or ad libitum observations of scent-marking during intergroup encounters.

Male sifaka that immigrated to new social groups during the previous year appeared to display the microbiomesignatures of their new groups suggesting rapid phylotype turnover amidst new social contacts a pattern previously observed in female chimpanzees However it is important to note that some of these dispersed males transferred from unsampled social groups that inhabited the periphery of the field site.

We hypothesized that the small cohesive sifaka social groupings should lead to more pronounced modularity among their gut microbial communities--greater homogeneity within groups and distance between groups--than previouslyobservedin chimpanzees and baboons 5.

Principal coordinates analysis and partitioning around medoids PAM clustering of phylo- type-level Bray- Curtis dissimilarities and weighted Unifrac distances indicated that sifaka microbiomes formed two dis- crete clusters b electronic supplementary material figure S4 with members of two social groups VI and Camp segregated from the other groups.

Six males dispersed to new social groups during the eight to 12 months prior to faecal sample collection and exhibited microbiome signatures of their new groups i.e.

Although we did not have data to show the presence of specific pathogens in our samples several bacteria genera that include opportunistic pathogens such as Atopobium Clostridium Escherichia and Streptococcus were differentially abundant across social groups electronic supplementary material table S2 and figure S7.Neither dietary nor habitat overlap explain clusteringSome previous studies have attributed positive associationsbetween social proximity and gut microbiome composition to shared diets We profiled the feeding behaviour of 16 adults in four of the focal groups II III IV V during the six months prior to faecal sample collection January- June 2012.

Although related individuals in different groups share microbiota kinship is not driving the compositional homogeneity observed among group members.b Social network based on grooming interactions in the year prior to and including microbiome sampling among four sifaka social groups II III IV V inhabiting Kirindy Mitea National Park.

Even after controlling for diet kinship and habitat overlap group mem- bership was the single most informative predictor of gut microbiome diversity and similarity between individuals revealing the importance of social network structures beyond the dyadic associations reported by prior studies Theoretical studies have shown that modular net- work structure constrains the spread of socially transmitted microorganisms but few empirical studies demon- strate such effects in wild animal populations - Within sifaka social groups we found that individual socia- bility age diet composition and scent-marking rate also influenced gut microbiome diversity.Microbiomes from the seven social groups aggregated into two clusters each with distinct taxonomic structure species diversity and abundances of particular bacterial phy- lotypes.
