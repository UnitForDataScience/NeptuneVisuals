sifaka are morphological folivores with dentition and gastrointestinal tracts that are anatomically specialized for consuming and processing fibrous leaf material  and for detoxifying secondary plant compounds their sacculated caecum contains mutualistic bacteria that use fermentation to break down otherwise indigestible plant polysaccharides into digestible volatile fatty acids sifaka live in small cohesive mixed-sex social groups with small overlapping home ranges  females tend to be philopatric whereas males disperse from their natal group upon reaching sexual maturity sifaka regularly groom one another with their toothcombs and tongues to remove ectoparasites grooming relationships vary by sex dominance rank and reproductive season and primarily occur within social groups intimate grooming contacts particularly near the anogenital region electronic supplementary material video s1 likely facilitate the direct oral exchange of gut bacteria within groups sifaka also communicate via scent-marking in which they rub their throat males only or anogenital region both sexes on trees males com- monly overmark and inspect the scent-marks of both group and extra-group members thus scent-marking locations potentially serve as fomites for enteric bacterial transmission as proposed by and because sifaka groups tend to have a high degree of home range overlap scent-marking is not necessarily effective for deterring extra-group individ- uals from entering a home range .

however we note that we did not have feeding data for groups vi and camp two non-adjacent groups that clus- tered separately from the other five groups and thus cannot fully exclude the influence of diet on sifaka gut microbiota.group-level clustering of sifaka gut microbiomes may stem from vertical transmission between mothers and off- spring direct transmission among individuals that are in close contact or environmental overlap and dietary similarity among group members.

for example group vi's home range intersected with those of groups ii and iii but its gut microbiota were most similar to those of group camp which inhabited a section of forest approximately 1 km away from the trail system c. given that sifaka groups in kirindy mitea national park have home ranges of approximately 0.15 km2 range 0.1 - 0.19 km2 it is unlikely that the microbial clustering among members of group vi and group camp arose due to shared habitat physical interactions or scent-marking during intergroup encounters.predictors of gut microbiome compositionacross all individuals social group membership explained 57.6 of observed variation in gut microbial communitiespermanova bray- curtis metric p  0.001 b whereas age r2 14 0.06 p 14 0.38 and sex r214 0.01 p 14 0.99 were not significant predictors of community composition.

their dominance in sifaka gut microbiomes is consistent with gut microbial profiles observed in other folivorous primate taxa .gut microbial composition across social groupssifaka social groups differed significantly in gut biodiversity electronic supplementary material figure s3.

we hypothesized that the small cohesive sifaka social groupings should lead to more pronounced modularity among their gut microbial communities--greater homogeneity within groups and distance between groups--than previouslyobservedin chimpanzees and baboons 5. we expected such microbial mirroring of social group membership to arise from common diet  horizontal transmission of gut bacteria via direct grooming contacts  or sequential scent-marking  and common environmental exposure among group members .

even after controlling for diet kinship and habitat overlap group mem- bership was the single most informative predictor of gut microbiome diversity and similarity between individuals revealing the importance of social network structures beyond the dyadic associations reported by prior studies theoretical studies have shown that modular net- work structure constrains the spread of socially transmitted microorganisms but few empirical studies demon- strate such effects in wild animal populations - within sifaka social groups we found that individual socia- bility age diet composition and scent-marking rate also influenced gut microbiome diversity.microbiomes from the seven social groups aggregated into two clusters each with distinct taxonomic structure species diversity and abundances of particular bacterial phy- lotypes.

further assuming that gut bacteria are transmitted between groups primarily via scent-marking during intergroup encounters and habitat over- lap we hypothesized that sifaka groups with overlapping home ranges should cluster more closely in microbial compo- sition than non-adjacent groups.

the proximity and strength of the dyadic grooming relationship predicted gut microbial similarity c and 1. however grooming path length was not a significant predictor in the full model that included the group membership predictor ddic  5. importantly when we examined the within- and between- group networks separately grooming path length no longer predicted similarity in gut microbiome composition c despite groups with higher edge densities025005000750010 00012 500social distance grooming network path lengthfigure 2. gut microbiomes reflect social group membership and grooming duration.

of the 47 individuals included in this study demographic and genetic data were avail- able for 35 individuals in groups i- vi social behaviour data for 22 individuals in groups ii- v feeding behaviour data for 16 individuals in groups ii- v and scent-marking data for 19 indi- viduals in groups ii- v electronic supplementary material table s1.

although we did not have data to show the presence of specific pathogens in our samples several bacteria genera that include opportunistic pathogens such as atopobium clostridium escherichia and streptococcus were differentially abundant across social groups electronic supplementary material table s2 and figure s7.neither dietary nor habitat overlap explain clusteringsome previous studies have attributed positive associationsbetween social proximity and gut microbiome composition to shared diets we profiled the feeding behaviour of 16 adults in four of the focal groups ii iii iv v during the six months prior to faecal sample collection january- june 2012. sifaka consumed primarily mature leaves mean  s.d.

male sifaka that immigrated to new social groups during the previous year appeared to display the microbiomesignatures of their new groups suggesting rapid phylotype turnover amidst new social contacts a pattern previously observed in female chimpanzees however it is important to note that some of these dispersed males transferred from unsampled social groups that inhabited the periphery of the field site.

a previous study in verreaux's sifaka examined correlations among group membership habitat overlap and escherichia coli sub- type st sharing  but did not address the influence of physical contacts on gut microbiota.we present a multi-dimensional analysis of social network structure and gut microbiota variation in a sifaka study population.

we thus conclude that the population-wide correlation between social contacts and microbiome composition stems primarily from group membership as sifaka groups are highly cohesive with most sifaka rarely grooming individuals outside their social group.on an individual level we assessed whether gut microbiome diversity correlated with an animal's age scent-marking rate dietary diversity and degree of sociabil- ity as measured by its weighted degree centrality in the grooming network.

yellow baboons live in social groups that are an order of magnitude larger and much more socially subdivided than sifaka groups with female baboons primarily grooming other female kin and males grooming much less frequently especially with members of their own sex while baboons do not scent-mark at all male sifaka frequently overmark and inspect the scent-marks of other group members which likely promotes bacterial exchange within social groups.age centrality in the grooming social network dietary evenness and scent-marking rate were significantly associ- ated with individual microbiome diversity.
