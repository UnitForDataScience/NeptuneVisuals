additionally the core microbiome was calculated for all samples using the computecoremicrobiome script in qiime   and the resulting otu list was used to create a new otu table used for plotting a taxa summary inqiime  .statistical analysesmetadata categories were compared between each site using one- way anova in r v. 3.2.5  .significant differences of alpha diversity were calculated using a non-parametric two-sample t-test using 999 monte-carlo permutations using the qiime   script comparealphadiversity.py using the collated alpha diversity file resulting from the alpha rarefaction analyses.

culture- independent techniques have shown differences in bacterial diversity depending on the degree of bd infection among the same amphibian species  .variations in the skin microbiota of species across different geographies have been attributed to several factors including1 the selective force excerpted by the chytrid fungus bd     2 additive and non- additive mechanisms underlying the dilution effect  3 environmental factors and host genetics and ecology     or 4 environmental connectivity  .even though there have been several reports on the microbiota of amphibians there are no studies on the cane toad skin microbiota   despite its wide distribution and propensity for acting as a vector of infectious diseases and the capability of biotransformation of their chemical defenses in their parotid glands  .

environmental variables including temperature humidity and precipitation were obtained from nearby meteorological stations in both countries.dna extractiongenomic dna was extracted from the swab material using the powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio carlsbad ca united states following the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications 1 samples were incubated at 65c after the addition of reagent c1 2 the powerbead tubes were homogenized horizontally for 2 min at 2000 rpm using a powerlyzertm 24 bench top bead-based homogenizer mo bio carlsbad ca united states and 3 the elutionto increase dna yield we used the pellet formed from the mo bio powerbead for a second dna extraction and pooled the two extractions per sample.16s rrna gene pcr and sequencingthe v4 hypervariable region of the 16s ribosomal rna  291 bp length was amplified by pcr using the universal bacterial and archaeal primers 515f 5'-gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa-3' and 806r 5'-ggactachvgggtwtctaat-3' as described in the earth microbiome project emp   using the following amplification conditions 1 cycle of 94c for 3 min and 35 cycles of 94c for 45 s and 50c for 60 s and 72c for 90 s and a final extension of 72c for 10 min.16s amplicons were sent to the sequencing and genotyping facility of the university of puerto rico for sequencing with the illumina miseq system msq-m00883.

the rarefaction plots were recreated using the r package hmisc   using the output results of the rarefaction curves in qiime.beta diversity analysis was performed as a non-metric multidimensional scaling plot nmds using the bray-curtis distance metric and calculating stress values using the r packages phyloseq   vegan   and ggplot2   through the ordinate function.

marina toads in its native costa rica and exotic puerto rico rangesa preliminary study on animals from two countries that share similar tropical ecosystems.we hypothesize that there will be differences in the skin microbial communities between the dorsal and ventral sides of toads and between the three sampling locations in its native costa rica and exotic puerto rico ranges.

the differencesin the microbial diversity in puerto rican toads compared to those in costa rica provide additional evidence of the geographically induced patterns in the amphibian skin microbiome and highlight the importance of discussing the microbial tradeoffs in the colonization of new ecosystems.keywords 16s rrna gene sequencing skin toad bacterial communities bioinformaticsintroductionin the last 30 years amphibians have undergone massive population declines  .

after the brief sterile skin swabbing in situ toads were released immediately in their natural environment.the swabs were placed in labeled power bead tubes mobio powersoil dna extraction kit into a cryobox in an ice-filled container and transported to the laboratory for 80c storage.a total of 42 swab samples were obtained from the ventral and dorsal skin surfaces of toads 20 from puerto rico and 22 from costa rica.

sarapiqui samples corresponded to young adults compared to all the rest of the sampled toads both in costa rica and puerto rico and an ontogenic relationship of the frog skin microbiota has already been reported      .

more studies comparing the skin microbiota of the cane toad at different stages of development should be done to further understand the type of association between halomonas and this amphibian host.the appearance of a new species in an ecosystem greatly impacts local diversity as already well described with the introduction of the pathogen bd in frogs worldwide    nonetheless other animals such as geckos can bring different varieties of pathogenic bacteria   or parasites to the regions where they are introduced  .

the amphibian skin is involved in pathogen defense and its microbiota has been relatively well studied however research focusing on the cane toad microbiota is lacking.

this core diversity workflow does an extensive diversity analyses including alpha rarefaction diversity analyses such as the chao 1 abundance-based richness estimator and the phylogenetic diversity pd metric of faith both computed in qiime.

the bray-curtis matrix was calculated on the otu table using script betadiversity.py with the metrics option braycurtis.taxonomic summaries at the phyla and genus levels were built by using qiime's taxasummary plot tables l2 and l6 respectively using the melt function in the reshape2 r package  .

this permanova test is determined through permutations and provides strength and statistical significance on sample groupings using a bray-curtis distance matrix as the primary input.we performed analyses of variance tests using the aov  function in r   on the abundance values at each taxonomic phyla using the -biom- derived data matrices from qiime l2 table comparing the relative abundance of each phyla in the three sampling locations.
