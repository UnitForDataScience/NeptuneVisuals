A dynamic cross-talk between the skin surface and the immune system resulting from the direct exposure to microbiota could be relevant to a number of addi- tional antigen-driven disorders for which skin barrier is compromised such as psoriasis allergic contact dermatitis and autoimmune blister- ing disorders.We used a well-established swabbing technique39-41 and next- generation sequencing technologies to compare the skin microbiome in patients with BP and matched controls at multiple body sites due to the skin microbiota displaying site-dependent patterns.7Unlike the gut in inflammatory bowel disease or inflamed skin in atopic dermatitis where microbial richness is reduced compared to healthy age-matched controls42-44 no difference was observed in the skin of bullous pemphigoid patients vs. controls.

Supporting this possibility we recently identified host genetic loci that contribute to variability in bacterial taxon abundances in the skin and also demon- strated that individual genotype-dependent microbial risk factors modify susceptibility to epidermolysis bullosa acquisita in a murine model.2Encouraged by these findings we aimed to characterise and com- pare the skin microbiota of patients with BP and matched controls at numerous distinct sites in order to determine the extent to which the composition of the skin microbiota differs between patients and healthy controls.2  METHODS  Study populationTwelve patients with BP from the departments of dermatology at Universities of Lubeck and Kiel were sampled between August 2014 and January 2015.

Comparing perilesional sites to non- lesional sites within patients revealed that only Actinobacteria were significantly different between P and N sites in patients Padj.0148.Although Proteobacteria are the most abundant phylum in con- trol- Figure 2A 'N Ctr' and patient non-lesional sites Figure 2A 'N Pat' we saw a difference in the second most abundant phylum-- Actinobacteria vs. Firmicutes respectively.
