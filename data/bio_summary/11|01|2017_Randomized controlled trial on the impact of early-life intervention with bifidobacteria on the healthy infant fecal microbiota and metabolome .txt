The impact of probiotic- supplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined.Objective We sought to determine the effects of a bifidobacteria- containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life.Design A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study of new- born infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 107 colony-forming units CFUg of Bifidobacterium bifidum Bifido- bacterium breve Bifidobacterium longum B. longum subspecies infantis intervention or to a control formula without bifidobacteria placebo.

Metabolite profiles A and microbiota development B were computed from generalized UniFrac distances that were calculated from normalized OTU tables and phylogenetic distance trees from months 1 to 12 in B and F infants months 1-7 n  42 months 9 and 12 n  31.

In addition and also consistent with our findings bacterial richness and diversity were lower in B infants than in F infants 41 and bifidobacteria dominated the gut microbial ecosystem of B infants at all times during year 1 42.

Of the infants born to secretor mothers 50 were positive for OTU1 whereas none of the infants born to nonsecretor mothers n  5 was positive Figure 4D.Fecal metabolites discriminated between F and F2 at an early ageNontargeted metabolomics revealed that metabolite profiles were clearly distinct at neonatal age between B F and F2 infants and they converged over time to reach profiles that were very different from the beginning of the study Figure 5A.

At months 7 and 12 metabolites were different between B and F infants but no longer between F and F2.
