The impact of probiotic- supplemented infant formula on the composition and function of the infant gut microbiota is not well defined.Objective We sought to determine the effects of a bifidobacteria- containing formula on the healthy human intestinal microbiome during the first year of life.Design A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study of new- born infants assigned to a standard whey-based formula containing a total of 107 colony-forming units CFUg of Bifidobacterium bifidum Bifido- bacterium breve Bifidobacterium longum B. longum subspecies infantis intervention or to a control formula without bifidobacteria placebo.

Of the 106 infants who completed the study 48 were randomly assigned to the group fed interventional formula F and 49 to the group fed placebo formula F2.

From birth to 12 mo of age participants were regularly provided with a control whey- based formula provided by Topfer GmbH or an interventional formula control formula plus a total concentration of 107 CFUg with equal amounts of Bifidobacterium bifidum BF3 Bifidobacterium breve BR3 Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis BT1 and B. longum BG7 by a staff member.

Of the randomly assigned infants 22 were exclusively formula-fed F F n  11 F2 n  11 and 75 were breast- and formula-fed BF either breast- and interventional formula-fed BF or breast- and placebo formula-fed BF2 throughout the first year of life.

Analysis of the 10 most abundant OTUs in each F group re- vealed that a total of 5 OTUs belonged to the genus Bifido- bacterium including the 2 most dominant species OTU1 and 2 which were shared between F and F2 Supplemental Figure 4.
