our results confirm that c. krusei does not filament as compared to c. albicans figure s2.genome sequencing and assemblywe sequenced the genome of c. krusei using pacbio technology to generate long reads.

this information could guide a search for isolates of the opposite mating type to begin to study whether c. krusei is capable of sexual reproduction.acknowledgmentswe thank the broad technology laboratories and broad genomics platform for generating the genome sequence for candida krusei.

here we report a high-quality genome sequence and assembly for the first clinical isolate of c. krusei strain 81-b-5 into 11 scaffolds generated with pacbio sequencing technology.

this genome will serve as a reference for further genetic studies of this pathogen.keywordscandida krusei81-b-5heterozygosity lohmating type locus transporters genome reportcandida krusei is a diploid heterozygous yeast with an estimated chro- mosome number of six whelan and kwon-chung 1988 samaranayake and samaranayake 1994 essayag et al.
