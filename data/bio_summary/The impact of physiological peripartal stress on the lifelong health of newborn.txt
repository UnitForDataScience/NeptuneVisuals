The risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head is 36  higher in children born by Caesarean delivery than in those born vaginally even after exclusion of breech delivery 27.Oncologic disordersInfants born by Caesarean section are in greater risk of several cancer diseases.

Likewise metaanalysis of 12 studies demonstrated that the risk of developing diabetes mellitus type I in children born by Caesarean sections is by 19  higher even after clearing other factors age of mother breast- feeding birthweight gestational age history of the mother 37.Mental disorders and psychiatric conditionsInfants born by Caesarean section have 2.5 times higher risk of developing bipolar disorder in their later lives 38.

Metaanalysis of 3 studies from USA found out there is 67  higher risk of discovering this type of cancer in boys born by Caesarean section 34.Metabolic disordersThe abnormal intestinal microflora in offspring born by Caesar- ean section might be the reason of higher prevalence of certain meta- bolic abnormalities.

Elective Caesarean section increases the risk of developing childhood acute myeloid leukemia by 79  the risk increase is related mostly to the precursor B-ALL 29.

In infants older than is 18 months the risk elevated to 40  31 recent study demonstrated that the risk is even 72  higher 32.

It is assumed that vaginal birth is associ- ated with important physiological mechanisms in newborn which positively affect the occurrence of several disorders during the lifetime mainly related to the immune system.Attempting to analyze the problemThree pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to contribute to a greater risk of developing disorders in infants born by Cae- sarean section the type of microbiome the newborn is exposed to depending on the mode of delivery the absence of adaptive stress during the Caesarean delivery and alterion epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

Different intestinal colonization of children born by Cae- sarean section prolongs postnatal immaturity of their immune sys- tem causing increased risk of occurrence of immune disorders in their later lives 6.

The perinatal programming is probably the reason for higher risk of metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus in infants born by Caesarean section.Caesarean section and development of immune systemPhysiological stress during the labour influences the composi- tion and function of immune cells in blood plasma.
