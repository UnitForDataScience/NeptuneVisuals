the pre- biotic inulin a member of inulin-type fructans itf has recently garnered attention due to its beneficial properties on metabolism and the gut microbiota slavin 2013. inulin is fermented in the colon producing short-chain fatty acids scfa acetate propionate and butyrate among which butyrate and propionate stimulate enteroendocrine l-cells to secrete glucagon like peptide-1 glp-1 andet al.

aim we aimed to investigate the acute effects of pre-meal inulin consumption on energy intake ei and appetite in older adults.

methods sedentary overweight or obese middle-aged and older adults n 7 60.9  4.4 years bmi 32.9  4.3 kgm2 ingested inulin 10 g or a water preload before each test period in a randomly assigned order.

2013 researchers administered 5 g inulin dp not known twice a day to females.

a main effect of inulin on reduced ei was observed when it was taken alone or with a yerba mate supplement but no differences in appetite sensations were noticed.

2012 offered chocolate bars with 10 g oligofructose or 10 g long-chain inulin dp 23 to adults as dinner and breakfast the following day prior to an ad libitum lunch.

participants exhibited no calorie reduction and no appetite changes during lunch.mixed results of these acute studies may be attributed to varying inulin doses 10-21 gd modes of administration water preload hot cocoa chews chocolate bars and insufficient amount of time given for full fiber fermentation in the colon.

research investigating inulin for weight management is scarce in middle-aged and older adults who may also have an age- related reduction in gastric emptying rate where greater solid food retention in the distal stomach and the subse- quent gastric distention may decrease postprandial appetite levels clarkston et al.
