Overweight and obese subjects supplementing their diet with 21 gd oligofructose short-chain inulin degree of polymerization DP 10 for 12 weeks have exhibited weight and body fat loss as well as 29 lower EI by week six Parnell and Reimer 2009 unlike when 10 gd of inulin DP not known was given in a similar 24-week intervention and no EI reduction waspeptide YY anorectic gut hormones that signal short-term satiety to appetite centers in the brain and reduce energy intake EI and appetite Chambers et al.

15-725.ProceduresParticipants were randomized in a double-blind crossover design to consume a preload of either 10 g of inulin Frutafit1 IQ Sensus American Inc. Lawrenceville NJ 100 chicory root inulin DP 9-12 mixed into 500 ml water or 500 ml plain water.

The choice of inulin chain length was determined to coordinate the test meal times with the colonic fermentation time whereas dosage was based upon the existing research on inulin tolerability in adults Bonnema et al.

Body weight and physical activity levels were consistent across the two study periods inulin 90.0  20.5 kg control 89.4  18.9kg inulin 5044  1474 stepsd control 5532  3393 stepsd all p  0.05.Energy intake at test mealsThere were no differences in EI gram weight of food and energy density of food consumed at each meal over the course of the day and over the course of 24 h entire con- dition between conditions Table 2.Appetite sensations and GI side effectsThere was no difference in ratings of nausea at any meal nor in changes in hunger fullness and nausea ratings between conditions all p  0.05 see Supplemental Fig- ures.

GI side effects did not change between conditions with the exception of slightly increased rumbling during dinner in the inulin condition which timing matches with assumed peak fer- mentation time of inulin 10 h post ingestion.

Short CommunicationPre-meal inulin consumption does not affect acute energy intake in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults A randomized controlled crossover pilot trialKatarina Smiljanec1 Cassie M Mitchell1 Olivia F Privitera1 Andrew P Neilson2 Kevin P Davy1 and Brenda M Davy1Nutrition and Health 2017 Vol.

Aim We aimed to investigate the acute effects of pre-meal inulin consumption on energy intake EI and appetite in older adults.

Methods Sedentary overweight or obese middle-aged and older adults n 7 60.9  4.4 years BMI 32.9  4.3 kgm2 ingested inulin 10 g or a water preload before each test period in a randomly assigned order.

EI appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms were monitored during the following 24 h. Results No differences in EI were noted between conditions inulin 14744  5552 kJ control 13924 4904 kJ p  0.05.

Rumbling was increased with inulin consumption p  0.05.
