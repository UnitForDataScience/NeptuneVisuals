Both aliquots gave the same quantitative profiles of the bacterial metagenomes the correlation coefficients R2 varied between 0.816 and 0.993 mean 0.958 Impact of storage period on metagenome data setsThe storage of the throat swabs in the agar gel for 24 h at room temperature affected the metagenome profile.

The bars indicate the normalized difference D between the number N of reads of samples processed immediately t  0 h or after a storage period of 24 h at room temperature in agar gel with Amies medium D  N0 h - N24 hN0 h. Correspondingly a value of D  0 indicates no change positive values indicate death and negative values growth of bacteria.

Swab tips were inserted into agar gel withAmies medium of the 108c transystem Copan Italia Brescia which according to the manufacturer and the literature  is an adequate transport system for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and maintains 100 survival of most test bacteria for at least 24 h. Half of the samples were processed immediately and the other half was stored in the dark at room temperature and processed 24 h after sampling.

When we comparedthe data sets obtained from the swabs that had been either pro- cessed immediately t  0 h or after storage t  24 h the yield of total DNA had decreased during the storage period by 30-95 in seven of the eight pairs.

Composition of bacterial communities in two samples of autoclaved deionized water used for the set-up of solutions in the laboratory and in an agar gel with Amies medium classified as sterile by the manufacturer.extraction to final data output A shipping time of less than 4 h at 4 C is recommended  but this request is often not manageable in environments with poor infrastructure and logistics But even in the context of collaborative field studies or multicenter clinical trials the shipping time to the core laboratory may take more than 24 h. We wanted to test the impact of storage and processing on the outcome of metagenome analysis.

We recommend that samples for metagenome analysis should be immediately processed or frozen at -80 C.c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The reader may note that values around 0 are more an exception than the rule implicating that the storage for 24 h had strongly distorted the composition of the bac- terial communities.
