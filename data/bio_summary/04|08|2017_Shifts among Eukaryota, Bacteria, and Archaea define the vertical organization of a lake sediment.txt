in lake stechlin we observed a high species otu b-diversity with depth in lake sed- iment leading to nearly complete taxonomic turnover of the microbial community within 30-cm depth.

apart from the betadispersal analysis we came to the same conclu- sion when we applied weighted phylogenetically based unifrac distances instead significant structuring along the depth gradient significant separation of the three depth clusters significant correlation with the presentand past principal components with comparable effect sizes see additional file .in order to examine links between the two parame- ter types and microbial community structure we used fuzzy set analysis to test whether past parameters were correlated with the richness component and present parameters with the replacement component of the microbial community.

as previously described for profundal lake stechlin sediments the archaeal contribution rose constantly in the transition zone while bacteria and eukaryota decreased and the general activity measures declined rapidly.according to dna concentrations more than 85 of settled organisms were decomposed within this replace- ment horizon which spanned approximately 60 years.the decay of dna in combination with an enrichment of fulvic acids with increasing depth fi values confirms the assumption that dna can serve as a proxy for the buried om.

its presence can inflate richness and misrepresent relative abundances in some types of soils when analyzed with dna metabarcoding the very few aquatic studies that investigated relic dna reported large amounts of extracellular dna in marine and fresh- water sediments with fragment sizes of up to 10 kb but with low amplification success the degradation of extracellular dna varies widely in different environ- ments and is dependent on the amount of om and organic clay fractions present the low rna content in the deeper layers in our study might indicate the presence of relic dna however cell numbers in these deeper layers 1.5 x 109 cells ml-1 were similar to those in upper layers 1.9-2.4 x 109 cells ml-1.

the community of sediment microbes was thought to be dominated by bacteria together with a smaller fraction of methanogenic archaea reviews in this view has been chal- lenged by the recent discovery of an abundance of non- methanogenic archaea in marine sediments they are assumed to be adapted to low-energy environments and at least one lineage seems to be specialized in inter alia amino acid turnover this discovery has led to a revised perception of microbial communities in marine sediments where archaea appear to be as abundant as bacteria and increase in relative abundance with sediment depth data on sediment archaea in freshwater are scarce and the causes of the significant variation observed among studies remain largely unknown e.g.

1 depth profiles of microbial community clustering and key biological and chemical characteristics of the sediment cores taken from 30-m depth in lake stechlin.

we aimed to relate taxonomic composition to sediment biogeochemical parameters test whether community turnover with depth resulted from taxonomic replacement or from richness effects and to provide a basic model for the vertical community structure in sediments.methods we analyzed four replicate sediment cores taken from 30-m depth in oligo-mesotrophic lake stechlin in northern germany.

2 mm per year as determined by137cs dating at the federal office for radiation protec- tion berlin courtesy of u.-k. schkade or 0.4-2.1 g m-2 d-1 as determined by sediment traps may mitigate this stratification and the scale of the horizons may differ in systems with higher or lower sedimentation rates.burial processes and microbial activitiesthe microbial sediment community appeared to be highly indigenous and yet the constant arrival of sinking om could bury the microbial community.

we hypothesize that this process would result in two simplified competing structural models wherein the microbial community 1 consists exclu- sively of sinking colonizers with the result being a fully nested community structure in which the commu- nity gradually changes from a complex and rich com- munity at the surface to an increasingly depauperate community with increasing sediment depth dominated by progressive cell death or 2 is structured by niche specialists at various layers that are well adapted to the specific environmental conditions including redox gradients om and nutrient c n p concentrations.

in our lake the extractable dna seems to be rapidly decaying similar to the sequences from eukary- otes as potential progenitors of relic dna which points to a short-lived fate of relic dna in lake stechlin.

approximately one third of the terrestrial organic matter om that enters freshwater is sequestered in sediments although the total amount of om that reaches the sediments is much greater than the amount that is actually sequestered this is because micro- bial activity is responsible for the cycling of carbon including methane emission in lake sediments a proportion of newly settled om is rapidly recycled and subsequently transformed into secondary compounds resulting in a distinct uppermost sediment zone of high heterotrophic activity .

although other studies report relatively constant proportions of active cells with depth and find no accumu- lation of dead cells in deeper sediments despite the continuous presence of vegetative cells and resting stages recent studies of marine systems indicate that the majority of microbial cells in energy-deprived horizons consist of microbial necromass and the proportion of living organisms decreases with the increasing age of the sedi- ment the vertical progressive transformation of om and depletion of electron acceptors may eventually lead to an extremely low-energy environment in deeper sediment layers with very low growth rates similar to sub-seafloorsediments a basic mechanism thought to explain the vertical distribution of microbes is simply the one-way input of new organisms attached to om that sinks from the water column.
