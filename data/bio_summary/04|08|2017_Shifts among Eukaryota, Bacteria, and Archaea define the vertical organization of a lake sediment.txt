Apart from the betadispersal analysis we came to the same conclu- sion when we applied weighted phylogenetically based UniFrac distances instead significant structuring along the depth gradient significant separation of the three depth clusters significant correlation with the presentand past principal components with comparable effect sizes see Additional file .In order to examine links between the two parame- ter types and microbial community structure we used fuzzy set analysis to test whether past parameters were correlated with the richness component and present parameters with the replacement component of the microbial community.

We hypothesize that this process would result in two simplified competing structural models wherein the microbial community 1 consists exclu- sively of sinking colonizers with the result being a fully nested community structure in which the commu- nity gradually changes from a complex and rich com- munity at the surface to an increasingly depauperate community with increasing sediment depth dominated by progressive cell death or 2 is structured by niche specialists at various layers that are well adapted to the specific environmental conditions including redox gradients OM and nutrient C N P concentrations.

Schkade or 0.4-2.1 g m-2 d-1 as determined by sediment traps may mitigate this stratification and the scale of the horizons may differ in systems with higher or lower sedimentation rates.Burial processes and microbial activitiesThe microbial sediment community appeared to be highly indigenous and yet the constant arrival of sinking OM could bury the microbial community.

Its presence can inflate richness and misrepresent relative abundances in some types of soils when analyzed with DNA metabarcoding The very few aquatic studies that investigated relic DNA reported large amounts of extracellular DNA in marine and fresh- water sediments with fragment sizes of up to 10 kb but with low amplification success The degradation of extracellular DNA varies widely in different environ- ments and is dependent on the amount of OM and organic clay fractions present The low RNA content in the deeper layers in our study might indicate the presence of relic DNA however cell numbers in these deeper layers 1.5 x 109 cells ml-1 were similar to those in upper layers 1.9-2.4 x 109 cells ml-1.

We aimed to relate taxonomic composition to sediment biogeochemical parameters test whether community turnover with depth resulted from taxonomic replacement or from richness effects and to provide a basic model for the vertical community structure in sediments.Methods We analyzed four replicate sediment cores taken from 30-m depth in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Stechlin in northern Germany.

In Lake Stechlin we observed a high species OTU b-diversity with depth in lake sed- iment leading to nearly complete taxonomic turnover of the microbial community within 30-cm depth.

In contrast the effect of richness increased with depth R2  0.96 F  230.8 dF  11 see Additional file  and it was signif- icantly elevated in the deepest layer 26-30-cm depth Table .The OTUs that were the most influential in struc- turing the microbial community across our 15 sedi- ment layers were identified by calculating species OTU contribution to b-diversity This analysis identi- fied 96 structuring OTUs see Additional file  whose identity reflected the interrelationship of domains.

as previously described for profundal Lake Stechlin sediments The archaeal contribution rose constantly in the transition zone while Bacteria and Eukaryota decreased and the general activity measures declined rapidly.According to DNA concentrations more than 85 of settled organisms were decomposed within this replace- ment horizon which spanned approximately 60 years.The decay of DNA in combination with an enrichment of fulvic acids with increasing depth FI values confirms the assumption that DNA can serve as a proxy for the buried OM.

The microbial community was structured into distinct groups and both the microbial community and the sediment parameters could be divided into components relevant for burial and past conditions as well as for recent carbon turnover processes and their context data.
