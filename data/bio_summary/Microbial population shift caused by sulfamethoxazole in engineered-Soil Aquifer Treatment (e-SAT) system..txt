The soil extraction and subsequent HPLC analysis of residual SMX concentration in the experimental and control e-SAT sys- tem revealed biological removal of SMX in the experimen- tal e-SAT system thus eliminating the possibility of SMX removal by soil adsorption in the e-SAT system.

The aim of this study is to find out the degradation potential of labora- tory e-SAT systems for SMX and further to understand the shift in the microbial community of the e-SAT system after SMX treatment using metagenomic approach.Materials and methodsChemicalsAll chemicals and solvents used were either molecu- lar grade or HPLC grade.

The experimental e-SAT was packed uniformly using collected soil samples consisting of dif- ferent particle sizes whereas the control e-SAT system was packed with the similar collected soil but the soil was sterilized autoclaved at 121 degC for 20 min before packing Lian et al.

The e-SAT column experiment and metagenomic data pre- sented in the manuscript are from a single experiment on e-SAT system.SMX concentration in the inlet and outlet fraction was monitored using High-Performance Liquid Chroma- tography HPLC as described by Rodayan et al.

To under- stand the microbial community change and biological deg- radation of SMX in e-SAT system metagenomic analysis was performed for the soil samples before A-EBD and after SMX exposure B-EBD in the e-SAT.

Estimation of soil elements was carried out using microwave digestion followed by Induc- tively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry ICP-OES Yafa and Farmer .Fabrication and packing of e-SAT systemTwo e-SAT systems were fabricated using acrylic mate- rial Inner diameter 4.5 cm and length 62 cm comprising of inlet outlet and three sampling ports placed uniformly at 11 cm distances.

Prior to column operation the experimental e-SAT system was acclimated for 10 days with the minimal medium in order to stabilize the rate of infiltration and enriched the microbial growth within e-SAT system.

Further both e-SAT systems were fed with SMX solution 20 ppm SMX prepared in distil water through the inlet of e-SAT column using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of0.3 mlmin and at a linear flow rate of 0.19 mmmin.
