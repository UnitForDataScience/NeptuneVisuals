Moreover a sec- ond ETBF strain ATCC 43858 is prevented from invading the microbiota of mice colonized with TM4000 despite an intact bfpai.The high degree of strain specificity in sequential colonization illustrates that differential encoding of genetic elements in the secondary strain can have an impact on colonization outcomes.

Early life colonization with ETBF may therefore be a key event in shaping the adult microbiome and represents an untapped opportunity for probiotic therapy.Genetic determinants of virulence and competition may depend on experimental modelTesting these predictions requires novel animals models of colonization and competition.

In this view colonization resistance and virulence are not isolated properties of the host or microbe but an emergent property of the interaction between host microbe and microbiome.Animal modeling of complex colonization events with toxigenic organisms are required to investigate this hypothesis.

fragilis shows self-exclusion in a mouse model of competitive colonization in which a challenge inocu- lum fails to colonize the gut after initial engraftment of the same strain dependent on the commensalFigure 1. bfpai locus deletion impairs fitness during competitive secondary colonization.

Future work will be required to determine which elements in the pathogenicity island arerequired for enhanced secondary colonization and if these factors directly impact on the competing organ- ism or have an indirect effect by modifying the colonic environment through host signaling.The pathogenicity island-encoded Bacteroides fragilis toxin is regulated by environmental cuesAs we found bfpai to be advantageous for secondary colonization in vivo we examined conditions affect- ing BFT regulation in vitro to understand the host niche for which it may be adapted.

Murine models are needed that facilitate a detailed examination of early neona- tal colonization in a developing and complex micro- bial environment including potentially importantevents that govern durable colonization such as birth suckling and weaning.

Mice colonized with a non-toxigenic B. fragilis NTBF strain were protected against colonization with ETBF and rescued from enteric disease.

In con- trast an isogenic NTBF mutant lacking a critical com- ponent of the type VI secretion system T6SS permitted ETBF colonization demonstrating the necessity of T6S in predicting the outcome of strain co-colonization.

As the distinction between the WT and mutant ETBF clones emerges over time and indeed is absent one day post-challenge the defect is a function of the dynamic characteristics of the colonic niche.Importantly bfpai is neither necessary nor suffi- cient for enhanced secondary colonization by ATCC 43859.

Together with a bfpai-dependent advantage during competitive colonization these data revealing envi- ronmental regulation of BFT indicate B. fragilis may fit within such a paradigm.ConclusionDeletion of bfpai in ETBF ATCC 43859 eliminates this strain's ability to successfully compete in vivo against an initial colonizing NTBF strain TM4000.
