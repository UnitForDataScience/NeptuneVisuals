Additional Mann-Whitney U test analysis between allogeneic animals receiving IgY pellets andcontrols showed similar levels at day 28 data not shown but at day 15 after transplantation Figure 2A we found a significant increase of Lactobacillus reuteri 21.95 6 4.18 vs 0.85 6 0.3 and another uncultured bacterium from the phylum Firmicutes 4.18 6.08 vs 0.17 6 0.05 in allogeneic IgY animals vs controls.

Starting 2 days before transplantation day 22 through day 28 after transplantation animals received feed pellets containing immunoglobulin yolk IgY antibodies from hens immunized with heat-inactivated Escherichia coli Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella typhimurium IgNova GmbH Oberursel Germany.

After transplantation animals received feed pellets with hen antibodies IgY or control pellets without IgY.

Serum analysis on day 7 did not reveala significant difference in relevant cytokine levels data not shown.The pathology score performed 28 days after transplantation showed less organ injury in syngeneic animals compared with allogeneic animals indicating the inferior effect of the conditioning regimen on organ damage.10 In contrast allogeneic mice displayed a high pathology score in liver lung small intestine colon and skin whereby the difference between IgY-fed animals and controls was significant for the colon only 4.07 6 0.57 vs 5.58 6 0.51 P  .05.

Thereafter severity of aGVHD microbial composition and cytokine levels were analyzed and compared with control animals receiving feed pellets without IgY.After transplantation we determined the presence of IgY antibodies in stool and serum samples.

Thereafter animals received feed pellets with IgY or control cont pellets without IgY.

Our findings are in line with previous studies demonstrating that administration of IgY leads to reduction of the viral load.1516 The exact mechanisms remain unknown so far however several mechanisms have been proposed in earlier publications including agglutination opsonization and toxin neutralization.1718 Furthermore previous studies revealed a correla- tion between high organ damage population shift toward E coli and the abundance of adherent-invasive E coli in patients with Crohn disease compared with healthy subjects.1920 Of further interest stool samples of animals receiving IgY pellets presented high levels of Akkermansia compared with controls.

A On day 15 after transplantation stool samples were isolated and the presence of IgY antibodies was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Furthermore only 12.5 of the animalsreceiving IgY feed pellets died within 4 weeks after transplantation Figure 1B compared with 40 in the control group P 5 .045.

However treatment of allogeneic recipients with IgY antibodies resulted in reduced weight loss and decreased clinical GVHD scores when compared with control animals.
