the correlation between the bacterial community and geographic dis- tances of polyrhachis and bacterial community and host phylogeny were calculated using the mantel test 999 permutations using the vegan package  in r. we also tested for significant associations between bacterial community dissimilarities and host genetic and geographic distances we used partial mantel tests as im- plemented in the vegan package in r .resultsbacterial 16s rrna diversityillumina 16s rrna sequencing of polyrhachis ant hosts reveals a relatively simple microbiota that is remarkably conserved.

our results showed that there is no correlation between the geographical location and the bacterial community over- all r  0.08582 and p  0.0756. lastly through a partial mantel test of the three matrices bacterial community host phylogeny and geographical distances we were able to demonstrate that the phylogeny of the host ex- plains just part r  0.2279 and p  0.0001 of the entire bacterial community while geographical distance does not have significant influence on structuring the bacter- ial community of spiny ants r  0.09075 and p  0.0697. while conducting more specific analysis of correlations of individual otus with the phylogeny of the host we did not obtained significant results.discussionthe use of ngs technologies to study the microbiome is relatively recent and these data are providing an unpre- cedented understanding of microbial diversity and puta- tive function in many habitats and across a diversity of hosts.

note that although not fully clustered there is a certain ordering of subgenera indicating that host phylogeny plays an important role in structuring the bacterial communityand evolution of the microbiota inside most hosts are still unknown and detailed studies are limited -besides revealing the bacterial community asso- ciated with hosts studies that attempt to explain changes and what factors influence this bacterial community are still scarce many factors may influ- ence the microbiota associated with the host for example diet ph host phylogeny coevolution life stage and host location -of all these factors thephylogeny of the host and diet has a strong effect on bacterial communities for many hosts in a study in- volving ants anderson et al.

although many species of camponotus and polyrhachis nest arboreally those with terrestrial habits should have evolved alternative antimicrobial defenses  based on this hypothesis another study suggested that the behavior of self- cleaning as well as the use of venom with antimicrobial properties are the key to disease resistance within the colony of a weaver ant species of polyrhachis divessmith with this in mind lactobacillus could be assisting in the defense of the colony potentially re- placing the role of the metapleural gland for this genus.in our findings entomoplasmatales is present in only 0.80 of the bacterial community found in polyrhachis.

in addition using the mantel test we found support for correlation between the phyl- ogeny of the host and the bacterial community using thevegan package in r r  0.2289 and p  0.0001. we also tested for the influence of locality on the bacter- ial community sampling again using the mantel test through the r software package to generate the pairwise geographical distances of each polyrhachis sample.

although wolbachia is known for manipulating the reproduction of the host its function in ants is still unclear.the next most common bacteria associated with polyrhachis is lactobacillus found in 31 samples 23.48. this bacterium was found widely distributed across host subgenera and across host locations.

general knowledge about the host united with informa- tion on the host's microbiome are important tools to understand more about the evolutionary complexity of these associations in nature.additional filesthe bacterial community and host location country or biogeography none.

in fact in previous studies this endosymbiont was recovered as a monophyletic group as- sociated with camponotini ants showing coevolution of host and endosymbiont and suggests the acquisition of this microorganism must have occurred in the common ancestor of this ant tribe  .the blochmannia endosymbiont is known to play a nutritional role for the host providing several essential amino acids especially in early life blochmannia also maintains certain genes for basic cellular functions such as biosynthesis of the nine essen- tial amino acids excluding arginine and urease cofactors and enzymes which allows the symbiont to recycle urea ni- trogen provided by the host's excretory system 73 in addition the nutritional role of blochmannia is not the only potential interaction with its host as it has also main- tained genes needed to contribute to the metabolism of nitrogen sulfur and lipids -.overall we detected low candidatus blochmannia abundance contrary to what we expected based on previous studies from this ant genus .

among the hymenoptera ants are well known for their associations with bacterial symbionts - diet flexibility exhib- ited by many species may explain much of the evolution- ary success of the group which is achieved in part due to the presence of endosymbionts that help improve host nutrition .one well-studied example among the ants is the association of blochmannia in the camponotini ants which circumscribes eight extant genera calomyrmex camponotus echinopla forelophilus opisthopsis overbeckia phasmomyrmex and polyrhachis including polyrhachis the focal genus in this study.

our analyses obtained 5443 observed otus from a total of 61225 reads from 132 specimens from12 of the 13 subgenera of polyrhachis collected from across the old world which permitted analyses comparing different host categories species subgenera biogeography and countries.the diversity and the total number of bacteria found in polyrhachis are represented in fig.

our analyses re- covered variation from 1 to a maximum of 1384 otus of bacteria per sample a lower absolute diversity compared to other herbivorous ants such as cephalotes - the predominant bacteria across samples were enterobacteriaceae 44.40 candidatus bloch- mannia 15.70 enterobacteriaceae - other 11.90 wolbachia 8.80 - multiple strains and lactobacillus 2.90 followed by thiotrichaceae 2.0 acinetobac-ter 1.60 nocardia 1.20 sodalis 0.80 and entomoplasmatales 0.80 additional file table s2.statistical analyses of bacterial community diversitywe performed statistical tests weighted and un- weighted to examine potential patterns that influence the bacterial community of polyrhachis.

this suggests that the evolutionary history of the host can influence the bacterial community in polyrhachis.

our findings do not support this as we did not find spiroplasm strongly associated with polyrhachis even within the subgenus chariomyrma.the correlation partial mantel and mantel tests found in this study indicates that host phylogeny verti- cal transfer could influence the bacterial community to some extent.

certainly the specificity found in some strains of enterobacteriaceae within subgenera of polyrhachis contributed to our findings of correlation between bacterial community and phylogeny of the host vertical transfer.

with this analysis it is also possible to verify the samples that have multiple infections as can happen with specimens infected with wolbachia and blochmannia we did analyses of correlation and coevolution 1 com- pared the bacterial community following the host phyl- ogeny of mezger and moreau  coevolutionvertical transfer 2 and similarity of bacterial community from hosts based on their locality horizontal transfer.
