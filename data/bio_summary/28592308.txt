d-lactic acidosis d-la is an acute condition that shares some similar features with mecfs and provides a clear example of the microbe- gut-brain interaction.d-la is a type of metabolic acidosis with the primary presentation of encephalopathy i.e.

these databases were also searched for mecfs articles referring to acidosis search terms acidosis and chronic fatigue syndrome or myal- gic encephalomyelitis.

however in some situations an underlying metabolic acidosis can be reflected in higher ph values that are indicative of alkalosis but are second- ary to a metabolic acidosis sometimes referred to asa compensatory process .

the authors described the normal serum ph values 7.35- 7.45 as a compensated metabolic acidosis due to simul- taneous higher l-lactate levels observed in this patient p. 90. metabolic acidosis is a primary marker of d-la but is not described in mecfs diagnostic criteria.

other research raises questions about the possibility of similar mechanisms of metabolic acidosis or the compensatory acidosis described above in mecfs.

therefore multiple factors including increasing bacterial d-lactate production other endogenous production ofd-lactate nutritional status and altered d-lactate metab- olism will effect d-lactate accumulation and the clinical presentation of an episode of d-la.proposed neurological mechanisms in d-lactic acidosis metabolic acidosis and increased d-lactate levels are synonymous with the presentation of d-la.

acidosis can occur without associated neurological symptoms and in reverse encephalopathy can be present without the accompanying acidosis .
