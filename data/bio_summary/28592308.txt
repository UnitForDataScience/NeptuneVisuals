Metabolic acidosis occurs when there is a decrease in serum bicarbonate excess hydrogen ions and commonly a lower pH value sug- gestive of acidosis .

However in some situations an underlying metabolic acidosis can be reflected in higher pH values that are indicative of alkalosis but are second- ary to a metabolic acidosis sometimes referred to asa compensatory process .

Other research raises questions about the possibility of similar mechanisms of metabolic acidosis or the compensatory acidosis described above in MECFS.
