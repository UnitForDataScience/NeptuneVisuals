on the contrary severe destruction of the photoreceptor layer was found with many inflammatory cells present in pbs-treated mice figure a. histology score in irt-5-treated mice was lower than in pbs-treated mice p  0.045 one-way anova and dunnett's multiple comparisons test figure b. flow cytometry of cervical lymph nodes showed that the percentage of cd8il17hiand cd8ifnghi cells in irt-5-treated mice were lower than in pbs-treated mice p  0.027 and p  0.022 respectively one-way anova and dunnett's multiple comparisons test.

unimmunized b6 mice were used for negative control n  6. after 3 weeks of the treatment the mice were sacrificed for the assay.irt-5treatment in autoimmune dry eye modeltwelve-week-old male nod.b10.h2b mice were used as the autoimmune dry eye model n  31. either 1 x 109 irt-5 probiotics in 300 ul pbs n  16 or 300 ul pbs n  15 alone was gavaged orally once a day for 3 weeks after pre-treatment of antibiotics.

the percentage of treg cells was higher than in control p  0.0021 while it was lower in irt-5-treated mice than in pbs-treated mice p  0.0021. data are presented as mean - standard errors.irt-5 treatment attenuates clinical manifestations of autoimmune dry eye modelsin parallel we assessed whether daily oral gavage of irt-5 could be also effective in reduction of autoimmune dry eye manifestation using 12-week-old nod.b10.h2b mice in the sjogren's disease model.

surprisingly irt-5 treatment reduced ocular staining p  0.0001 paired t-test and increased tear secretion p  0.0001 paired t-test figure a-c. flow cytometry of draining lymph nodes submandibular ln revealed that the percentage of cd8ifnghi cells in irt-5-treated mice were lower than in pbs-treated mice p  0.036 mann-whitney u test which was accompanied by the increased treg cells in irt-5-treated mice p  0.032 mann-whitney u test figure d. the percentage of mmdsc was not changed with irt-5 treatment.

donor cornea of b6 mice was transplanted into balbc mice.

breeding pairs of non-obese diabetic nod.b10.h2b mice were purchased from jackson laboratories bar harbor me usa for breeding and male nod.b10.h2b mice were used for the autoimmune dry eye model.

seven-week-old b6 mice h-2b were served as corneal donors and balbc mice h-2d used as recipients allografts n  22. donor corneal buttons 2.5 mm-diameter were transplanted in a 2.0 mm host trephined-bed and sutured in place with six to eight interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures ethicon somerville nj usa.

after 3 weeks of the treatment the mice were sacrificed for the assay.evaluation of clinical manifestations in autoimmune dry eye modelunder anesthesia with zoletil and xylazine phenol red-impregnated cotton threads fci ophthalmics pembroke ma usa were administered into the lateral canthus of mice for 60 s and wetting of the thread was measured in millimeters to evaluate the amount of tear production.

inflammatory foci score 50 inflammatory cellsfocus  1 25-50 inflammatory cellsfocus  0.5 was measured in a blinded manner.flow cytometry analysis of t cellsubsetscervical lymph nodes were collected in mice of uveitis n  3-6 and transplantation model n  6-11 and submandibular lymph nodes n  5 were collected in the mice of autoimmune dry eye model.

unexpectedly the percentage of treg cells washigher in the uveitis model than in control p  0.0021 while the percentage of treg cells was lower in irt-5-treated mice than in pbs-treated mice p  0.0021 one-way anova and dunnett's multiple comparisons test.
