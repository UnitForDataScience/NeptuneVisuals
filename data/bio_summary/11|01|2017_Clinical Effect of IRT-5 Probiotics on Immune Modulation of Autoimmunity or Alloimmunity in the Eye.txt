On the contrary severe destruction of the photoreceptor layer was found with many inflammatory cells present in PBS-treated mice Figure A. Histology score in IRT-5-treated mice was lower than in PBS-treated mice p  0.045 one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test Figure B.

Surprisingly IRT-5 treatment reduced ocular staining p  0.0001 paired t-test and increased tear secretion p  0.0001 paired t-test Figure A-C. Flow cytometry of draining lymph nodes submandibular LN revealed that the percentage of CD8IFNghi cells in IRT-5-treated mice were lower than in PBS-treated mice p  0.036 Mann-Whitney U test which was accompanied by the increased Treg cells in IRT-5-treated mice p  0.032 Mann-Whitney U test Figure D. The percentage of mMDSC was not changed with IRT-5 treatment.

Donor cornea of B6 mice was transplanted into BALBC mice.

15-0136-C1A0.Six-week-old female B6 C57BL6J mice and BALBC mice were purchased from Orient Bio Inc. Seongnam Korea.

Breeding pairs of non-obese diabetic NOD.B10.H2b mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor ME USA for breeding and male NOD.B10.H2b mice were used for the autoimmune dry eye model.

After 3 weeks of the treatment the mice were sacrificed for the assay.IRT-5Treatment in Autoimmune Dry Eye ModelTwelve-week-old male NOD.B10.H2b mice were used as the autoimmune dry eye model n  31.

Seven-week-old B6 mice H-2b were served as corneal donors and BALBc mice H-2d used as recipients allografts n  22.

After 3 weeks of the treatment the mice were sacrificed for the assay.Evaluation of Clinical Manifestations in Autoimmune Dry Eye ModelUnder anesthesia with zoletil and xylazine phenol red-impregnated cotton threads FCI Ophthalmics Pembroke MA USA were administered into the lateral canthus of mice for 60 s and wetting of the thread was measured in millimeters to evaluate the amount of tear production.

Inflammatory foci score 50 inflammatory cellsfocus  1 25-50 inflammatory cellsfocus  0.5 was measured in a blinded manner.Flow Cytometry Analysis of T CellSubsetsCervical lymph nodes were collected in mice of uveitis n  3-6 and transplantation model n  6-11 and submandibular lymph nodes n  5 were collected in the mice of autoimmune dry eye model.

Flow cytometry of cervical lymph nodes showed that the percentage of CD8IL17hiand CD8IFNghi cells in IRT-5-treated mice were lower than in PBS-treated mice p  0.027 and p  0.022 respectively one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test.
