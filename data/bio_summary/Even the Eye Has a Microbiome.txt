Since its introduction GDC has gathered and harmonized more than 4.5 petabytes of diverse cancer genomic data and the NCI hopes that scientists worldwide will apply DAVE's pattern-recognition and other skills tomine this vast storehouse of information.According to  DAVE will enable researchers to explore GDC data by creating customizable patient cohorts visualize the most frequently mu- tated genes and genes affected by high- impact mutations annotated in the Cancer Gene Census perform survival analysis by af- fected genes view mutations mapped to protein-coding regions and generate and ex- port publication-ready figures.In a Louis Staudt MD PhD di- rector of NCI's Center for Cancer Genomics said the agency's aim in creating both the GDC and DAVE is to enlist the brainpower of the entire research community.To make diverse discoveries about an exceedingly complex disease we need great scientific minds across different disci- plines he said.

There is no reason why this would be unique to mice she Time.Vaccines Protect Fetus From Zika Researchers funded in part by the National Institutes of Health have recently demon- strated that 2 experimental vaccines can re- strict transmission of Zika virus from preg- nant mice to their fetuses thereby shielding offspring from congenital damage or death.Multiple candidate Zika vaccines have been shown protective against infection with the virus in animal studies with sev- eral now in human trials but none were tested in the context of pregnancy accord- ing to the authors of the published in Cell.

Although the vaccines were administered to female mice prior to pregnancy the result is considered an important step toward developing a vac- cine that could be safely given to preg- nant women.One of the 2 candidates is a modified messenger RNA mRNA vaccine encoding Zika genes developed by the biotechnol- ogy company Moderna.

The re- searchers first vaccinated the mice with 1 of the vaccines or a placebo.

Mice vaccinated with either vaccine had significantly higher rates of fetal viability whereas 100 of fetuses from mice vaccinated with the mRNA vac- cine were born none survived to term in the placebo group.A working group funded by the Well- come Trust recently approved ethical guidelines for testing such vaccines in preg- nant women normally excluded from drug trials.Open Access Data Tool for Cancer ResearchThe National Cancer Institute recently un- veiled a new web interface forexploring can- cer genomic data online in real time with- out the need to download or process the data.Researchers demonstrate that the eye has a unique microbiome capable of protecting against infections.The interface referred to as Data Analy- sis Visualization and Exploration Tools DAVE is intended to be used as an ana- lytic resource for cancer researchers that complements the NCI Genomic Data Com- mons GDC launched by the agency in 2016.

Aweek later more than 50 of placentas and fetuses from mice ad- ministered the mRNA vaccine had virtually no Zika RNA.

News  AnalysisEven the Eye Has a MicrobiomeA study conducted at the National Eye Insti- tute NEI suggests that the eye like so many other parts of the body possesses its own microbiome that protects against ophthal- mic infections.We've established the proof of con- cept of a central ocular microbiome Anthony St. Leger PhD research fellow in NEI's Laboratory of Immunology said in a .

The 2 vaccine candidates investigatedin the new study are the first to demon- strate efficacy in preventing vertical trans- mission of the virus and related fetal death in an animal model.

The remainder had substan- tially lower levels relative to placebo.The live vaccine provided broader pro- tection 78 of placentas and 83 of fe- tuses had Zika RNA at or below the level of detection while the placebo group exhib- ited significantly higher levels of placental and fetal Zika RNA.

Citing abundant evidence that good gut bacteria have a key role in modulating immunity he said Now we show that this relationship exists in the eye.
