It is suggested that oral administration of g-PGA can be helpful for modulating the gut microbiota as a prebiotic.Keywords Poly-g-glutamate gut microbiota prebiotics organ distributionsPoly-gamma-glutamate g-PGA is an anionic polymer of glutamic acid bonded by g-amide linkages 1.

Because the gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining physiological reactions of the host new dietary treatments such as g-PGA have been developed to modulate the gut immune response and restore intestinal homeostasis.

Theresults of this study indicate that high-molecular-weight g-PGA with its viscous characteristics can stabilize the gut microorganisms and low-molecular-weight g-PGA reaching the colon can be utilized as a prebiotics able to increase the diversity of the microbial composition in gut.

In this study we investigated the effect of poly-gamma-glutamate g-PGA as a prebiotic on the gut microbiota of mice and the organ distributions of g-PGA in mice.

2.We confirmed that g-PGA affected the composition change of the gut microbiota in mice.
