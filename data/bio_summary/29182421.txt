While horizontal gene transfer has been posited as a community-level adaptive response to environmental selection 6 very few studies have analyzed or compared microbial membership metagenomic and metabolic profiles from the same sample set although see 1.Comparing previously published data with captive lemur species that exhibit different gut morphologies and feeding strategies enables us to test predictions about dietary and microbial involvement in human health.We expect that P. coquereli's specific diet and gut morphology select for a conserved metagenome along with increased fermentation of fiber-derived products such as acetate and butyrate compared to other lemurs.

We present two examples to demonstrate the utility of microbial geometry using data from the current study.First to investigate the selective power of diet for shaping specific microbial metagenomic and fermentation profiles we compare dietary fiber bacterial diversity enrichment for carbohydrate metabolism pathways and fiber-derived fermentation products.

Furthermore if a relatively high-sugar diet selects for a --dysbiosic gut microbiome then frugivorous lemurs should host more microbial taxa with more metabolic pathways similar to humans with inflammatory disease compared to folivorous lemurs.ResultsPropithecus coquereli consume a diet containing less starch but increased fiber and protein compared to V. variegata and L. catta Table 1.

We use microbial geometry to compare empirical gut microbialprofiles across different feeding strategies and suggest additional utility as a tool for hypothesis-generation.Keywords gut microbiome microbial ecology lemur fermentation dietary fiber next- generation sequencingIntroductionAnimals have evolved a suite of adaptations to accommodate diverse feeding strategies.

We bridge this gap with a comparative study of lemur gut microbial taxa metabolic pathways and fermentation products that offers insight to microbial ecology as well as primate-microbial dynamics.

Our research expands on previous studies to investigate the specific mechanisms by which gut microbial communities adapt and contribute to host nutrition in lemurs.Lemurs provide a basal group for exploring host-microbial dynamics across a range of phenotypes in a phylogenetically constrained group of primates and for testing whetherthe microbial trends observed in humans and model species extend to other primates.

We used nuclear magnetic resonance based metabolic profiling of fecal samples to link metabolic pathways to fermentation products confirming that the dissimilar substrates provided in each diet select for specific microbial functions.

Previous studies have demonstrated the power of diet in shaping microbial community membership and functionality in humans 4 and across mammals with different feeding strategies 5.
