Two subgroup analyses of the effect of the type of PPI and the effect of PPI therapy in users and non-users of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicated no significant differences in the prevalence of small-bowel injuries in these two groups.Pharmaceutical Company Limited Eisai Co.

No previous studies have evaluated whether PPI therapy affects the small-bowel mucosa in non-users of NSAIDs.The risk of small-bowel lesions has been reported to be dependent on drug therapy and comorbidities-.

Similarly PPI therapy caused no significant differences in the prevalence of small-bowel lesions among non-users of NSAIDs.To estimate the influence of protopathic bias we performed a subgroup analysis of patients who could be predictable indications for PPI therapy such as patients with a previous history of peptic ulcer and those with a history of NSAID or aspirin use using another propensity- matched analysis and Tables.

This study was designed to assess the association between PPI therapy and small-bowel lesions after adjustment for the differ- ences in baseline characteristics between users and non-users of PPIs.MethodsWe retrospectively studied patients suspected to be suffering from small-bowel diseases who underwent capsule endoscopy between 2010 and 2013.

Few clinical studies have evaluated the effect of PPI therapy on the small-bowel mucosa.

To assess the association between PPI therapy and small-bowel lesions differences in baseline characteristics between users and non-users of PPIs need to be adjusted.

In the present study we conducted a propensity-matched analysis to assess the association between PPI therapy and small-bowel lesions by using a large multicenter capsule endoscopy database.MethodsStudy design setting and participantsWe used a prospective capsule endoscopy database originally designed by the Japanese Associ- ation for Capsule Endoscopy JACE.
