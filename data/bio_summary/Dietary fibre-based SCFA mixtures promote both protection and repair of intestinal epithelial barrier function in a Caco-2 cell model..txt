3a for further studies using scfa mixtures with a range of butyrate proportions to investigate optimal compositions for good barrier function.high butyrate proportion in a moderate concentration of scfa protected monolayer barrier function against inflammatory induced injuryprevious studies on individual scfas and caco-2 monolayer barrier function showed butyrate to be the most important scfa contributing to barrier function with butyrate increasing teer at a lower concentration compared to acetate and propionate.646-48 in fig.

in this experi- ment scfa mixtures 40 mm total concentration with different butyrate proportions 5 20 and 50 were added at the same time as lpstnf-a to measure protective effects.without scfa application teer was significantly reduced and the protective role of the scfas was butyrate concentration dependent fig.

when the monolayer was previously disrupted by lpstnf-a scfa mix- tures with both 20 and 50 butyrate repaired barrier function as shown by no significant difference between the paired groups and 50 butyrate further increased the teer value fig.

thus increase in the proportion of butyrate at 40 mm increased caco-2 cell monolayer barrier function.protective and reparative effects of butyrate on barrier function of the caco-2 monolayerscfa mixtures at 20 and 50 butyrate were protective against the lps and tnf-a-induced barrier disruption.

this was also reflected in teer values where sax fos and cax had signifi- cantly higher teer than fecal water.

trauma infection inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syn- drome.49 it has become a therapeutic target for those inflam- matory conditions.50 also tnf-a induced by lps decreased teer and loosened the tight junctions of epithelial cells.51 in the present study we found that a significant decrease of the teer values decrease in monolayer integrity and increase in the fitc-d4 flux values increase in paracellular permeability were caused by the combination of lps and tnf-a.although we did not investigate the reasons for the protec- tive and reparative function of the scfa mixtures there is a mechanistic basis to explain our findings.

resistant starch has been reported as a butyrate promoting prebiotic and ruminococcus bromii was identified as a keystone species for resistant starch degradation.3536 the subjects with low levels of r. bromii were not able to ferment resistant starch completely in the colon.37 in the present study raw potatostarch did not ferment well and possibly the microbiota lacked a keystone degrader to efficiently degrade the resistant starch.effect of the scfa concentration on barrier functionfollowing 48 h incubation of the fibre ferment supernatants on the caco-2 monolayer it was found that fos sax and cax had higher teer values than rs2 fig.

of the three scfas only butyrate was positively related with teer fig.

the fitc-d4 data supported the teer test results showing first a significant increase in paracellular per- meability when lpstnf-a was added with no scfas and then no difference in permeability in the paired treatments atdifferent butyrate concentrations fig.

the proportion of butyrate ranged from 8 for cax to 20 for fos a known butyrogenic fibre.3031 interestingly although fos had the highest gas production the scfa level was lower than that for sax table 1. gas produced by the rapidly fer- menting fos can lead to undesirable gastrointestinal symp- toms including abdominal pain eructation and flatulence.32this collection of fibres was chosen because their reported fermentation products contained a wide range of scfa concen- trations and compositions.3334 as shown by rumpagaporn et al.14 sax produced about twice the amount of butyrate com- pared to cax and nearly the same amount as fos.

in the case of lpstnf-a stimulation activation of nuclear transcription factor-kb nf-kb increases gut permeability.5253 butyrate has been found to decrease nf-kb transcriptional activity blockingnf-kb translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus through different mechanisms including behaving as a hdac inhibitor47 interfering with the ampk pathway54 and activat- ing the pparg pathway.55 through down-regulation of nf-kb the lps-induced inflammatory effect was shown to be inhib- ited and tnf-a induced disruption of tight junctions and increased cell permeability was also attenuated.56-58conclusionsthis study shows that scfa mixtures in a moderate concen- tration and with a relatively high butyrate proportion as can be achieved by some dietary fibres have a beneficial effect of both protecting and repairing caco-2 cell monolayer barrier function that has been disrupted by inflammatory factors.

the value of the trans-epithelium resistance teer of the caco-2 monolayers reached about 150 o cm2 7 days after con- fluence.
