4 Barrier function influenced by 40 mM pure SCFA mixtures A SCFA composition of mixtures at 40 mM B TEER values change with exposure to different mixtures at 48 h C correlation of the TEER response to individual SCFA concentrations in the different mixtures and different letters indicate significant differences using Tukey's mul- tiple comparison test a  0.05 n  3.tration of 40 mM a higher butyrate proportion Mix4 20 butyrate and Mix5 50 butyrate resulted in significantly increased TEER compared to the control Fig.

5 Protective SCFA mixtures added at the same time of LPSTNF-a exposure and reparative SCFA mixtures added after 48 h LPSTNF-a exposure effects after 48 h of incubation of SCFAs of SCFA mixtures with different proportions of butyrate A TEER response and B FITC-D4 per- meation showing that the increasing butyrate increased the protective effects C TEER response and D FITC-D4 permeation showing reparative effects no significant difference between without and with LPSTNF-a treatments at 50 butyrate for both indicators and also 20 for TEER.

3A for further studies using SCFA mixtures with a range of butyrate proportions to investigate optimal compositions for good barrier function.High butyrate proportion in a moderate concentration of SCFA protected monolayer barrier function against inflammatory induced injuryPrevious studies on individual SCFAs and Caco-2 monolayer barrier function showed butyrate to be the most important SCFA contributing to barrier function with butyrate increasing TEER at a lower concentration compared to acetate and propionate.646-48 In Fig.

2 Barrier function influenced by supernatants of in vitro fecal ferments A TEER response of Caco-2 monolayers during 48 h incubation of the ferments inset TEER values at 48 h B FITC-D4 permeation at 48 h C correlation of the TEER response to the supernatant SCFA concentration and D LDH release from the cell monolayer during 48 h incubation with supernatants.

In this experi- ment SCFA mixtures 40 mM total concentration with different butyrate proportions 5 20 and 50 were added at the same time as LPSTNF-a to measure protective effects.Without SCFA application TEER was significantly reduced and the protective role of the SCFAs was butyrate concentration dependent Fig.

When the monolayer was previously disrupted by LPSTNF-a SCFA mix- tures with both 20 and 50 butyrate repaired barrier function as shown by no significant difference between the paired groups and 50 butyrate further increased the TEER value Fig.

Thus increase in the proportion of butyrate at 40 mM increased Caco-2 cell monolayer barrier function.Protective and reparative effects of butyrate on barrier function of the Caco-2 monolayerSCFA mixtures at 20 and 50 butyrate were protective against the LPS and TNF-a-induced barrier disruption.

This was also reflected in TEER values where SAX FOS and CAX had signifi- cantly higher TEER than fecal water.

trauma infection inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syn- drome.49 It has become a therapeutic target for those inflam- matory conditions.50 Also TNF-a induced by LPS decreased TEER and loosened the tight junctions of epithelial cells.51 In the present study we found that a significant decrease of the TEER values decrease in monolayer integrity and increase in the FITC-D4 flux values increase in paracellular permeability were caused by the combination of LPS and TNF-a.Although we did not investigate the reasons for the protec- tive and reparative function of the SCFA mixtures there is a mechanistic basis to explain our findings.

Resistant starch has been reported as a butyrate promoting prebiotic and Ruminococcus bromii was identified as a keystone species for resistant starch degradation.3536 The subjects with low levels of R. bromii were not able to ferment resistant starch completely in the colon.37 In the present study raw potatostarch did not ferment well and possibly the microbiota lacked a keystone degrader to efficiently degrade the resistant starch.Effect of the SCFA concentration on barrier functionFollowing 48 h incubation of the fibre ferment supernatants on the Caco-2 monolayer it was found that FOS SAX and CAX had higher TEER values than RS2 Fig.
