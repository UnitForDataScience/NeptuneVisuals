thus we categorized the disease phases according to body weight changes during the experimental period before dss administration phase 1 progressive phase phase 2 a peak of weight loss phase 3 recovery phase phase 4.figure 1. monitoring of body weight changes and bleeding score of dextran sulfate sodium dss-treated mice.

bleeding dashed lines in mice was scored according to the following criteria no bleeding 0 bleeding 1 gross bleeding 2. the disease phases were categorized according to body weight changes during the experimental period before dss administration phase 1 white progressive phase phase 2 red a peak of weight loss phase 3 yellow recovery phase phase 4 blue.

the abundances of the bacteroidaceae 38.7 - 16.5 enterobacteriaceae 25.0 - 15.4 clostridiaceae 2.8 - 1.2 and porphyromonadaceae 1.6 - 0.7 increased in the phase of colitis progression but rapidly decreased in the recovery phase figure a. on the other hand the onset of dss-induced colitis resulted in a significant decrease in the abundances of bifidobacteriaceae 0.7 - 0.4 uncultured bacteroidales family s24-7 0.5 - 0.5 rikenellaceae 0.1 - 0.1 lachnospiraceae 0.3 - 0.1and ruminococcaceae 0.03 - 0.03. furthermore these four bacterial families did not increase in the recovery phase.

as mentioned in previous reports - the nmr peaks of interest were assigned using two web databases spinassign hmdb with assistance of 2-dimension nmr spectra 1h-13c heteronuclear single quantum coherence data of fecal samples in dss-treated mice which was collected in another research project.measurements of lactate and succinate in fecal samplesfecal samples collected from five mice were suspended in distilled water.

after centrifugation lactate and succinate in the deproteinized supernatants were measured with an ion chromatography ics2100 thermo fisher scientific inc. waltham ma usa and a liquid chromatography electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry xevo g2-xs qtof waters corp. milford ma usa.statistical analysismultidimensional scaling mds of fecal microbiome and principal component analysis pca of fecal metabolome were performed using the r software package ver 2.15.3 .

a changes in the relative abundance at the family level in each dss-treated mouse b multidimensional scaling mds plot of fecal microbiome at the family level at each time point.furthermore we identified abundant bacterial phylotypes in each phase.

fecal levels of succinate transiently increased around the peak of weight loss and decreased to the baseline levels in the recovery phase.

on the other hand fecal levels of lactate gradually decreased after the onset of colitis but increased to the baseline level in the recovery phase.

a change in the fecal succinate level was positively correlated with seventeen otus r  0.5 p  0.0004. nine otus r  0.51-0.63 had 96.0-99.4 similarities with 16s rrna sequence of lactobacillus intestinalis eu381126 four otus r  0.52-0.57 had 95.8-99.7 similarities with bacteroides caecimuris kr364741 two otus r  0.51-0.63 had 97.4 and 98.0 similarities with b. thetaiotaomicron lc033799 and cp012937 one otu r  0.51 had 97.6 similarity with b. acidifaciens ab021159 and one otu r  0.53 had 92.0 similarity with parasutterella excrementihominis lt558827.figure 4. characteristics of changes in fecal metabolites of dss-treated mice.

data of fecal lactate and succinate levels are mean - standard error of the mean sem n  5.discussionour results on the microbiome during the colitis progressive phase demonstrate transient expansions of two specific bacterial families including the bacteroidaceae and the enterobacteriaceae.
