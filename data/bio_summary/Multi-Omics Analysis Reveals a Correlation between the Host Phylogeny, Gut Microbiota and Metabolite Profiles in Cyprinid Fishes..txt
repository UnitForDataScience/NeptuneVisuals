our results showed that host species and feeding habits significantly affect not only gut microbiota composition but also metabolite profiles anosim p  0.05. mantel test demonstrated that host phylogeny gut microbiota and metabolite profiles were significantly related to each other p  0.05. additionally the carps with the same feeding habits had more similarity in gut microbiota composition and metabolite profiles.

this filter-feeding activity resulted likely in more diverse microbes and greater variation of microbiota composition in filter-feeding carps      .the environment affects the gut microbiota of fish and mammals     but the same environment in the present study did not result in similar gut microbiota and metabolite profiles among the five carp species.

however a correlation with host phylogeny by itself does not allow to discern whether genetic factors are acting through the direct physiological control of gut microbiota by the host       or whether the correlation was due to the dietary strategy of the species    .the metabolic importance of gut microbiota was illustrated by the fact that genetically homogeneous fishes may have diverse metabolic profiles when they have structurally different gut microbiota.

it was also shown that identical twins had still significant differences in their gut microbiota although they shared much higher similarity between gut microbiota structures than genetically unrelated married couples  .

comparative analysis among various hosts and their microbiota revealed that both diet and host phylogeny have driven the evolution of gut microbiota  .

thus identifying shifts in gut microbiota composition and diversity over evolutionary timescales will be crucial to understanding how gut microbiota of cyprinid fishes is involved in evolution and environmental adaptation.the concept of metabonomics was first defined as the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric metabolic response of living systems to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification    .

otus belonging to aeromonas clostridium xi proteocatella pirellula and relatively high percentages of leucine were common in both grass carp and blunt snout bream while cetobacterium lactic acid and phosphoric acid were more abundant in crucian carp.the relationship between evolutionary distance gut microbiota and metabolite profilesmantel tests were performed to detect the correlations between the fish evolutionary distance gut microbiota and metabolite profiles.

the distribution of points representing the inferred function of gut microbiota suggested that fishes within the same feeding habits had more similarity in the predicted functions of the microbiome than fishes with different feeding habits supplementary figure s4b.discussionto our knowledge the present study was the first one that addressed the relationship between host phylogeny gut microbiota and metabolic profiles in cyprinid fishes raised under identical husbandry conditions.

our results shed new light on the microbiota of cyprinid fishes and highlighted the correlations between host genotype gut microbiota and presumptive functions and gut metabolite profile.

future interspecific studies with well-defined diets are needed for addressing the issue.correlation between host genetics gut microbiota and metabolic profiles of cyprinid fishesadditionally the carps with the same feeding habits had more similarity in gut microbiota composition and metabolite profiles .

in order to investigate the functional roles of gut microbiota especially thoseassociated with food degradation and digestive metabolism a strict control of experimental conditions in laboratories should be applied and multiple analytical approaches are necessary.lactic acid and scfas are among the dominant metabolites produced by commensal microbiota.

however little is known about the relationship between host genetics gut microbiota and metabolic profiles.

here we used high-throughput sequencing and gas chromatographymass spectrometry approaches to characterize the microbiota composition and the metabolite profiles in the gut of five cyprinid fish species with three different feeding habits raised under identical husbandry conditions.

our results shed new light on the microbiome and metabolite profiles in the gut content of cyprinid fishes and highlighted the correlations between host genotype fish gut microbiome and putative functions and gut metabolite profiles.keywords correlation host phylogeny gut microbiota metabolite profiles cyprinid fishesintroductionvertebrates harbor vast and complex microbial communities that colonize their gastrointestinal tracts  .
