moreover during vaginal delivery a considerable inoculum of maternal intrauterine microbes is received by the neonate and after birth neonatal gut colonization is continued by microbes present in maternal milk and feces with human milk factors e.g.

enterobac- teriaceae enterococcaceae staphylococcaceae gener- ally called pathobionts can prosper in an inflamed gut as they are relatively oxygen tolerant getting the better of mutualistic symbionts and further supporting inflammation .

thus pursuing a wholesome and adaptive gm trajectory during aging is dramatically emerging as a key factor in the achievement of healthy aging and mainte- nance of host homeostasis .the comparison of gm among young adults the elderlyand centenarians has highlighted that the mutualistic changes in the composition and diversity of the gut ecosystem do notfollow a linear relation with age remaining highly similar between young adults and 70-year-olds and markedly chang- ing in centenarians.

along with extreme aging it seems that the host tolerates the consolidation of new gm ecosystem balances in the gut resembling a property typical of the ancestral human gm  .

the circulating bile acid pool composi- tion consists of primary bile acids produced from cholesterol in the liver and secondary bile acids formed by specific gut bacteria.

the gut microbial community through its capacity to produce bile acid metabolites distinct from the liver i.e.

the term sterolbiome  describes the genetic potential of the gm to produce endocrine molecules from endogenous and exogenous steroids in the mamma- lian gut.

gut and the gm affect brain and upper cognitive functions by two distinct pathways 1 a directone via retrograde stimulation of the vagus nerve and the production of hormones and cytokines such as il-6 tnf-a and vip 2 an indirect one via the production of bacterial components and metabolites.

major studies about this relationship have been performed using germ- free animals free of all microorganisms including those normally symbiotic in the gut characterized by increased plasma tryptophan concentrations that can be normalized by colonizing the mice immediately post-weaning.

once absorbed from the gut trp is madeavailable in circulation as free trp and albumin-bound trp fraction andor is metabolized along the serotonin or the kynurenine path- way.
