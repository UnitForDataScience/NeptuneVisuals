After 56 days continuously treatment of Met TSPK TSPK.L TSPK.H and PSPK fasting blood glucose levels weresignificantly reduced by 42.99 29.28 24.23 and 48.40 respec- tively P  0.05 P  0.01 when compared with the diabetic group C.TSPK and PSPK regulated gut microbial colony in the gut environmentThe small intestinal contents of rats were cultivated for 24 h on blood agar plates to visually illustrate possible effects of TSPK and PSPK on DM rats.

The result was coincided with the results of colony in intestinal tract which cultivated for 24 h on blood agar plates .TSPK and PSPK regulated SCFAs in faecesConcentrations of SCFAs in faeces acetate acid propionate acid butyrate acid which were major microbial fermentation products of diets were measured to display the possible regulation effects of TSPK and PSPK .Generally TSPK.L and PSPK reduced the acetate propionate and butyrate acids contents of these experimental rats B C D. Therefore the total SCFAs contents in the groups of TSPK.L and PSPK rats were significantly lower than the other group A.DiscussionsIt is now accepted that the acquisition and stability of gut mi- crobiota are controlled and influenced by both environmental fac- tors and host genetics.

Rats which considered to be in diabetes mellitus serum glucose concentrations higher than 11.0 mM were randomly divided into 4 groups in the 30th day diabetes mellitus group DM metformin positive control group Met TSPK TSPK.L and TSPK.H group and PSPK group.

All rats were fasted for 2 h every day before administration of therapeutic agents.After induction by STZ 50 male diabetic rats with serum glu- cose concentrations higher than 11.0 mM were randomly divided into 5 groups in the 30th day diabetes mellitus group DM met- formin positive control group MET low and high dosage groups of total saponins from P. kingianum groups TSPK.L and TSPK.H and polysaccharides from P. kingianum PSPK group.

The  indicates a significant difference compared with control group  P  0.05 P  0.01 P  0.001.The  indicates a significant difference compared with model group  P  0.05  P  0.01  P  0.001.Correlation between 57 key OTUs and FBG FINS LPS and body weightPearson correlation analysis and cluster analysis were carried out based on clean data of OTUs Operational Taxonomic Units.By using Pearson correlation analysis we identified 57 key vari- ables which were significantly altered after treated by TSPK and PSPK correlated to the alternations of FBG FINS LPS and body weight .

TSPK and PSPK could also affect the SCFAs concentrations in DM rats.ConclusionIn summary TSPK and PSPK relieved hyperglycemic state in DM rats by the regulation of gut microbiota and subsequent SCFAs al- ternation.

The MET TSPK.L TSPK.H and PSPK rats received oral metformin 0.09 gkg TSPK 0.025 gkg TSPK 0.1 gkg and PSPK 0.1 gkg respectively.

It suggested that the profile of gut micro- biota in diabetic rats group were changed significantly compared to the normal rats.

TSPK.L and PSPK increased about 370 and 70 colony forming units compared with DM group which indicated a significant improvement on species diversity.0.250.200.150.100.050.00CONDMMetTSPK.LTSPK.HPSPKGroupsAmong them propionate and butyrate acids contents in DM group increased about 29.54 and 6.98 respectively compared to the CON group.
