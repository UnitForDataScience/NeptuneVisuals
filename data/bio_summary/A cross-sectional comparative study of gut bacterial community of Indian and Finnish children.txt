Given the impact of distinct environmental conditions our study assess the gut bacterial diversity of a small cohort of Indian and Finnish children and investigated the influence of FUT2 secretor status and birth mode on the gut microbiome of these populations.

Using multiple profiling techniques we show that the gut bacterial community structure in 13-14-year-old Indian n  47 and Finnish n  52 children differs significantly.

Our study also demonstrates a strong influence of FUT2 and birth mode variants on specific gut bacterial taxa influence of which was noticed to differ between the two populations under study.Microbial communities associated with the human gut respond and interact with host immune and digestive functions thus contributing greatly to the overall well-being of the human body-.

The table describes demographic characteristics of the Finnish and Indian cohort along with the FUT2 secretor status as determined by genotyping and information about the birth mode of subjects.attempts have been made to assess the association of this polymorphism with specific gut bacterial taxa   and to our knowledge no efforts have been undertaken to compare this effect in different geographical settings.Furthermore the early vaginal contact during normal delivery of an individual is a major source of microbial diversity followed by the microbiome acquired from the breast milk-.

qPCR-based quantifications of 12 bacterial species Supplementary Table  were carried out to determine their absolute abundance in the gut of Indian and Finnish children.
