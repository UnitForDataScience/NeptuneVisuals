using the microbial inventories from this experiment we addressed the follow- ing questions i across host species do gut regions harbour distinct microbial communities ii within each gut region are the microbial communities of various host species distinguishable and if so iii does the pattern of phylosymbiosis exist across gut regions these results will help to reveal how microbial communities structure across gut regions and host species.

we found that microbial communities vary along the length of the gas- trointestinal tract but that host species are still distinguishable in each gut region and that phylosymbiosis also is detectable across the vari- ous microbial communities present in the different regions of the gut.first we compared diversity and microbial community composi- tion across gut regions.

however p. eremicus also known as the cactus mouse is a desert-adapted species and exhibits much lower rates of voluntary drinking compared to other peromyscus species glenn 1970. this difference or other physiological adaptations in this species may affect the gut microbial community structure even in captivity.overall we found that the gut microbiota varies across gut regions of closely related rodent hosts and that this variance is con- sistent with host evolutionary history resulting in a pattern of phy- losymbiosis.

for example the caecum is a region known for high microbial activity as evidenced by high levels of vfa production which the host can use an energy source stevens  hume 2004.across all samples we found that both gut region and host spe- cies determined microbial community structure with host species having a greater effect.

we have previously demonstrated that phylosymbiosis among species of permoyscus has a functional component such that individuals of p. polionotus inoculated with the microbial communi- ties from more distantly related host species exhibited a reduced ability to digest food material brooks et al.

2016.moreover this pattern has a functional component such that ani- mal hosts subjected to interspecific microbial transplants exhibit decreased performance and survival compared to hosts receiving intraspecific microbial transplants brooks et al.

when using all samples two microbial genera varied in abundance across gut regions oscillospira figure 1d logarithmic lda score 5.01 fdr-corrected p  .0001 and ruminococcus figure 1elogarithmic lda score 4.81 fdr-corrected p  0.0001. these gen- era were most abundant in the stomach and hindgut regions.next we investigated whether microbial communities were dis- tinguishable across all gut regions.

2014.we first tested the effects of gut region and host species on microbial community membership and diversity.

we also investigated which microbial taxa distinguished host species across gut regions.

then we used the command jackknifedbetadiver- sity.py within qiime to generate upgma trees of the microbial com- munities using 970 sequences per host species and 20 iterations.
