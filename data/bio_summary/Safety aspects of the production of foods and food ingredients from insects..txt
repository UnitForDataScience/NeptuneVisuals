penicillium round worm a. lumbricoides whipworm t. trichiura coccidia entamoeba histolytica enterobius vermicularis schistosoma haematobium balantidium coli73 12461 125efsa published a risk profile for the production and con- sumption of insects as food and feed 11.the purpose of this review was to identify potential risks in the process chain from the farmed insect to an isolated fraction by taking into consideration different insect species and stages of development and by putting a focus on in- dividual fractions.

proteolytic enzymes 22 cellulases 3 a-amylases 23 and lipases 24. the genomic analysis of insects and the metagenomic analy- sis of insect microbiota allowed to identify genes coding for enzymes with the potential to be used in food technology 4 but up to now no industrial applications of insect enzymes have been reported.the complexity of the insect matrix could make it difficult to extract sufficiently pure enzyme fractions.

it remains to be established whether possible antin- utritive properties of certain insect enzymes present a risk when applied in food production.lipidslipids are found in the fat body surrounding the insect gut which is the central energy reservoir and an impor- tant metabolism site in insects 25. the average fat content of various edible insect species ranges from 13 to 33 in relation to dry mass whereby some species reach a maxi- mum fat content of over 70 2. moreover a fat content of 4-32 has been reported in relation to fresh weight 16. the fatty acid spectrum depends on the species and the stage of development nevertheless it is comparable to that in other animal species 2 and as in the latter case is affected by the composition of the diet.

average bacterial densities of 106-1012 bacteria per milliliter of gut content have been detected in some insect species depending on the segment of the gut analyzed 69. the microbial biomass accounts for 1-10 of the total insect body and depends on the insect species 70. when pro- cessing insects to produce fractions or extract enzymes it must therefore be assumed that ab initio there is an un- avoidably high microbial contamination which needs to be taken care of with appropriate processing steps e.g.

initial data are available on the effects of different processes on the microbiological status of whole insects 8.chemical and toxicological aspectsthe selection of insect species suitable for consump- tion must also include a consideration of toxins and antinutrients such as oxalate tannin phytate 75 76 and thiaminases 77. toxins and antinutrients should be distinguished according to whether they are absorbed by the insect from the feed or synthesized by the insect it- self.
