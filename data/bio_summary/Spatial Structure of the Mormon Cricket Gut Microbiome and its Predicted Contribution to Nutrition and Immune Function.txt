finally our phylogenetic analysis of cultured isolates found that mormon cricket gut bacteria are closely related to bacteria associated with plants or the guts of other animals suggesting that gut bacteria are either acquired from the environment in each generation or have not been restricted to mormon crickets over appreciable periods of evolutionary time.our finding that bacterial abundance is lower in the midgut is in agreement with reports from other orthopterans      and termites    and has been attributed to characteristics that make the midgut less hospitable to bacteria than other regions of the alimentary tract  .

pediococcus in the midgut could provide immunological or nutritional benefits to mormon crickets as has been shown for p. acidilactici in other animals   .

the mormon cricket midgut was populated by lactic- acid bacteria with pediococcus specifically exhibiting greater relative abundance in the midgut and hindgut than in the foregut.

this suggests that lactate production and antibiotic resistance could play a role in microbe-microbe interactions in the mormon cricket gut microbiome.phylogenetic analysis of cultured isolatesthirteen strains were cultured from the mormon cricket gut based on 99 sequence similarity of their near full-length 16s rrna genes mean sd 1406 30 bp.

like other studies   however the 16s rrna gene did not have enough signal to resolve relationships among enterobacter and its relatives data not shown so we present a simpler phylogeny with the mormon cricket isolates and type strains from the family .we found that our mormon cricket isolates were interspersed with enterobacter klebsiella and escherichia type strains.

acidilactici 1 phylotype sequenced using the illumina platform in this study and with the p. acidilactici 102222 phylotype associated with variation in mating status in mormon crickets  .

similar to p. acidilactici these lactobacillus had high sequence similarity 99.5 to other members of the clade and a short branch length indicating that while it is distinct enough to form its own clade they are closely related to environmental sources of lactobacillus at the 16s rrna locus.our genbank search for lactobacillus isolated from insect guts found sequences from ants bees termites and fruit flies all of which fell into a different clade than lactobacillus isolated from mormon crickets.
