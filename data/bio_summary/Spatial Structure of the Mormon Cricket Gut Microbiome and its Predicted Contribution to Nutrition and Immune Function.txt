The Mormon cricket midgut was populated by lactic- acid bacteria with Pediococcus specifically exhibiting greater relative abundance in the midgut and hindgut than in the foregut.

lactic-acid bacterium associated with the foregut Pediococcus lactic-acid bacteria associated with the midgut and P. agglomerans an enteric bacterium was found in association with the hindgut.

Inspection of the plots from laboratory animals where the ileum and rectum of the hindgut were dissected separately indicate that P. agglomerans is relatively more abundant in the rectum while the composition of the ileum which is separated from the rectum by the colon closely resembled that of the midgut Supplementary Figure S2.Univariate analyses of these three groups largely confirmed the pattern in the ordination  and Supplementary Figure S3.

Pediococcus in the midgut could provide immunological or nutritional benefits to Mormon crickets as has been shown for P. acidilactici in other animals   .

Finally our phylogenetic analysis of cultured isolates found that Mormon cricket gut bacteria are closely related to bacteria associated with plants or the guts of other animals suggesting that gut bacteria are either acquired from the environment in each generation or have not been restricted to Mormon crickets over appreciable periods of evolutionary time.Our finding that bacterial abundance is lower in the midgut is in agreement with reports from other orthopterans      and termites    and has been attributed to characteristics that make the midgut less hospitable to bacteria than other regions of the alimentary tract  .

The first clade was comprised of P. acidilactici isolates derived from environmental sources such as plants and various human foodstuffs as well as strains from the human gut.
