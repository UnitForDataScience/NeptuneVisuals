The iso- lated psychrotrophic bacteria were inoculated on SMA and CJA plates and incubated at 25degC for 2 d. After incu- bation the plates were examined for clear zones around colonies.Results and DiscussionIsolation and identification of psychrotrophic bac- teriaFor the isolation of psychrotrophic bacteria 12 samples of chicken meat were stored at 4degC and 10degC and the period of storage was continued until observing similar patterns of spoilage on the surface including microbiolog- ical visible and organoleptic features.

The isolates were assessed for the growth at dif- ferent temperatures and media and also evaluated for pro- teolytic activity to predict their putrefactive potential.Almost all of the isolated psychrotrophic bacteria were able to grow at 10degC and 25degC but some of these bacteria did not grow at 37degC even after 5 d. This is probably due to their psychrophilic characteristics.For the assessment of proteolytic activity activity was identified by a clear zone around the colonies Fig.

Therefore it is essential to know the dynamics of the microbiota composition as a function of the refriger- ated storage time in order to better understand how the specific spoilage bacteria evolves in chicken meat and to develop useful preservation methods.Consequently further study is needed to develop better preservation methods against these spoilage bacteria.

Molecular identification of the isolated psychrotrophic bacteria was carried out using 16S rDNA sequencing and their putrefactive potential was investigated by the growth at low temperature as well as their proteolytic activities in chicken meat.

Further study is needed to develop better preservation methods against these spoilage bacteria.Keywords next generation sequencing psychrotrophic bacteria spoilage proteolytic acti- vity chicken meatIntroductionReceived July 7 2017Revised July 13 2017Accepted July 13 2017Corresponding authorGeun-Bae KimDepartment of Animal Science and Technology Chung-Ang University Anseong 17546 KoreaTel 82-31-670-3027Fax 82-31-676-5986E-mail Due to improvements in economic drivers for local communities demand for animal products and particularly meat are increasing in order to meet dietary demands.

Chicken meat has a short shelf life because psychrotrophic bacteria causes spoilage or off-flavors even at cold storage conditions Carrizosa et al.

2012.Storage temperature however is the most important fac- tor that affects the growth of bacteria present in chicken meat.

Psychrotrophic bacteria can grow at refrigerated conditions and temperature can affect various microbial growth parameters including maximum growth rate and total bacterial counts Mataragas et al.

Doulgeraki et al 2010 reported that storage temperature can affect the spoilage potential of bacteria and that different strains of the same species do not necessarily grow at the same rates.Traditionally microbial populations of meat has been analyzed by culture-dependent plating methods.
