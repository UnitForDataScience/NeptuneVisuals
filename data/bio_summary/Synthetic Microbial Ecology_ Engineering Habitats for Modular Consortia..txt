In such a context as the environmental conditions are not controlled one needs to ensure that those would be suitable for the microbial consortium in terms of temperature pH nutrients.. A suggested solution to control the spatial distribution and influence the environmental condition of the degrading consortium would be the construction of porous alginate beads Lee and Mooney 2012 containing the microbial consortium Haferburg and Kothe 2010 and dispersing them in the contaminated environment soil groundwater...

1998 Rosche and Foster 2000 Foster 2006.DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOKTests of the proposed concepts of spatially linked microbial consortia would invariably involve a set of experiments to provide proof of concept of key elements of the SLMC that under prescribed conditions the SLMC would support assembly of incompatible members or would outperform mixed communities.

Finally with a continuous flow most of the perturbations would occur during the initiation phase until a steady-state is reached under constant input concentrations and environmental conditions and the level of fluctuations would therefore be limited.Conversely a pulsing regime would generate periodic perturbations and considerations of microbial member robustness and efficiency under fluctuating concentrations become very important.

Prospective microbial consortia and proposed spatial configurations will be illustrated and preliminary calculations highlighting the advantages of SLMC over co-cultures will be presented followed by a discussion of challenges and opportunities for moving forward with some designs.Keywords synthetic ecology microbial ecology microbial consortia consortia assembly modular consortia engineering consortia engineering habitatsMICROBIAL CONSORTIA EFFICIENT AND METABOLICALLY VERSATILE ASSOCIATIONSMicrobes are present in all environments on our planet and are often forced to interact within close proximity and share resources.

In line with the Unified Microbiome Initiative UMI which aims to discover and advance tools to understand and harness the capabilities of Earth's microbial ecosystems we propose in this concept paper to capitalize on ecological insights into the spatial and modular design of interlinked microbial consortia that would overcome limitations of natural systems and attempt to optimize the functionality of the members and the performance of the engineered consortium.

Such a degree of freedom would even allow the assembly of microbial species with incompatible requirements aerobeanaerobe acidophilealkalophile thermophilemesophile halophilenon-halophile...Moreover by separating and concatenating the members of a microbial consortium we reduce the average exposure of its members to the intermediate compounds and by-products secreted by the other species which could potentially inhibit their growth or activity.

The reduced need for compatible environmental conditions that SLMC offers would allow the combination of microbial species with incompatible requirements.
