when specifically evaluating patients with cancer chung et alfound that recurrence was seen more frequently in patients with cancer than in those without cancer 20.4 v 9.5 p 5 .005 respectively and that cancer was an in- dependent risk factor for recurrence of c difficile infection or 2.66 95 ci 1.34 to 5.29 p 5 .005.in the hsct population c difficile-associated diarrhea has been found to occur most frequently during conditioning or immediately after transplant.the severity of disease is generally described as mild and although there continues to be a high incidence of relapse metronidazole has resulted in successful resolution of symptoms in a majority of patients.it has been suggested that there is a relationship between c difficile-associated diarrhea and the development of graft-versus-host disease gvhdbut few studies have been able to show an increased risk of severe gvhd or gut gvhd after c difficile-associated diarrhea.

the purpose of this article is to review the current literature on the epidemiology pathogenesis and management of c difficile-associated diarrhea in the oncology population.associated contentsee accompanying commentaries on pages and doi introductionclostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea in the united states implicated in 15 to 25 of patients and resulting in significant morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients.c difficile- associated diarrhea seems to be more common and often more severe among patients undergoing chemotherapy for an oncologic process.

host factors that further promote the germination of spores include poor immune responses igg mucus layer disruption eg mucositis and reduced conversion of primary to secondary bile salts whichoccurs when normal gut microbial flora are altered.oncology patients are at a high risk of c difficile-associated diarrhea in keeping with the frequency of known risk factors in that population prior and prolonged hospitalizations antibiotic use antineoplastic chemotherapy advanced age use of feeding tubes and use of proton-pump inhibitors.-in a recent retrospective study of 225 hospitalized patients with solid tumors who had diarrhea 17.3 were found to have c difficile-associated diarrhea whereas another 5.8 had a bacterial pathogen identified as a probable causative agent.

this is an area of active research.diagnosis of c difficile-associated diarrheac difficile-associated diarrhea can be difficult to distinguish from diarrhea which is commonly seen secondary to che- motherapeutic agents therefore accurate and precise labo- ratory diagnosis of c difficile-associated diarrhea is essential for the rapid management of affected patients and to ensure appropriate isolation for infection control.

before this therapy can be endorsed further studies are needed to help identify the ideal patient for this procedure.clinical outcomes in oncology patientshistorically 20 to 35 of patients with c difficile-associated diarrhea have relapse or reinfection after their first episode of disease.response to c difficile-associated diarrhea therapy is significantly lower among patients with cancer compared with patients without cancer.

in turn these changes are associated with alterations of the gut microbiota and there is speculation that the amended intestinal flora as well as c difficile infection itself can actually contribute to the de- velopment of mucositis.although antibiotics are clearly linked to the development of c difficile-associated diarrhea there is also evidence that cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents can promote c difficile- associated diarrhea even in the absence of antibiotics.in 1981 fainstein et alreported the first case of c difficile colitis related to chemotherapy in which a 26-year-old man with testicular embryonal cell carcinoma developed c difficile- associated diarrhea with each cycle of cisplatin bleomycin and vinblastine but remained asymptomatic between rounds.

no relationship between specific types of antineoplastic therapy and c difficile-associated diarrhea or between a solid tumor type and c difficile-associated diarrhea was identified in this small cohort.however cytotoxic agents often precipitate diarrhea as a consequence of gi mucosal damage from decreased intestinal cell proliferation and in- creased apoptosis of crypt cells.

cornely et al28volume 13  issue 1  january 2017 n journal of oncology practicecopyright c 2017 by american society of clinical oncologyreported that in two large double-blind trials comparing c difficile-associated diarrhea therapeutics the cure rate was significantly lower among oncology patients compared with those without cancer n 5 922 79.2 v 88.6 p  .001 respectively and the median time to resolution of diarrhea was delayed 100 hours v 55 hours p  .001 respectively.

the sensitivity and specificity of these assays in the general population range from 47 to 98.7 and 84 to 100 respectively.erb et alhave suggested that a negative toxin enzyme immunoassay may not be sufficient to rule out c difficile-associated diarrhea in the immunocompromised population noting that high-dose corticosteroids leuko- cytopenia and nonsevere c difficile-associated diarrhea were all independent predictors of a negative toxin enzymeimmunoassay but a positive toxigenic culture.
