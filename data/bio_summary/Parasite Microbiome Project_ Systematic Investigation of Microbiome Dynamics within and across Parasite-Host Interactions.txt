as a result the potential effects of parasites on pathogenesis and disease due to disturbance of the host's microbiome have yet to be fully explored and the role of parasite- associated microbes in disease development and parasite evolution has arguably been underestimated.therefore the central goal of the pmp is to further propel parasitology forward by characterizing the microbiomes of parasites from undersampled representative phyla across the tree of life and elucidating their interactions with host-associated microbes and functions throughout the parasite life cycle.

however it often remains unknown whether the disruption of the host microbiome is beneficial for the parasite participates in the host defense mech- anism against the parasite or is merely a by-product of infection.

comparative data analyses will include the following microbiomes within and among parasite species the effects of different parasites on their hosts host- and parasite-associated micro- biomes microbiomes of parasites coinfecting the same host and intermediate host- and definitive host-associated microbiomes for parasites with complex life cycles.along with others we have begun to investigate host-parasite-microbe interactions and independently confirm that parasite-microbe interactions participate in parasite ecology and disease manifestations.

at a time when we are increasingly exploring the potential of probiotic supplementation the pmp will provide a baseline for host and parasite micro- biomes that will allow us to explore the beneficial and detrimental effects of these probiotic microbes on parasites and hosts.

thus far the known roles of parasite-associated microbes in host disease are diverse ranging from enhanced nutritional environment  behavioral manipulation  increased inflammatory responses   reduced host defenses  and carcinogenesis .

the project will also shed light on the role of parasites as vectors of microbes among intermediate and definitive hosts on the dynamics of horizontal transmission of microbes between hosts and parasites and on the corresponding impacts on parasite transmission and disease.as an initial approach we will launch a large-scale sequencing campaign including targeted surveys and metagenomes that will use standardized methodologies e.g.

given the importance of understanding parasite biology and host-associated microbiomes for human health agriculture aquaculture and environ- mental management we propose the parasite microbiome project pmp.

these studies havejulyaugust 2017 volume 2 issue 4 e00050-17msystems.asm.org 1led to important advances in many other disciplines including medical and environ- mental science technology philosophy education and engineering.more poorly understood however is the diversity composition and role of micro- biomes within or on parasites with the latter defined as an organism that lives or replicates in or on a host organism at the host's expense.

we hereby propose the parasite microbiome project to bring together researchers with complementary expertise and to study the role of microbes in host-parasite interactions.

the pmp will trigger and support functional ap- proaches in parasite systems of interest thereby leading to opportunities for using parasite-associated microbes as an indicator of system health and novel therapeu- tics.

in an era in which microbes archaea bacteria fungi protozoans and viruses are known to play varied roles in host health koch's postulates are notably under recon- sideration in light of the effects of the microbiome and polymicrobial infections on disease  .

when feasible culture isolates of parasites and their microbes together and independently will be maintained to allow complementary functional investigation of the mechanisms and consequences of the association on diseases or the host.

through the pmp collaborative effort researchers will identify which parasite-associated microbes have a direct or indirect role in causing disease and whether there has been a parallel change in parasite- associated microbes or microbiomes with the evolution of parasites and hosts.

data from the parasite microbiome project will help identify the mechanisms driving micro- biome variation in parasites and infected hosts and how that variation is associated with the ecology and evolution of parasites and their disease outcomes.
