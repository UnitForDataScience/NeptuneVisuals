neutral model applies for healthy lung micro- biome yet in cf microenvironment factors contribute over time to the establishment of a bona fide local mi- crobial community that segregates from the influence of the upper airways mainland.open questions and therapeutic implicationsfrom the reported findings a number of questions arise which should be subject of future research is there an influence of the gut microbiome on the respiratory microbiome extending over the early time period of es- tablishment what is the functional role of the anaer- obes found in the lower airways of cf patients do they just mirror the source of colonization from upper com- partments or do they play a functional role of its own disease aggravating or even beneficial what are the interactions of classical pathogenic bacteria with com- mensals and how do these interactions evolve to allow establishment of dominant infections at later disease stage to what extent contributes the disturbed nasal microbiome to an environment favoring infections of the lower airways what are the local host factors microenvironment immunity that allow selection pro- cesses of local bacteria growth to occur in later micro- biome development what host factors differ in cf patients resulting in deviation from the neutral ecology model and resulting in a bona fide lung microbiota therapeutic implications could be can nutritional changes be used to modify the respiratory microbiome could narrow-spectrum antibiotics or a targeted anti- biotic strategy be useful to correct environment changes that evolve over time in the lower airways might ma- nipulationcorrection of the disturbed early life nasal microbiome be a strategy to influence later lower airway microbiome composition e.g.

an altered nose microbiota could also have a distal effect by produ- cing metabolites that may be transported to the lower airways -many studies have shown that s. aureus can enhance the growth and virulence of p. aeruginosa and therefore it can be hypothesized that s. aureus from the nasal cavity or from first lung infection will help p. aeruginosa to install - in the same line other nasal microbiota might exert secondary or long-term ef- fects that modulate the lower airways' microbiome.interestingly a small part of the children with cf hada healthy moraxella-dominated microbiome in the nose it will be interesting to study whether thissubgroup shows better stability of the nasal microbiome and has a better long-term clinical outcome.the oral cavity and the throat drive early lower airways' microbiotaas the mucus blanket is transported through the nasal passage towards the oropharynx it was hypothesized that oropharyngeal and nose microbiota could share similarities.

airways have been described within the conceptual framework of the island model where the microbiota- rich upper airways are the mainland serving as source for migrants that will colonize the microbiota-free or microbiota-poor lower airways descrip- tion of the lower airways as islands also indicates that different regions might undergo differential migration or selection.

in cf as well as in healthy patients studies analyzing simultaneously the different com- partments of the airways showed that the throat microbiota and most likely the oral cavity is the main source of migrants colonizing the lower airways through a route of micro-aspiration  for the evolutionary process involved it was shown that the neutral theory applies fairly well in healthy people as most of the bacteria in the lungs can be predicted based on a neutral model with upper airways as a source of origin - the more abundant bacteria in the original niche will have more chances to colonize the lower airways because the balance be- tween immigration and elimination is more decisive than regional growth selection.nasal dysbiosis occurs early in lifethe nasal cavity is the first filter of inhaled air which contains particulate matter and microorganisms.

it is still unknown whether such a postulated protectiveeffect occurs in cf patients but it is certain that it does not extend to the lower airways as gram-negative patho- gens highly dominate the lung microbiome during the later stage of the disease microbial interactions within the specific niche of the throat might result in a quite stable microbiota that is more influenced by the oral cavity and less prone to alterations even in cf patients.the lung microbiota a dedicated balance of migration and eliminationthe presence of a true commensal microbiota establish- ing in the lower airways is still a matter of debate espe- cially because lung microbiota resembles more a transient colonization from the upper airways than a true stable growth of commensals .

however in advanced stage disease when a pathogen overgrows the throat microbiota is not a good surrogate anymore of the lower airways some studies observed that throat microbiota did not reflect the microbiota of the lower airways in some cf patients all those studies were analyzing patients with chronic infections in the lower airways showing a high dominance of known classical pathogens.

in turn it should be important to study in more detail the mechanisms by which the al- tered microenvironment shapes a different selection of the early-life nasal microbiome in cf patients.seed bacteria from the nosehypothesizing that nasal cavities might be a reservoir for lower airways pathogen - a dysbiosis in this niche can lead to an increase of colonization by oppor- tunistic pathogens in the lower airways and might ex- plain why s. aureus is one of the major pathogens in the early life of cf.

data argue for repeated cycles of microaspiration and removal of bacteria in the lower airways of the cf patients in early life with the throat being the source.as a proof of concept in less severe disease no classical pathogens are observed by ngs or by cul- ture and the same genera are dominating the lower airways' microbiome and the oropharyngeal commu- nity.

establishment of the lower airways' microbiome is strongly impacted by the upper airways' bacterial com- munity and starts as suggested by an island ecology model.

streptococcus prevotella veillonella and neis- seria are the most common and abundant genera in the lower airways in young cf patients as well as in healthy people  a high intra- individual variation in the structure of the microbiome was highlighted in different studies mostly because the lung is a heterogeneous niche and does not possess a homogeneous microbiome -.

however studies in healthy as well as in cf patients showed that nasal microbiota are quite diver- gent from the throat microbiota definitively the throat microbiota is more influenced by the rich di- verse and very dense oral microbiome during the first 2 years of life the diversity of the throat microbiota increases in the same timeline as the gut microbiome is establishing however from 2 years on richness and diversity then seem to be in- versely correlated with age in cf indicating an instable state of the microbiome that can be correlated with the increase of the severity of the disease as well as the accu- mulative effects of antibiotics the throat micro- biota in cf is dominated by few genera including streptococcus veillonella and prevotella which are also dominant genera in healthy adults  .

the data are compatible with a role of micro-aspiration from the oral cavities in the colonization of the lower airways studies on probiotics administration in cf children and young adult showed a beneficial effect on the lung phenotype by decreasing the frequency of pulmonary ex- acerbation and restoration of gut microbiota in- triguingly those findings allow for speculation that dietary changes and probiotics might be used to manipu- late also the respiratory microbiota but whether this will be possible only during a narrow window of first post- natal colonization or might even work in elder people is unclear.conclusionsacquisition of the airways' microbiota occurs in the first days of life in cf patients as well as in healthy patients.

individual patients exhibited a personalized microbiome in the lower airways.confirming these results sections of lungs taken during transplantation possessed a unique microbiome in cf dis- ease  .

the gut microbiome is interconnected to the early respiratory microbiome and might play a role as initial source.
