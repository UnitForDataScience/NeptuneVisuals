Even though we observed a 1-log reduction in CFUs using neat supernatants for some PA-specific clones including PA-1 this was not significant c. We therefore classified the IL-10thIL-17thIL-22thIL-26th-secreting clones as protective Th17 prTh17 and the IFN-gthIL-17thIL- 22thIL-26th-secreting clones as pathogenic Th17 paTh17 because our data corroborate recent evidence that broadly categorize RORthTh17 cells into two groups first host- protective Th17 cells that express both IL-17 and IL-10   and second a highly inflammatory population that express IL-17 IL-22 and IFN-g .We next used electron microscopy to determine whether supernatants from activated prTh17 like other antimicrobial peptides kill bacteria by pore formation and membrane disruption.

Briefly CD4thIL-17th T-cell clones at 5 x 104 cellswell were seeded into 96-well flat-bottom microplates BD Biosciences containing 2.5 x 104 autologous monocytes in T-cell media withwithout P. acnes strains one multiplicity of infection that was originally used as a stimulus to generate the clones.

Therefore to investigate whether PA- and PH-specific clones express and secrete functional mole- cules associated with Th17 cells clones underwent cos- timulation by a-CD3a-CD28 antibodies.

We next generated PH and PA strain-specific Th17 clones and show that P. acnes strains induce Th17 cells of varied phenotype and function that are stable in the presence of IL-2 and IL-23.

Together our data suggest that certain subsets of Th17 cells may be involved in providing protection against P. acnes.Our observations that certain PA strains induced higher IL-17 levels than PH strains suggest that P. acnes strains ex- press different antigenic componentsligands on their surface structure which may be responsible for the differential Th17 responses.

A better mechanistic understanding of how P. acnes strains modulate immune responses can inform future microbiome studies and probiotic designs.In summary we show that P. acnes strains differentially modulate the CD4th T-cell responses leading to the generation of Th17 cells that may contribute either to homeostasis or pathogenesis in acne vulgaris.

Although PH- and PA-specific clones expressed similar levels of LL-37 and DEFB4 only PH-specific clones secreted molecules sufficient to killP.

To specifically address the role of IL-23 as a stabilizing factor for the in vitro developed PH- and PA-specific clones we tested the ability of the clones to survive in vitro both in the presence and absence of IL-23.
