even though we observed a 1-log reduction in cfus using neat supernatants for some pa-specific clones including pa-1 this was not significant c. we therefore classified the il-10thil-17thil-22thil-26th-secreting clones as protective th17 prth17 and the ifn-gthil-17thil- 22thil-26th-secreting clones as pathogenic th17 path17 because our data corroborate recent evidence that broadly categorize rorthth17 cells into two groups first host- protective th17 cells that express both il-17 and il-10   and second a highly inflammatory population that express il-17 il-22 and ifn-g .we next used electron microscopy to determine whether supernatants from activated prth17 like other antimicrobial peptides kill bacteria by pore formation and membrane disruption.

pa-specific clones expressed both th17- and th1-associated transcriptional factors rorc and tbet in contrast to ph-specific clones that expressed only il-17 b. in addition elisa cytokine profiles indicate that pa-specific clones secreted ifn-g il-17 il-22 and il-26 whereas the ph-specific clones secreted il-10 il-17 il-22 and il-26 and maintained this capacity at later time points cef and supplementary figure s2bee.

therefore to investigate whether pa- and ph-specific clones express and secrete functional mole- cules associated with th17 cells clones underwent cos- timulation by a-cd3a-cd28 antibodies.

we next generated ph and pa strain-specific th17 clones and show that p. acnes strains induce th17 cells of varied phenotype and function that are stable in the presence of il-2 and il-23.

together our data suggest that certain subsets of th17 cells may be involved in providing protection against p. acnes.our observations that certain pa strains induced higher il-17 levels than ph strains suggest that p. acnes strains ex- press different antigenic componentsligands on their surface structure which may be responsible for the differential th17 responses.

a better mechanistic understanding of how p. acnes strains modulate immune responses can inform future microbiome studies and probiotic designs.in summary we show that p. acnes strains differentially modulate the cd4th t-cell responses leading to the generation of th17 cells that may contribute either to homeostasis or pathogenesis in acne vulgaris.

although ph- and pa-specific clones expressed similar levels of ll-37 and defb4 only ph-specific clones secreted molecules sufficient to killp.

to specifically address the role of il-23 as a stabilizing factor for the in vitro developed ph- and pa-specific clones we tested the ability of the clones to survive in vitro both in the presence and absence of il-23.

the loss of the th17 phenotype was irreversible because exth17 clones could not regain il-17 protein secretion even though both il-23etreated and un- treated clones showed il23r expression as measured by quantitative pcr see supplementary figure s1b s1c.
