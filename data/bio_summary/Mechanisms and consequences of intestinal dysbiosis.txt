The complex interplay between drugs the microbiota the intestinal mucosa and the immune system underline the importance of a comprehen- sive approach when unravelling the mechanisms underlying intestinal dysbiosis.Intestinal mucosaMucinsThe gastrointestinal tract is lined with mucus secreted by goblet cells thereby protecting the epithelium from a direct contact with the microbiota.

Adrienne Weiss1  Thierry Hennet1Received 21 December 2016  Revised 8 March 2017  Accepted 15 March 2017  Published online 28 March 2017c Springer International Publishing 2017Abstract The composition of the gut microbiota is in constant flow under the influence of factors such as the diet ingested drugs the intestinal mucosa the immunesystem and the microbiota itself.

The characterization of the changes leading to intestinal dysbiosis and the identi- fication of the microbial taxa contributing to pathological effects are essential prerequisites to better understand the impact of the microbiota on health and disease.Keywords Bacteria  Cytokine  Mucin  Oxidative stress  Bacteriophage  Bacteriocins  Necrotizing enterocolitis  Cancer Thierry Hennet1 Institute of Physiology University of Zurich Winterthurerstrasse 190 8057 Zurich SwitzerlandIntroductionThe gut microbiota can be viewed as an actual body organ contributing to the well-being of the host organism.

This anti- microbial product strongly influences the gut microbiota and increased NO levels measured in obese patients likely contribute to the development of an obesity-associated microbiota -.FatsA high fat intake induces remarkable changes in the gut microbiota composition.

Finally the microbiota itself also regulates intestinal mucin secretion and glycosylation as outlined by the different glycosylation of MUC2 produced in conventionally raised mice and germ-free mice .ImmunityThe immune system enables a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbiota by maintaining a non-inflamma- tory homeostasis.

Is the pro- liferation of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Entero- bacteriaceae facilitated by the presence of oxygen in the newborn colon As outlined in the present review multi- ple mechanisms account for the development of dysbiosis.Given the resilience of the gut microbiota in response to changes the occurrence of dysbiosis in necrotizing entero- colitis is likely the result of a chain of events combining an inadequate supply of protective nutrients and prebiotics an immature immune system and an insufficient secretion of intestinal mucus.Colorectal cancerDysbiosis of the gut microbiota can entail severe conse- quences.

But what role do members of the commensal microbiota play and which shifts in the microbiota are linked to tumor development The micro- biota composition is significantly different in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy individuals.

Accordingly it is essentialto take in account the impact of medications on intestinal microbes when addressing possible correlations between changes in the gut microbiota in chronic disorders.AntibioticsThrough their antibacterial activity antibiotic drugs have an intrinsic potential in promoting intestinal dysbiosis.

The replication of a disease through the transplantation of the gut microbiota from a diseased animal to a healthy one is often used in a second step to confirm the contribution of intestinal dysbiosis to disease.
