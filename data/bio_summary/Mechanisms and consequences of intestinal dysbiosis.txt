the complex interplay between drugs the microbiota the intestinal mucosa and the immune system underline the importance of a comprehen- sive approach when unravelling the mechanisms underlying intestinal dysbiosis.intestinal mucosamucinsthe gastrointestinal tract is lined with mucus secreted by goblet cells thereby protecting the epithelium from a direct contact with the microbiota.

this anti- microbial product strongly influences the gut microbiota and increased no levels measured in obese patients likely contribute to the development of an obesity-associated microbiota -.fatsa high fat intake induces remarkable changes in the gut microbiota composition.

adrienne weiss1  thierry hennet1received 21 december 2016  revised 8 march 2017  accepted 15 march 2017  published online 28 march 2017c springer international publishing 2017abstract the composition of the gut microbiota is in constant flow under the influence of factors such as the diet ingested drugs the intestinal mucosa the immunesystem and the microbiota itself.

the characterization of the changes leading to intestinal dysbiosis and the identi- fication of the microbial taxa contributing to pathological effects are essential prerequisites to better understand the impact of the microbiota on health and disease.keywords bacteria  cytokine  mucin  oxidative stress  bacteriophage  bacteriocins  necrotizing enterocolitis  cancer thierry hennet1 institute of physiology university of zurich winterthurerstrasse 190 8057 zurich switzerlandintroductionthe gut microbiota can be viewed as an actual body organ contributing to the well-being of the host organism.

finally the microbiota itself also regulates intestinal mucin secretion and glycosylation as outlined by the different glycosylation of muc2 produced in conventionally raised mice and germ-free mice .immunitythe immune system enables a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbiota by maintaining a non-inflamma- tory homeostasis.

is the pro- liferation of facultative anaerobic bacteria such as entero- bacteriaceae facilitated by the presence of oxygen in the newborn colon as outlined in the present review multi- ple mechanisms account for the development of dysbiosis.given the resilience of the gut microbiota in response to changes the occurrence of dysbiosis in necrotizing entero- colitis is likely the result of a chain of events combining an inadequate supply of protective nutrients and prebiotics an immature immune system and an insufficient secretion of intestinal mucus.colorectal cancerdysbiosis of the gut microbiota can entail severe conse- quences.

accordingly it is essentialto take in account the impact of medications on intestinal microbes when addressing possible correlations between changes in the gut microbiota in chronic disorders.antibioticsthrough their antibacterial activity antibiotic drugs have an intrinsic potential in promoting intestinal dysbiosis.

changes in the density of fucosylated glycans or the passage of soluble fucosylated molecules such as milk oligosaccharides  in the intestinal lumen alter the adhesion of c. jejuni to the intestinal mucosa and force its elimination from the intestinal tract.

strikingly higher sfb levels as found in myd88-deficient mice protect mice of a diabetic genotype from developing the disease indicating that microbiota exert both inhibiting and promoting effects -.a disturbed microbiota also affects the maturation of the innate immune system as gut bacteria per se are a driving force in that process.

but what role do members of the commensal microbiota play and which shifts in the microbiota are linked to tumor development the micro- biota composition is significantly different in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy individuals.

dysbiosis can trigger disease in the first weeks of life as observed in necrotizing enterocolitis  during adult- hood through the promotion of colorectal cancer  or in elderly people as exemplified by clostridium difficile-asso- ciated diarrhea .unlike infectious microbes the pathogenicity of spe-cific intestinal bacteria cannot be established through the application of koch's postulates given that a major fraction of the microbiota cannot be isolated as pure culture.

the replication of a disease through the transplantation of the gut microbiota from a diseased animal to a healthy one is often used in a second step to confirm the contribution of intestinal dysbiosis to disease.

microbiota transplantation demonstrated the contribution of intestinal microbes among others to obesity  and atherosclerosis  in mice.

accord- ingly the identification of factors causing strong shifts in the gut microbiota is pivotal to devise strategies aimed at preventing intestinal dysbiosis.between resilience and fragilityseveral exogenous and endogenous factors affect the microbial composition of the intestine.
