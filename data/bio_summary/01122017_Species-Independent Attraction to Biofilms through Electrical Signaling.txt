Biofilm-bound cells were assumed to be non-motile no self-propelling force no tumbling torque.The dynamics of extracellular potassium ion field were implemented via a reaction-diffusion model where the biofilm cells played the role of sources and sinks of potassium periodicallyHumphries et al.Page 128Here Ka is the extracellular potassium concentration and rj is the location of the j-th cell ft is the periodic function describing periodic excretion with rate ak and absorption with rate-bkKe cycles of extracellular potassium by the biofilm cells and Dk is the potassium diffusion constant.Each simulated motile cell carried a set of equations 1-7 describing its membrane potential dynamics in response to the local extracellular potassium concentration.

The relationship between extracellular potassium membrane potential and tumbling frequency of motile cells suggests a possible mechanism for the observed attraction of motile cells to biofilms.The role of the potassium ion channel in motile cell attractionTo determine the mechanism of motile cell attraction we first confirmed that potassium ion channel activity in the biofilm generates the extracellular potassium signal that results in motile cell attraction.

Specifically the function fits a least-squares line to the data and subtracts this linear trend from the data.The motile cell response reported in Figure 3d was obtained by averaging the intensities of motile cell attraction peaks from multiple experiments to obtain a single motile cell response measurement.

For all these measurements the exact value of n is presented in the corresponding figure legend and represents the number of independent experiments of each genetic background used.Motile cell density lag and oscillation period measurements The motile cell density lag measurements reported in Figure 1d and Figure 6c were obtained using the peak of motile cell attraction and biofilm ThT.

The Python based cell tracking software TrackPy and the Anaconda Python platform Trackpy authors 2016 Continuum Analytics 2016 were used to track single cell movement over time and compile this movement into trajectories for each tracked cell.

Using this model we computed how a change in extracellular potassium altered the cell's membrane potential and how this in turn affected the tumbling probability of each motile cell Fig.

In addition to the inlet used to flow in the motile cell suspension a potassium concentration gradient could be produced by flowing MSgg supplemented with 300 mM KCl from the inlet furthest from the biofilm.Time-lapse microscopy Growth of biofilms was tracked using phase contrast microscopy and motile cell behavior was tracked by fluorescence microscopy of the Phyp-mKate2 reporter only present in motile cells.

Indeed if a cell swims up the gradient it experiences rising levels of potassium and strongly hyperpolarizes thus increasing the mean proton motive force and the level of energy in the cell.

Together these results show that electrical oscillations generated by the biofilm are correlated in time with periodic attraction of distant motile cells to the biofilm.Sufficiency of extracellular potassium in directing cell motilityWe next asked whether the observed attraction of motile cells was due to changes in extracellular potassium generated during biofilm oscillations Prindle et al.
