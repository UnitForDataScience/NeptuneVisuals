As such de- velopment of the gut microbiota is greatly impacted in preterm infants who have an immature gut and are ex- posed to factors like hospitalization caesarean section antibiotics and respiratory support.Design We analyzed fecal microbiota composition and activity of ten preterm infants gestational age 25-30 weeks birthweight 630 -1750 g during the first six post- natal weeks through metaproteomics LC-MSMS and 16S-rRNA gene sequencing.Results A gestational-age-dependent microbial signa- ture is observed enabling microbiota-based differentia- tion between extremely preterm 25-27 weeks gestation and very preterm 30 weeks gestation infants.

Host-microbe interactions influence GI-Microbiota development in preterm infantstract and immune system development 12 and disturbances in microbiota development have been related to development of disorders like necrotizing enterocolitis infant colic atopy inflammatory bowel disease and obesity 13-16.Despite increasing knowledge about microbiota composi- tion in preterm infants knowledge about the functional sig- natures of the intestinal microbiota remains limited.

The development to- ward a Bifidobacterium-dominant microbiota as observed in VP infants but not in EP infants is more representative of microbiota development in term vaginally born breast-fed infants which is considered most beneficial during early-life development.The observed differences between proteome- and 16S- based taxonomy in EP infants could indicate that microbiota composition is not representative for metabolic activity of the microbiota.

In addition maternal antibiotics and duration of the first and second course of antibiotic treatmentrespectively explained 2 2.6 and 1.8 of the observed variation in microbiota composition p  0.05.DISCUSSIONThe current study implements metaproteomics and 16S- rRNA gene sequencing in a cohort of preterm infants to get insight into the establishment and activity of their intestinal microbiota.

In the present study 16S-rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics are com- bined to study microbiota development during the first six postnatal weeks in preterm infants and to identify the factors associated with this development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSubjects and Sample Collection--This study was part of an obser- vational nonintervention study involving preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or the pediatric ward of Isala in Zwolle the Netherlands.

The current study adds up to these data by using a combination of metaproteomics and 16S-rRNA gene sequencing to study microbiota development during the first six postnatal weeks in ten preterm infants of varying GA.Analysis of the fecal proteome indicated low bacterial load till the second postnatal week in all preterm infants.

As the gut microbiota plays a major role in development of the neonate gestational age and its associated factors could set the stage for early and later life health complications via interference with microbiota development.

In very preterm infants the intestinal microbiota developed to- ward a Bifidobacterium-dominated community and was associated with high abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism.

Establishment of the in- testinal microbiota has shown to be greatly impacted by preterm birth 6.
