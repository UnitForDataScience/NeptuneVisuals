for veterans who served in operation iraqi freedom oif and operation enduring freedom oef   ptsd prevalence estimates range from 4-17.1. for 0889-1591published by elsevier inc.individuals with a history of tbi with a loss of consciousness the rate of ptsd has been reported to be as high at 43.9  .

authors also highlighted that ptsd may be an ''impor- tant mediator of the relationship between tbi and poor physical health outcomes p. 453 .at present there is a dearth of evidence-based treatments to address persistent pcs as well as co-occurring persistent pcs and ptsd symptoms .

while there are promis- ing data showing the potential of cam approaches for tbi or ptsd  studies of cam treatments for co-occurring tbi and ptsd have been limited.mechanistically the role that inflammation plays in the onsetand perpetuation of psychiatric or post-tbi symptoms has gar- nered increased attention  .

studies with human adults with ptsd were also included with ptsd defined as a maladaptive response to a trau- matic or stressful life experience that may be characterized by expressions of distress including intrusive thoughts or feelings avoidance negative cognitions and mood and increased arousal and reactivity  .

overall 22 of those who received l. reuteri supplementation decreased their crp risk cate- gory by one risk group compared to just 2 in the control group .

tbi sequelae may be further exacerbated by symptoms associated with frequently occurring comorbid psychiatric conditions including posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd.

this is particularly true among the population of military personnel from recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan with a history of mild tbi mtbi and ptsd.

the need for efficacious treatments for tbi and comorbid ptsd is significant and evidence-based interventions for these frequently co-occurring conditions are limited.

the focus of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate existing research regarding prebiotic and probiotic interventions for the popula- tions of individuals with a history of tbi andor ptsd.

traumatic brain injury tbi and posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd have been described as the ''signature wounds of the recent conflicts.
