Authors also highlighted that PTSD may be an ''impor- tant mediator of the relationship between TBI and poor physical health outcomes p. 453 .At present there is a dearth of evidence-based treatments to address persistent PCS as well as co-occurring persistent PCS and PTSD symptoms .

While there are promis- ing data showing the potential of CAM approaches for TBI or PTSD  studies of CAM treatments for co-occurring TBI and PTSD have been limited.Mechanistically the role that inflammation plays in the onsetand perpetuation of psychiatric or post-TBI symptoms has gar- nered increased attention  .
