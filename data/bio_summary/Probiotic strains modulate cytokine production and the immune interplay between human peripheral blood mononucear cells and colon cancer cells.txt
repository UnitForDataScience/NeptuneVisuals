the results may clarify the way by which probiotics modify the intestinal environment resulting in a decline of colon cancer development.keywords probiotics cytokines peripheral blood mononuclear cells colon cancer cells cross-talkintroductionthe human body and particularly the gastrointestinal tract con- tain a silent health-sustaining partner represented by a vari- ety of microbial communities designated as microbiota or re- ferred by some authors as microbiome.

it is of interest that administration of antibiotics to af- fected mice reduced both tumor size and number.regarding the close relationship between chronic inflamma- tion and cancer growth it is plausible that probiotics may at- tenuate cancer development and progress by preventing inflam- matory processes.

a paired t-test was used to compare between the level of cytokine produced with various concentrations of ms and that found in control cultures incubated without ms. probability values of p  0.05 were considered as significant.

tel 972-3-9372397 fax 972-3-9372398 e-mail one sentence summary microbial strains incorporated in the probiotic affected pbmc' cytokine production and altered the cross-talk between immune and colon cancer cells.editor ce'lia ferreiraabstracthuman health is tightly connected with a great number of gut microbial cells designated as microbiome or microbiota.

ms added to pbmc co-cultivated with ht-29 or rko colon cancer cells resulted in downregulation of most cytokines except il-6 and tnfa and enhanced production of tnfa and il-1b.

the ms incorporated in the probiotic affected pbmc' cytokine production and altered the cross-talk between immune and colon cancer cells.

on the other hand any change of microbiome components may lead to serious complications including cancer development pevsner-fischer et al.
