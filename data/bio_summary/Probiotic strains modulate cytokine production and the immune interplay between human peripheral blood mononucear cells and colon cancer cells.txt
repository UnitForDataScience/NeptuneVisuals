At MS to PBMC ratio of 2.51 the production of TNFa IL-1b and IFNg was stimulated by 59 63 and 127 P  0.005 respectively whereas at ratios of 2.51 51 and 101 the secretion of IL-6 was reduced by 19 P  0.058 29 P  0.02 and 39 P  0.002 respectively.HT-29-induced cytokine productionThe secretion of TNFa and IL-6 by PBMC induced by HT-29 colon cancer cells was not affected following incubation with MS at the ratios indicated P  0.1 whereas that of IL-1b and IFNg was slightly reduced P  0.005.

The production of TNFa and IL-1b was slightly en- hanced P  0.0138 and P  0.001 respectively at the lower ratios of MS to PBMC by 39 and 30 respectively P  0.001 whereas that of IL-6 was reduced P  0.001 at and the higher ratio only by 17 P  0.005.Effect of MS on anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion Table The secretion of IL-10 and IL-1ra by non-stimulated PBMC was enhanced when cells were incubated with increased ratios of MS4FEMS Microbiology Letters 2017 Vol.

At MS to PBMC ratio of 51 the se- cretion of IL-1b and IFNg induced by HT-29 cells was inhibited by 16 P  0.03 and 26 P  0.01 respectively.RKO-induced cytokine productionThe production IFNg by PBMC induced by RKO colon cancer cells was not affected by incubation with MS at the ratios indicated P  0.1.

However MS caused a reduced secretion of IL-10 and IL-1ra when PBMC were stimulated by either LPS P  0.001 HT- 29 cells P  0.001 or RKO cells P  0.001.

At this ra- tio IL-10 and IL-1ra production by LPS-stimulated PBMC was in- hibited by 55 and 32 P  0.005 respectively that induced by HT-29 cells was lowered by 30 and 26 P  0.01 respectively and that induced by RKO cells was reduced by 43 and 23 P  0.02 respectively.DISCUSSIONThe present results show that the MS used in the study strongly prompted unstimulated PBMC to generate all cytokines exam- ined except for IL-1ra whose production was only slightly in- creased.

At MS to PBMC ratio of 2.51 the secretion of TNFa IL-1b IL-6 and IFNg was 5.5 4.4 2.55 and 2.4 times enhanced compared to PBMC incubated with- out MS P  0.001 and P  0.05.

At elevated ratios of bacte- ria to PBMC the increased production of cytokines was similar or even higher.LPS-induced cytokine productionThe production of TNFa IL-1b and IFNg by LPS-stimulated PBMC was significantly increased following incubation with MS P  0.001 while the secretion of IL-6 was dose-dependently re- duced P  0.001.

At MS to PBMC ratio of 2.51 51 and 101 the secretion of IL-10 by non-stimulated cells was 3.0 2.85 and 2.26 times higher than that of cells incu- bated without MS respectively P  0.02 and that of IL-1ra was enhanced by 55 47 and 40 respectively P  0.03.
