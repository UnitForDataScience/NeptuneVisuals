The BALOs are characterized by their parasitic lifestyle on other Gram-negative bacteria and represented 86.07 of the predatory bacteria in thesample while it summed up to 26.31 and 37.88 at IF and PA respectively.

Number of reads of different reported predatory taxa in the metagenomic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences.TaxaSite of Collection N of Reads aa The total number of reads obtained by Illumina sequencing is given.Isolation of Antibiotic Producing Predatory BacteriaIn the metagenomic analysis it was shown that only about 0.5 of the bacteria present in the environmental samples correspond to known predatory bacteria.

The T column indicates which strains were able to grow at an elevated temperature 40 C. The 16S rRNA sequences of the strains have been deposited at GenBank with the accession numbers MF796603-MF796631 and MF620093.Phylogenetic AnalysisFrom the originally isolated 35 strains showing antimicrobial activity 30 could be retained in vitro since five strains stopped growing under our culture conditions.

The latter group consists of more autonomous bacteria that in most cases possess larger genomes which provide them with a larger metabolic repertoire enabling themi to get access to scarce nutrients andor ii to produce bioactive specialized metabolites to protect themselves from predators or even to play this role .Mar.

The Firmicutes split mainly into Clostridiales and Bacillales other bacteria had a proportion 1.

The overall percentage of 0.50 - 0.44 of predatory bacteria in the environmental samples corresponds to reported values.

5 uL of a 1 mgmL sample solution was injected and flow rate was set to 0.3 mLmin.Supplementary Materials The following are available online at  Table S1 Isolated strains that showed antibiotic activity Table S2 Growth behavior at different NaCl concentrations Table S3 Growth behavior at different temperatures Table S4 Selected predatory bacteria reported in the literature.

At PA and MA the abundance of the targeted bacteria was 0.67 and 0.85 of total bacteria respectively.

If diffusion chambers like the iChip which was successfully applied in the isolation of the teixobactin-producing bacterium Eleftheria terrae  can be successfully applied to isolate social bacteria which hunt as wolf packs must be evaluated in the future.Interestingly by the approach applied in the project strains belonging to the Actinobacteria and Bacillales taxa were isolated which had not been reported before as predatory bacteria.
