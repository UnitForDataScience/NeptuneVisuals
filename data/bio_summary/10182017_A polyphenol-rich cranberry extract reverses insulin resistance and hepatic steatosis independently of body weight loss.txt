In the present study we aimed to investigate the potential of a polyphenol-rich extract from cranberry CE to reverse obesity and associated metabolic disorders in DIO-mice.Methods Mice were pre-fed either a Chow or a High Fat-High Sucrose HFHS diet for 13 weeks to induce obesity and then treated either with CE 200 mgkg Chow CE HFHS CE or vehicle Chow HFHS for 8 additional weeks.Results CE did not reverse weight gain or fat mass accretion in Chow- or HFHS-fed mice.

The gut microbiota of HFHS CE mice was characterized by lower Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and a drastic expansion of Akker- mansia muciniphila and to a lesser extent of Barnesiella spp as compared to HFHS controls.Conclusions Taken together our findings demonstrate that CE without impacting body weight or adiposity can fully reverse HFHS diet-induced insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis while triggering A. muciniphila blooming in the gut microbiota thus underscoring the gut-liver axis as a primary target of cranberry polyphenols.c 2017 The Authors.

Conversely levels of superoxide dismutase SOD SOD2 glutathione peroxidase GPx and catalase all important constituents of the cell's anti-oxidant defenses were not affected by diet treatment or the interaction of both F. Interestingly CE administration reversed the HFHS-induced mRNA overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 COX2 tumor necrosis factor-a TNFa nuclear factor k-light-chain- enhancer of activated B cells NFkB and NFkB inhibitor IkB sug- gesting a broad resolution of diet-induced hepatic inflammation in HFHS-fed CE-treated mice G. Consistent with improved he- patic steatosis we found higher mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor a PPARa and lower levels of both sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2 SREBP12 transcripts in the livers of HFHS CE mice versus HFHS mice H. Unexpectedly the mRNA expression of PPARg and liver X receptor a and b LXRab all nuclear factors linked to lipid anabolism was upregulated in HFHS CE in comparison with vehicle-treated HFHS-fed mice H.We then sought to investigate whether glucose homeostasis and in- sulin sensitivity were affected by CE administration in diet-induced obese mice.

Treatment also importantly influ- enced the gut microbiota PCo2 213 and separated vehicle- and CE-treated microbial communities of both Chow- and HFHS-fed mice A. b-diversity changes between HFHS and HFHS CE were accompanied by a drop in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in HFHS CE mice versus vehicle-treated HFHS-fed mice B. LEfSe analysis disclosed that obesity-driven dysbiosis was mostly explained by a reduction in the populations of Barnesiella Bifido- bacterium Turicibacter Anaerostipes and Clostridium and an expansion of Peptostreptococcaceae Clostridiales Oscillospira Oscillibacter Clostridiaceae and Anaerotruncus C. Admin- istration of CE to Chow-fed mice was associated with an increase of Clostridiales Lachnospiraceae and A. muciniphila D and Supplemental Figure 1 whereas in HFHS-fed mice CE-treatment was related to expansion of A. muciniphila Coprobacillus and Barnesiella E and Supplemental Figure 1.Because the presence of A. muciniphila in the gut microbiota has been linked to improved intestinal barrier and mucus layer integrity  we assessed fecal mucin as a readout of mucus layer thickness.

We found a reduction in fecal mucin in HFHS-fed mice as compared to Chow-fed mice which tended to be reversed in HFHS CE P 0.06 HFHS vs HFHS CE two-way ANOVA with Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test .

Linear discriminant analysis LDA effect size LEfSe was calculated in order to explore the taxa that more strongly discriminate between the gut microbiota of C Chow vs. HFHS D Chow vs Chow CE and E HFHS vs HFHS CE.

from the beginning of week 13 to the beginning of week 21 control groups Chow n 8 and HFHS n 8 were orally administered the animal facility's drinking water whereas the treated groups Chow CE n 11 and HFHS CE n 10 received a cranberry extract CE 200 mgkg Nutra Canada Quebec Canada.

Accordingly we found similar energy intake and fat mass accumulation when comparing Chow versus Chow CE and HFHS versus HFHS CE BC.

Quantifi- cation of liver triglycerides and ORO staining revealed massive tri- glyceride accumulation in the livers of HFHS mice which was fully reversed in HFHS CE mice BeD.
