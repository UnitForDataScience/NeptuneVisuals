A recent high-profile study showed that differences in melanoma growth were linked to the differences in intestinal microbiota composition of mice obtained from separate commercial suppliers   while differences in microbiota composition have also been implicated in susceptibility to both dextran sodium sulfate-induced   and Helicobacter hepaticus-induced colitis  .Such microbiota-level differences can arise due to internal or external influences on the gut environment.

A number of taxa which varied significantly between generations also contributed substantially to these inter-group differences including Turicibacter G1 to G2 3.98-fold increase G2 to G6 5.26-fold decrease G6 and AF2 342.47-fold lower in AF2 Bifidobacterium G1 to G2 2.70-fold increase G2 to G6 1.32-fold decrease AF1 and AF2 104.71-fold lower in AF2 and Roseburia 9.95-fold increase 1.05-fold decrease 8.62-fold lower in AF2.In keeping with microbiota-level analysis unsupervised PCA based on AF1 and AF2 metabolome data indicated substantial between-group differences with significant differences in 684 positive ESI and 850 negative ESI  respectively five-fold change difference in abundance ANOVA p  0.005.DISCUSSIONGiven the fundamental role of the gut microbiome in many aspects of host physiology the growing number of reports that implicate microbiota-level differences in the outcomes of in vivo experiments are perhaps unsurprising.

Shifts in microbiota composition were mirrored by corresponding differences in the fecal metabolome r  0.57 p  0.0001 with notable differences in levels of tryptophan pathway metabolites and amino acids including glutamine glutamate and aspartate.

Together these factors are likely to contribute to the substantial differences in intestinal microbiota in mice obtained from different commercial suppliers      .Importantly differences in microbiota composition can have a profound influence on the metabolites and excreted factors that the commensal intestinal bacteria collectively produces       .

While the increase in Bacteroidetes relative abundance between G1 and G2 was not significant significant differences were seen between G1 and G3p  0.001 and between G1 and G6 p  0.002.Inter-generational differences were also observed between G3 and G6 mice with a decrease in the median relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria p 0.039 and p 0.001 respectively ANOVA litter nested within generation with Bonferroni correction.

These changes suggest an ongoing intergenerational variance as opposed to a unidirectional process of acclimation.SIMPER analysis was used to identify the bacterial taxa that contributed most to the fecal microbiota differences between G1 and G2 as well as subsequent inter-generational differences determined based on contribution of 70 to the cumulative variance Supplementary Figure S4.

In addition no significant within-individual differences was observed across all time points PERMANOVA with Bonferroni correction p 0.288 9915 permutations and p 0.577 9956 permutations respectively Supplementary Table S3.Potential Contributors to Compositional VarianceThe influence of litter membership on the observed inter- generational differences was assessed by PERMANOVA testswith litter nested within generation.

Although the differences in the fecal microbiota of male and female mice were statistically significant when analyzed across all samples in the inter-generational study as a whole PERMANOVA p 0.002 9926 permutations sex was not a significant influence to the observed variation between mice generations PERMANOVA p 0.3164 9866 permutations Pseudo-F sex 3.32 gen sex 1.10 square root ECV sex 4.03 gen sex 1.63 residual 15.70 Supplementary Table S5.Intergenerational Changes in the Fecal MetabolomeDifferences in metabolome composition between the founder populations and subsequent generations assessed by unsupervised PCA indicated that the inter-generational differences in the fecal metabolome mirrored those in microbiota composition r 0.569 p 0.0001 and r 0.583 p 0.0001 respectively .
