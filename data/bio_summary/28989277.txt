Therefore as a marker the ratio proportion of 1 enzymatic functions that are overrepresented in GC-rich bacteria compared with GC-poor ones relative to 2 the whole DNA-encoded protein sample for the type of bacteria considered GC-poor or GC-rich were cho- sen. Because the relative ratio of these enzymatic functions is dif- ferent in GC-rich and GC-poor bacteria then rejection of the null hypothesis of equality of both proportions 1 for GC-rich and 1 for GC-poor bacteria in the bench experiment is to be expected if it mirrors the model where both proportions are different.There are at least 4 different methods to test the equality of 2 proportions but 1 based on the Z score is presented here.

It simply suggests that Corynebacterium at least the species considered here may be in a process of genome reduc- tion on the basis of the enzymatic apparatus of the family.When comparing enzymatic activities in GC-poor and GC-rich bacteria through the evaluation of their relative fre- quency according to the first digit of the EC numbers Table 4 oxidoreductases might explain the success of GC-rich bacte- ria because they were 2 times more frequent on average than in GC-poor ones.According to this observation the enzymatic comparison of the second digit Table 5 revealed a larger number of subcatego- ries 6 ie acting on the CH-CH group of donors--EC1.3.-.- act- ing on the CH-NH2 group of donors--EC1.4.-.- acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxygen--EC1.13.-.- acting on paired donors with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxy- gen--EC1.14.-.- acting on iron-sulfur proteins as donors--pn1  n22EC1.18.-.- with a larger EC number frequency 2 times more frequent in GC-rich compared with GC-poor bacteria in oxi- doreductases than in the other 4 categories of the first digit levelis the proportion of successes in the 2 samples combined Y1 and Y2 are the absolute frequency of success in samples 1 and 2 respectively.

those with GC-rich genomes surpass in relative number 75 the genera of bacteria with GC-poor genomes 25.8 In addition among the genera described by Gumiel et al8 the most widely repre- sented include species with GC-rich genomes whereas the genera only marginally represented include bacterial species with GC-poor genomes Table 2.

Also with the V3-V4 region differences between expected and observed fre- quencies of 10 to 300 times were reported by Zheng et al26 for this latter genus whereas the measure obtained using V1-V3 region was close to the expected value.The GC level of a genome is an interesting variable to con- sider because it is robust in the sense that it is expected to be globally conserved at the level of the family rank.13 Thus if one GC-poor bacterial species is present in one family there is a major likelihood that another species of that family will also be GC-poor.

Thus despite a bias introduced by LB fermentation is favorable for the growth of GC-poor bacteria the conclusion from the shotgun DNA sequencing is that overrepresented enzymatic activities are more frequent in relative terms in a medium fermented by GC-rich than in a medium fermented by GC-poor bacteria as suggested by the model analysis based on complete genome sequences available from National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI.DiscussionA recent investigation compared the microbiota of DTT in the presence or absence of T cruzi.24 Globally it showed a predom- inance of GC-rich bacterial species without considering the intracellular endosymbiont Arsenophonus25 as previously described78 except for Staphylococcus which predominated in some individuals of P megistus and T infestans.

In fact the positive correla- tion between GC3 and genome size suggests that in the DTT bacterial species with GC-rich genomes have a potentially more complex metabolism than those with GC-poor genomes which would be an advantage for the bacteria in this niche.The most significant differences that we found between the bacterial groups were due to oxidoreductase enzymes that are much more numerous in GC-rich than GC-poor bacteria and seem to confer a metabolic advantage to GC-rich bacteria in an environment such as blood in particular nitrate reductases and oxygenases that are common in GC-rich bacteria.In the enzymatic reaction involving nitrate reductases EC 1.7.99.4 KEGG map 91030 the electron transport system is similar to that of aerobic respiration.3132 It can be comple- mented by vitamin K to generate the energy required to survive in anaerobic conditions.33Oxygenases are enzymes that oxidize a substrate by the transference of gaseous oxygen.

Thus the biochemical differences were analyzed between the GC-rich rich in guanine  cytosine and GC-poor bacterial species found in the DTT emphasizing specific enzymatic functions that could explain the success of the former compared with the latter bacteria.12-16Materials and MethodsThe successive methodological steps followed to analyze the genome properties and enzymatic determinants in the particu- lar niche of DTT were as followsTo set up a metagenomic model of wild microbiota in DTT from species of bacteria having their genome completely sequenced and being as close as possible from the same genera to those identified by 16S rDNA sequencingTo characterize the gross genomic features genome size gene number GC level enzymatic annotation from bacteria of the metagenomic modelTo set up a working hypothesis based on the metagenomic model to justify the enzymatic determinants that make certain bacteria outcompete others in the DTT nicheTo validate the inference drawn from the metagenomic model through a bench experiment using a quantitative marker.

cCorrelation for genome size vs gene number.The shading regions in Table 3 is to improve the contrast between GC-rich gray and GC-poor white genomes.frequency according to the second digit within those of the first digit category between GC-poor and GC-rich bacteria were due to acting on single donors with incorporation of molecular oxy- gen--EC1.13.-.- difference of 24 times and acting on paired donors with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen-- EC1.14.-.- difference of 8 times.

This statistic means that GC-rich bacteria have enzymes with 3.3 times more enzy- matic functionalities than GC-poor ones on average accord- ing to the list of Table 6 which sustains the hypothesis that GC-rich bacteria outperform GC-poor bacteria because of their more complex metabolism which seems to be an advan- tage in the DTT.

A closer look at Table 7 enables understanding that the enzyme groups which most explain the differences between GC-rich and GC-poor bacteria are ranked by decreasing level of factor difference AvGCrAvGCp and that the data of Table 7 can be reorganized as shown in Table 8.In conclusion we can say from the divisions in Table 8 that oxygenases incorporation of oxygen in organic substrates and CoA ligases a central function in energy storage make up the main significant differences in comparison with the more basic metabolic functions between the GC-poor and GC-rich bac- teria.
