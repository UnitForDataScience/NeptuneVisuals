In addition amounts of plasma IL-10 a cytokine known to suppress inflammation were increased in mice colonized by WT L. reuteri Supplemental Figure 2f and whereas G-CSF and IL-6 were diminished Supplemental figure 2a  2e in SW mice colonized with WT L. reuteri Supplemental figure 2a-2f.Intestinal mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression by hdcA dgkA WT L. reuteriin gnotobiotic miceMucosal immune responses due to the presence and absence of histamine andor diacylglycerol kinase of wild type L. reuteri 6475 were measured in intestinal mucosal tissue samples.

Furthermore microbial DAG kinase appears to modulate myeloid cell maturation and cytokine production in vivo.ResultsWild type and mutant L. reuteri 6475 stably colonize the germ-free mouse intestineTen week-old BALBc germ-free mice were either colonized with L. reuteri 6475 WT WT or DhdcA L. reuteri 6475 DhdcA or DdgkA L. reuteri 6475 DdgkA on day 1 and maintained for 22 days Figure 1a.

L. reuteri resides close to intestinal epithelium and epithelial histamine receptors Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analysis used to see L. reuteri Lr localization in the mouse intestine a bc WT de DhdcA and f DdgkA Lr 6475.

Similarly SW mice colonized with WT Lr also showed increased mucus fucosylation with increased mucus secreting goblet cells Supplemental Figure 8av- 8aviii 8b.Histamine-dependent enhancement of CD11bGr-1Ly6Ghigh splenic myeloid cell maturation was offset by the absence of DAG kinase in L. reuteriTo determine if bacterial derived histamine has immunomodulatory effects by targeting myeloid cell maturation GF mice were colonized with WT DhdcA DdgkA Lr and a control group without any bacteria.

On day 23 the SW mice were euthanized and werecolonized with log109.83 - 0.24 of WT Lr per gram of cecal contents Supplemental Figure 1b.Systemic immune responses were suppressed by intestinal colonization with histamine- generating DAG kinase-producing WT L. reuteriTo identify whether hdcA dgkA L. reuteri 6475 colonization had an impact on immunomodulation of the mouse intestine pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin IL-1a IL-6 TNF-a IL-17 IL-22 IL-12 Eotaxin G-CSF and IFN-g were analyzed in the blood plasma of gnotobiotic and GF control mice.

Similarly IL-6 mRNA and protein quantities were significantly reduced in the cecal mucosa of SW mice colonized by WT L. reuteri compared to control GF mice Supplemental Figure 2g 2i-2j.Colonization by wild type dgkA but not mutant DdgkA L. reuteri inhibits mucosal PKC phosphorylation and NFkB accumulation in intestinal epitheliumSince PKC phosphorylation depends on availability of DAG through G-protein coupled receptor activation 5 phosphorylation of p-PKC was compared among the cecal mucosae of mice colonized by WT and mutant DhdcA or DdgkA L. reuteri in addition to control GF mice.

In addition mammalian DGK quantified from the cecal intestinal epithelium by immunoblot did not yield significant differences between control mice and the GF mice colonized with WT or mutant L. reuteri Supplemental Figure 3b.Bacterial histidine decarboxylase mRNA and luminal histamine present in the intestinal lumen of gnotobiotic BALBc mice colonized by L reuteriLuminal contents were treated with 99 methanol and the supernatants obtained were used for histamine quantification using LC-MS. WT L. reuteri 6475 and mutant DdgkA L. reuteri colonized BALBc mice yielded detectable luminal histamine qualitative data not shown.

After weaning all mice ten weeks old were colonized by gavaging with L. reuteri 6475 WT strain DhdcA Lr 6475 hdcA mutant strain or DdgkA Lr 6475 dgkA mutant strain 1109 bacterial cells in the presence of a 4 L-histidine diet on Day 1 and were euthanized on Day 23.

In addition GF mice colonized with DdgkA Lr did not result in suppression of IMCs in the spleen Figure 6b suggesting that loss of microbiome-derived DAG kinase and enhanced H1R signaling may offset effects via H2R on myeloid cell maturation.Additionally we observed reduced Ly6Ghigh and Ly6Gmedium populations in the spleens of mice that were colonized with WT L. reuteri compared to mice colonized by mutant DhdcA or DdgkA L. reuteri Figure 6a.L.

L. reuteri 6475 derived-Dgk secreted into the mediuma Conditioned media CM from WT L. reuteri Lr 6475 grown in LDM4 with lipid diacylglycerol DAG supplements for 12 hours were analyzed using Ekisgent nanoLC and the ABCIEX TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer.
