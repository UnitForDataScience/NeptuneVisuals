the lack of registration was because the protocol for our updated systematic review was the same as the one used in our primary review .criteria for considering studies for this reviewwe included randomized controlled trials rcts examining the effects of probiotics compared with placebo no treatment or any pharmacological therapy in patients aged 0-18 years with functional constipation diagnosed according to either the authors' definition or specific diagnostic criteria such as the rome ii iii or iv criteria     .

while some probiotic strains showed some ef- fects on defecation frequency none of the probiotics had ben- eficial effects on frequency of fecal incontinence or frequency of abdominal pain.

the second- ary outcome measures were defecation frequency frequency of fecal incontinence frequency of abdominal pain all at the end of the intervention period and adverse events.
