Adverse events were rare and not serious.Communicated by Peter de WinterWhat is KnownConventional treatment for functional constipation in children does not always provide satisfying improvement.Probiotics have been suggested as potential treatment modalities for this condition.What is NewProbiotics are ineffective for the management of functional constipation in children in terms of treatment success frequency of fecal incontinence and frequency of abdominal pain.Keywords Probiotics .

The most frequently occurring adverse events were abdominal pain vomiting and gastroenteritis.DiscussionSummary of evidenceThis systematic review demonstrates that probiotics are inef- fective for the management of functional constipation in chil- dren in terms of treatment success defecation frequency fre- quency of fecal incontinence and frequency of abdominal pain.

Data from one RCT  found that compared with placeboadministration of L. reuteri DSM 17938 significantly in- creased the frequency of bowel movements at the end of the intervention week 8 P  0.027 no data given in the refer- enced article.One RCT  showed that compared with placebo admin- istration of Bifidobacterium longum significantly increased the frequency of bowel movements at the end of the interven- tion week 10 P  0.012 no data given in the referenced article.One RCT  reported that compared with placebo admin- istration of Lactobacillus GG had no effect on stool frequency in children treated with lactulose 1 RCT n  84 MD -0.73 bowel movements per week 95 CI -1.79 to 0.39.One RCT  found that compared with the adminis- tration of a control product the administration of a fermented dairy product containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010 had no effect on stool frequency at the end of intervention 3.9 vs. 4.5 stools per week at week 3 respectively P  0.51.One RCT  showed that compared with placebo admin- istration of a mixture of seven probiotic strains had an effect on stool frequency at the end of the intervention week 4 however the difference between groups was of borderline statistical significance 1 RCT n  48 MD 0.54 defecations per week 95 CI 0.07 to 1.01.Frequency of fecal incontinence Fecal incontinence was re- ported in five RCTs     .

The lack of registration was because the protocol for our updated systematic review was the same as the one used in our primary review .Criteria for considering studies for this reviewWe included randomized controlled trials RCTs examining the effects of probiotics compared with placebo no treatment or any pharmacological therapy in patients aged 0-18 years with functional constipation diagnosed according to either the authors' definition or specific diagnostic criteria such as the Rome II III or IV criteria     .

While some probiotic strains showed some ef- fects on defecation frequency none of the probiotics had ben- eficial effects on frequency of fecal incontinence or frequency of abdominal pain.

The second- ary outcome measures were defecation frequency frequency of fecal incontinence frequency of abdominal pain all at the end of the intervention period and adverse events.

Defecation frequency frequency of fecal incontinence frequency of abdominal painRCTs involving 245 patients with chronic constipation.

The diagnosis of functional constipation is based on the Rome criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders cur- rently the Rome IV criteria  .

As new pediatric data have become available here we report an updated sys- tematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of using probiotics for the management of functional constipa- tion in children.
