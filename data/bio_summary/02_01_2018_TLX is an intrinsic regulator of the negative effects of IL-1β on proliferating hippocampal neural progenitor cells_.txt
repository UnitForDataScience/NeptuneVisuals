We demonstrate here that when TLX expression is suppressed by IL-1b there is a concurrent increase in p21 expression which suggests that IL-1b may suppress NPC proliferation by enhancing p21 expression.

Here we identify the NF-kB signaling path- way as a key mediator of the effects of IL-1b on TLX expression and demonstrate that the restoration of TLX expression is sufficient to prevent the negative effects of IL-1b on NPC expansion in vitro.

IL-1b-induced suppression of hippocampal neurosphere expansion is associated with increased p21 expression and reduced TLX expression.

Changes in TLX mRNA expression were mirrored by those in TLX protein expression F3 796  75.57 P 0.001 vs. control P  0.001 vs. IL-1b Fig.

Both GFP- andTLX-overexpressing cells display an increase in mRNA expression of IkBa in response to IL-1b treatment how- ever the increase in expression only reaches significance in TLX-transduced neurospheres F3 19  5.71 P  0.001 vs. TLX Fig 5G.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that TLX may protect against the IL-1b-induced suppression of hippocampal NPC proliferation and therefore TLX is an importantregulator of neuroinflammatory-induced changes in hip- pocampal neurogenesis.

This decrease is associated with a significant reduction in TLX expression--a regulator of NPC proliferation--and an increase in p21 expression a mediator of cell-cycle ar- rest and reduced proliferation 55-57.

P  0.01 P  0.0001 compared with control ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.IL-1b decreased mRNA expression of TLX after a short treatment duration for up to 24 h as well as after a longer treatment duration of 5 d. This supports previously published data that report an IL-1b- induced decrease in the protein expression of TLX at both 24 h 28 and 7 d 30.

In addition we observed an increase in mRNA expres- sion of the TLX target gene p21 after IL-1b treatment for up to 5 d. p21 expression in suppressed by TLX and when its expression is increased it induces cell-cycle618Vol.
