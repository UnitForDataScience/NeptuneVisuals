specifically we show that il-1b induces a decrease in hippocampal npc neurosphere ex- pansion which is consistent with previous reports 28 30. this decrease is associated with a significant reduction in tlx expression--a regulator of npc proliferation--and an increase in p21 expression a mediator of cell-cycle ar- rest and reduced proliferation 55-57. in addition we demonstrate that il-1b recruits the nf-kb pathway in embryonic hippocampal npc neurospheres and that pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to reverse the negative effects of il-1b on tlx expression.

p21 is a potent suppressor of the cell cycle and subsequently is an important regulator of cell pro- liferation 56. tlx has previously been shown to suppress the expression of p21 in neural stem cell cultures un- known source which is correlated with an increase in npc proliferation55 however the study didnotattempt to manipulate the increase in p21 expression--either by knockdown oranother method of inhibition--to assess the direct role of p21 on neural stem cell proliferation 55. the importance of p21 in regulating the proliferation of hip- pocampal npcs has since been establishedin p2122mice for which there is a significant increase in npc pro- liferation 59 therefore it is reasonable to suggest that the mechanism by which tlx regulates proliferation involves the regulation of p21 expression.

we demonstrate here that when tlx expression is suppressed by il-1b there is a concurrent increase in p21 expression which suggests that il-1b may suppress npc proliferation by enhancing p21 expression.

here we identify the nf-kb signaling path- way as a key mediator of the effects of il-1b on tlx expression and demonstrate that the restoration of tlx expression is sufficient to prevent the negative effects of il-1b on npc expansion in vitro.

this is con- sistent with a previous report that demonstrated that il-1b reduced protein expression levels of tlx in hippocampal npcs after 7 div 30. il-1b did not induce a reduction in cell viability at this dose and over this timeframe data not shown which is in agreement with previous data 27.il-1b induces rapid activation of nf-kbto assess whether il-1b administration induced the translocation of the nf-kb subunit p65 to the nucleus in hippocampal npcs--an indicator of nf-kb activation-- we assessed the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic expression of p65 rel a a key signaling component of the nf-kb pathway.

this corroborates previous data that show a reduction in tlx protein expression at 24 h in response to il-1b 28. as tlx functions as a transcriptional suppressor we assessed the effect of il-1b on the expression of the tlx target gene and the suppressor of proliferation p21.

therefore we extended our treatment times and observed that after 8 htlx is an intrinsic regulator of the negative effects of il-1b615figure 1. il-1b-induced suppression of hippocampal neurosphere expansion is associated with increased p21 expression and reduced tlx expression.
