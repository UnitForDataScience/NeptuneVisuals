No significant differences in the structure of kogiid gut microbiomes were detected based on sex ANOSIM P  0.18 or carcass condition P  0.36 Table .The high degree of host-specificity exhibited by kogiid gut microbiomes was also observed across more dis-tantly related host species including other toothed whales and baleen whales as cluster plots based on microbial community similarity grouped all individuals by host species Fig.

As such kogiid whales appear to represent a more fertile microbial habitat compared to other toothed whale species possibly related to the unique colonic sac that enlarges the large intestine of kogiid whales e.g.

Error bars represent -1 standard deviation.in these two kogiid hosts was comprised of 115 OTUs that accounted for most of the sequence reads recovered from K. breviceps 95.6 and K. sima 94.0 Table .The 25 most common OTUs in kogiid microbiomes were examined in further detail to compare their rel- ative abundances between kogiid hosts and presence in the microbiomes of other toothed and baleen whales Table .

Despite these shared dominant phyla several bacterial phyla distinguished kogiid micro- biomes from those in baleen whales Actinobacteria and Synergistetes were common in kogiid hosts 6-15 and 2-4 respectively while rare in baleen hosts 2 and 0.2 respectively while Spirochaetes were common members of baleen whale microbiomes 3-8 and extremely rare in kogiid hosts 0.03.Diversity of cetacean gut microbiomes.

Broader comparisons of diversity including previously characterized cetacean gut microbiomes revealed that kogiid whales hosted microbial com- munities with significantly P  0.05 higher diversity than those occurring in other toothed whales bottlenose dolphins  52 - 18 OTUs beluga whales  84 - 8 post hoc Tukey's HSD tests Fig.

As a result distinct microbial community structure was detected between kogiid species as well as among kogiid microbial communities and previously characterized gut microbiomes of other toothed and baleen whales.

The vast majority 84 to 91 of the gut microbiomes in baleen whale hosts hump- back whales right whales and sei whales were comprised of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes whereas non-kogiid toothed whale hosts were dominated by Proteobacteria 60 in bottlenose dolphins and Actinobacteria 66 in beluga whales Fig.

For comparative analyses previously characterized cetacean gut microbiome datasets were downloaded for bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas hump- back whales Megaptera novaeangliae right whales Eubalaena glacialis and sei whales Balaenoptera borealis Table .

In total five phyla exhibited differential abundances between hosts including significantly P  0.05 higher relative abundances of Bacteroidetes Verrucomicrobia and Lentisphaerae in K. breviceps and Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria in K. sima Table .Comparative analysis with other toothed and baleen whale species revealed that the dominance of the bacterial phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in kogiid microbiomes was more characteristic of baleen whales than those of other toothed whales Fig.

For example the most abundant OTU in both kogiid hosts OTU1 was unique to kogiid microbiomes unclassified below the phylum level Bacteroidetes and exhibited over 9 sequence divergence from the most closely related bacterium a symbiont characterized from elephant Elephas maximus feces Table .The few symbiont OTUs shared between gut communities of kogiid and other cetacean hosts were generally in very low abundance in one or both hosts with notable exceptions.
