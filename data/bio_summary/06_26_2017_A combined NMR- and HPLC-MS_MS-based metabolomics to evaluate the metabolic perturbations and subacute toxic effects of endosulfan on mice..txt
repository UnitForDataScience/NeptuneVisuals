Furthermore targeted amino acid detection showed that endosulfan perturbed serum amino acid metabolism in a dose-dependent manner with increasing dose of endosulfan the concentration of amino acids decreased significantly.DiscussionHistopathology and clinical biochemistry studyAfter exposure to endosulfan at two concentrations for 2 weeks hepatocellular inflammation and necrosis were clear- ly observed through histopathology investigation.

Therefore a deeper knowledge of metabolic perturbations andsubacute toxic effects of endosulfan at metabolomic level may provide novel insight into toxic mechanism and integrative risk assessment for environment and human health.Many studies indicated that endosulfan can induce a lot of toxic effects including neurotoxicity genetoxicity hepatoxicity cardiotoxicity reproductive toxicity endocrine disruption effects and oxidative stress responses Berntssen et al.

employed NMR-based metabolomics to investigate the toxic effects of endosulfan on earthworms and found that glutamineGABA- glutamate cycle metabolites were significantly changed which are highly related to neurotoxicity and apoptosis in- duced by endosulfan Yuk et al.

Acetate is an end product of fatty acid oxidation and the decreased level of acetate in mouse urine clearly indicates the perturbed b-oxidation of fatty acids which may result in affecting energy metabolism after endosulfan exposure.Lipid metabolismBased on metabolomic results glycerophospholipid me- tabolism metabolites such as choline PC GPC and ace- tate were significantly changed after endosulfan exposure.

6 Perturbed pathways and fluctuant metabolites induced by endosulfan exposuredecreased after endosulfan exposure in mice which clearly indicated the alteration in gut microbiota.

To sum up the alteration of hippurate and choline metabolism pathways indicated that endosulfan induced gut microbial col- ony changes in mice such fluctuation may affect absorption of nutrient from diet and hence the growth of the mice.ConclusionThis study represents metabolic perturbations and subacute toxic effects of mice exposed to endosulfan using HPLC- MSMS- and 1H-NMR-based metabolomics.
