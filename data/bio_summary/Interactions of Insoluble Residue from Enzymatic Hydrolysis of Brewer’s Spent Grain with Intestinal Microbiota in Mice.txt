However this study was designed to measure the metabolite and microbiota changes after INS supplementation and longer feeding studies would be required to reliably measure the changes in body weight and other metabolic parameters with INS and INScellulose mixtures.The bacterial numbers together with bacterial diversities were similar in all mice groups of our study at baseline and therefore the diet induced changes in the microbiota are comparable to each other.

Studies have also shown that cellulose significantly decreased -27 mean fecal transit time and increased mean wet fecal weight 57 in healthy volunteers.In our animal study we observed similar effectsFigure 2. continueddark red  fecal pellets 15 d after cellulose diet light green  cecal material after intervention diet containing insoluble lignin-rich fraction INS from brewer's spent grain BSG dark green  fecal pellets 15d after intervention diet containing INS light blue  cecal material after intervention diet containing INS 60 and cellulose 40 dark blue  fecal pellets 15 d after intervention diet containing INS 60 and cellulose 40.Figure 2.

It has also been previously shown that there may be mice that do not respond to the diet and these nonresponders may be confounding factors in the data analysis.There were also differences in bacterial diversity between thetested diets the diversities of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were lower after the cellulose diet as compared to the samples taken after the diets containing INS as has also previously been shown with HMPC in C57B L6 mice.Moreover diversity of predominant cecal and fecal bacteria were higher after the intervention in both groups consuming INS whereas no such difference was observed in the cellulose intervention diet group.

After acclimatization the mice were weighed and randomized into three diet groups n  8 mice in each in which 40 of their diet contained either INS orcellulose or their mixture a INS b cellulose c INS and cellulose 32.

However the bioavailability in themammalian body is not known.The aim of our study was to elucidate whether a lignin-rich fraction isolated from BSG is metabolized by the mice gut microbiota and assess its bioavailability to the animals and the effects on the mice gut microbiota.

Bacterial community analyses were performed using six different bacterial denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE methods developed and validated by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to assess the diversity and temporal stability of the selected bacterial populations by fecal bacterial community fingerprints.

The mice were fed a BSG insoluble residue INS 40 of the diet b cellulose Solka floc 40 of the diet or their mixture c INS 24 of the diet and cellulose 16 of the diet 32.

Cecal bacterial numbers were lower in most of the dietary groups and bacterial groups studied than fecal bacterial numbers at the beginning of the study 0 d feces vs cecum Univ Clept Bfra Ato Bif Lac for all dietary groups p  0.05.

Similarly the cecal bacterial numbers were also lower than the fecal bacterial numbers at the end of the study in most of the dietary groups and bacterial groups studied 15 d feces vs cecum Univ Clept Bfra Ato for all dietary groups p  0.05 .

Cecal bacterial numbers were lower than fecal bacterial numbers at the beginning of the study and after the dietary intervention in most of the bacterial groups studied as has previously been shown for Bacteroides spp.
