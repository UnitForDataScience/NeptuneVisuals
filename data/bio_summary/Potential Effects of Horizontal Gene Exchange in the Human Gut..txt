In conjugation experiments performed both in vitro and in cheese the transfer of erythromycin resistance between Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Enterococcus faecalis was detected.While antibiotic resistant pathogens portray a straight threat to human and animal health due to difficulties of their uproot- ing  resistance among commensal bacteria constitutes an indirect hazard as being a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes that can be shifted to pathogens via HGT.

From the safety standpoint it is necessary to distinguish between the intrinsic resistance which may constitute a normal physiology and metabolism for example inability of an antibiotic to enter the cell because of a particular cell wall structure or formation of a thick capsule and the transferable antibiotic resistance genes .

MGE-mediated transfer of genetic cargo from one organism to another greatly contributes to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes because it can take place between closely or non-related species and in diversified environments including the animal and human gut -.Notably the taxonomically distant prokaryotes of intestinal microbiome may share reservoir of closely related antimicrobial resistance genes .

Would the ingestion of probiotic cultures which may act as donors or recipients therefore increase the antibiotic resistance gene pool in the enteric ecosystem Some authors suggest that there is a gene flux from Gram-positive cocci such as enterococci or streptococci to Gram-negative bacteria with genes encoding for streptogramin resistance as an example .

Being lactic acid producing bacteria they contain plasmids con- taining genes conferring resistance to tetracycline erythromycinchloramphenicol lincosamide macrolides streptomycin and streptogramins .Leuconostoc and Pediococcus species can serve as recipients for the broad host range antibiotic resistance plasmids from Lactococcus species .

Although no evidence for the clonal spread of ESBLpAmpC-producing E. coli fromfarm animals or foods to humans was found ESBLpAmpC- producing E. coli with same resistance genes and plasmids were present in farm animals foods and humans suggesting HGT as a prevalent mechanism for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes.Diet-driven convergence in gut microbiome functions has been investigated with 33 mammalian species and 18 humans .

The role of bacteriophages plasmids conjugative transposons and integrons in transfer of genes by pathogenic human enteric pathobionts and subsequent acquisition of pathogenicity also pointed to HGT as an impor- tant step in the expansion of virulence traits and antibiotic resistance -.

The stature however had been acquired well before the recent safety concerns such as the carriage of antibiotic resistance genes on MGEs have been raised.

The safety issues associated with the antibiotic resistance gene pool in probiotics have also been noted earlier  .
