Given the risk of invasive disease resulting from colonization these results reveal important host and pathogen determined changes in the nasal microbiome that could be exploited to limit pneumococcal disease.ResultsExperimental Set UpTo determine the contributions of IL-17 signalling to the composition and behaviour of the nasopharyngeal and lung microbiome before and after pneumococcal colonization we utilized IL-17RA knockout mice and wild type mice both bred in house and cohoused for 6 weeks after weaning as described in the Methods.

Numerical estimate of sample coverage using the abundance-based coverage esti- mator showed a median OTU coverage of 92.7 with no significant difference between wild type and IL-17RA knockout animals Additional file Figure S1B.To confirm that a lack of the IL-17RA receptor resulted in expected changes in IL-17 cytokine targets we assayed for known IL-17 targets following SRL1 infection in wild type and IL-17RA knockout mice Additional file  Figure S2.

In- deed another study investigating the role of type III interferon in susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus superinfection found a significant impact of deletion of the gene encoding the type III interferon receptor on the composition and dynamics of the murine nasal micro- biome following influenza infection In contrast to the differences observed in the nasal microbiome be- tween wild type and Il17ra KO animals we found very similar bacterial communities in the lungs of these animals.Our experiments utilised animals with a genetic defect in IL-17RA the common receptor subunit for IL-17 family cytokines.

In both groups of mice the alterations in interactions between the members of the microbiome were still evident 14 days after pneumococcal inoculation.The lung microbiome of wild type animals showed no disruption following pneumococcal nasal colonization but in the absence of IL-17 signalling there was a significant alteration in the composition of the microflora.

A similar pattern was repeated in the lower respiratory tract samples among exposed mice P  0.0001 although in this case there was no correlation among unexposed mice P0.25.Differences in Gene Function between Wild Type and IL-17RA KO Nasal MicrobiomesFinally we compared the gene function of the nasal microbiome between wild type and IL-17RA knockout animals using Tax4Fun as described in the Methods to infer gene composition from the 16S amplicon analysis.

We confirmed that the known IL-17 target genes beta- defensin 4 S100A8 and macrophage inhibitory protein-1 alpha  were strongly induced following SRL1 infection in wild type animals but their expression was significantly and strongly abrogated in IL-17RA knockout mice.Resting nasal microbiomeThe wild type nasal microbiome had a median of 292 OTUs observed per sample.

Following colonization with the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae there is significantly enhanced recovery of this microbe from the nasopharynx of Il17ra knockout mice and multiple changes in microbiome composition even in animal without established pneumo- coccal colonization.

Following experimental inoculation of S. pneumoniae in both wild type and Il17ra knockout KO animals there were multiple changes in the composition of the nasal microbiome even in animals that did not show established colonization.

In both sites levels of this OTU were significantly higher in the IL-17RA knockout animals compared to wild type 2-way ANOVA p  0.05 for both sites.Changes in the relative abundance of the top 20 most abundant OTUs within the nose following pneumococcal colonization are shown in Fig.

In both wild type and in Il17RA knockout ani- mals there is an expansion in proteobacteria in animals that do not show significant colonization with OTU2 Additional file Figure S5A.
