in this review we highlight recent progress in human microbiome research and how modifications to the microbiome could result in implications to human health.

furthermore we discuss the application of a 'design-build-test' framework to expedite microbiome engineering efforts by reviewing current literature on three key aspects design principles to engineer the human microbiome methods to engineer microbiome with desired functions and analytical techniques to examine complex microbiome samples.addresses1 department of biochemistry yong loo lin school of medicine national university of singapore 117596 singapore2 nus synthetic biology for clinical and technological innovationsyncti life sciences institute national university of singapore 117456 singapore3 department of paediatrics yong loo lin school of medicine nationaluniversity of singapore 119074 singaporecorresponding author chang matthew wook  these authors contributed equally to this work.introductionrecent discoveries on the roles of the human gut micro- biome in health and diseases have inspired novel means for prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against dis- ease onset and progression.

to support this proposition we herein assess the status of human gut microbiome engineering with a focus on three key aspects design principles to engineer the human microbiome methods to reassemble microbiome with desired functions and analytical techniques to examine complex microbiome samples.designharnessing the design principles of natural microbiome represents a pioneering step for rational microbiome engineering.

on the contrary in86 pharmaceutical biotechnologyfigure 1the design principles of human microbiome.the complex biology of human gut microbiome has been investigated in various aspects including composition and dynamics biogeography and metabolic activity.

environment factors such as antimicrobial level nutrient availability ph and oxygen affect the distribution of dominant species across the human gastrointestinal tract leading to unique regulation of host biology at specific niches  cross-kingdom communication with human host such as signaling cascades involved in gut-brain interactions healthy adults large-scale analyses have revealed remarkable intrapersonal stability of gut microbiota com- positions despite their large interpersonal variation  fecal contents reported a 60 conservation of micro- biota members in a diet-controlled cohort over 5 years  position between unhealthy individuals and healthy controls microbial signatures of disease manifestation dysbiosis could be inferred.

besides antibiotics drugs used in the treatment of other human disorders could also be effective modulators of the human microbiome.

reported a novel method to design a 4-component macronutrient diet which when fed to gnotobiotic mice harbouring a model community of human gut bacteria resulted in a predictable transformation of the microbiota composition88 pharmaceutical biotechnologyfigure 2engineering gut microbiome diversity and functions.current methods to engineer microbiome could be broadly classified as biotic microbiota transplants designer probiotics or engineered phages or abiotic pertubations drugs dietary shifts  intentional shift transition of the human microbiota.

the humanized mice models were then used to interrogate the effects of microbial diversity and taxonomic composition on various aspects of human health such as metabolic and immune- mediated pathologies and human pregnancy .

the human microbiome project analyzed 16s variable regions regions v1-v3 are for complementary taxonomic view v3-v5 are annotated to identify all samples to map the bacterial populations in the human body using the genboree microbiome toolset and ribosomal database project classifier.

these perturbations in the microbiome give a better understanding on how microbial-host and microbial-microbial interactions affect the host environment.conclusionin this review we describe various aspects of the human microbiome and how modifications to the composition and functionality of the microbiome can result in implica- tions to human health.

the engineering of human microbiome for health benefits and related applications could be observed across many disciplines in nanotech- nology chemistry and biology.

nanoscale instruments are being fabricated to interface with human microbiome for real-time monitoring of health status or for on-site protection against early disease onset .
