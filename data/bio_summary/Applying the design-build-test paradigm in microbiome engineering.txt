This work critically demonstrate the regulatory role of short-chain fatty acids in microglia homeostasis suggesting the possiblity of manipulating gut-brain axis through metabolites generated by gut bacteria.This work analyzed the microbiome of largest human cohort so far revealing the diversity and abundance of signature microbes in special body niches.This article provides a framework for the systematic discovery of func- tional probiotics through the use of antibiotics to perturb the human gut12... microbiome.This work combined low-error 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon and whole- genome sequencing to characterize fecal microbial contents of human subjects over a 5-year period demonstrating the species-level stability of human microbita.92 Pharmaceutical biotechnology 50.

In this review we highlight recent progress in human microbiome research and how modifications to the microbiome could result in implications to human health.

Furthermore we discuss the application of a 'design-build-test' framework to expedite microbiome engineering efforts by reviewing current literature on three key aspects design principles to engineer the human microbiome methods to engineer microbiome with desired functions and analytical techniques to examine complex microbiome samples.Addresses1 Department of Biochemistry Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine National University of Singapore 117596 Singapore2 NUS Synthetic Biology for Clinical and Technological InnovationSynCTI Life Sciences Institute National University of Singapore 117456 Singapore3 Department of Paediatrics Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine NationalUniversity of Singapore 119074 SingaporeCorresponding author Chang Matthew Wook  These authors contributed equally to this work.IntroductionRecent discoveries on the roles of the human gut micro- biome in health and diseases have inspired novel means for prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against dis- ease onset and progression.

To support this proposition we herein assess the status of human gut microbiome engineering with a focus on three key aspects design principles to engineer the human microbiome methods to reassemble microbiome with desired functions and analytical techniques to examine complex microbiome samples.DesignHarnessing the design principles of natural microbiome represents a pioneering step for rational microbiome engineering.

On the contrary in86 Pharmaceutical biotechnologyFigure 1The design principles of human microbiome.The complex biology of human gut microbiome has been investigated in various aspects including composition and dynamics biogeography and metabolic activity.

Environment factors such as antimicrobial level nutrient availability pH and oxygen affect the distribution of dominant species across the human gastrointestinal tract leading to unique regulation of host biology at specific niches  cross-kingdom communication with human host such as signaling cascades involved in gut-brain interactions healthy adults large-scale analyses have revealed remarkable intrapersonal stability of gut microbiota com- positions despite their large interpersonal variation  fecal contents reported a 60 conservation of micro- biota members in a diet-controlled cohort over 5 years  position between unhealthy individuals and healthy controls microbial signatures of disease manifestation dysbiosis could be inferred.

integrated human phenotypes serum metabolome and gut microbiome datasets to identify and validate Prevotella copri as the driving species that induce insulin resistance in human host via branched-chain amino acids biosynthesis regu- lation .

Besides antibiotics drugs used in the treatment of other human disorders could also be effective modulators of the human microbiome.

reported a novel method to design a 4-component macronutrient diet which when fed to gnotobiotic mice harbouring a model community of human gut bacteria resulted in a predictable transformation of the microbiota composition88 Pharmaceutical biotechnologyFigure 2Engineering gut microbiome diversity and functions.Current methods to engineer microbiome could be broadly classified as biotic microbiota transplants designer probiotics or engineered phages or abiotic pertubations drugs dietary shifts  intentional shift transition of the human microbiota.

The humanized mice models were then used to interrogate the effects of microbial diversity and taxonomic composition on various aspects of human health such as metabolic and immune- mediated pathologies and human pregnancy .
