None of these patients developed repeat abscess formation at these sites on fol- low-up imaging Table .The drainage technique in this study was CT-guided percutaneous catheter placement using relatively small caliber drainage catheters median 10 F range 8-14 F. Early studies used the trocar technique and larger drainage catheters reported higher complication rates while modern series use Seldinger technique and small-bore catheters reported rates similar to this study .

The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of percutaneous lung parenchymal abscess catheter drainage after broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy failure and correlate with patient microbiologic samples.Materials and Methods Retrospective review of patients who underwent percutaneous lung abscess drainage at a tertiary hospital system from 2005 to 2015 was performed.

The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of percutaneous lung parenchymal abscess catheter drainage after broad-spec- trum antibiotic therapy failure and correlate with patient microbiologic samples.Materials and MethodsPatient Selection and Data CollectionIn accordance with the Institutional Review Board retro- spective review was performed of all patients who under- went percutaneous parenchymal lung abscess drainage between 2005 and 2015 at a tertiary academic medical center by examining the records in a dedicated quality assurance QA database compiled daily from the interventional radiology division's master QA database Hi-IQ ConexSys Lincoln RI USA.

Technical success was defined as positioning of locking loop or all side holes of straight drains of the catheter into the lung abscess cavity.The electronic medical records of each patient were examined for procedure details including technical suc- cess and complications comorbidities age at drain placement duration of drainage therapy complications if applicable and outcome of drainage.

Conclusion In cases of persistent lung abscess after broad- spectrum antibiotics percutaneous abscess drainage is highly sensitive for microbiologic sampling compared to sputumbronchoscopic or blood cultures.

Additionally percutaneous drainage of lung parenchymal abscess cavi- ties may promote resolution of the abscess with high rates of therapeutic success and low complications.Keywords Pulmonary abscess  Drainage  Lung infection  MicrobiologyIntroductionAirway infections represent one of the most common causes of mortality worldwide.

Many of these patients are poor surgical candi- dates due to multiple comorbidities or critical illness andpercutaneous drainage may be offered as an alternative to thoracotomy with wedge resection or lobectomy .

Sev- eral case series have evaluated the efficacy of lungTable 1 Patient and drain demographicsValueparenchymal abscess catheter drainage demonstrating varying efficacy with clinical resolution of the abscess ranging between 37.5 and 100  -.

Clinical documentation andor temporally related tai- loring of antibiotic therapy following the growth of abscess cultures were considered evidence of therapeutic change due to abscess cultures.In total 19 initial drainage catheter placements were performed on 16 different patients six females and ten males.

Patient follow-up until tube removal or death was 100.Median total duration of drainage was 8 days range 1-107 days.
