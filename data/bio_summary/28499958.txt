In patients B and C who were only treated for 3 days and 4 days respectively the D3 samples were the Dstop samples only four samples were analysed.

It was shown here by the failure to detect blaCTX-M genes when the bacteria carrying them were at low levels.Nevertheless metagenomics allowed the detection of specific pat- terns undetected by culture but presumably not attributable to imipenem such as the specific patterns of the colostomy samples from patient K the reduced diversity and increased proportion of Bacteroides in samples D0 D3 and Dstop from patient G probably linked to the fluoroquinolones received before imipenem  and the increased proportion of Proteobacteria in samples Dstop D15 and D30 from patient F who received vancomycin after imipenem .In conclusion metagenomic and culture-based techniques were highly complementary in characterising the gut microbiota from clin- ical specimens and showed that imipenem induces minimal changes in these patients who have usually been previously exposed to an- tibiotics and hospitalisation.

The microbiota patterns in some samples from patients K D0 and D3 G D0 D3 and Dstop and F Dstop D15 and D30 differed from those of other samples in terms of pro- portions of the most prevalent genera Supplementary Fig.

In patient K samples D0 and D3 taken from a drainable pouch after colostomy were enriched in Lactobacillales Streptococcus Lactococcus and Lactobacillus and depleted in40BDetection of blaCTX-M and carbapenemase genesblaCTX-M gene fragments were detected in 27.1 1348 of the samples including all those from patients F and M but in none from patients C D E H and P and intermittently from the others.

Patient K had a colostomy from 41 days before to Day 9 of imipenem treatment the D0 and D3 samples were obtained from the colostomy whereas the Dstop D15 and D30 samples were normal faecal samples.

The metagenomic analysis showed that samples from the same patient clustered together even though the duration of imipenem treatment varied between individuals and most patients were exposed to multiple antibiotics before andor after imipenem.

lusitaniaeBacteroides but not the three further samples obtained after the co- lostomy was closed.No significant differences were detected when the overall bac- terial communities of samples from the different sampling points was compared PERMANOVA pairwise tests P  0.1493-0.968.

Shannon diversity was lower in these samples median 0.74 interquartile range IQR 0.65-0.93 than in other samples median 1.76 IQR 1.39-1.99.

Samples with higher proportions of Enterobacteriaceae correlated with higher counts of blaCTX-M genes Spearman's r  0.66 .The carbapenemase gene ccrA from Bacteroides also called cfiA was identified in four samples Dstop and D15 of patient C and Dstop and D30 of patient K. No other carbapenemase genes were detected.Detection of yeastsYeasts were identified in only three samples of patient K Kluyveromyces at D0 Candida at D15 and both genera at D3 using MetaPhlAn2.

Kluyveromyces was by far the most abundant genus in the two colostomy samples from patient K.Comparison of metagenomic and culture techniquesOf the 27 samples positive for ESBL-E in culture 14 were neg- ative for blaCTX-M genes in metagenomics suggesting insufficient sequencing depth.
