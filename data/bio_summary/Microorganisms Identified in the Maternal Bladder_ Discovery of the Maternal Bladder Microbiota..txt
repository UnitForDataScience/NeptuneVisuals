Thus transurethral catheterized urine specimens accurately sample the bladder and are thus the appropriate urine collection method for investigation of the bacteria presentreceivedMarch 2 2017 accepted after revision August 15 2017DOI ISSN 2157-6998.Copyright c 2017 by Thieme Medical Publishers Inc. 333 Seventh Avenue New York NY 10001 USA.Tel 1212 584-4662.in the urinary bladders of women the female bladder microbiota.13To determine whether bacterial DNA detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing originated from live bacteria within the bladder our group developed an enhanced quantitative urine culture protocol that detects bacteria in the vast majority of catheterized urine samples deemed no growth by standard clinical microbiology urine culture meth-ods.1415 Thus standard urine culture does not detect thepresence of a large number of bacterial species including most uropathogens.16Given compelling enhanced culture and DNA sequence evidence that the female urinary bladder of perimenopausal women is not sterile we questioned the sterility of urine obtained from the bladders of younger pregnant women.

As per clinical protocol a portion of the urine sample was placed into a BD Vacutainer Plus CS preservative tube and sent to the research laboratory for standard urine culture and enhanced quantitative urine culture assessment.

If no growth was observed the culture was reported as no growth indicating no growth of bacteria at the lowest dilution that is 11000.bFor enhanced quantitative urine culture we struck 0.1 mL of urine onto BAP chocolate and CNA agars BD BBL prepared plated media which wereincubated in 5 CO2 at 35degC for 48 hours.

The culture profile B divided into 13 profiles S. epidermidis L. gasseri S. anginosus L. jensenii C. glabrata E. faecalis L. iners L. johnsonii C. coyleae A. schaalii G. vaginalis and a mixed profile termed diverse.Table 3 Frequency of profiles using either sequence or enhanced quantitative urine culture dataAbbreviation BDT below detection threshold.aA diverse profile indicates a diverse community lacking a single predominant organism.Enterococcus N 14 2 or the family Enterobacteriaceae which contains the species E. coli N 14 1.

Thus with respect to the major dominant profiles sequencing and en- hanced quantitative urine culture obtained similar results.The combination of 16S sequencing and enhanced quan- titative urine culture detected bacteria in 80 4151 of participants and reached the same conclusion regarding urotype in 64 3351 of all the participants.

This high rate of microbe detection stands in stark contrast to the low rate of detection by the standard urine culture method which had a 100 false-negative rate for identification of bladder microbes compared with enhanced quantitative urine culture.

Critically standard urine culture did not identify several known or emerging uropathogens.The evidence of live microbes in the bladders of most pregnant women questions the notion that the urine ofTable 5 Uropathogens detected by enhanced quantitative urine culture in the urine samples of 15 patientsAbbreviation pPROM preterm premature rupture of the membrane.pregnant womenissterile.

Further research is needed to understand how the microbiota might also play preventative or protective roles and to determine the dysbiotic effects of antibiotics.The strengths of this investigation are the prospective design the use of catheterized urine specimens and the useof the robust combination of enhanced quantitative urine culture and 16S rRNA sequencing techniques.141522 Togetherthese techniques illustrate the limited view provided by the standard urine culture which was specifically designed to detect fast growing bacteria with limited nutrient require-ments and no aversion to oxygen especially E. coli the most common cause of UTI.

Even given these discrepancies with sequen- cing data however the culture data clearly shows the pre- sence of more than 103 CFUs of many different organisms including known and emerging uropathogens.As this study also documents the poor performance of the standard urine culture these findings offer us the opportu- nity to improve our understanding of the maternal bladder microbiota especially as it relates to clinically relevant definitions of ASB.

Of particular concern was the finding of bacteria by our enhanced quantitative urine culture techni- que that had gone undetected by the standard urine culture method.
