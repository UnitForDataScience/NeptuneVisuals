longtime exposure to low-level an- tibiotics imposes negative impacts on the bionts living in aquatic ecosystems  and microbial community may0043-1354c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.also structurally and functionally shift greatly in response to the environmental changes .current studies have focused on the fates of antibiotics args and pathogens in wastewater treatment plants and the receiving rivers  but correlations among the co- occurring args and between the args and bacterial community were seldom reported.

additionally the total abundance of args was positively correlated p  0.05 with the total concen- tration of the detectable antibiotics as well as separately with the concentration of each class of the antibiotics table s6.correlations among bacterial community mges and argsin general about 25 of contigs carrying args in all the samples could be taxonomically annotated at the genus level and it could reveal the main hosts of the detectable args in this study.

however the roles of hgt and microbial com- munity shift in the resistome alteration in the wastewater- receiving rivers remain unknown.currently molecular methods including polymerase chain re- action pcr and real time quantitative pcr qpcr have been widely used to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the occurrence distribution and fate of args in water environments  but they are usually limited by the number of validated primers for target args which makes it difficult for re- searchers to comprehensively profile microbial antibiotic resis- tance in the environment.

high-throughput sequencing hts based metagenomic analysis provides powerful tools for solving the above technical problems due to its capability of broad- spectrum scanning and accurate quantification which has been successfully applied in exploring the args in different environ- mental compartments such as river sediments   activated sludge  and drinking water  .in this study hts-based metagenomic approaches were applied to comprehensively investigate the distribution patterns of antibi- otics bacterial community and args in pig farming wastewater and its receiving river water.

the basic as- sembly information was summarized in table s2.to determine the diversity and abundance of environmental args and mges blast tool was applied to annotate sequencing reads and predicted orfs against offline databases of args and mges including integrons plasmids and insertion sequences iss using our previously established methods  .

args profiles arg subtypes and bacterial community genus level of each sample were grouped by cluster analysis using past paleontological statistics software university of oslo norway and by principal coordinate analysis pcoa using r software version 3.2.3. mantel test and canonical correspon- dence analysis cca were performed to determine the potential links among bacterial community structure mges and args dis- tribution and the associations between chemical parameters and bacterial community.

s6.co-occurrence of args in the wastewater and its receiving river waternetwork analysis of the co-occurring args consisted of 50 nodes arg subtypes and 393 edges with clustering coefficient of 0.74 and the connections showed strongly and significantly posi- tive correlations p 0.01 and r 0.8 .

this study showed that co-occurrence was evident for the args within the same type including aminoglycoside and beta-lactam which is supported by revealing the positive selection on args posed by antibiotics in manure-polluted aquatic environ- ment.

plasmids often carry the args encoding resistance to tetra- cycline tetx m-l-s ermf and chloramphenicol catii and transposons harbor the args encoding resistance to tetracycline tetq and m-l-s ermb in bacteroides sp.

network analysis showed that 25.26 args within the same type or among the different types showed higher incidences of non-random co-occurrence.

this study may help to understand the correlations among antibiotic resistome microbiota and environmental conditions in the wastewater- receiving river water.c 2017 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.introductionthe intensive use of antibiotics for veterinary and agricultural proposes coupled with medical treatment has caused severe antibiotic pollution and subsequently promoted the introduction dissemination and accumulation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and resistance genes args in the aquatic environments .

besides domestic sewage and hospital wastewater animal farming wastewater have become one of the main sources of an- tibiotics and args in surface water  and ground water .

discharge of the wastewater might cause potential health risks to the local residents since it has been reported that high diversity of args  and a considerable amount of pathogenic bacteria   can be released through wastewater effluents to the receiving water bodies.
