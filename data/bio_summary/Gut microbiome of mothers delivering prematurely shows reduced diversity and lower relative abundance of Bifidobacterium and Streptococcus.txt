measures of alpha diversity shannon phylogenetic diversity and observed operational taxonomic units and microbiome composition were combined with information from the medical birth registry pregnancy journals and questionnaires.resultsthe association between maternal gut diversity and preterm delivery was examined using logistic regression.

intake of probiotic foods has previously been found to influence spontaneous preterm birth in the norwegian mother and child cohort  and more studies are needed to determine whether this could affect the association between gut diversity and preterm birth.conclusionin this state-of-the-art study on the maternal gut microbiome's role in preterm delivery we report an association between low bacterial diversity and increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.

the sponta- neous preterm delivery mothers also had significantly lower abundance of otus belonging to the genera bifidobacterium and streptococcus and to families in the clostridiales order.to our knowledge this is the first study comparing bacterial gut diversity in mothers of pre- term and term deliveries using next-generation sequencing as well as taking into account maternal characteristics that could confound the association.

to assess this we compared median gut diversity in mothers delivering prematurely by caesarian section to mothers delivering at term in nomic.

gut diversity measured by shannon in mothers of 4 delivery types vaginal term n  102 c-section term n  19 c-section preterm n  21 and vaginal pretermn  19. mothers reporting antibiotic use during or after delivery were excluded.

alpha diversity is a mea- sure of diversity within a subject  which enables comparisons between mothers.

low diversity microbiomes from pregnant women induce inflammatory markers when transplanted into germ free mice indicating that low gut diversity may be one underlying cause of increased inflammation .

gut diversity at 4 days postpartum was used as a proxy for diversity at the end of pregnancy.

2017 gut microbiome of mothers delivering prematurely shows reduced diversity and lower relative abundance of bifidobacterium and streptococcus.

a rich and diverse microbial composition in the gut indicates increased robustness and strength against pathogen attack   whereas low gut diversity is found in diseases associated with a heightened inflammatory state such as ibd and obesity .

we hypothesize that premature birth will be associated with lower overall diversity and differences in specific taxa in the maternal gut microbiome postpartum when compared to full term births.materials and methodsstudy cohortthe norwegian microbiota study nomic was established to study the composition of mother and infant gut microbiota and subsequent health outcomes.
