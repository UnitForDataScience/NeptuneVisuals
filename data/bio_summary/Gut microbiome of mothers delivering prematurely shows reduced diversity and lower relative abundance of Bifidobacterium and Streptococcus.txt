Measures of alpha diversity Shannon Phylogenetic Diversity and Observed Operational Taxonomic Units and microbiome composition were combined with information from the Medical Birth Registry pregnancy journals and questionnaires.ResultsThe association between maternal gut diversity and preterm delivery was examined using logistic regression.

Low diversity microbiomes from pregnant women induce inflammatory markers when transplanted into germ free mice indicating that low gut diversity may be one underlying cause of increased inflammation .

Gut diversity at 4 days postpartum was used as a proxy for diversity at the end of pregnancy.

Between communities diversity beta diversity was calculated using unweighted unifrac and visualized with Principal Coordinate Analysis PCoA.

Alpha diversity is a mea- sure of diversity within a subject  which enables comparisons between mothers.

Intake of probiotic foods has previously been found to influence spontaneous preterm birth in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort  and more studies are needed to determine whether this could affect the association between gut diversity and preterm birth.ConclusionIn this state-of-the-art study on the maternal gut microbiome's role in preterm delivery we report an association between low bacterial diversity and increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.
