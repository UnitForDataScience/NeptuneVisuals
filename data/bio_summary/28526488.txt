Administering GS9674 with food lowered systemic expo- sure.Ongoing trials will address the safety and efficacy of GS9674 alone in patients withNASHor combined with selonsertib in patients with steatosis and elevated liver stiffness.Selon- sertib formerly GS4997 is an inhibitor of the apop- tosis signal-regulation kinase that alone or in combination with the monoclonal antibody sim- tuzumab has been shown to reduce liver fibrosis and liver fat content in patients with NASH and moderate to severe liver fibrosis stages F2 and F3.

Since patients with advanced cirrhosis who are the patients most in need of rifaximin have lower intestinal BA concen- trations the hydrophobicity of the traditional com- pound could be a hindrance.

A phase II study of rifaximin SSD in patients with early decompensated cirrhosis showed that the 40 mg immediate release formula- tion could reduce hospitalisations and death because of reductions in all cirrhosis-related com- plications especially HE in patients with cirrho- sis.In view of this rifaximin could be construed as more than an antibiotic and results from ongoing studies in chronic liver diseases are awaited.

clearly underlining the inter- est in this field.Many years ago pre-biotics such as inulin were shown to reduce hepatic lipogenesis and serum triglycerides in humansattributable to their fer- mentation by gut microbiota and the associated increase in short chain fatty acids such as propi- onate in the colon and portal vein.However the lack of high-quality clinical trials has recently been emphasised.Ongoing well-designed trials may fill the void and evaluate the effects of prebiotic supple- mentation adjunct to those achieved with diet- induced weight loss on hepatic injury and liver fat the gut microbiota inflammation glucose toler- ance and satiety in patients with NAFLD.A recent meta-analysis of prosymbiotic use in NAFLDNASH utilising different 8 to 30 week regi- mens concluded that this approach can produce positive effects.Some probiotics lead to a signif- icant reduction in liver transaminases TNF and insulin-resistance.Such improvements in cytokine profile insulin action and hence glyceamic control have recently been underlined in another RCT in patients with NAFLD.Additionally three double- blind randomised placebo-controlled trials were presented at the last AASLD.

However only 520 patients in the placebo group compared to 1019 patients in the VSL3 group underwent a second liver biopsy introducing a risk of selection bias.

In fact a recent meta-analysis of 14 studies including a total of 1152 patients with cirrhosis demonstrated that probiotics are effective at improving minimal HE MHE and preventing progression to overt HE as well as reducing hospitalisation rate in patients with underlying MHE.As for secondary prophy- laxis probiotics demonstrated non-inferiority to lactulose in one trial but symbiotic treatment using VSL3 failed.

Therefore these promising data need confirming in larger cohorts of patients with various aetiologies and advanced stages of cirrhosis with long-term follow-up.In terms of efficacy a well-designed RCT on FMT via rectal enema is available utilising stool from one ideal OpenBiome donor that has been selected using cross-sectional HE microbiome data and being applied after a five-day course of antibi- otic pre-treatment in patients with cirrhosis and P2 HE episodes on lactulose - rifaximin.

This has therapeutic potential in patients with hepatic encephalopa- thy.However a large study in patients with min- imal HE did not demonstrate a clinical benefit partly owing to a high learning effect of the testing strategy used.

However the FLINT trial raised several safety issues including i pruritus in about 20 of OCA-treated patients ii dyslipidaemia with increased total- and low- density lipoprotein LDL-cholesterol and mild but significant reductions in high-density lipopro- tein HDL-cholesterol and iii concerns regarding the carcinogenic potential of increased circulating FGF19 since overexpression of FGF19 has been associated with HCC in animal models.A phase III trial evaluating the effect of OCA on mortality and liver-related outcomes including HCC at five years is currently recruiting patients with non- cirrhotic NASH.

A proof-of-concept phase II study with the non-steroidal FXR-agonist PX104 in patients with NAFLD showed the relevance of these com- pounds for the treatment of metabolic liver disease Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG Heidelberg Ger- many.The authors observed that a four-week course of PX-104 improved insulin sensitivity evaluated by clamp like index and decreased serum gamma-glutamyltransferase GGT and ALT in 12 non-diabetic patients with NAFLD without changes in serum lipids and FGF19.
