Relative abundance profiles for archaea at the family level showed the same trend with a higher sequence en- richment observed for bulk soil compared with forest rhizosphere samples such as the acidophilic Ferroplasmaceae Cenarchaeaceae Thermofilaceae Nitrosopumilaceae Picrophilaceae Desulphurococcaceae and Thermoplasmataceae S4 Fig..Hierarchical clustering of forest rhizosphere and bulk soil samplesHierarchical clustering based on relative abundance grouped the forest rhizosphere and bulk soil samples in two distinct clades at the microbial phylum level  and also at the bacterial species level S2 Fig.. For the microbial phylum heatmap  all bacterial and fungal phylum appear overrepresented in forest rhizosphere samples compared to bulk soil but archaea samples showed the opposite trend being highly enriched in bulk soil compared to the rhizosphere.

The increased relative abundance observed for these bacterial species in forest rhizosphere samples suggests that the rhizo- sphere has the potential to select in favor of beneficial bacteria that actively participate in basic metabolic functions such as nitrogen carbon cycling and decomposition S2 Fig.. Several bacterial species commonly found in forest soils that are related to nitrogen andor carbon cycling as well as the genes involved in the respective pathways were identified in our data such as Catenulispora acidiphila Xanthobacter autotrophicus and Rhodopseudomonas palustris S2 Table.Fungal taxonomy analysis between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomesFor fungi the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla were highly enriched p  0.05 in the forest rhizosphere samples when compared to bulk soil a. Interestingly Ascomycota was the most abundant phyla present for forest rhizosphere.

Another species of basidiomycete highly en- riched in forest rhizosphere was the ectomycorrhizal EMC symbiont Laccaria bicolor that promotes plant growth and the biotrophic plant pathogen Ustilago maydis which also has a role in degrading lig- nocellulose S3 Fig..Relative abundances of archaea between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomesFor archaeal phylum relative abundance the trend was surprisingly the opposite of fungi and bacteria with two phyla Thaumarchaeota and Crenarchaeota being significantly more enriched in the bulk soil sam- ples than forest rhizosphere .

rhizosphere or bulk soil samples from the Amazon forest reserve appeared consistently grouped rather than with a different microbiome type indicating distinct microbial community profiles.Functional potential of rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes from the Cunia forest reserveMetagenomic read sequences from rhizosphere and bulk soil mi- crobiomes displaying matches to known proteins from MG-RAST Subsystem 1 database were annotated and relative abundancies of functional categories plotted in a boxplot .

The fact that both metagenomes showed similar taxonomical diversity at the domain level  90 of both metagenomes is composed of bacteria could account for this observed similarity although some difference can be observed in re- gions with a lower overall GC content 30-40.Bacterial taxonomy analysis between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomesA detailed comparison of microbial community structure at the phylum level between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil demonstrated that Proteobacteria Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria were the pre- dominant phyla for both types of sample .

was also observed for the PCoA analysis results  further validating the distinct microbial profiles between rhi- zosphere and bulk soil microbial communities.The phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were found to be highly enriched for the forest rhizosphere when compared to bulk soilwhereas Ascomycota was the predominant phyla for forest rhizosphere in agreement with previous shotgun-sequenced soil microbiome data .

Heatmap displaying microbial relative abundance at phylum level for the forest rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes.Heatmap summarizing microbial relative abundances at the phylum level between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil samples.

Boxplot displaying functional categories for forest rhizosphere and bulk soil me- tagenomes.Subsystems 1 database annotated functional categories for the forest rhizosphere blue and bulk soil red metagenomes is shown in a box plot.

Several bacterial and fungal taxa were highly en- riched in the forest rhizosphere samples compared to bulk soil but the opposite trend was observed for archaea with higher sequence enrich- ment for bulk soil compared to forest rhizosphere samples.

Si- milarly soil bacterial community structure analysis in broadleaf forest biomes  also showed a similar enrichment of Acid- obacteria in forest biomes.A similar distribution was observed between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomes in GC rich regions but not in low GC content regions B.
