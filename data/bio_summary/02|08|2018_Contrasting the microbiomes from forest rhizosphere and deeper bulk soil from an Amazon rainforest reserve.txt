relative abundance profiles for archaea at the family level showed the same trend with a higher sequence en- richment observed for bulk soil compared with forest rhizosphere samples such as the acidophilic ferroplasmaceae cenarchaeaceae thermofilaceae nitrosopumilaceae picrophilaceae desulphurococcaceae and thermoplasmataceae s4 fig..hierarchical clustering of forest rhizosphere and bulk soil sampleshierarchical clustering based on relative abundance grouped the forest rhizosphere and bulk soil samples in two distinct clades at the microbial phylum level  and also at the bacterial species level s2 fig.. for the microbial phylum heatmap  all bacterial and fungal phylum appear overrepresented in forest rhizosphere samples compared to bulk soil but archaea samples showed the opposite trend being highly enriched in bulk soil compared to the rhizosphere.

the increased relative abundance observed for these bacterial species in forest rhizosphere samples suggests that the rhizo- sphere has the potential to select in favor of beneficial bacteria that actively participate in basic metabolic functions such as nitrogen carbon cycling and decomposition s2 fig.. several bacterial species commonly found in forest soils that are related to nitrogen andor carbon cycling as well as the genes involved in the respective pathways were identified in our data such as catenulispora acidiphila xanthobacter autotrophicus and rhodopseudomonas palustris s2 table.fungal taxonomy analysis between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomesfor fungi the ascomycota and basidiomycota phyla were highly enriched p  0.05 in the forest rhizosphere samples when compared to bulk soil a. interestingly ascomycota was the most abundant phyla present for forest rhizosphere.

a si- milar gc distribution was observed between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomes with a higher read percentage showing between 60 and 70 gc content b. the fact that both metagenomes showed similar taxonomical diversity at the domain level  90 of both metagenomes is composed of bacteria could account for this observed similarity although some difference can be observed in re- gions with a lower overall gc content 30-40.bacterial taxonomy analysis between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomesa detailed comparison of microbial community structure at the phylum level between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil demonstrated that proteobacteria actinobacteria and acidobacteria were the pre- dominant phyla for both types of sample .

the ascomycetes eurotiomycetessordariomycetes and dothideomycetes were the predominant classes in forest rhizosphere samples b. amongst the basidiomycota themost over-represented classes were agaricomycetes tremellomycetes and ustilaginomycetes for all samples b. interestingly amongst the species of basidiomycota found significantly enriched in the forest rhi- zosphere samples is the brown-rot fungal decomposer postia placenta commonly found in forest ecosystems s3 fig.. indeed forest rhizo- sphere samples displayed a higher organic matter content than bulk soil samples providing a richer substrate for fungal and bacterial decom- posing agents s1 table.

another species of basidiomycete highly en- riched in forest rhizosphere was the ectomycorrhizal emc symbiont laccaria bicolor that promotes plant growth and the biotrophic plant pathogen ustilago maydis which also has a role in degrading lig- nocellulose s3 fig..relative abundances of archaea between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomesfor archaeal phylum relative abundance the trend was surprisingly the opposite of fungi and bacteria with two phyla thaumarchaeota and crenarchaeota being significantly more enriched in the bulk soil sam- ples than forest rhizosphere .

rhizosphere or bulk soil samples from the amazon forest reserve appeared consistently grouped rather than with a different microbiome type indicating distinct microbial community profiles.functional potential of rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes from the cunia forest reservemetagenomic read sequences from rhizosphere and bulk soil mi- crobiomes displaying matches to known proteins from mg-rast subsystem 1 database were annotated and relative abundancies of functional categories plotted in a boxplot .

si- milarly soil bacterial community structure analysis in broadleaf forest biomes  also showed a similar enrichment of acid- obacteria in forest biomes.a similar distribution was observed between forest rhizosphere and bulk soil metagenomes in gc rich regions but not in low gc content regions b. it has been previously suggested that both environ- ment and phylogeny can shape nucleotide composition in metagenomes  therefore the observed differences seen here cannot be explained by phylogeny alone although it is likely the main driver of nucleotide bias for metagenomes.microorganisms can affect biogeochemical cycling and have an important role in the carbon-nitrogen cycle.

additionally the emc fungi laccaria bicolor found enriched in our amazon forest samples can support a healthy forest ecosystem by providing nutrients to their plant host through a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with host roots .archaea relative abundance data at the phylum and family levelsshowed the opposite trend to fungal and bacterial abundances being more enriched in the bulk soil samples than in forest rhizosphere  and s4 fig.. significantly enriched archaea taxa such as nitrosopumilus which belongs to the thaumarchaeota phyla is an ammonia oxidizing archaea suggesting a potential role on nitrite reductases activity of thesoil.

was also observed for the pcoa analysis results  further validating the distinct microbial profiles between rhi- zosphere and bulk soil microbial communities.the phyla basidiomycota and ascomycota were found to be highly enriched for the forest rhizosphere when compared to bulk soilwhereas ascomycota was the predominant phyla for forest rhizosphere in agreement with previous shotgun-sequenced soil microbiome data .

several bacterial and fungal taxa were highly en- riched in the forest rhizosphere samples compared to bulk soil but the opposite trend was observed for archaea with higher sequence enrich- ment for bulk soil compared to forest rhizosphere samples.

given that all sequenced metagenomes displayed a similar read cov- erage and depth the observed rarefaction curves indicate a lower tax- onomical richness for bulk soil samples in comparison to forest rhizo- sphere which is a hotspot for microbial diversity and a. the fact that each environmental metagenome type might have a dis- tinct gc-signature  prompted a measure of gc content for amazon forest bulk soil and rhizosphere samples.
