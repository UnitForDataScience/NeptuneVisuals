In the CAMA test combining microbial markers or the test combining CAMA with F-Hb a negative test result was given to stool samples negative for both markers and a positive test result given to stool samples with one or both markers positive.

The test might however be sensitive to antibiotic treatment and stool sampling as it is a single test randomly sampled by the patient from a small amount of stool.

nucleatum is enriched in stool of patients with CRC Quantitative PCR was applied to detect F. nucleatum in DNA from stool of study patients.

very recently showed that quantitation of fecal F. nucleatum improved and had a com- plementary value added to the FIT test.45 Therefore combin- ing different microbial markers of high-risk flora with F-Hb tests clinical characteristics and tumor-specific DNA RNA or protein biomarkers in stool may be a putative screening strat- egy in the future to more accurately identify patients in early stages of disease progression.In conclusion we suggest that analyses of markers ofmicrobial alterations in stool may be putative noninvasive diagnostic markers for CRC.

A test combining microbial markers and F-Hb in CRC screening1A positive score was given to stool samples positive for one or both of clbA and F. nucleatum.

This cutoff was used in the F. nuclea- tum assay to identify stool samples as positive with high lev- els of F. nucleatum or negative with low levels of F. nucleatum.

The stool samples originating from individuals diagnosed with CRC were slightly more frequently positiveInt.
