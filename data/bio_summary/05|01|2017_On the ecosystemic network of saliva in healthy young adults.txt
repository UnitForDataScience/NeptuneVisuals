saliva with its ph buffering capacity and antimi- crobial properties may have a key role in the maintenance of the ecological balance it is believed that a prolonged state of imbalance may eventually lead to irreversible changes in the oral ecosystem contributing to the transition of a healthy oral ecosystem toward dysbiosis and disease although this notion is well accepted we have little under- standing on the processes that underlie this transi- tion and to date we are unable to predict individual predisposition toward a dysbiotic or disease- prone state.here we aimed at describing the boundaries of and the heterogeneity within the healthy oral ecosystem and at deciphering the relations between salivary bacterial composition microbiome salivary metabolites metabolome and the host- related biochemical salivary parameters and diet.

the most studied behavioral factors include diet espe- cially high consumption of carbohydrates which has a profound effect on the oral ecosystem and dental decay  and smoking which has been shown to disturb host-correspondence e zaura department of preventive dentistry academic centre for dentistry amsterdam gustav mahlerlaan 3004 1081 la amsterdam the netherlands.e-mail 9these authors contributed equally to this work.received 4 august 2016 revised 16 november 2016 accepted25 november 2016 published online 10 january 2017microbe interplay and result in increased pro- inflammatory responses of the host in addition systemic conditions and use of medications are all linked to changes in the oral environment.despite the open structure of the oral ecosystem the oral microbiota composition is relatively stable over time 013. nevertheless its activity undergoes large variations during the day with 'feast' and 'famine' periods  3 004. carbohydrate intake by the host the 'feast' results in temporary metabolic overflow during which bacterial fermen- tation results in acid formation g 7. during the resting 'famine' period salivary flow clears the acids and contributes to ph recovery .

neither the age nor the clinical variables gingival inflammation amount of plaque caries experience related to the observed heterogeneity--the clusters--of salivary microbiome and metabolome data sets results not shown.besides the microbiome and the metabolome fourteen host-related biochemical parameters rele- vant to oral health were analyzed from the same saliva sample set these included salivary flow rate ph and various salivary enzymes.

although oral diseases have been studied for decades our understanding of oral health the boundaries of a healthy oral ecosystem and ecological shift toward dysbiosis is still limited.

the ffq was completed by 255 individuals of whom 16 6.3 reported a vegetarian lifestyle.heterogeneity in salivary microbiome and metabolome profileswe first assessed the heterogeneity within the salivary microbiome and metabolome data sets.

unlike classical partitioning clustering algorithms spectral clustering is able to produce nonlinear separating hypersurfaces among data since it constructs an adjacency structure from the input data set fi.within the salivary microbiome data set supplementary table s2 three main microbiome sample co-occurrence clusters mic1 n  191 mic2 n  59 mic3 n  17 left panel were identified.

then we applied elastic net regression analysis which is a sample cluster- independent approach that allows prediction ofvariables based on most stable features otus or metabolites in our case in multivariate data sets.heterogeneity of the microbiome and metabolome data sets related to some of the biochemical parameters of saliva the samples in microbiome cluster mic3 had higher salivary chitinase and albumin and lower lysozyme activity than samples in the other mic clusters whereas clusters mic1.2 and mic2 had the lowest salivary ph of all clusters fi.

no signifi- cant relation between self-reported dietary lifestyle habits vegetarians versus the omnivores or indivi- dual food components and microbiome profiles or microbiome clusters was found results not shown.

our microbiome data-driven analysis stratified the salivary microbiome of healthy volunteers into five distinct clusters.
