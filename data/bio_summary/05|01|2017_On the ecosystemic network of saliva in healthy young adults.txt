The PCA and PERMANOVA confirmed the spectral clustering results of both data sets Fi.Next we determined which microbial OTUs and genera contributed to the observed diff- erences among the microbiome sample clustersMicrobiome samples1Metabolome samples01.11.21.323 MIC METChao-1123 4 METMICGenderMicrobiome samples3PERMANOVA2F10.07 P0.000110-1-2-3-3-2-10123PC 1 16 of varianceMetabolome samples6PERMANOVA4F42.65 P0.000120-2-4-20246PC 1 36 of varianceMIC1.1MIC1.2MIC1.3MIC2MIC3MET1MET2MET3MET40.50.40.30.20.10.0Microbiome samples10Metabolome samples50MIC1.1MIC1.2MIC1.3MIC2MIC3MET1MET2MET3MET4Figure 1 Heterogeneity of salivary microbiome left panels and metabolome right panels samples in healthy young adults a spectral clustering co-occurrence plots of the microbiome or metabolome samples ordered along the axes according to the co-occurrence matrix the more similar the sample profiles the closer they are together on the axis.

Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction of the P-values for multiple comparisons was performed in R.The LDA effective size LEfSe biomarker discov- ery tool was used with the 'one against all' strategy for multiclass analysis and logarithmic LDA score threshold of 2 Po0.05.Assessment of significant patterns of microbial co-occurrence or mutual exclusion was performed using CoNet and visualized in Cytoscape v. 3.3.0.High-dimensional feature selection by significance analysis of microarrays analysis  using the TIGR MultiExperiment Viewer 111. tm4.orgmev.html was used to compare scaled- metabolite data among metabolome sample clusters and to assess the differences in host-related clusters and microbiome clusters by metabolites.Elastic Net regression with stability selection M was used to select features OTUs or metabo- lites that were related to the host-related biochem- ical salivary parameters.The relation between the microbiome OTUs and the metabolome data set all 493 metabolites was assessed using Spearman Correlation with Bonferroni-corrected P-values.

The FFQ was completed by 255 individuals of whom 16 6.3 reported a vegetarian lifestyle.Heterogeneity in salivary microbiome and metabolome profilesWe first assessed the heterogeneity within the salivary microbiome and metabolome data sets.

Unlike classical partitioning clustering algorithms spectral clustering is able to produce nonlinear separating hypersurfaces among data since it constructs an adjacency structure from the input data set Fi.Within the salivary microbiome data set Supplementary Table S2 three main microbiome sample co-occurrence clusters MIC1 N  191 MIC2 N  59 MIC3 N  17 left panel were identified.

Strepto- cocci although highly abundant in most of the sample clusters did not form complex networks with other genera.Mutual interrelationships between the microbiome metabolome and host-related parametersRelation between salivary microbiome and metabo- lome.

HOT278 HOT279 whereas other clusters were dominated by OTUs classified as veillonellae and prevotellae.Figure 2 Salivary microbiome co-occurrence analysis results per individual microbiome cluster.

Taxonomic names marked with have been truncated for legibility.Similarly the observed heterogeneity in the micro- biome data set related with specific metabolites Of the 493 metabolites 64 were significantly discriminatory significance analysis of microarrays analysis median FDR 0 delta 0.0033 among the microbiome clusters Supplementary Figure S3 the majority of which were most abundant in the smallest microbiome cluster MIC3 N  17 compared with the other samples.

Neither the age nor the clinical variables gingival inflammation amount of plaque caries experience related to the observed heterogeneity--the clusters--of salivary microbiome and metabolome data sets results not shown.Besides the microbiome and the metabolome fourteen host-related biochemical parameters rele- vant to oral health were analyzed from the same saliva sample set These included salivary flow rate pH and various salivary enzymes.

Then we applied Elastic Net regression analysis which is a sample cluster- independent approach that allows prediction ofvariables based on most stable features OTUs or metabolites in our case in multivariate data sets.Heterogeneity of the microbiome and metabolome data sets related to some of the biochemical parameters of saliva the samples in microbiome cluster MIC3 had higher salivary chitinase and albumin and lower lysozyme activity than samples in the other MIC clusters whereas clusters MIC1.2 and MIC2 had the lowest salivary pH of all clusters Fi.

No signifi- cant relation between self-reported dietary lifestyle habits vegetarians versus the omnivores or indivi- dual food components and microbiome profiles or microbiome clusters was found results not shown.
