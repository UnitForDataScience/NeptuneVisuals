However whether environmental contam- ination has a role in the transmission of HAIs is poorly understood.

hospitalization periods patient numbers or cleaning protocol than the use of chemotherapy may be responsible chemotherapy may lead to altered microbial diversity.

Although the exact reason for the unusually skewed cluster of Enterobacteriaceae remains to be clarified it is likely that unaware harmful behaviors of nurses while treating patient wastes or cleaning sinks shared by patients or visitors result in the spread of bacteria originating from patients or sinks to hospital wards.
