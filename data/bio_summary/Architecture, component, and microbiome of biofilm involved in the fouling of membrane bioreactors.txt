Fluorescent staining of the microbial cells and the subsequent image quantification showed that most 81.6 - 5.4 of the microorganisms were alive but localized specifically in the uppermost parts of the biofilms on the fouled membranes indicating that the massive region of the thick biofilms at the high OLRs was composed of not cells but materials reflected by the light due to the direct microscopy.Main solid-phase components of the fouling-related biofilmsThe fluorescent probes SYTO9 and PI that specifically detected DNAs inside the cell were used but most of the biofilms were not stained especially those found at the high OLRs.

Fluorescent images were obtained from the 31 kPa TMP biofilms under the low OLR conditions a c and 50 kPa TMP biofilms under the high OLR conditions b d. The microscopic observations were performed on at least five different points of the fouled membranes and the representative images are shown for presentationStructure and microbiome of biofilms in MBRs T Inaba et al3previous findings.

In recent years microorganisms in the fouling-related biofilms have been investigated.-However the structural and compositional bases of the biofilms in their naturally occurring states are still unclear.

TMPs of 10 and 31 kPa for the low OLR conditions and those of 10 20 30 44 and 50 kPa for the high OLR conditions that found in the succeeding runs were selected to examine the biofilm structures and microbiomes.Architecture and cell localization of biofilms on the fouled membranesCRM was applied to non-destructively visualize the fouling-related biofilms.

Here staining with component-specific probes such as the concanavalin A ConA-FITC conjugate FM4-64 and FilmTracer SYPRO Ruby was conducted to identify the main solid components of the fouling- related biofilms obtained at 31 and 50 kPa TMP under the low and high OLR conditions respectively.Immunostaining with ConA-FITC which specifically binds to a- Man and a-Glc of polysaccharides showed the upper regions of the biofilms stained intensively at the low OLRs whereas the fluorescent signal was rather weak at the high OLRs Fig.

Although it may be difficult to detect equally all kind of the diverse components of the biofilms and there was the possibility of the false negative results we successfully applied these fluorescent probes to determine the main solid-phase components in the biofilms.

To explore the devel- opmental mechanism of biofilms on filtration membranes that may contribute to the resolution of the most persistent biofouling problem of wastewater treatment and reclamation direct CRM was implemented to non-destructively visualize the fouling- related biofilms followed by high-resolution phylogenetic identi- fication of the biofilm microbiomes using high-throughput Illumina sequencing.

To evaluate and prevent membrane biofouling it is of particular importance to unveil the development mechanism of biofilms on filtration membranes in actual MBR runs.Non-destructive direct observation of biofilm formation anddevelopment has recently become available due to theimprovement of confocal reflection microscopy CRM.

It hasPublished in partnership with Nanyang Technological Universitynpj Biofilms and Microbiomes 20175Structure and microbiome of biofilms in MBRsT Inaba et al6been so far reported that the pseudomonads abundantly existed in the biofilm on filtration membrane in MBRs.P.

The autofluorescnece was not detected from PAN membrane and there was a little FITC-like autofluorescence in the biofilms.
