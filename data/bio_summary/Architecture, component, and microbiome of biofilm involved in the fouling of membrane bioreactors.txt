13 and 15 days at low and high olrs before collecting the fouled membrane samples.chemical analysis proceduresthe mixed liquor suspended solid temperature do and ph in all three compartments of the mbr as well as the tmp of the membrane module were monitored throughout the operation.

these results strongly suggest that the biofilm microbiomes changed along with the extent of membrane fouling under both the low and high olr conditions.high-resolution phylogeny of the biofilm microbiomesa class-level phylogenetic analysis of the illumina sequence data was performed using the qiime software to determine the biofilm microbiome compositions at all tmps under the low and high olr conditions fig.

how- ever membrane filtration is intrinsically linked with the incidence of membrane fouling which induces serious problems such as a decrease in the quality and quantity of the treated wastewater that results in increased operational cost.generally the fouling of mbrs is caused by the deposition and accumulation of inorganic and organic matters including micro-bial cells i.e.

the biocake build-up on the filtration membrane and the subsequent complete clogging of the membrane pores.

the membrane module was operated with a permeate extraction cycle for 9 min and a pause for 1 min to improve the membrane performance by intermittent suction.

total dna was extracted from the stored membrane pieces and activated sludges according to a direct lysis protocol that included bead-beating.three replicates were conducted for the dna extraction and the subsequent protocols to analyze each fouled membrane and activated sludge sample.

the relationship between the biofilm structures and microbiomes is discussed to gain deeper insights into the mechanism underlying the biofouling of the mbr.results and discussionphysicochemical profile during the operation of a laboratory-scale mbrto acclimatize the sludge microbiome the mbrs were indepen- dently operated at low and high olrs for 13 and 15 days respectively before collecting the fouled membrane samples supplementary fig.

these results highlight that the change in the biofilm structures depended on the extent of membrane biofouling even at the same olr.under the high olr conditions the fouled membranes were obtained at five different tmps 10 20 30 44 and 50 kpa.

b d. this result shows that the increase in the biofilm thickness is a significant causative agent of membrane biofouling at high olrs.

fine-scale monitoring of shifts in microbial community composition after high organic loading in a pilot-scale membrane bioreactor.

fluorescent staining of the microbial cells and the subsequent image quantification showed that most 81.6 - 5.4 of the microorganisms were alive but localized specifically in the uppermost parts of the biofilms on the fouled membranes indicating that the massive region of the thick biofilms at the high olrs was composed of not cells but materials reflected by the light due to the direct microscopy.main solid-phase components of the fouling-related biofilmsthe fluorescent probes syto9 and pi that specifically detected dnas inside the cell were used but most of the biofilms were not stained especially those found at the high olrs.

here staining with component-specific probes such as the concanavalin a cona-fitc conjugate fm4-64 and filmtracer sypro ruby was conducted to identify the main solid components of the fouling- related biofilms obtained at 31 and 50 kpa tmp under the low and high olr conditions respectively.immunostaining with cona-fitc which specifically binds to a- man and a-glc of polysaccharides showed the upper regions of the biofilms stained intensively at the low olrs whereas the fluorescent signal was rather weak at the high olrs fig.
