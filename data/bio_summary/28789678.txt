Yet for both the combined and separate workflow reads were uniformly distributed across the reference genomes and we did not observe differences.In order to validate our method we sequenced a mul- tiplexed viral pathogen reagent that was expected to contain 25 viruses across different families genome types and sizes At most we identified 17 different viruses Table We did not detect any reads for eight viruses supposed to be in the reagent all of them single- stranded RNA viruses Coronavirus 229E Norovirus GI and GII Influenzavirus A and B Metapneumovirus Hu- man Parainfluenzavirus 3.

Comparing our results to more similar workflows filtration nuclease treat- ment random amplification NexteraXT MiSeq our numbers of reads were higher than reported and weTable 1 Number of reads reported from sequencing a multiplexed viral pathogen reagentFor subsamples of reads the average number of virus reads and detected target viruses in 10 random samplings is shownidentified more virus species Therefore we think that our method which might still have potential for im- proved sensitivity shows no bias against a certain virus family or genome type e.g.

Considering individual viruses used for spiking for all three viruses significantly more reads were reported for filtered samples both in numbers and in the fraction of total reads passing quality filtering Fig.

Of the 25 viruses expected in the reagent we detected 17 and 15 different viruses in two replicates respectively with high numbers of reads Table Previous studies have sequenced the same viral pathogen reagent We randomly subsampled our raw reads to match the num- bers analyzed in these studies.

After random amplification and sequencing with the separate work- flow we calculated the ratio of the number of reads of the two viruses as the number of total reads in each sample varied and the viruses are amplified differentially.

This is a result of the digestion of human DNA containing a lot of repetitive low entropy sequences and therefore fewer reads to be removed in quality filtering.With nuclease treatment reads of viruses increased significantly while human background reads decreased Fig.

For all further samples we chose pre-processed as standard method.Nuclease treatment significantly enriches for virus reads Next we tested the effect of nuclease treatment which takes advantage of the presence of a stable virus capsid that protects the viral genome from digestion in metage- nomic sequencing of plasma spiked with two RNA viruses poliovirus and influenzavirus A and two DNA viruses adenovirus and HHV-4.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus Bocavirus Enterovirus Table Ratio of virus reads correlates with concentration of viruses in spiked plasmaIn order to confirm that our protocol detects viruses in a reproducible and quantitative manner we sequenced plasma samples spiked with different ratios and concen- trations of an RNA virus poliovirus or influenzavirus and a DNA virus adenovirus.

Nevertheless the correlations showed that the ratio of sequencing reads is preserved over different input ratios and concentrations signifying that the ampli- fication method itself preserves the relative contribution of different viruses in a sample.Finally spiking the same amount of viruses in different samples showed that the protocol presented here could be applied not only for plasma but also for other clinical samples such as urine and swabs.

Briefly reads were quality-filtered by removing low quality bases average PHRED score below 20 reads shorter than 75 bp and reads with low entropy i.e.
