Shotgun metagenomic libraries preparation and sequencing using SOLiD 5500xl platform Life Technology USA was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer using the following reagent kits 5500 SOLiD Fragment Library Core Kit SOLiD Fragment Library Barcoding Kit SOLiD FlowChip Kit SOLiD FWD SR S50 Kit SOLiD Run Cycle Buffer Kit.

We collected 99 stool samples from the patients with alcoholic dependence syndrome n 14 72 and alco- holic liver cirrhosis n 14 27.

The description of the data is listed in .100A.V.

The patients were enrolled in Moscow Clinical Scientific Center Moscow Narcology Dispensary of Republic of Tatarstan Kazan and Saint-Petersburg Bekhterev Psychoneurological Research Institute Saint-Petersburg.

The cohort included 2 groups 72 patients with the diagnosis alcoholic depen- dence syndrome and 27 - with alcoholic liver cirrhosis.Patients inclusion and exclusion criteriaGeneral exclusion criteria non-alcoholic liver diseases decompensated diseases of other organs intake of probiotics andor prebiotics medications non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs anti- biotics and proton pump inhibitors less than 1 month prior to the sample collection abdominal102A.V.
