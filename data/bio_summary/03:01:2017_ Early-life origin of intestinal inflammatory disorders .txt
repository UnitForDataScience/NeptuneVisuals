finally the role of epi- genetic mechanisms in the developmental origin of in- testinal inflammatory disorders is examined.perinatal maturation of the intestinal barrierduring the perinatal period the gastrointestinal tract undergoes significant maturation to cope with the changes in nutritional supply and the high nutritional needs of the young infant and to provide an effective barrier against potentially harmful agents food anti- gens microorganisms and microbial toxins.-the in- testinal barrier is a complex structure comprising 4 components 1 the intestinal microbiota which pro- duces antibacterial agents that prevent pathogen colon- ization stimulates mucus production and plays a critical role in the maturation of the immune system2 the mucus layer which protects the intestinal epi- thelium and contains antimicrobial peptides that pre- vent bacterial invasion 3 the intestinal epithelium and its intercellular junctions which act as a physical barrierbetween the intestinal lumen and the inner milieu and4 the immunological barrier made up of secretory im- munoglobulin a siga antimicrobial peptides secreted by paneth cells and the mucosal immune system .maturation of the intestinal epithelial barrier in humans starts at the end of the first trimester of preg- nancy and continues after birth.although the fetal intestinal epithelium is morphologically similar to the adult epithelium by 22 weeks of gestation its functional maturation continues in the newborn.

disrupted intestinal microbiota diversity dysbiosis or compromised intestinal barrier function is linked to many disease statesincluding chronic inflammatory diseases such as obesity food allergy ibd and celiac disease.inflammatory bowel disease is associated with an increased permeability of the intestinal epithe- lium.although the pathogenesis of ibd is unclear it has been suggested that dysfunction of the intestinal barrier may be the primary defect in genetically suscep- tible individuals resulting in the translocation of com- mensal bacteria and the continuous stimulation of the intestinal immune system.

increasing evidence suggests that the perinatal environment can af- fect the developing gastrointestinal tract including the intestinal microbiota and modify the risk profile for in- testinal inflammatory disorders later in life including ibd and celiac disease.this review first provides an overview of the peri- natal maturation of the intestinal barrier and the role of the intestinal microbiota in shaping intestinal barrier function.

this suggests that the onset of the disease may be preceded by an altered intestinal barrier which leads to the translocation of gluten proteins and a t-cell- mediated chronic immune response.evidence of perinatal programming of intestinal inflammatory disordersinfluence of the perinatal environment on the intestinal microbiotaincreasing evidence suggests that the bacterial coloniza- tion of the gastrointestinal tract may be initiated in utero.

changes in the development and compos- ition of the intestinal microbiota as well as epigenetic changes are emerging as key mechanisms through which the perinatal environment determines susceptibility to intestinal inflammatory disorders.introductionthe perinatal and early childhood periods from con- ception until 2 years of age - the so-called first 1000 days of life - are critical in the development of the fetus and infant and can modify the risk profile for disease later in life.over the last 25 years the developmental origin of chronic noncommunicable diseases referred to as the concept of perinatal programming has emerged as an important aspect of the pathogenesis of these diseases.

epigenetic modifications induced by the early-life environment can affect gene expression in pathways associated with metabolic homeostasis and thus program phenotypic responses to later environ- mental challenges such as a high-fat diet.the gastrointestinal tract undergoes significant maturation during the perinatal period which leads to the establishment of the intestinal barrier and immune homeostasis.-dysfunction of the intestinal barrier is implicated as a critical component of chronic inflam- matory disorders including inflammatory bowel dis- ease ibd and celiac disease.inflammatory bowel diseases which include crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are incurable disorders that affect mainly young adults and are characterized by chronic inflammationaffiliation d. ley j.-l. desseyn d. turck and f. gottrand are with the lille inflammation research international center liric - umr 995 inserm university lille chu lille lille france.

dysfunction of the intestinal barrier and inappropriate immune response to the intestinal microbiota seem to be implicated in genetically susceptible individuals.

the closure of the leaky fetal intestinal epithelium to the external en- vironment occurs during the first week after birth in humans with the maturation of the intercellular junc- tions and thus prevents the passage of macromolecules such as food antigens and microorganisms and their toxins.goblet cells are present by 10 weeks of ges- tation and the mucin muc2 the main gelling mucin in the intestinal mucus layer is detected in the small in- testine and the colon by 12 weeks of gestation.all of the components of the immunological barrier are pre- sent before birth.

the bacterial colon- ization of the gastrointestinal tract and the exposure to food antigens contribute to the shaping of the immune system and the acquisition of immune tolerance to commensal bacteria and dietary antigens from birth through infancy and childhood.role of the microbiota in the maturation and maintenance of the intestinal barrierthe intestinal microbiota and the host coexist in a mu- tually beneficial relationship.

in turn the intestinal microbiota is critical in the maturation of the intestinal barrier.

moreover the intestinal microbiota modulates the th1 th2 balance by determining the development of effector t cells thus impacting the direction of immune responses.the microbiota is also critical for the maintenance of a functional intestinal barrier.

nondigestible carbohydrates from solid foods such as fruits vegetables and cereals introduce new substrates for colonic fermentation and induce profound changes in the intestinal microbiota compos- ition.amarri et al.showed stable counts of fecal bifi- dobacteria but increases in enterobacteria and enterococci 5 months after the introduction of complementary feeding to 4-month-old breastfed infants.dietary intervention such as the administration ofprebiotics or live microorganisms probiotics can modu- late the composition of the intestinal microbiota in in- fants.

further well-conducted randomized controlled trials are required to determine the health benefits of probiotics and to define the optimal dose and duration of intake.preterm birth is associated with a reduced micro- bial diversity and a higher proportion of clostridium difficile probably because of delayed enteral feeding use of sterile formula the ecology of the neonatal inten- sive care unit and frequent antibiotic administra- tion.however the high carriage rate of clostridium difficile in preterm neonates is not associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea or necrotizing enterocolitis because of the absence of the surface-binding site for clostridium difficile enterotoxin in the immature intestine.antibiotic use in early life seems to be intimately linked to reduced microbiota diversity and delayed col- onization by bifidobacteria depending on the antibi- otic's spectrum the dosage and the length of antibiotic treatment.in a cohort of 1032 infants antibiotic ex- posure mainly amoxicillin during the first month after birth was associated with decreased numbers of bifido- bacteria and bacteroides.even if the dysbiosis induced by antibiotic use appears to be transient this modifica- tion occurring during the key period of maturation of the intestinal barrier and immune system may have long-term effects on the intestinal immune homeostasis.

maternal intake of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids during gestation and lactation modulated the severity of experimental colitis in young adults rats.early-life stress induced by maternal deprivation increased colitis susceptibility in adult wild-type rats and exacerbated colitis in il-10-- mice.however further studies are requiredto understand better the influence of the perinatal environment on the susceptibility to intestinal inflam- matory disorders and to identify the mechanisms involved.epigenetics possible link between early life and intestinal inflammatory disordersepigenetics is defined as heritable changes in gene ex- pression that are not due to changes in the dna se- quence.
