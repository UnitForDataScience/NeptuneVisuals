the occurrence of fluoroquinolone- resistant campylobacter strains in southern asia especially southeast asia and the very high rates of illness expected for travel to india are likely to influence recommendations for travel to these areas.future research needed to develop evidence- based recommendationssix areas of research needed to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of antibiotics in travel medicinein the  six areas of future research are identified that should be studied scientifically to help travel medicine special- ists fully evaluate the costs and benefits of antimicrobial therapy when diarrhoea occurs during international travel.relative importance of various antibiotics and dosage in inducing acquisition of mdr enterobacteriaceae during travel to high-risk areasalthough a large number of scientific publications have shown the relationship between travel to high risk area and receipt of antibiotics for diarrhoea and subsequent fecal shedding of mdr coliforms surprisingly little information has been published on the relative importance of the specific antibiotic used to treat cases of travellers' diarrhoea.

essentially all studies indicate that diarrhoeal illness is important in the pathogenesis of post-infectious functional bowel disorders particularly that caused by inflammatory bacterial pathogens which cause low-grade intestinal inflammation that persists in patients with later chronic functional complaints.duration of diarrhea was defined as a risk factor for later develop- ment of post-infectious ibs in non-travelers with infection due to campylobacter and shiga toxin-producing e. coli.prevention of diarrhoeal illness during travel is likely to be effective in pre- venting later functional bowel disease.is limiting of use of antibiotics to certain syndromes feasibleit is logical to recommend that antibiotics only be used in the more severe cases or those with critical itineraries but is it prac- tical to expect travellers to identify treatable illness and when to withhold treatment the practicality of such recommendations should be testable.development of non-antibiotic approaches to treatment and prevention of travellers' diarrhoeabismuth subsalicylate has been evaluated as a treatment of trav- ellers' diarrhoeaand as a prophylactic agent for travellers to a high-risk country.-the active ingredient for therapy of infectious diarrhoea appears to be the salicylate which provides antisecretory effects in the gut mucosawhile the diarrhoea prevention properties appears to relate to the bismuth moiety with its antimicrobial effects.more research is needed with non-antibiotic compounds in travel medicine including bss.the human genome study has opened up the horizon on gut microbiomeand shown the association of microbiota diversity with intestinal health.during international travel and with acute diarrhoea while traveling the gut microbiota of the travel- ler undergoes profound alterationsreceipt of antibiotics can have long-term effects on the gut microbiotathat may have ef- fects on immune and metabolic functioning in the gut and in the body.better understanding the microbiome of the gut during travel will likely lead to the development of a new class of probi- otics that can normalize the gut physiology during and after travel or receipt of antibiotics.a healthy diverse intestinal flora is less likely to encourage development of or persistence of antibiotic-resistant flora carriage.concluding thoughts and summarythe growing problem of antibiotic resistance on a worldwide basis constitutes a serious public health problem.

ruppe et al.found that mdr acquisition occurred in 142196 72 travellers to asia 93195 48 for travel to sub-saharanafrica and 57183 31 for travel to latin america.

another study provided evidence that travel to asia was associated with higher risk of mdr acquisitionwith the highest rate of resis- tance acquisition occurring during travel to the indian subconti- nent.

risk factors for acquisition of mdr coliforms in international travel include development of diarrhoea antibi- otic treatment destination of trip length of time in country and type of travel where those visiting friends and relatives showed high levels.although not all studies show that antimicro- bial therapy lead to mdr microbiota acquisition most do deficiencies in most of these published studies include failure to specify the antibiotics used or to indicate how long antibiotic treatment was continued.the duration of excretion of mdr coliforms is shorter than that seen in the u.s. for hospitalized patients receiving multiple antibiotics.

these people should travel to areas with the highest risk only if their conditions are stable and when travel to these re- gions cannot be avoided be armed with therapeutic and possibly preventive medication.

one study demonstrated that 24 of 100 participants with negative pre- travel samples were found to be colonized by esbl-escherichia coli after international travel.

in one study 16 of 21 76 of travellers harboring esbl-producing e. coli on returning home were no longer colo- nized 6 months later.a second study looking at persistence of carriage of mdr e. coli demonstrated that 90 of the colo- nized travellers were negative for carriage of multi-resistant strain after 6 monthsand a third study carried out at six in- ternational travel medicine centres in paris demonstrated that acquisition of mdr enterobacteriaceae occurring during travel disappeared by 3 months after returning home in 95 of newly colonized travellers.usually carriage of mdr coliforms has no negative conse- quences for the bearers.

but very rarely probably  1 tran- sient carriage of mdr coliforms can lead to difficult-to-treat infections in travellers returning homeand can spread from a traveller to a family memberparticularly if they are receiv- ing antibiotics that encourage growth of resistant bacterial forms.general comments on the use of antibiotics in travel medicineinformation being accumulated on antibiotic resistance acquisi- tion of colonic microbiota during international travel and effects of self-treatment may lead to modifications of therapeutic rec- ommendations.
