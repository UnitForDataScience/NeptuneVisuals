Increasing impact of gut dysbiosis is recognized with the progression of liver injury from mild fatty liver disease to advanced liver cirrhosis 1 where the enterohepatic circulation is considered to strengthen a relation between gut microbiome and the liver.

They confirmed that that additional administration of anti-IL-17 suppressed the tumor growth more strongly compared with probiotics and speculate that the probiotics may require IL-17 modulation for tumor suppression 10.It has been reported that segmented filamentous bacteria SFB is the major inducers of intestinal Th17 cells where adhesion of these microbes to intestinal epithelial cells is a critical cue for Th17 accumulation 12.

The effects of SCFAs and Treg on the liver and liver tumor are also interesting.

TheHepatoBiliary Surgery and Nutrition Vol 6 No 6 December 2017427authors next found that the proportion of Th17 cells in total CD4 cells was decreased in the small intestine and peripheral blood but not in the spleen liver and mesenteric lymph node.

Decreased Th17 cells in the small intestine and peripheral blood suggested the decreased mobilization of Th17 cells to the tumor site.

The authors explained that the suppression of Th17 cells might be attributable to the down-regulation of TGF-b and RORgt both of which are important for the differentiation of Th17 10.

8 reported that the administration of probiotics VSL3 a probiotic combination of eight strains of Lactobacilli Bifidobacteria and Streptococcus decreased tumor growth and multiplicity in the liver and markedly improved the enteric dysbiosis intestinal inflammation and endotoxemia in rats given diethylnitrosamine DEN.

These studies have suggested that the probiotics suppresses development and growth of HCC by protecting endotoxin-mediated liver inflammation fibrosis and carcinogenesis.HepatoBiliary Surgery and Nutrition Vol 6 No 6 December 2017425Table 1 Comparisons of three experimental studies investigating the effects of probiotics on hepatocellular carcinomaDEN diethylnitrosamine.426Fukui.

Decreased levels of pro-angiogenic IL-17 suppressed Th17 cells and the down-regulation of angiogenic growth factors and receptors FLT-1 ANG2 KDR VEGFA and TE were noted together with the decreased vascular area in the subcutaneous hepatocellular carcinoma.

Prohep suppressed the growth of SFB the major inducers of intestinal Th17 cells.
