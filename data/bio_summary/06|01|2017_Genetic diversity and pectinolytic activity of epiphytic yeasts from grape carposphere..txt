All isolated yeasts were deposited in the culture collection of the Department of General Biology of Londrina State University.Characterization of genetic diversity of isolated yeastsMorphological characterizationColonies of isolated yeasts were grown on PDA medium for 72 h at 28degC and grouped according to the shape size elevation color consistency and aspect of the margin of the colonies.

The population of yeasts related with grape carposphere depends on grape variety its maturation level and grapevine geographical location Sabate et al.

The digestion product was applied in electrophorese gel with 2 agarose wv using the molecular mass marker of 1 kb plus DNA ladder Invitrogen with ethidium bromide Sambrook and Russell 2006.DNA amplification by rep-PCRThe primers described by Versalovic et al.

The PCR product 15 uL was submitted to electrophorese on 1.5 agarose gel wv with molecular mass marker of 1 kb plus DNA ladder Invitrogen with ethidium bromide Sambrook and Russell 2006.Dendrogram graphGenetic diversity of yeasts from grape carposphere5Based on band profiles obtained from rep-PCR and PCR-RFLP amplifications of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA isolates were grouped by DendroUPGMA program http genomes.urv.catUPGMA Garcia-Vallve et al.

The reproducibility of these methodologies is questionable as a result depends on the physiological state of the cell at that moment Barata et al.

The isolated yeasts were purified until obtaining a pure culture confirmed by visualization under an optical microscope and cryopreserved at -80degC in culture medium containing Czapek-Dox broth CBD and glycerol 11.

Assays were done in triplicate and reported as arithmetic average and standard deviation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCharacterization of genetic diversity of isolated yeastsMorphological characterization of isolated yeastsIsolated yeasts 90 were morphologically characterized as Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces genera.

Number of isolated yeasts and morphotypes colony color collected from grape carposphere in different regions of Parana PR and Rio Grande do Sul RS States in Brazil.Genetic diversity of yeasts from grape carposphere7Phenotypical characters and the number of yeasts can be affected by cultivation conditions cultivar harvesting period climatic conditions geographic location stage of fruit ripening the presence of physical damages and the utilization of agricultural pesticides in grapes Mortimer and Polsinelli 1999 this can partly explain the greater morphological variability observed in the isolated yeasts.

Among V. labrusca Bordeaux cultivar has stood out for its capacity to adapt to Brazilian climatic conditions high productivity and tolerance to fungal diseases Rizzon et al.

Yeast is the responsible agent for the transformation of must sugar into alcohol during the fermentation process to produce wine producing and releasing pectinases that with b-glucanases and hemicellulases help the extraction clearing and stabilization of wine resulting in improvement in its quality and stability Bhat 2000 Takayanagi et al.
