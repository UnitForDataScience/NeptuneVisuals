L. reuteri induces DP IELsA Relative abundance of L. reuteri operational taxonomic unit ID 411486 as determined by sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA genes present in the ileal microbiota of 8-week- old JAX mice and CR mice n  4 and 4 week-neomycin treated Neo or untreated Ctrl CR mice n5 mice per treatment group.

Because the great diversity of polyclonal T cells complicates analysis at the individual TCR level we analized the TCR a repertoires of DP IELs CD4 IELs CD8 IELs and MLNnaive CD4 T cells from mice that express a fixed transgenic TCR b chain TCli mice 1617.

Finally DP IELs were significantly reduced in Ahrflfl x Rorc-Cre mice which lack AhR in T cells and ILCs as well as inAhrflfl x Cd4-Cre mice which lack AhR in T cells in comparison to littermate controlsFig.

Several bacterial taxa shape the differentiation of naive T cells segmented filamentous bacteria SFB bias CD4 T cells towards a Th17 fate 4 Clostridia clusters IV and XIVa promote CD4 T regulatory cells Treg differentiation 5 6 and Bacteroides fragilis 7 8 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 9 induce CD4 T cells that secrete IL-10.

The lack of DP IELs in germ-free GF mice 11 13 indicates that the intestinal microbiota is required for their differentiation although the bacterial taxa and metabolites required are not known.We noticed that mice born at one of our vivaria specialized research facility SRF harbored substantial numbers of DP IELs DP whereas DP IELs were negligible or absent DP- in mice from another vivarium Clinical Sciences Research Building CSRB Fig.1A.

L. reuteri was present in the ileum of CR control mice and CR mice treated with neomycin or metronidazole but absent in CR mice treated with ampicillin plus vancomycin fig.

F Total number of DP IELs in germ-free mice colonized with JAX mice ileal microbiota JAX mice ileal microbiota combined with L. reuteri W L. reuteri WU alone or CR ileal microbiota.

This species induced DP IELs in germ-free mice and conventionally-raised mice lacking these cells.

In contrast AhR-- T cells did not differentiate into CD8aaCD4 T cells whether or not DCs lacked AhR implying that AhR is required in T cells Fig.

Moreover DP IELs in SRF mice expressed low levels of the transcription factor Thpok Thpoklo whereas CSRB mice lacked CD4 Thpoklo IELs 13 consistent with the observed lack of DP IELs fig.
