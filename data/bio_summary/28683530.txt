The quality quantity and integrity of the RNA extracts were assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using an RNA 6000 Pico and small RNA kit both from Agilent Technologies USA according to the manufacturer's protocols.Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR to Detect miRNAsRT-qPCR was performed using a miScript System Qiagenaccording to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications.

In the present study curd with a high RNA content wasfborrin1edd aayndtothdernyritpheenecudrfdosr 1a2ndaayts 8a-nd102C2 days at 15oCderived RNA 23.Bioanalyzer electropherograms were used to determine the RNA distribution patterns for small RNAs where the apparent cellular ratio of 28S rRNA to 18S rRNA was approximately 21 Fig.

Fungal ribosomal RNA was not detected in 12d-S and 22d-S which were ripened with P. candidum possibly because the RNA purification kit employed in the present study was not specific for fungal RNA purification.Immune-Related miRNAs in Samples Collected during the Cheese-Making ProcessTo evaluate changes in miRNAs during the cheese- making and ripening processes we quantified the amounts of immune-related miRNAs in raw milk LTLT milk whey fresh curd and the inner center and surface fractions of the 12- and 22-day aged cheese.

Comparison of total RNA yield from milk and cheese samples.Total RNA isolated and yield of miRNAs were evaluated using the NanoQ spectrophotometer and RNA pico Kit with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.

The sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units based on 97 similarity and the sequence number was normalized by subsampling randomly for the downstream analyses of alpha-diversity phylogenetic information Chao 1 Shannon and Simpson and beta-diversity principal coordinates analysis.Total RNA ExtractionTo extract total RNA 0.2 ml of fluid samples or 200 mg of curd and cheese samples was mixed with 0.8 ml 4x of the sample of Qiazol and thoroughly homogenized by pipetting 20 times or bead beating for 90 sec and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature.

Total RNA yield and RNA distribution of each sample during the manufacturing and ripening of Camembert cheese.A Simple flow diagram representing the process employed to determine microbial diversity and to evaluate miRNAs.

Cellular RNA and whey after heating were used to compare RNA distributions in samples collected during manufacturing of the soft cheese.MicroRNAs and Microbiota in Soft Cheese1571milk LTLT milk whey fresh curd and the inner center and surface fractions when P. candidum appeared on the 12- and 22-day aged cheese.

Our study showed that fresh curd produced during cheese- making contained 4.5 times more total RNA than raw whole milk and that the cheese was rich in RNA throughout ripening.

Our results indicated that the RNA contents per 200 mg200 ul of the sample increased significantly during cheese-making and ripening.

The inner cheese fractions had higher RNA contents than the surfaces after 12 and 22 days of ripening in a time- dependent manner 21.9 and 13.2 times higher in the inner and surface fractions than raw milk respectively.
