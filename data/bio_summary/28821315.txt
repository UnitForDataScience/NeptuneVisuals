However change between groups with treatment for several parameters including abdominal pain and bloating showed trends toward differences between groups .Bowel habitAt baseline visit 1 both 9- and 12-g SM treatment groups had a lower percentage of those with normal consistency type 3 or 4 than psyllium with 33.8 and 24.2 with normal stool consistency at baseline respectively vs 62.2 in the psylliumgroup P  .012 .

At the end of the 3-month supplementation period the percentages of participants who reported normal stool consistency were similar in all 3 groups the percentages with normal stool consistency were 56.7 48.0 and 45.7 for psyllium SM 9 g and SM 12 g respectively.Mean bowel movement frequency increased with psyllium intake P  .0003 from baseline to treatment end 9.8 - 0.1 bowel movements per week vs 14.0 - 0.2 bowel movements per week.

In addition the SF-12 scores approximated the SF-12 mean scores of the general US population score of 50 for all parameters and all treatment groups.Gut microbial community structureNo significant effect on alpha diversity was observed between the different treatment groups for example the average group Shannon index ranged from 2.20 to 2.64 between the 6 groups 3 treatment groups by 2 visits 2 and 3 .

Although it is possible that SM is more effective at normal- izing stool consistency compared with psyllium as seen in the current study a larger sample will be needed to determine if SM is truly more effective than psyllium at improving stool consistency or if baseline differences in stool consistency contributed to the differing responses to the different fibers.

However our clinical study did not fully support our prediction becausealthough there was a trend for potential benefit of SM fiber the differences between SM fiber and psyllium were not marked.Previous research supports improved stool consistency and increased stool frequency with psyllium intake in individuals with constipation .

Of the 43 that completed the treatment period 13 were in the 12-g psyllium group 15 in the 9-g SM group and 15 in the 12-g SM group 38.1 25.0 and 31.8 attrition in each group respectively although the highest attrition occurred in the psyllium group no significant differences in attrition existed between groups.

Stool frequency significantly improved P  .0003 in all groups after 3 months but stool consistency improved only in both SM groups compared with psyllium.

The number of bowel movements per week in the 9- and 12-g SM groups also increased from 9.8 - 0.1 to 11.9 -0.2 and from 9.8 - 0.2 to 12.6 - 0.2 bowel movements respectively this increase was not significantly different than the increase in the psyllium group over time.When self-reporting improvement in bowel habit partic- ipants in all 3 groups experienced a minimally better 4 of 5 or significantly better 5 of 5 change in all 6 parameters of bowel habit after supplementation with no significant differences between groups for each of the 6 parameters .Quality of lifeBaseline SF-12 scores assessed functional health 5 five parameters for both physical and mental health.

Currently limited data exist for the benefit of psyllium on quality of life in constipated individuals a recent review in those with irritable bowel syndrome concluded that psyllium did not increase quality of life .Based on our prior in vitro work that indicates that SM positively alter microbiota composition in the stool and increase production of butyrate through the entire colon  we hypothesized that SM fiber intake would lead to significantchange in microbiota composition and increased SCFA produc- tion.

The microbial community was assessed for stool samples obtain- ed at visit 2 before treatment and visit 3 after completion of treatment.
