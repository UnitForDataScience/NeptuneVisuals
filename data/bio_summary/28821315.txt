however change between groups with treatment for several parameters including abdominal pain and bloating showed trends toward differences between groups .bowel habitat baseline visit 1 both 9- and 12-g sm treatment groups had a lower percentage of those with normal consistency type 3 or 4 than psyllium with 33.8 and 24.2 with normal stool consistency at baseline respectively vs 62.2 in the psylliumgroup p  .012 .

at the end of the 3-month supplementation period the percentages of participants who reported normal stool consistency were similar in all 3 groups the percentages with normal stool consistency were 56.7 48.0 and 45.7 for psyllium sm 9 g and sm 12 g respectively.mean bowel movement frequency increased with psyllium intake p  .0003 from baseline to treatment end 9.8 - 0.1 bowel movements per week vs 14.0 - 0.2 bowel movements per week.

although it is possible that sm is more effective at normal- izing stool consistency compared with psyllium as seen in the current study a larger sample will be needed to determine if sm is truly more effective than psyllium at improving stool consistency or if baseline differences in stool consistency contributed to the differing responses to the different fibers.

in addition the sf-12 scores approximated the sf-12 mean scores of the general us population score of 50 for all parameters and all treatment groups.gut microbial community structureno significant effect on alpha diversity was observed between the different treatment groups for example the average group shannon index ranged from 2.20 to 2.64 between the 6 groups 3 treatment groups by 2 visits 2 and 3 .

however our clinical study did not fully support our prediction becausealthough there was a trend for potential benefit of sm fiber the differences between sm fiber and psyllium were not marked.previous research supports improved stool consistency and increased stool frequency with psyllium intake in individuals with constipation .

stool frequency significantly improved p  .0003 in all groups after 3 months but stool consistency improved only in both sm groups compared with psyllium.

as the low- fiber background diet in this study is similar to the general population  the impact of the fiber supplements in this study may be generalizable to the population with unsatis- factory bowel habits.our primary limitation was that our study was underpow- ered to see differences in our outcomes between treatment groups.

of the 43 that completed the treatment period 13 were in the 12-g psyllium group 15 in the 9-g sm group and 15 in the 12-g sm group 38.1 25.0 and 31.8 attrition in each group respectively although the highest attrition occurred in the psyllium group no significant differences in attrition existed between groups.

a dose of 9 g and 12 g of sm was selected based on our pilot study in 10 participants with constipation indicating that after 1 month of supplementation a 9-g dose improved bowel habit improvement in stool consistency from 2 to 4 on the bristol stool scale  range of 6 to 10 on a visual analog scale ranging from -10 worsening of bowel movements to 10 improvement of bowel movements with 0 indicating no change and increased stool butyrate concentration p  .01  without adverse effects.

data were analyzed with sas software version 9.1 sas institute cary nc usa dietary intake data were entered using food processor version 10.9 esha research salem or usa.the power for this study was based on a kh2 test statistic to compare the proportion of participants with adverse effects between the psyllium control arm and the 2 treatment groups.

as individual species within the prevotella genus were not identified it is possible that changes in prevotella after sm intake could be originating from increases in beneficial strains.although total scfa was not significantly different withsupplementation in any group in the current study the percentage of individuals with increased scfa with treatment was greater in both sm groups compared with psyllium.

no differences in baseline characteristics existed between groups or between those that were randomized to treatment n  63 and those that completed the study n  43. allanalyses were performed with those completing the treat- ment period returned for visit 3 n  43.dietary intake and supplement compliancedietary intake n  42 was assessed through 7-day food records before and after the treatment period to ensure that any changes seen in bowel habit and gut milieu were due tothe fiber supplementation and not changes in dietary intake.

the number of bowel movements per week in the 9- and 12-g sm groups also increased from 9.8 - 0.1 to 11.9 -0.2 and from 9.8 - 0.2 to 12.6 - 0.2 bowel movements respectively this increase was not significantly different than the increase in the psyllium group over time.when self-reporting improvement in bowel habit partic- ipants in all 3 groups experienced a minimally better 4 of 5 or significantly better 5 of 5 change in all 6 parameters of bowel habit after supplementation with no significant differences between groups for each of the 6 parameters .quality of lifebaseline sf-12 scores assessed functional health 5 five parameters for both physical and mental health.

based on prior experience the proportion of participants in the psyllium group with adverse effects was expected to be approximately 80 and we hypothesized that the sm supple- ment would reduce the adverse effects by half nearly 40. thus we would have 90 power to detect this difference in proportions between the control and treatment arms with an error rate of 5. if the differences in proportions were smaller say sm reduced adverse effects by 60 of that in psyllium then the power drops to 75.alpha-diversity within-sample and beta-diversity between- sample metrics were calculated within the software package primer6 primer-e ltd plymouth uk.
