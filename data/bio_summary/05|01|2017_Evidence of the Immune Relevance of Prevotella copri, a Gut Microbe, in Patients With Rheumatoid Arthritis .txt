Although RA shared epitope alleles have been reported to correlate inversely with P copri overexpansion in the gut 8 our study showed no significant correlations between these T cell epitopes and shared epitope alleles which is consistent with the fact that these epi- topes are promiscuous HLA-DR binders.While PBMCs were available only from patients with new-onset RA we were able to test for antibodyresponses to P copri in both new-onset RA and chronic RA patients.

Although overexpansion of P copri was previously detected only in the stool of new-onset RA patients 8 we found similar frequencies of P copri antibody responses and similar clinical associations in new-onset RA and chronic RA patients suggesting that once initiated these antibody responses may persist for years.

Second only 37 of the RA patients with IgG P copri antibody responses had ACPAs compared with 74 of those who had IgA P copri antibodies P 5 0.01 and 71 who lacked P copri anti- bodies P 5 0.003.

Third there was little overlap between patients with P gingivalis antibodies and those with P copri antibodies.P copri antibody responses were found primarilyin women both in those with new-onset RA and in those with chronic RA.

Altogether 15 of 127 RA patients had P copri IgG or IgA antibody responses.When the antibody responses to whole P copri or recombinant Pc-p27 were combined 41 of the 127 RA patients 32 had IgG or IgA antibody reactivity with the organism.

A key hypothesis is that spe- cific organisms in the mouth or microbiota in the gut the composition of which is strongly influenced by environ- mental cues may shape mucosal and systemic immune responses that affect joints in RA patients 4-7.Using high-throughput sequencing Scher et al8 showed that Prevotella copri in the gut microbiota was overexpanded in stool samples from patients with new-onset RA compared with patients with chronic RA patients with psoriatic arthritis or healthy individuals.

Only significant P values are shown.samples were also tested for reactivity with whole P gingivalis an oral periodontal pathogen implicated in RA 25 and with 2 common gut commensal organisms Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli.Similar to previous studies 2627 IgG antibody responses to P gingivalis were found in 25 of our new- onset RA and chronic RA patients and these responses tended to be higher in RA patients than in the other com- parison groups Figure 3A.

Thus P copri anti- bodies were found primarily in women and ACPAs were less common in patients with IgG P copri antibodies whereas neither of these factors correlated with P gingivalis antibody responses again indicating that these microbes induce distinct responses.Correlation of P copri antibodies with serum cytokine and chemokine levels.

In con- trast P copri DNA was not detected in SF samples from the remaining 13 patients 2 with IgA P copri antibodies and 11 without P copri antibodies.

When her PBMCs were stimulated with this P copri peptide in an IFNg ELISpot assay her T cells secreted levels of IFNg that were .3 times the background levels insert in Figure 1A attesting to the immunogenicity of the peptide.T cell reactivity with P copri peptides in patientswith new-onset RA.
