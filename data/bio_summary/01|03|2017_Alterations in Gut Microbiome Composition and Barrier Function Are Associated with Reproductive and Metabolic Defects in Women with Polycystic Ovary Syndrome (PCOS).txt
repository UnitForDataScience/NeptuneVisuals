PCOS patients were significantly younger than controls p  0.003 with median ages of 27 and 32 respectively.When classifying PCOS patients based on the four possible phenotypes under the Rotter- dam Criteria the majority 42 of patients displayed the phenotype D OAPCOM whilePCOS diagnostic criteria and phenotypes.

unclassified the lowest classified taxonomic level is shown FDR Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction.BacteroidetesTenericutes.doi10.1371journal.pone.0168390.t003differences were observed between PCOS patients and controls in bacterial taxa with a relative abundance 1 or in the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio.When comparing rare taxa relative abundance 1 bacteria from the phylum Teneri- cutes showed a significantly lower relative abundance in PCOS patients p0.0001 .

Stool calprotectin a marker for intestinal inflammation was unchanged between patients and controls.In the assessment of systemic inflammatory status PCOS patients had significantly higher blood leukocytes and lymphocytes than controls p  0.042 and 0.001 respectively .

We conclude that although the PCOS patients in our study had a relatively mild metabolic phenotype with only slightly higher indi- ces of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia than the control group and no significant difference in BMI these disturbances may nevertheless be reflected in the gut microbiome of these patients.

If some of the taxa which were reduced in our PCOS patients are heritable as was suggested recently for ML615J-28 and Tenericutes they may regulate hor- monal and metabolic development in the small or proximal large intestine in early life up to puberty and decline in abundance thereafter .We found significant or borderline significant increases in several parameters of intestinal barrier dysfunction and inflammation in PCOS patients.

Weaknesses of the study include the small sample size which precluded stratification of PCOS patients based on diagnostic criteria or metabolic parameters the high prevalence of PCOS patients with a mild phenotype and the assessment of gut barrier function using surrogate parameters rather than an in vivo lactulose-mannitol test.

In this pilot study we compared the stool microbiome gut permeability and inflammatory status of women with PCOS and healthy controls.Methods16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples from 24 PCOS patients and 19 healthy controls.

Gut barrier integrity endo- toxemia and inflammatory status were evaluated using serum and stool markers and asso- ciations with reproductive metabolic and anthropometric parameters were investigated.ResultsThe stool microbiome of PCOS patients showed a lower diversity and an altered phyloge- netic composition compared to controls.

Additionally PCOS patients display a heightened inflammatory state with increased circulating C-reactive protein .
