in this review we describe the role of tgf-b in intestinal immunity focusing on immune cells epithelium and intestinal microbes.

reported that the active tgf-b level was higher in strictured intestinal muscle obtained from surgi- cally resected ilea of cd patients than in adjacent normal intestinal tissue .

a previous study reported that in healthy individuals phosphorylation of smad3 in intestinal t-cells was upregulated compared to that in peripheral t-cells indicating a role for tgf-b signaling in intestinal immune homeostasis .

several experimental models of ibd facilitate evaluation of the role of the intestinal immune system and have identified key regulators and pathways of ibd pathogenesis.some mouse strains with inactivation or disruption of tgf-b signaling are susceptible to intestinal inflammation and are used to study the pathogenesis of ibd.

in addition we discuss the roles of tgf-b and the intestinal microbiota in intestinal immunity.immune cellst-cellstgf-b regulates multiple immune processes of t-cells.

intestinal dcs produce tgf-b and il-10 which are major suppressors of intestinal immunity .

upon infection by toxoplasma gondii tgf-b produced by iels interacted with the lamina propria cd4 t-cells and reduced intestinal inflammation by downregulating ifn-c production .epithelium and extracellular matrixprevious studies have unraveled the roles of tgf-b in intestinal epithelial homeostasis associated with mucosal integrity wound healing and consequent fibrosis.

a previous in vitro study using an intestinal monolayer cell line reported that tgf-b enhanced intestinal epithelial barrier function by inducing production of the tight junction protein claudin-1 and by preventing the pathogenic bacteria-induced reduc- tion of levels of the tight-junction proteins claudin-2 occludin and zo-1 .as wound healing progresses in injured tissues the provisional extracellular matrix is replaced by a newly formed matrix which is rich in collagen synthesized by fibroblasts migrating into the wound .

in cd patients chronic transmural intestinal inflammation can result in intestinal fibrosis and fistula which require sur- gical resection .

moreover pirfenidone an anti-fibrogenic drug used for the treatment of fibrotic diseases suppressed intestinal fibrosis in a dss- induced colitis model by inhibiting tgf-b signaling  .microbiotathe intestinal lumen harbors trillions of microbes of diverse taxa including both commensal and harmful bac- teria this microbial ecosystem is termed the microbiota.

importantly these two bacteroides species did not induce colitis in hosts with intact tgf-b signaling suggesting that tgf-b signaling suppresses the proinflammatory effects of com- mensal bacteria.784j gastroenterol 2017 52777-787enterobacteriaceaethe commensal gram-negative enterobacteriaceae com- prise a minor proportion of the intestinal microbiota however overgrowth of enterobacteriaceae occurs in most colitis models and ibd patients and may be associated with the promotion of intestinal inflammation   .
