the ileal hormone fgf19 is secreted into the portal blood in response to fxr activation and although levels were increased after small-bowel resection oca treatment did not alter portal fgf19 levels in oca-treated sham or sbs piglets c. fxr gene expression was measured in liver and intestine samples d. fxr gene expression was increased significantly within the liver of oca-treated sham piglets and untreated sbs piglets whenfigure 3. sbs-associated alterations in bile acid composition were not prevented by oca treatment.

the expression of fxr target genes involved in bile acid transport and synthesis increased within the liver of sbs piglets after oca administration whereas paradoxically intestinal expression of fxr target genes were decreased by oca administration.conclusions administration of oca in sbs reduced fat malabsorption and altered bile acid composition but did not prevent the development of sbs-alds.

low levels of conju- gated bile acids have been associated with malnutrition but whether this may contribute to malnutrition experienced in patients with sbs-ald is not known.the prevention or modification of disturbances in the bile acid profile and biliary taurine levels and a reduction in fat malabsorption after oca treatment may have the potential to offer clinical benefit to patients with sbs.oca treatment has been effective in preventing liver dis- ease in a range of animal models including those mimicking cholestasissteatosisand cirrhosis.however in the current study we report evidence of hepatic lipidosis hepatic metabolite toxicity and extensive lymphedema within thefigure 4. oca treatment resulted in increased gene expression of fxr targets within the liver but paradoxically a decrease in fxr target gene expression in the intestine of sbs piglets.

although chronic fxr activation is beneficial in primary biliary cirrhosis diabetes-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis the chronic activation of fxr in a perinatal mouse model led to unexpected partial perinatal lethality and spontaneous liver toxicity.in this study we examined fxr agonist adminis- tration in a novel pathologic setting that of liver disease associated with short-bowel syndrome.

a recent report also suggested efficacy in patients with primary bile acid diarrhea.given the success of oca administration in the prevention of liver disease in both mouse models and human disease we postulated that administration of oca to sbs piglets would prevent the development of sbs-ald via preservation of bile acid composition and fxr signaling pathways within the liver and intestine.

oca treatment in sbs piglets resulted in a significant reduction in portal unconjugated hca levels when compared with untreated sbs piglets however levels remained significantly increased compared with sham controls.a dichotomous gene response to oca treatment between the intestine and liver in sbsgiven our previous findings of disturbed fxr signaling in sbs pigletsand the oca-induced modulation of bile acid composition in sbs piglets we investigated the relative expression of key intestinal and hepatic fxr target genesinvolved in the regulation of bile acid synthesis and trans- port.

however clinical benefit provided by oca treatment on enhancing intestinal fat absorption is outweighed by the impact of increased hepatic fat accu- mulation and lymphedema observed after oca treatment.the results from our study are consistent with a study in patients with secondary bile acid diarrhea after extensive intestinal resection.we were unable to replicate the re- sults described in patients with primary bile acid diarrhea in whom oca administration improved stool frequency and form and stimulated fgf19 secretion.because taurine promotes bile flow and biliary conjugation it is possible that prevention of low biliary taurine levels resulting from oca treatment in sbs may reduce the risk of development of sbs-ald.

further studies are required to confirm if the disturbed intestinal fxr response observed in sbs piglets in response to oca is owing to microbial dysbiosis and consequent bile acid dysmetabolism or owing to alternative activation of cyp3a4 which may impact on bile acid metabolism.in conclusion this study assessed the impact of treat- ment with oca an fxr agonist on the development of sbs-ald in a preclinical model of sbs.

small-bowel resection had no effect on gene expres- sion levels of fxr targets in either the intestine or the liver a and b. in the liver oca treatment of sham and sbs piglets resulted in increased mrp2 gene expression whereas small heterodimer partner shp bile salt export pump bsep organic solute transporter beta ostb and sulfotransferase family 2a member 1 sult2a1 were increased only in oca-treated sbs piglets when compared with untreated sbs piglets.

furthermore although the expression of fxr target genes was increased in the liver of sbs piglets treated with oca paradoxically the expression of fxr target genes in the in- testine was decreased.oca treatment was effective in reducing fat malabsorp- tion which may offer clinical benefit in patients with sbs.

although hepatic and intestinal fxr traditionally have been considered to cooperate to down-regulate cyp7a1 expres- sion evidence emerging from tissue-specific knockout and transgenic fxr activation models suggest that it is intestinal fxr activation that protects the liver from bile acid- associated damage.
