Presenters and leaders in the field were invited to attend a half-day session on the second day of the symposium to summarize the previous days' presentations evaluate our cur- rent scientific knowledge explore opportunities and challenges for conducting research in the field and determine potential ave- nues for future research.The following aims of the symposium were toImprove understanding of the methods used to determine the composition and function of the gut microenvironmentGain understanding of the relationship between the gut microen- vironment and the host with specific focus on interaction be- tween the gut microbiota and the immune system enteric nervous system external stressors and the brainBegin to understand the mechanisms by which the gut microbi- ota may play an important role in the pathogenesis of medical and neuropsychiatric diseasesExplore the role of diet prebiotics probiotics antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation FMT in manipulating the gut microenvironment to treat diseaseImprove the quality and generate new avenues of international research in brain-gut communicationMore than 100 participants from around the world including gastroenterologists psychiatrists basic scientists and other health care providers participated in the meeting.

Three central areas require basic and clinical research 1 how the intestinal microenvironment interacts with the host immune system central nervous system and enteric nervous system 2 the role of the intestinal microenvironment in the pathogenesis of medical and neuropsychiatric disease and 3 the effects of diet prebiotics probiotics and fecal microbiota transplan- tation on the intestinal microenvironment and the treatment of disease.Methods This review article is based on a symposium convened by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American Psychosomatic Society to foster interest in the role of the intestinal microenvironment in brain-gut communication and pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric and biopsychosocial disorders.

The pro- gram included sessions on 1 basic aspects of the intestinal microbiome 2 the intestinal microbiome and neural systems with a focus on physiology and pathophysiology 3 the role of the intestinal microbiome in medical and neuropsychiatric dis- eases and 4 manipulation of the intestinal microbiome as aFrom the Department of Internal Medicine Division of Gastroenterology Aroniadis Montefiore Medical Center-Albert Einstein College of Medicine Bronx New York Center for Functional Gastrointestinal and Motility Disorders Drossman Simren University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill North Carolina Drossman Gastroenterology Drossman Simren Chapel Hill North Carolina and Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition Simren Institute of Medicine Sahlgrenska Academy University of Gothenburg Sweden.Address correspondence and reprint requests to Olga C.

However there is no standardization regarding which of these outcomes should be used in microbiome research and yield the most relevant informationComplex methods that use machine learning computational biology and bioinformatics are required to handle and analyze large microbiome dataLarge longitudinal prospective cohort studies that are cumbersome time-consuming and expensive are necessary to provide de- tailed information about the role of the microbiome in health and diseaseThe complex multidirectional relationships that exist between the host microbiome and environment make it difficult to control for confounders in human subjects research which poses a challenge to establishing causal links between the microbiome health and diseaseThere are few studies comparing the luminal and mucosal microbiomeThe role of the virome and fungome in brain-gut communication is unexploredProbiotics are not subject to the same regulatory processes as traditional drugs which raises concern regarding the viability content and purity of probiotic products and hinders research in the fieldNoninvasive techniques to study brain-gut communication in humans are mainly limited to functional MRIThere are difficulties translating mechanistic findings from animal models to humans partly related to different readouts in research as well as physiologic differencessuch as irritable bowel syndrome IBS and although a specific microbial signature in IBS remains elusive this disorder has been associated with disturbances of the intestinal microbiota This as- sociation is intriguing and may provide additional evidence for a link between gut microbes and brain function however further studies are needed to determine whether a causal link exists.A Complex Multidirectional NetworkThe Microbiota the Host and the Environment There is strong evidence to suggest that environmental factors such as diet 16-18 exercise 19 and antibiotic 20 use can alter the intestinal microbiome and that changes in the intestinal microbiome can lead to alterations in the metabolism of food substrates 2021.

The speakers were chosen because they had extended expertise in characterizing the following 1 the gut microbiomecomplex relationships between the gut microbiota and the hostthe role of intestinal microbiota in health and disease or 4 the therapeutic role of the gut microbiota.The following summarizes the information presented at the symposium.

The role of the intestinal microbiome in medical and neu- ropsychiatric diseases is reviewed as well as the treatment effects of manipulation of the intestinal microbiome.Conclusions Based on this review opportunities and challenges for conducting research in the field are described leading to potential avenues for future research.Key words brain-gut communication metabolomics metaproteomics metatranscriptomics microbiota probiotics.INTRODUCTIONn recent years the role of the gut microbiota has been an area of active investigation and emerging data suggest that it may havea significant role in brain-gut interactions.

Collectively these data support a complex relationship between diet microbiota and host.Bidirectional Associations Between the Gut Microbiota and the BrainAlthough the brain and intestinal microbiome are separated by physical space these two systems also communicate in a bidirec- tional way 125 integration of complex neural hormonal andimmunological signaling enables bidirectional communication be- tween the gut and the brain 26 and provides a potential route by which the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites can access the brain and result in pathophysiologic consequences 125.

In addition we recognize that the gut micro- biota plays a crucial role in the development of innate and adaptive immunity 56 and in regulation of gut motility intestinal barrier homeostasis nutrient absorption and fat distribution 78.

Therefore the relationship be- tween the host microbiome and environment can be considered a complex multidirectional network 4142.The bidirectional relationship between the brain and intestinal microbiome has been elegantly elucidated in proof-of-concept studies in rodents which demonstrate that psychological stress results in altered composition of the intestinal microbiome hallmarked by a reduction in Lactobacillus 43.

It is believed that dynamic endo- crine neurologic and inflammatory systems mediate commu- nication between the brain and intestinal microbiota through a complex systemic and multidirectional network and that their ability to modulate one another is facilitated by permeability of the blood-brain barrier and intestinal barrier2847 although the precise mechanisms whereby these interactions occur have not yet been elucidated.Effect of Early-Life Events on the Intestinal Microbiota Early-life events are known to lead to long-term changes in health and are presumed to exert their affect by inducing low-grade in- flammation evoking changes to the immune system or resulting in dysbiosis 48.
