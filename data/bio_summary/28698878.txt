despite this from a more general perspective the nmds ordination plot of the dgge data showed a clear grouping of the microbiota from hypercholesterolemic individuals which is not so evident in the control group with the exception of some of these individuals that appear overlapping with the control group suggesting that there is a group of predominant phylotypes influencing hypercholesterolemia.finally the technical limitations could be corrected in future studies by analyzing microorganisms by means of next-generation sequencing ngs methodologies allowing a much deeper description of the bacterial populations associated with the development of hypercholesterolemia.conclusionour results showed differences in the profiles and diver- sity of bacterial communities between hypercholesterolemicacknowledgmentsthis study was supported by grants from direccio'n de inves- tigacio'n of universidad de la frontera diufro through projects of associative investigation pia15-0001 and by fondecyt-chile grant no.

in this context changes in the bacterial profiles have been also associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity and type 2 diabetes2biomed research internationalmellitus 10 recent studies have suggested the influence of changes in the microbiota on lipid metabolism in animal models describing differences in both cholesterol absorption and serum levels between germ-free and conventional rats moreover studies performed in hamsters--animals showing human-like lipoprotein metabolism --havequantified by uv spectrophotometry with infiniter 200 pro nanoquant microplate reader tecan switzerland.

in line with this observation it has been demonstrated that facultative and anaerobic bacteria located in the large bowel produce secondary bile acids from bile salts secreted by the individual which can modulate lipid metabolism at both hepatic and systemic levels on the other hand the attenuation of certain communities of gut microorganisms could determine a lower production of short chain fatty acids scfas which have been shown to reduce plasma concentrations of cholesterol in rodents and humans 22 or they could mediate l-carnitine metabolism into forming trimethylamine n-oxide a compound involved in the reverse transport of cholesterol cholesterol and sterols metabolism and the modulation of bile acids amount and composition 23.the approach used in the present study does not permit to identify the specific communities that differ between the groups.

in conclusion our results showed differences in the profiles of bacterial communities between hypercholesterolemic subjects and controls suggesting a possible role of the gut microbiota in the development of hypercholesterolemia.introductioncardiovascular diseases cvd are the leading cause of death in the world causing annually about 16 million deaths and more than 21000 in chile  .

stool samples were collected to ana- lyze bacterial community profiles of the gut microbiota by gel electrophoresis with denaturing gradient dgge technique.

by calculating diversity indexes obtained from the analysis of bacterial dna from the gut we have consistently demonstrated that hypercholesterolemic subjects have significantly lower bacterial diversity compared to control individuals.

in addition the nmds scaling analysis demonstrated the existence of differences among cases and controls allowing the grouping by similarity of 26 from the 29 hypercholesterolemic individuals.data obtained are concordant with a 2015 cross-sectional study relating microbiota with bmi tg and hdl-c revealing that healthy lipid levels were associated with an increase in microbial diversity 19. moreover a recent and highly relevant review provided insight into the relationship between the gut microbiota and interindividual variation in the lipid profile suggesting that gut microbes can explain a significant part of these differences .

however since it has been suggested that dif- ferences in microbial diversity could directly affect hep- atic metabolism by exerting an influence on hepatic lipid biosynthesis 24 as well as lipids degradation 25 due to its proximity to the gastrointestinal tract differences described in the present study might affect this mechanism depending on the bacterial communities differing between4biomed research international0.80.70.60.50.40.30.20.10.0figure 1 dendrogram of bacterial community profiles in stool samples from hypercholesterolemic subjects red and controls blue.hypercholesterolemic and control individuals.

considering that hypercholesterolemiadefined by the elevation of circulating low-density lipopro- tein levels increases the risk of coronary artery disease its treatment--besides reducing cholesterol levels--has been shown to decrease both incidence and mortality by acute coronary events during the last years gut microbiota has been related to both the maintenance of health and the development of several diseases .

it has been suggested that attenuation in phylotypes number and alter- ations in bacterial relative abundance as showed by the stud- ied hypercholesterolemic subjects could modulate choles- terol absorption or modulate cholesterol metabolism at the systemic level.

two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies showed a 4.4 tc and 6.2 ldl-c reduction caused by dairy products enriched with lactobacillus acidophilus or enterococcus faecium in subjects having a normal lipid profile and subjects with medium to moderate hypercholesterolemia 30 1. in addition the lipid-lowering effect of lactobacillus reuteri was described as an effect associated with increased intraluminal bile acid deconjugation resulting in reduced absorption of sterols different than cholesterol 32.among the limitations of our study we need to men- tion that dgge allows describing qualitatively the bacterial populations present in a particular sample.

glucose triglycerides tg total cholesterol tc and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c were quantified using enzymatic-colorimetric methods.
