Despite this from a more general perspective the nMDS ordination plot of the DGGE data showed a clear grouping of the microbiota from hypercholesterolemic individuals which is not so evident in the control group with the exception of some of these individuals that appear overlapping with the control group suggesting that there is a group of predominant phylotypes influencing hypercholesterolemia.Finally the technical limitations could be corrected in future studies by analyzing microorganisms by means of next-generation sequencing NGS methodologies allowing a much deeper description of the bacterial populations associated with the development of hypercholesterolemia.ConclusionOur results showed differences in the profiles and diver- sity of bacterial communities between hypercholesterolemicAcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by grants from Direccio'n de Inves- tigacio'n of Universidad de La Frontera DIUFRO through Projects of Associative Investigation PIA15-0001 and by FONDECYT-Chile Grant no.

By calculating diversity indexes obtained from the analysis of bacterial DNA from the gut we have consistently demonstrated that hypercholesterolemic subjects have significantly lower bacterial diversity compared to control individuals.

However since it has been suggested that dif- ferences in microbial diversity could directly affect hep- atic metabolism by exerting an influence on hepatic lipid biosynthesis 24 as well as lipids degradation 25 due to its proximity to the gastrointestinal tract differences described in the present study might affect this mechanism depending on the bacterial communities differing between4BioMed Research International0.80.70.60.50.40.30.20.10.0Figure 1 Dendrogram of bacterial community profiles in stool samples from hypercholesterolemic subjects red and controls blue.hypercholesterolemic and control individuals.

In conclusion our results showed differences in the profiles of bacterial communities between hypercholesterolemic subjects and controls suggesting a possible role of the gut microbiota in the development of hypercholesterolemia.IntroductionCardiovascular diseases CVD are the leading cause of death in the world causing annually about 16 million deaths and more than 21000 in Chile  .

In this context changes in the bacterial profiles have been also associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity and type 2 diabetes2BioMed Research Internationalmellitus 10 Recent studies have suggested the influence of changes in the microbiota on lipid metabolism in animal models describing differences in both cholesterol absorption and serum levels between germ-free and conventional rats Moreover studies performed in hamsters--animals showing human-like lipoprotein metabolism --havequantified by UV spectrophotometry with Infiniter 200 PRO Nanoquant microplate reader Tecan Switzerland.

Stool samples were collected to ana- lyze bacterial community profiles of the gut microbiota by gel electrophoresis with denaturing gradient DGGE technique.

demonstrated that gut microbiota stimulates an increase in hepatic triglyceride synthesis and modulates essential lipid absorption regulators such as taurocholateand tauromuricholate associating this effect to the Cori- obacteriaceae family  Gut microbiota is also able to modify lipid fractions in serum adipose tissue and liver 27.

Therefore we aimed to assess differences in the gut bacterial community profiles between hypercholesterolemic subjects and controls.

In parallel stool samples were collected and total DNA was isolated to assess the bacterial community profiles by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE.
