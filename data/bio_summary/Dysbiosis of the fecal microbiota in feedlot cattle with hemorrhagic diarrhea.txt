it is possible that the hemorrhagic diarrhea was caused by an independent pathophysiological process and that the observed microbial changes were a secondary outcome to the pertur- bations in the gastrointestinal environment arising from the causal pathology.the two main bacterial taxa present in greater proportions in the calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea were clostridium and escherichia spp.

there were 746 unique otus identified in healthy control cattle 339 otus unique in the hemorrhagic diarrhea calves and 270 otus were represented the core microbiota between the two groups.conclusionthis is the first study to describe the differences in fecal microbial community composition diversity and predicted functional profile be- tween feedlot calves with and without hemorrhagic diarrhea.

we hypothesized that feedlot cattle with hemor- rhagic diarrhea would have a reduction in fecal microbial richness and diversity when compared to the pen matched healthy controls.materials and methodsanimal populations and sample collectionsamples for this study were collected as part of a clinical in- vestigation from a large  70000 head one-time capacity cattle feeding facility located in the west central united states that had a multi-year seasonal history of hemorrhagic diarrhea late in the feeding period.

in fact similar changes at dif- ferent taxonomic levels have also been reported in feline diarrhea  acute hemorrhagic diarrhea in dogs  and colitis in horses .

in calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea is similar to that observed in feline diarrhea .

s3.to further evaluate the potential change in fecal microbiota asso- ciated with hemorrhagic diarrhea the differences in microbial relative abundance between healthy calves and calves with hemorrhagic diar- rhea were compared using the lefse algorithm .

this study compared the composition diversity and predicted functional profiles of the fecal microbiota between healthy feedlot calves and calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea.our results demonstrated significant differences in microbial com-munity composition and predicted functional profiles between the healthy calves and calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea.

however limited information is available about changes in the fecal microbiota that occur under disease conditions such as hemorrhagic diarrhea in feedlot cattle.

the objectives of this study were to characterize the differences in fecal microbiota composition diversity and functional gene profile between feedlot calves with and without hemorrhagic diarrhea.

deep fecal swabs were collected from calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea n  5 and from pen matched healthy calves n  5. genomic dna was extracted and v1-v3 hypervariable region of 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina miseq sequencing.
