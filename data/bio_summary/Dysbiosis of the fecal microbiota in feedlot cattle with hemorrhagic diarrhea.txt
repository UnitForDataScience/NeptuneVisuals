We hypothesized that feedlot cattle with hemor- rhagic diarrhea would have a reduction in fecal microbial richness and diversity when compared to the pen matched healthy controls.Materials and methodsAnimal populations and sample collectionSamples for this study were collected as part of a clinical in- vestigation from a large  70000 head one-time capacity cattle feeding facility located in the west central United States that had a multi-year seasonal history of hemorrhagic diarrhea late in the feeding period.

In fact similar changes at dif- ferent taxonomic levels have also been reported in feline diarrhea  acute hemorrhagic diarrhea in dogs  and colitis in horses .

It is possible that the hemorrhagic diarrhea was caused by an independent pathophysiological process and that the observed microbial changes were a secondary outcome to the pertur- bations in the gastrointestinal environment arising from the causal pathology.The two main bacterial taxa present in greater proportions in the calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea were Clostridium and Escherichia spp.

in calves with hemorrhagic diarrhea is similar to that observed in feline diarrhea .

There were 746 unique OTUs identified in healthy control cattle 339 OTUs unique in the hemorrhagic diarrhea calves and 270 OTUs were represented the core microbiota between the two groups.ConclusionThis is the first study to describe the differences in fecal microbial community composition diversity and predicted functional profile be- tween feedlot calves with and without hemorrhagic diarrhea.
