recent studies have begun to disclose how ilc3s interact with gut bacteria diet-derived factors and various cell types to maintain intestinal homeostasis.although the organization of ilc subsets in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues and murine intestinal tissues occur independently of microbiota colonization the anatomical retention of lymphoid tissue resident bacteria seems to be related with ilc3s function80.

innate lymphoid cells in tissue homeostasis and diseases.

in addition their interaction with the microbiota nutrients and metabolites613 highlighted important functions for ilcs in triggering tissue repair and inflammation which if unregulated can result in exacerbated immune responses.based on the emerging roles of ilcs in controlling tissue homeostasis this review will highlight the advances in understanding how ilcs can participate in host defense in the context of immunity microbiota autoimmunity and tissue remodeling focusing on the intestinal and liver pathophysiology.ilcs development an overviewuntil the discovery of ilcs conventional natural killer cells cnks were the only innate cells able to respond to cytokines released by antigen presenting cellsinnate lymphoid cells ilcs are the most recent family of innate immune cells discovered among the myriad of factors that make up the immune system.

they belong to innate immune system but develop from the lymphoid lineage.

the ilc3s also include the lymphoid tissue inducer lti cells.

these cells were uncovered in 1997 and are involved in the formation of secondary lymphoid tissues4.mirroring the th subsets the non-cytotoxic ilcs are separated based on cytokine expression transcription factors during development surface markers and distinct effector functions56.
