Recent studies have begun to disclose how ILC3s interact with gut bacteria diet-derived factors and various cell types to maintain intestinal homeostasis.Although the organization of ILC subsets in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues and murine intestinal tissues occur independently of microbiota colonization the anatomical retention of lymphoid tissue resident bacteria seems to be related with ILC3s function80.

They are a part of the innate immune system but develop from the lymphoid lineage.

Therefore in this review we discuss recent findings regarding ILC functions in homeostasis and disease with a focus on the intestine and liver.Key words Innate lymphoid cells Intestine Liver Homeostasis Inflammatory diseasesc The Authors 2017.
