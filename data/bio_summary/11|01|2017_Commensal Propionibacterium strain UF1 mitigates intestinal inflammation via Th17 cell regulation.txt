uf1- or pbs-gavaged thy1.2 rag1-- mice 42 lacking mature t and b cells 43. data document the differentiation of th17 cells from thy1.1cd4cd45rbhi t cells by p. uf1 in the intestines mlns and spleens of thy1.2 rag1-- mice figure 4d.to investigate the mechanistic paradigm associated with dlat-specific th17 cell differentiation the dlat gene was deleted from the bacterial chromosome by homologous recombination with a single crossover event 44 resulting in the ddlat p. uf1 figure 5 a-d. importantly the bacterial growth kinetics and detection of ddlat p. uf1 in conventional c57bl6 mouse fecal and cecal contents were comparable to p. uf1 figure 5 e and f. when compared with p. uf1 gf mice monoassociated with ddlat p. uf1 exhibited significantly increased expression of il-1bil-6 and il-1223p40 in colonic dcs and colonic tissue supple- mental figure 2 a-c. ddlat p. uf1 also substantially abrogated th17 cells while il-10 tregs were generally comparable to those of pbs-gavaged mice suggesting a crucial role for dlat in il-10 th17 cell differentiation.

data revealed different metabolic pathways particularly in tryp- tophan and butanoate metabolism however no th17 cells were promoted in the h2-ab1-- mice lacking mhc ii supplemental fig- ure 3 b and c once again highlighting the critical role of mhc ii in differential t cell activation 41. furthermore cytokines e.g.il-1b il-6 alone were not sufficient to induce th17 cells in mice that were gavaged with the s-layer p. uf1 denoting that the s-layer and its deduced peptides are essential in th17 cell differentiation supplemental figure 3a.to further evaluate s-layer-specific th17 cells c57bl6 mice were gavaged with p. uf1.

il-1b were not only diminished in colonic tis- sues of gf mice monoassociated with p. uf1 but also in sorted colonic dcs supplemental figure 2 b and c. the generation of th17 cells particularly il-10ifn-g- th17 cells and il-10 tregs was also substantially increased in gf mice monoassociated with p. uf1 while the ifn-gcd4 t cell response th1 cells was decreased compared with that in the control groups figure 3d and supplemental figure 12 suggesting that p. uf1 not only criti- cally regulates dcs but also specifically augments the formation of th17 cells.

uf1 or in dacta l. m-infected mice figure 7c.to demonstrate the role of p. uf1-induced il-10 tregs in the regulation of gut homeostasis the frequency of these cells was significantly reduced in b6.129cg-foxp3tm3dtrgfpayrj mice foxp3dtr mice through diphtheria toxin dt injection 53. con- versely regulated immunity against dacta l. m infection was sig- nificantly diminished when compared with functional tregs from mice with no dt injection figure 7a and supplemental figure 7 a and b again highlighting the regulatory role of sustained p. uf1- induced il-10 tregs in controlling inflammatory responses 54 against dacta l. m infection.regulation of p. uf1-induced immunity requires signr1.

furthermore introducing this bacterium to conven- tional c57bl6 mice via a single oral gavage resulted in transient gut colonization potentially due to bacterial competition for space and nutritional resources 15 16 whereby this bacterium was no longer detectable in the fecal or cecal contents of c57bl6 mice after 5 to 6 days figure 2 c and d. in contrast p. uf1 perma- nently colonized the gut of germfree gf mice as detected in the fecal contents of these mice until day 7 figure 2e.

additionally gavaging mice with p. uf1 upregulated signr1 in colonic tissue and in dcs figure 8 e and f. to assess signr1 involvement in limiting pathogen-induced inflammation signr1 and signr1-- mice were gavaged with p. uf1 ddlat p. uf1 or pbs and then orally infected with dacta l. m. data illustrate the role of signr1 in assuaging dacta l. m-induced inflamma- tion seen in p. uf1-gavaged signr1 mice figure 8g which was not evident in p. uf1-gavaged signr1-- mice infected with dactal.

here the fre- quency of il-17ail-22 ilc3 in p. uf1-gavaged newborn mice was significantly increased when compared with control new- born mice supplemental figure 10b and supplemental figure 13. to elucidate whether p. uf1 can mitigate pathologic con- ditions induced by nec-like injury 63 64 newborn mice 5 days of age delivered by p. uf1-gavaged dams were compared with newborn mice of dams given pbs.

uf1-gavaged h2-ab1-- mice compared with h2-ab1-- mice plus cd4 t cells and pbs-gavaged h2-ab1-- mice were performed.

m were considered to require ifn-g th1 cells 48. however ifn-g deficiency does not exclude the activation of cd4 t cells against this pathogen 83. moreover protective th17 cells were induced against several intracellular pathogens including salmo- nella typhimurium 84 and l. m 85 indicating that th17 cells are not redundant against intracellular pathogens.

moreover transfaunating gf mice with hbmf preterm infants' microbiota increased th17 cells and sustained il-10 tregs a trend that was less evident in gf mice transfaunat- ed with ff preterm infants' microbiota figure 3a.

not only were proinflammatory dc responses attenuated upon p. uf1 gavage of gf mice transfaunated with ff preterm infants' microbiota but th17 cells and il-10 tregs were also significantly increased to the levels seen in gf mice transfaunated with hbmf preterm infants' microbiota supplemental figure 1a and figure 3a.

a cd4 splenic cells derived from c57bl6 mice gavaged with p. uf1 were transferred intoh2-ab1-- recipient mice.

compared with the newborn mice of pbs-gavaged dams newborn mice of dams gavaged with p. uf1 exhibited regulated tgf-bil-10 dcs supplemental figure 10a and significantly induced il-10 th17 cells and il-10 tregs figure 9a.
