IL-1b were not only diminished in colonic tis- sues of GF mice monoassociated with P. UF1 but also in sorted colonic DCs Supplemental Figure 2 B and C. The generation of Th17 cells particularly IL-10IFN-g- Th17 cells and IL-10 Tregs was also substantially increased in GF mice monoassociated with P. UF1 while the IFN-gCD4 T cell response Th1 cells was decreased compared with that in the control groups Figure 3D and Supplemental Figure 12 suggesting that P. UF1 not only criti- cally regulates DCs but also specifically augments the formation of Th17 cells.

Data are pooled from 3 experiments in steady state n  15 newborn micegroup A and for NEC-like injury PBS n  10 newborn mice NEC n  12 newborn mice NEC  P. UF1 n  17 newborn mice E or 4 experiments NEC n  33 newborn mice NEC  P. UF1 n  30 newborn mice B.

Furthermore introducing this bacterium to conven- tional C57BL6 mice via a single oral gavage resulted in transient gut colonization potentially due to bacterial competition for space and nutritional resources 15 16 whereby this bacterium was no longer detectable in the fecal or cecal contents of C57BL6 mice after 5 to 6 days Figure 2 C and D. In contrast P. UF1 perma- nently colonized the gut of germfree GF mice as detected in the fecal contents of these mice until day 7 Figure 2E.

Additionally gavaging mice with P. UF1 upregulated SIGNR1 in colonic tissue and in DCs Figure 8 E and F. To assess SIGNR1 involvement in limiting pathogen-induced inflammation Signr1 and Signr1-- mice were gavaged with P. UF1 DdlaT P. UF1 or PBS and then orally infected with DactA L. m. Data illustrate the role of SIGNR1 in assuaging DactA L. m-induced inflamma- tion seen in P. UF1-gavaged Signr1 mice Figure 8G which was not evident in P. UF1-gavaged Signr1-- mice infected with DactAL.

UF1-gavaged H2-Ab1-- mice compared with H2-Ab1-- mice plus CD4 T cells and PBS-gavaged H2-Ab1-- mice were performed.

UF1 or in DactA L. m-infected mice Figure 7C.To demonstrate the role of P. UF1-induced IL-10 Tregs in the regulation of gut homeostasis the frequency of these cells was significantly reduced in B6.129Cg-Foxp3tm3DTRGFPAyrJ mice Foxp3DTR mice through diphtheria toxin DT injection 53.

Furthermore cytokines e.g.IL-1b IL-6 alone were not sufficient to induce Th17 cells in mice that were gavaged with the S-layer P. UF1 denoting that the S-layer and its deduced peptides are essential in Th17 cell differentiation Supplemental Figure 3A.To further evaluate S-layer-specific Th17 cells C57BL6 mice were gavaged with P. UF1.

Moreover transfaunating GF mice with HBMF preterm infants' microbiota increased Th17 cells and sustained IL-10 Tregs a trend that was less evident in GF mice transfaunat- ed with FF preterm infants' microbiota Figure 3A.

Not only were proinflammatory DC responses attenuated upon P. UF1 gavage of GF mice transfaunated with FF preterm infants' microbiota but Th17 cells and IL-10 Tregs were also significantly increased to the levels seen in GF mice transfaunated with HBMF preterm infants' microbiota Supplemental Figure 1A and Figure 3A.
