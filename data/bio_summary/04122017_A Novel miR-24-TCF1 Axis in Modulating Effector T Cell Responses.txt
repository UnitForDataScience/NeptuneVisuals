finally although it seems that the mir-24-tcf1 axis reported in this study generally promotes ef- fector function of all t cell subsets expression of tcf1 has been recently shown to be crucial for establishing the transcriptional program of the follicular th tfh cell population 11 26. as such excessive mir-24 expression is likely to be detrimental to tfh responses and mir-24 might function as a central molecular regulator in controlling the reciprocal development of tfh cells versus other teff cell lineages through targeting tcf1.our study has revealed a novel mir-24-tcf1 axis in regulating effector cytokine production and further demonstrated that the expression of tcf1 needs to be tightly regulated because small changes in tcf1 amounts could have significant impact on lymphocyte development and responses.

2 sup- porting the reported role of mir-24 in promoting th1 differenti- ation and ifn-g production 6.tconv cells with excessive mir-24 expression from healthy r24tg mice already exhibit th1 and th17 gene signaturesalthough we did not detect significant changes in il-17 production by t cells in r24tg mice before the onset of the autoimmune diseases in addition to enhanced th1 responses increased th17 polarization was also observed in t cells with excessive mir-24 expression 6. to further explore the molecular impacts of mir-24 on t cell immunity we reanalyzed the transcriptome profiling results of cd4cd252cd62lhi tconv cells isolated from r24tg mice of 6-8 wk of age 6. although overexpression of mir-24 was reported to negatively regulate the th2-related gene network 6 7 r24tg t cells isolated from mice before the onset of t cell hyperactivation already exhibited elevated expression of many th1- and th17-signature genes fig.

interestingly although tcf1 was previously shown to promote th2 responses through inducing gata3 expression 9 mir-24 does not seem to limit th2 immunity through targeting tcf1 because enforcing tcf1 expression in mir-24- overexpressing t cells led to further downregulation of il-4 and gata3 expression.

however once cells are fully differentiated although tcf1 could still modulate the production of effector cytokines its impact on the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors diminishes because those molecules would be stabilized by many transcrip- tional and epigenetic regulations 25.although our work has clearly shown that mir-24 could drive the generation of ifn-g- and il-17-producing t cells through repressing tcf1 it seemed to argue against the reported role of tcf1 in promoting th2 responses 9. restoring the expression of the l-tcf1 the one with the capacity to induce gata3 expression through interacting with b-catenin in mir-24-overexpressing cells resulted in a further decrease in gata3 expression and il-4 pro- duction.

surprisingly whereas tcf1 was previously shown to promote th2 responses through inducing gata3 enforced tcf1 expression in mir-24-overexpressing t cells led to further downregulation of il-4 and gata3 expression suggesting mir-24-mediated inhibition of th2 immunity cannot be attributed to tcf1 repression by mir-24.

although we could not exclude the possibility that exces- sive mir-24 expression might still hamper some aspects of treg cell function thus contributing to the autoimmune phenotypes detected in r24tg mice our studies have unequivocally demonstrated that excessive mir-24 expression in tconv cells alone is sufficient to cause dysregulated ifn-g and il-17 responses and would lead to the subsequent autoimmunity.tcf1 functions as a key downstream effector of the wnt sig- naling pathway to control t cell development in the thymus as well as mature t cell differentiation in the periphery 22-24. specif- ically it was previously shown that tcf1 inhibits ifn-g and il-17 responses without directly impacting the expression of t-bet and rorgt 9 10. interestingly although our analysis of dif- ferentiated th1 and th17 cells regarding the effect of tcf1 on lineage-specific transcription factors was in agreement with the aforementioned reports our transcriptome profiling results re- vealed that enhanced expression of t-bet and rorgt as well as other th1- and th17-associated genes could already be observed in cd4cd252cd62lhi t cells isolated from healthy r24tgmice.

it is also noteworthy that r24tg mice harbored increased thymic treg cells as opposed to the reduced number observed in r27tg mice 14. a recent report has suggested a regulatory role of tcf1 in limiting thymic treg cell development 21. it is thus plausible that mir-24 could also pro- mote thymic treg cell generation through targeting tcf1 which further suggests that mir-24 might act more as a positive player rather than a negative regulator like mir-27 in controlling treg cell biology.

in the process of t cell differentiation each th cell subsetacquires lineage-defining master regulators that orchestrate unique transcriptional programs allowing the different th cell populations to exert their respective immune functions through secreting corresponding effector cytokines 1. in addition to transcriptional regulation the establishment and maintenance of each functional th cell subset also involve the expression of epigenetic regulators such as micrornas mirnas that could either promote or inhibit the differentiation and function of a given th cell lineage 1.in the past decade many mirnas have been identified to be crucial in regulating th cell fate decisions and controlling their effector functions 2. for example members of the mir-29 family have been shown to inhibit th1 immunity not only by repressing the th1 master regulators t-bet and eomes but also through directly targeting the effector cytokine ifn-g 3-5. re- cently we and others have demonstrated that mir-24 and mir-27could potently control th2 immunity through coordinately re- pressing gata3 il-4 and many other th2-associated molecules 6 7. interestingly whereas the whole mir-232724 family also negatively regulates the differentiation and function of other th cell lineages mir-24 unlike mir-23 or mir-27 actually promotes th1 and th17 responses suggesting that under certain circumstances in- dividual members can antagonize rather than cooperate with each other to fine-tune a given biological effect of the entire mirna family 6.in this study we showed that mir-24 drives the production of ifn-g and il-17 by conventional t tconv cells in a cell-intrinsic manner and enforced expression of mir-24 in tconv cells led to dysregulated th1 and th17 responses even in the presence of wild type wt regulatory t treg cells.

these results clearly demonstrated that mir-24 does not limit il-4 production and th2 differentiation through targeting tcf1.discussionalthough it is generally believed that mirna clusters are evolu- tionarily conserved to ensure their biological impact through having different cluster members collaboratively target the same gene or different components of a common biological process 18 recent studies have revealed that individual members could also antagonize each other's function to fine-tune a given biological effect of the entire mirna family 6 19 20. specifically we have recently reported that enforced mir-24 expression resulted in enhanced th1 and th17 differentiation whereas overexpressionof the whole mir-232724 cluster or other family membersinhibited those th lineages 6. in this study by further examining mice with t cell-specific mir-24 overexpression as well as employing the mixed bm chimera approach we comprehensively demonstrated a tconv cell-intrinsic role of mir-24 in promoting ifn-g and il-17 responses.

collectively our results identify a novel mir-24- tcf1 axis in modulating effector t teff cell cytokine production and further suggest that mir-24 could serve as a key regulator in fine-tuning the amount of tcf1 to control a wide range of immune responses.materials and methodsmicer24tg 6 and tcf1fl mice 11 were described previously.

to examine the mir-24 effect on tcf1 at a more physiologically relevant level we then generated cd4-cre tcf1fl mice in which all t cells express reduced tcf1 levelssimilar to what we could observed in our r24tg t cells fig.
