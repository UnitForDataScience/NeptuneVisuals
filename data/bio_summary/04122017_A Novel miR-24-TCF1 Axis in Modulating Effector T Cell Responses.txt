The fact that miR-24 represses TCF1 and TCF1 was shown to promote Th2 responses and IL-4 production through inducing GATA3 expres- sion raised a possibility that miR-24-mediated TCF1 repression could also contribute to the impaired Th2 responses observed in T cells with excessive miR-24 expression 9.

Interestingly although TCF1 was previously shown to promote Th2 responses through inducing GATA3 expression 9 miR-24 does not seem to limit Th2 immunity through targeting TCF1 because enforcing TCF1 expression in miR-24- overexpressing T cells led to further downregulation of IL-4 and GATA3 expression.

However once cells are fully differentiated although TCF1 could still modulate the production of effector cytokines its impact on the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors diminishes because those molecules would be stabilized by many transcrip- tional and epigenetic regulations 25.Although our work has clearly shown that miR-24 could drive the generation of IFN-g- and IL-17-producing T cells through repressing TCF1 it seemed to argue against the reported role of TCF1 in promoting Th2 responses 9.

Surprisingly whereas TCF1 was previously shown to promote Th2 responses through inducing GATA3 enforced TCF1 expression in miR-24-overexpressing T cells led to further downregulation of IL-4 and GATA3 expression suggesting miR-24-mediated inhibition of Th2 immunity cannot be attributed to TCF1 repression by miR-24.

As such excessive miR-24 expression is likely to be detrimental to Tfh responses and miR-24 might function as a central molecular regulator in controlling the reciprocal development of Tfh cells versus other Teff cell lineages through targeting TCF1.Our study has revealed a novel miR-24-TCF1 axis in regulating effector cytokine production and further demonstrated that the expression of TCF1 needs to be tightly regulated because small changes in TCF1 amounts could have significant impact on lymphocyte development and responses.

Collectively our results identify a novel miR-24- TCF1 axis in modulating effector T Teff cell cytokine production and further suggest that miR-24 could serve as a key regulator in fine-tuning the amount of TCF1 to control a wide range of immune responses.Materials and MethodsMiceR24Tg 6 and TCF1fl mice 11 were described previously.

To examine the miR-24 effect on TCF1 at a more physiologically relevant level we then generated CD4-cre TCF1fl mice in which all T cells express reduced TCF1 levelssimilar to what we could observed in our R24Tg T cells Fig.
