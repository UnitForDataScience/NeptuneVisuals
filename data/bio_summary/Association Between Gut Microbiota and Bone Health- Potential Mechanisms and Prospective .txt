several additional anti- biotics studies have supported these findings indicatingthat the gut microbiota may impact bone growth through changes in metabolic hormones as well as the regulation of hepatic gene expression potential mechanisms for gut microbiota affecting bone metabolismthere are several potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may influence biological processes important for human health and in the subsequent sections we aim to outline the current findings as they relate to bone metabolism.influence on nutrient absorption and the intestinal mucosal barrieramong the extensive variety of bacterial species in the gut microbiota many can influence the processes of nutrient absorption.

peptide yy is a gas- trointestinal hormone secreted from the endocrine l cells and has been shown to be negatively associated with total body and hip bmd in premenopausal women  glucagon-like peptide 1 an amino acid hormone that is also secreted from the endocrine l cells has been shown to act as a regulator of bone metabolism by altering thebalance between osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation from bone mesenchymal stem cells .the overall relationship between the gut microbiota and bone metabolism is summarized in 1.approaches for metagenomics analysisgiven the importance of the gut microbiota for bone metabolism and potentially the risk of osteoporosis de- velopment we anticipate a growing number of meta- genomic studies in this field throughout the near future.

whereas some aspects of the microbiota-bone relationship have previously been reviewed we also contribute some useful bio- informatics methodology and approaches for meta- genomics research and provide perspectives for future explorations of the role of the gut microbiota in the etiology of osteoporosis.evidence of the association between gut microbiota and boneintestinal bacterial overgrowth and bone lossthe earliest evidence of a relationship between the gut microbiota and bone metabolism reported that bone mineral density bmd was associated with intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

integratingmultiple layers of omics from the gut microbiota will provide a more comprehensive and systematic under- standing of how the microbiota may affect certain aspects of host physiology such as bone metabolism 92.the simul-table 3.examples of the area under the curve of using gut microbiota to distinguish patients from healthy samples for complex diseases95 confidencetaneous advances in multiomics studies for both humansdiseaseaucintervaland the gut microbiota offer opportunities for combining studies of host omics with that of the gut microbiome  several recent studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiota composition may be influenced by the host genome  and there is also a growing appreciation for the role of epigenetic regulation of the host-microbiota interactions .

tnf-a is known to stimulate the receptor activator for nuclear factor kb ligand signaling pathway which may promote bone loss as well as suppress the differentiation of mesen- chymal stem cells into osteoblasts inhibiting bone for- mation it has been noted that there is an interesting re- lationship between bone loss and bariatric surgeries the mechanism of the bone loss induced by bariatric surgeries is not fully understood although it is believed to include malabsorption and certain immune system fac- tors along with multiple other unknown components in one recent study it was reported that gut microbiota and proinflammatory cytokines including tnf-a and il-6 were altered after sleeve gastrectomy in particular after treatment by sleeve gastrectomy the levels of tnf-a and il-6 were reduced .

remarkably several recent studies have shown that distinctions in the gut microbiota composition may be used to distinguish between individuals having differ- ential disease status with high statistical power based on the area under the curve metric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve a common indicator to evaluate sensitivity and specificity 3. therefore it is conceivable that the gut microbiota may furnish effective biomarkers in the diagnosisprognosis of bone diseases and other phenotypic traits.currently the majority of therapeutic efforts targeting the gut microbiota have been focused around the preventativeprotective effects provided by probiotics and prebiotics  these types of treatments have been successfully tested in clinical interventions for dozens of human diseases including obesity ul- cerative colitis atopic diseases of children  hypercholesterolemia and autism narrow- spectrum antibiotics directed toward the gut microbiota and their byproducts are believed to hold great promise as a microbiome-based therapy  .

further exploration through integrative multiomics and network analysis studies is needed to elucidate the full range of these interactions as they relate to bone health and other complex humandiseases.translational potential of gut microbiotathe apparent association between the gut microbiota and bone metabolic processes suggests that the charac- terization and identification of important gut microbiota features may have great clinical potential.

although researchers have only recently begun to study the relationship between the gut microbiota and bone metabolism early efforts have provided increased evidence to suggest an important association.evidence acquisition in this study we attempt to comprehensively summarize the relationship between the gut microbiota and bone metabolism by detailing the regulatory effects of the microbiome on various biological processes including nutrient absorption and the intestinal mucosal barrier immune system functionality the gut-brain axis and excretion of functional byproducts.

previous association studies have shown that the gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes including gut physiology nutrient production and absorption host growth energy balancing metabolicfunctions  immune-system functions  brain- behavior systems and inflammatory processes additionally differences in the composition of the gut microbiota have been found to be associated with the pathogenesis of several complex human diseases in- cluding obesity irritable bowel syndrome type 1 and type 2 diabetes  colorectal cancer parkinson's disease  transient ischemic attack and rheumatoid arthritis although the number of studies assessing the impact of the microbiota composition on bone metabolism is still very limited the current findings suggest a potentially intriguing and complex relationship that warrants further examination to determine the specific mechanisms by which the microbiome may modulate bone physiology.

furthermore we outline some useful toolsapproaches for metagenomics research and present some prominent examples of metagenomics association studies in humans.conclusion current research efforts although limited clearly indicate that the gut microbiota may be implicated in bone metabolism and therefore further exploration of this relationship is a promising area of focus in bone health and osteoporosis research.

although milk has long been known to contain nutritional elements that are beneficial for bone health there have not been any current studies exploring whether milk consumption benefits bone metabolism by altering the composition of the gut microbiota.

how- ever bone loss is known to be associated with increased levels of tnf-a and il-6 rather than decreased levels.therefore although it is worth noting these findings are inconsistent and it is unclear exactly how bariatric surgeries may impact the microbiome relevant to bone.influence on gut-brain axisin recent years it has been discovered that the gut microbiota may have important effects on the nervous system through regulation of the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters such as serotonin 5-ht the 5-ht signal transduction system is regarded as an im- portant factor for the regulation of bone development and maintenance.

the decrease of estrogen levels is a major factor contributing to post- menopausal osteoporosis risk and therefore the gut microbiota may influence the regulation of bone health by altering levels of nonovarian estrogens.additional studies have discovered that short chain fatty acids also might indirectly affect bmd by signifi- cantly influencing the function of host endocrine factors that are related to bone metabolism such as peptide yy and glucagon-like peptide 1 .

these microbes begin to interact with the human body beginning from the earliest stages of life as it is believed the human fetus may be exposed to the maternalmicrobiome during gestation and development after birth the gut microbiota quickly colonize in the digestive tract and the microbiome is established within the first few years of life although the composition of an individual's gut microbiota usually remains relatively stable in adulthood it may be altered by various factors including host genetics diet age ge- ography host immune status travel and use of certain medications issn print 0021-972x issn online 1945-7197printed in usacopyright c 2017 endocrine societyreceived 25 february 2017. accepted 18 july 2017.first published online 26 july 2017these authors contributed equally to this study.abbreviations 5-ht serotonin bmd bone mineral density il interleukin lps lipo- polysaccharide mgwas metagenome-wide association study otu operational taxonomic unit rrna ribosomal rna tnf tumor necrosis factor.doi j clin endocrinol metab october 2017 102103635-36463635it is estimated that .1000 different microbial species exist in the human gut .

more importantly colonization of the germfree mice with a normal gut microbiota reduced bone mass suggesting that the absence of gut microbiota may be responsible for the elevated bmd in the germfree mice.
