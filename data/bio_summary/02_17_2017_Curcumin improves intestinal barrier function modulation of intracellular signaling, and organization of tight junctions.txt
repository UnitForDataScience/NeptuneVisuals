We earlier reported a WD-induced decrease in intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity 12 indicating the disruption of this first layer of the intestinal barrier by WD that results in effectively increasing the luminal LPS concentration.Luminal LPS not only activates the intestinal epithelial cells IECs but also activates intestinal macrophages that survey the intestinal lumen and constitute the intestinal innate immune system 6.

IL-1b-dependent activation of p38 MAP kinase and subsequent activation of myosin light chain kinase MLCK leading to phosphorylation of myosin light chains result in disruption of intestinal tight junctions and an increase in intestinal permeability emphasizing the importance of understanding the processes that regulate luminal LPS or LPS-induced IL-1b production as well as strategies to modulate them.We have earlier demonstrated that oral supplementation with curcumin significantly increased the activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase and reduced the levels of plasma LPS in WD-fed mice demonstrating its protective effects against WD-induced disruption of intestinal barrier function 12.

We and others have reported an increase in circulating LPS levels in response to WD feeding due to an increase in intestinal permeability 8 12.Intestinal barrier can be visualized as composed of four different layers namely 1 intestinal alkaline phosphatase that dephosphorylates and detoxifies LPS 2 mucin layer that limits the direct interaction between gut bacteria and the intestinal epithelial cells 3 The tight junctions of the intestinal epithelial cell layer and 4 the antibacterial proteins secreted by the Paneth cells into the lumen.

Mucosal balance between IL-1b and IL-1Ra regulates inflammatory bowel diseases in humans 5 and animals 18.Activity of SHIP that reduces expression of IL-1b is reduced in Crohn's disease patients 20 underscoring the importance of tight regulation of intestinal IL-1b production and also identifying interventions to attenuate IL-1b production associated with these inflammatory diseases.

Since curcumin is very poorly absorbed resulting in limited basolateral exposure these data further suggest that apical or luminal exposure to curcumin might underlie its observed effects on improvement of intestinal barrier function by oral administration 12.While direct contact between luminal bacteria and IECs is restricted by the presence of a firmly attached mucin layer bacteria-derived LPS not only can activate IECs but also the surveying intestinal macrophages leading to the production of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-1b.

Furthermore curcumin supplementation attenuated WD-induced increase in plasma LPS levels by not only increasingthe activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase that detoxifies LPS in the gut lumen but also by improving intestinal barrier function.

LPS is continually being produced in the intestinal lumen by the gut bacteria and an intact intestinal epithelial barrier restricts the translocation of this luminal LPS to systemic circulation.

The major site of action of curcumin is therefore likely the IECs and the intestinal barrier and by reducing intestinal barrier dysfunction curcumin modulates chronic inflammatory diseases despite poor bioavailability.Keywords chronic inflammatory metabolic diseases intestinal epithelial cell inflammation tight junction proteinsIN ADDITION TO Western diet WD-induced dyslipidemia chronic inflammatory state is increasingly being recognized as an important contributor to the development of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

To examine whether in addition to reducing LPS-induced IL-1b production from IECs  or intestinal macrophages as shown  curcumin also modulates inflammatory signaling in IECs by affecting activation of p38 MAPK IECs namely Caco-2 or HT-29 cells were exposed to IL-1b with or without pretreatment with curcumin.

Biotinylated secondary antibodies as well as NeutrAvidin-conjugated AlexaFluors were from PierceThermoFisher.Ready-go-set ELISA kit for measuring human IL-1b IL-10 and IL-6 were from Affymetrix-eBiosciences.Optimized Taqman gene expression assay kits for IL-1b Hs00174097m1 IL-6 Hs00985639m1 IL- 10 Hs00961622m1 and MLCK Hs00364926m1 were obtained from Applied Biosciences ThermoFisher and qPCR conditions recommended by the manufacturer were used to determine the respective mRNA levels and normalized to b-actin 4326315E serving as the housekeeping gene.Secretion of IL-1b.
