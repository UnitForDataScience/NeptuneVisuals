Thus it is likely that R-ketamine has more potency to improve the altered composition of gut microbiota after CSDS than S- ketamine.Altered composition in the gut bacterium at the phylum levelThe phylum levels of gut bacterium 4 days day 16 after a single dose of saline R-ketamine or S-ketamine are shown Fig.

These findings suggest that an altered gut microbiota composition plays a role in the depression-like phenotype of CSDS-susceptible mice and that the restoration of the gut microbiota induced by R-ketamine partly explains its robust antidepressant effects.At the phylum level levels of Actinobacteria were sig- nificantly higher in active major depressive disorder MDD patients than in healthy control subjects.Consistent with these results we found increased levels of Actinobacteria in CSDS-susceptible mice.

Nonetheless further studies on the anti-inflammatory and antidepressant actions of R-ketamine in the gut microbiota-brain axis will be needed.The present data do not provide direct evidence of the effect of gut microbiota on the antidepressant actions of R-ketamine because behavioral experiments using germ- free mice were not performed.

c.Altered composition in the gut bacteria at the class levelThe class levels of gut bacterium 4 days after a single dose of saline R-ketamine or S-ketamine are shown Fig.

c.Altered composition in the gut bacteria at the family level The family levels of gut bacterium 4 days after a single dose of saline R-ketamine or S-ketamine are shown Fig.

b.Altered composition in the gut bacteria at the genus level The genus levels of gut bacterium 4 days after a single dose of saline R-ketamine or S-ketamine are shown Fig.

Considering the possible role of the gut microbiota in the antidepressant actions of certain compounds it is likely that the gut microbiota-brain axis plays at least a partial role in robust antidepressant actions of R- ketamine.The precise mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of ketamine and R-ketamine are not fully understood.

Given the role of gut microbiota in the immune system- it is likely that anti- inflammatory action of R-ketamine might play a role in its antidepressant effects through the immunomodu- lation by the gut microbiota.
