previously in the nineteenth century antibodies were the first immu- nological molecules discovered in breast milk boosting the possibil- ity that human milk could have an influence on the development of children immune system.8 indeed human milk supplies an impressive array of immune-a ctive molecules metabolites oligosaccharides mi- crobial content vitamins and other nutrients that provide protection against infections and modulates mucosal immune responses.49 at this time more than 80 different autoimmune diseases have been de- scribed in which the leading role is characterized by an inappropriateam j reprod immunol.

human milk contains al- lergens allergen-specific immunoglobulins immune complexes and immunosuppressive cytokines that are transferred through the milk and might modify the immune response to allergens and decrease sus- ceptibility to immune-mediated disorders.123 a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study performed in 2016 by huang et al concluded that exclusive breastfeeding for 3-6 months and either partial or ex- clusive breastfeeding for more than 6 months were associated with significantly reduced risk of asthma.

more recently a meta-analysis proved that the risk of cd was significantly decreased in infants who were breastfed at the time of gluten introduction.105107 actually being breastfed at the time of gluten introduction was related with a latter onset of cd.100105107 interestingly intestinal dysbiosis may promote an abnormal response to gluten in predisposed individuals108 a fact that could be due to the role of specific bacteria in the modulation of infant's immune responses.109 however it is still not clear whether human milk truly provides permanent tolerance acquisition or just a symptomatic reduction and delayed diagnosis of cd.110 future stud- ies should investigate the effect of different intervention strategies in cd including nutrition immunomodulation and the role of the microbiome.111  breastfeeding and inflammatory bowel diseasesinflammatory bowel diseases ibd are known as a chronic inflamma- tory condition of the gastrointestinal tract manifesting has 2 majordisorders ulcerative colitis and crohn disease.112 the exact pathogen- esis of ibd remains unknown and part of the underlying mechanism is believed to be a deregulated host immune response to intestinal flora in genetically susceptible individuals.12113 the major risk for de- veloping ibd is having a family history of the disease.113 the greatest incidence of ibd is in early adulthood bolstering the fact that early exposures might force future susceptibility.

the protective role of human milk in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated ms could be related with its capacity of promot- ing the immune system development safeguarding from toxic agents and pathogens and modulation of immune responses9697 including immunomodulatory effects by interleukin il-10 production and the anti-inflammatory properties of transforming growth factor tgf-b.98  breastfeeding and celiac diseaseceliac disease cd is a systemic immune-mediated disorder caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing grains in genetically susceptible individuals.99 genetic background plays a crucial role in the predis- position to celiac disease100 although better long-term health was observed in cd patients who were breastfed.101 this fact may be due to the delayed introduction of gluten in daily diet and expanding the latency time between the introduction of gluten and the development of the disease102 lower incidence of gastrointestinal infections in the newborn who is breastfed103 and the prevention of gut dysbiosis.104 meta-analysis and systemic review including all studies between 1966 and 2004 found that infants who were breastfed had a 52 risk reduction in developing cd when compared with those who were not breastfed at the time of gluten introduction.105 hanson et al106 reported that cd was prevented when gluten was introduced in small doses during breastfeeding.

authors justified the earlier onset with the differences in ilar international league of associations for rheumatology categories observed between the groups with a higher proportion of psaera psoriatic arthritisenthesitis-related arthritis in the never-breastfed group which tend to present at a later age.83 the reason why human milk can influence the suscepti- bility to certain subtypes of jia is unknown although studies have related it with differences in microbiome between children with and without enthesitis-related arthritis.8384 indeed breastfeeding could be indirectly linked to jia by the gut microbiome as altered microbial profiles have been identified among jia patients.84 however further studies are needed to clarify the role of breastfeeding in jia disease risk.85  breastfeeding and rheumatoid arthritisrheumatoid arthritis ra is the most common autoimmune inflam- matory joint disease worldwide characterized by a distinctive pattern of bone and joint destruction.86 several studies have investigated the influence of breastfeeding and the risk of developing ra but the re- sults were inconsistent.87-89 an investigation performed by colebatch reported that in hla-dr4-negative children rheumatoid factor- positive infants were less likely to have been breastfed for 3 months when compared with rheumatoid factor-negative children although this effect was not seen in hla-dr4-positive infants.90 a recent meta-analysis by chen et al91 included 1672 patients with ra and aimed to estimate the association between breastfeeding and ra risk and an inverse association was found in the overall study population relating a decreased risk of ra no matter if breastfeeding was longer or shorter than 12 months.

breast milk and immune tolerancea healthy mucosal immune system is capable of distinguishing nutri- tional antigens and non-harmful microbes from pathogens promot- ing adequate immunological reactions by suppression of cellular and humoral immune responses to ingested antigens.

hormones immunoglobulins cytokines signal- ing molecules soluble receptors and inflammatory mediators.816 the high content of bioactive proteins evidenced that colostrum's main role is immunological rather than nutritional.17 antimicrobial factors present in human milk possess resistance to degradation by the new- born's digestive enzymes protecting the mucosal surfaces and elimi- nating pathogens without initiating inflammatory reactions while the immune system matures.18 furthermore the abundance and diver- sity of indigestible oligosaccharides promote the optimal microbiotacolonization which will condition future immune homeostasis.19 a few days after delivery tight junctions of the mammary epithelium start to close the rate of sodiumpotassium declines and the lactose con- centration rises indicating the secretory activation and production of transitional milk.

indeed previous studies related proper breast- feeding with a 24 decreased risk of t2d in childhood.74 according to earlier data a systematic review directly correlated the duration of breastfeeding and the risk of development of childhood t2d andobesity in neonates.75 more recently halipchuk et al76 performed a large retrospective case-control study to identify the factors associ- ated with the development of childhood-onset t2d and suggested that exclusive breastfeeding decreases the risk of development of childhood-onset type 2 diabetes.

conradi et al93 recently associated breastfeeding for at least 4 months as a protective factor against the risk of developing ms however other studies still debate the impact of breastfeeding du- ration in determining the risk for ms.94 applying data from a large multinational case-control study envims ragnedda et al95 described an increased risk of ms in males who were breastfed for less than 4 months.

two weeks postpartum the milk is considered fully mature.20 it is characterized by decreasing relative concentrations of the immunologically active molecules while the volume and nutri- tional requirements increase to fulfill the growing infant needs.213  breast milk and immune system modulation the postnatal period is crucial for the newborn's immune system maturation.

breast milk will not only nourish the newborn but also provide a complete arsenal of immune components that will contribute as protective factors and as devel- opment and maturation factors table 1. the protective factors are known to contribute against infections by providing direct immunity passive and immune regulatory effects based on anti-inflammatory capabilities.

they ensure the adequate environment in the infant's gastrointestinal tract by preventing microbiome dysbiosis therefore preserving the immune barrier functions of the epithelium.3334 the newborn immune system can be looked at as a very complex machine with amazing capabilities yet it does not know how to use it.

the de- velopment and maturation factors will promote as their name implies the maturation differentiation and development of the local immune system known as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue galt and the systemic immune system.
