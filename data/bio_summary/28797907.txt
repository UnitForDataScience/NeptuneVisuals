Although close we are not yet at this step and the field is competitive Studies in patients with PSC with or without IBD in different countries show that some of the findings are sometimes only partly reproduced from a study to another that result may differ between the fecal microbiota and the mucosa associated microbiota and that confound- ing factors have to be carefully taken into account Of note UDCA influenced the microbiota in patients with PBC while it did not seem to do so in patients with PSC Among potential explanation one must remember that those studies are performed at the genus level and that modifications of specific bacterial species for example those sensitive to bile salt concentration and those involved in bile acid metabolism would be far better described using more dedicated tools.

recently pioneered in the field of fecal microbiota disturbances during primary biliary cholangitisPBC.

They disclosed a microbial signature of PBC and reported that during ursodeoxycholic acid UDCA treat- ment which is known to improve survival of patients with PBC the PBC-associated dysbiosis was partially reversed As a first step they showed differences in the fecal microbiota from 60 PBC patients naive from UDCA com- pared to the one from 80 healthy controls.

In a second step the authors assessed the effect of UDCA therapy on fecal microbial pro- file in 37 patients with PBC who provided fecal samples2210-7401c 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Some of them could be for example linked to modification of bile secretion other to severity of hepatic lesions or dysfunctions.A reduction of biodiversity has been reported in IBD cirrhosis PSC and now PBC Of note these char- acteristics should not be considered as a prerequisite to diagnose dysbiosis as there are some contra-examples in literature such as vaginosis where dysbiosis includes an increased diversity Reduction of fecal concentration or proportions of Faecalibacterium reported here in PBC is also a common feature of several diseases including IBD and PSC Important research efforts are made on this bac- terium which dominates the healthy microbiota.

In brief the gut microbiota richness was significantly reduced in PBC patients.

To explore the potential ability of a fecal microbial signature to discriminate patient with PBC from healthy subjects authors constructed a random Forest model based on PBC-associated genera.

Indeed it exhibits anti-inflammatory properties in the gastrointesti- nal tract not only because it produces butyrate but also the MAM protein Interestingly for clinicians low fecal concentrations of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii have been associated with a high risk of recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery or after cessation of anti-TNF treatmentThis cannot yet be assessed in clinical practice and the predictive value of tests based on these ecological charac- teristics has to be evaluated.Will those disease ecological markers be confirmed in different populations worldwide Will the model proposed here or other ones based on microbial profiles help solving unmet needs for example identifying subgroups of patients with different responses to treatment predict treatment response At least such ecological data should be under- stood as and used as bioindicators of the gut environment.
