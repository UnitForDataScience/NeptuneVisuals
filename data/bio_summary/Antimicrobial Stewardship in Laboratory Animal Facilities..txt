Laboratory animal personnel must take respon- sibility for the judicious use of antibiotics in research animals to protect vivarium personnel reduce resistant bacteria in the environment preserve antibiotic efficacy for research use and treat laboratory animals with bacterial infections that warrant antibiotics.Reduce Antibiotic Use in Research AnimalsOne of the biggest contributors to antimicrobial resistance is the use of antibiotics when they are not warranted.11727 In human medicine antibiotics are frequently prescribed for res- piratory disease caused by viruses especially in children.11727 Clinical disease from viruses is rare in research animals to- day.1119 And some antibiotic use in research animals is for diagnosed bacterial infections.13-1533 However antibiotics also are administered empirically to research animals.11202232 AMS dictates that diagnostics should be performed when consider- ing antibiotic use in laboratory animals.110172627 The diagnosis of bacterial infections in research animals is outside the scope of the current overview but generally speaking the presence identification and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria should be investigated--and ideally confirmed--before antibiotics are prescribed.

If the MIC is not achieved then infection will not be controlled and animals potentially will be treated for an extended period of time with antibiotics that exert selective pressure on bacterial populations favoring resistance.18202231 In veterinary medicine antibiotics are commonly used in surgery and intensive care internal medicine and dermatol- ogy.210 Skin conditions dermatitis and traumatic wounds from fighting account for a significant proportion of disease in mice and NHP.11192332 In fact dermatitis is the most common clinical condition in some mouse colonies.1923 Guidance from small animal veterinary practice encourages topical rather than systemic antibiotics for focal surface lesions like the majority of skin lesions dermatitis and fight wounds in research rodents.23 Ocular lesions rank just behind skin lesions in incidence in some mouse colonies.19 Eye infections should likewise be treated with topical antimicrobials given that the eye is difficult to reach with systemic medication.11 Localized infections for exampleabscesses should be treated by using incision and drainage concurrent antibiotics are usually unnecessary.1124 If surgeries are performed aseptically but antibiotic coverage is desired then topical antibiotic ointment can be mixed with a local anes- thetic and applied to surgical incisions for the first few days after surgery see the Replacement section for further discussion of prophylactic perioperative antibiotics.8 Large lab animals such as NHP and dogs are usually treated with injectable antibiotics a long-acting single-dose injectable antibiotic formulation has recently been advocated.1332 Extensive traumatic lesions and generalized infections especially those in immunocompromised animals may warrant systemic antibiotics.1332But if systemic antibiotics are administered then they should be provided for the shortest time that is clinically appropriate there is no minimum duration of treatment necessary for an- tibiotics.112182736 The patient's total exposure to the antibiotic should be limited both to minimize perturbations to normal flora and physiology and to decrease the risk of selecting for resistant bacteria.141831 Recent research has shown that short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses for infections in several organ systems.112172736 Some research has advocated reevaluation of the patient ideally with repeat diagnostics on day 3 of antibiotic treatment.18 Professional judgement of the status of the patient and the clinical con- sequences of the infection should be paramount rather than compliance with standard antibiotic regimens.1836 Further study of antibiotic treatment duration is needed especially in animals in which prolonged antibiotic courses are often prescribed.1036 Systemic administration of antimicrobials to research animals should be infrequent and reserved for systemic or severe dis- ease preferably with diagnosed susceptible bacteria.Replace Antibiotics in Research AnimalsEven when diagnostic test results support antibiotic adminis- tration there are good reasons to be circumspect about the use of even topical antibiotics.

The contribution of the microbiome to the phenotype of disease is increasingly recognized as important.45 The microbiome of the gut for example is now thought to mod- ulate the development of obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease chronic conditions that are increasingly prevalent.45 The endogenous flora of mammalian research animals is in- fluenced by how they are derived by housing and husbandry and by exposure to xenobiotics foreign chemical substances including antimicrobial drugs.45 Because of the interaction and competition between bacterial populations changes in bacterial levels in antibiotic-treated animals are not limited to those that are susceptible to the administered agent.17 Treat- ment with antibiotics leads to transient and sustained shifts in host immunity and physiology.4517 Although engineered mice with genes altered by antibiotics such as tetracycline-inducible lines continue to be propagated researchers today are turning to more sophisticated mechanisms of induction.30 Gene expres- sion can be manipulated by using nonantibiotic drugs such as tamoxifen or by incorporating drug-free genome-editing tech- nologies.30 Whereas antibiotics might be used less frequently in genetically engineered animals investigators might begin to incorporate antibiotics into their studies to modify and study the microbiome and its contribution to our modern plagues4 or they may simply become sensitized to the profound effect antibiotics might have on their research.45 The clinical use of antibiotics in research animals may come to be seen as an unac- ceptable variable in research.Refine the Use of Antibiotics in Research AnimalsWhen antibiotics are used how they are used is important.

Small bottles of hand sanitizer should be provided in animal holding areas for use by veterinary technicians veteri- narians and investigators handling animals Table 1 in reference 21 is a useful catalog of hand hygiene products.Resistant bacteria are frequently recovered from hand-touch sites which are often over-looked in favor of cleaning general surfaces such as floors.3 Surfaces in the animal facility that are handled frequently such as door handles and panels and micro- scope knobs should be sanitized with noncorrosive disinfectants at least once daily.3 Washable computer keyboards should be used in clinical areas and they should be disinfected frequently.3 The need for personnel hygiene and zealous sanitation cannot be overstated because humans are sources of resistant and potentially dangerous bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.35Infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria in laboratory animals are probably underreported but conditions in most vivaria are ripe for colonization and spread.2235 Laboratory animals are frequently mixed and have close contact with hu- mans they may have varying degrees of immunodeficiency invasive devices and implants may be used and antibiotics may be used or overused.2235 There have been several reports of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and other drug-resistant bacteria in large lab animals pigs and NHP in the last decade915163335 and reports in rodents cannot be far behind.

pseudointermedius and E. coli producing extended-spectrum b-lactamase are important pathogens in dogs and cats.10 The presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is concerning both from the standpoint of interspecies transmission and disease and because these infections may impel veterinarians to prescribe antimicrobials that are important in human medi- cine.1036 For example a recent report on methicillin-resistantaureus in NHP relates isolate susceptibility to rifampin and vancomycin valuable antibiotics in humans that should not be overused.9 Unfortunately many antibiotics that are deemed 'critically important' for human use are used routinely in vet- erinary medicine.1036 An extended-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin was recently proposed for use in NHP and dogs used in research.1332 Another study reports the resistance of Shigella flexneri Yersinia enterocolitica Y. pseudotuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni all zoonotic bacteria isolated from NHP to several antibiotics but not yet to the fluoroquinolones used most commonly to treat them.15 Fluoroquinolones are popular veterinary drugs and their use has been linked to increased incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.1017 Efforts should be made to categorize antimicrobials used in animals to guide veterinary prescribers so that antibiotics important in human medicine are not overused .1036Aside from restrictions on the use of some antibiotics in food- producing animals the censorship of antimicrobial prescription has not been undertaken in veterinary medicine in the United States.1036 In contrast other countries have taken initiatives to control antibiotic use in animals that are not raised for food.10 For example Sweden restricts the use of both third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones to situations in which bacteria are resistant to all other veterinary-licensed antimi- crobials.10ConclusionPersonnel caring for laboratory animals face competing ob- ligations relative to antibiotic use.

Email of America.17 These programs focus on education and include modifying antibiotic prescriptions where appropriate.1727 Multidisciplinary teams including pharmacists microbiolo- gists epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists review antibiotic use in the population they support.1727 AMS teams may modify antibiotic dosages restrict the prescription of overused or valuable antimicrobials and recommend alterna- tives.1727 Antibiograms provide epidemiologic data to inform antibiotic use.27 Cumulative antibiograms are lists of clinically significant bacterial isolates that are obtained from a specified patient population over a defined time period and the antibiotic susceptibilities of the local bacteria.27 AMS is a relatively new concept in veterinary medicine.102636 The use of antimicrobials as growth promoters in food animals has been scrutinized for contributing to the colonization and spread of resistant bacte- ria.117 Recent articles encourage companion animal practitioners to adopt AMS practices including formalized programs in veterinary hospitals.1026 Studies have shown that education about bacterial resistance and AMS is effective in reducing the frequency and duration of antibiotic prescriptions and in curtailing inappropriate use regardless of whether formalized AMS programs are implemented.101727Antimicrobial use in laboratory animals was reviewed 2 decades ago.24 That review focused on the interference of antimicrobials with research studies the complexities of dose extrapolation to small laboratory animals such as mice and adverse side effects of antibiotics such as enterocolitis in rab- bits and some rodent species for example hamsters.24 Many specific examples of drug interactions and research effects were provided and questionable uses of antibiotics in research ani- mals including empirical and unnecessary prophylactic use were addressed.24 Despite these words of caution antimicrobial use in both rodents71114202230 and large animal species for example dogs13 pigs33 and NHP1532 is commonplace today.

Antimicrobials are used in laboratory animals to treat clinical disease to protect populations that may be vulnerable to infection and in research projects including studies of the microbiome and to influence expression in genetically engineered animals.

Two studies have cast doubt regarding the efficacy of antibiot- ics to treat bacterial infection when administered enterally in the food or water to mice.2022 Importantly antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been recovered recently from pigs and NHP used in research.915163335The '3 Rs' of Replace Reduce and Refine--a mnemonic frequently espoused in the laboratory animal field in regard to the use of animals in research--was recently used to sup- port the principles of AMS in the veterinary literature.1026 A '5 Rs' approach to AMS was advocated adding Review and Responsibility to the better known Rs.1026 The current overview explores how to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in laboratory animals particularly rodents the species most commonly used in research.

Historically antibiotic dose has been based on the minimum inhibitory concentration MIC31 which is the lowest concentra- tion of antibiotic that is expected to effectively inhibit bacterial growth.31 But the MIC for any given antibiotic reflects carefully controlled conditions and a steady-state drug concentration and does not account for the selection for resistant bacteria thatmight occur before steady-state concentrations are achieved.18 In this era of resistant 'bugs' the MIC may underestimate the drug dose needed to control an infection especially at sequestered sites such as the lung and CNS.18 In addition the MIC for most antibiotics is based on studies in humans the high metabolic rates of small lab animals such as rodents might make achiev- ing the MIC for many drugs challenging.2024 Efforts should be made to treat infections as soon as possible and to maximize the antibiotic dose and efficacy for the initial bacterial kill either to eradicate the bacteria at the site of infection or to decrease the bacteria to levels that the animal's immune system can fight off.18 Mice and rats treated with antibiotics typically show few noticeable toxic effects possibly because they are relatively resistant to the effects of the antibiotic-associated clostridial overgrowth that is so devastating to other rodents and rabbits.24 But whenever antibiotics are used animals should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity and adverse drug effects.2427The specific characteristics of the antibiotic should inform how it is administered see reference 18 for a list of antibiotic classes and their pharmacodynamic characteristics.182031 Al- though some antibiotics like sulfonamides are time-dependent with their efficacy dependent on the duration that the plasma levels of the drug exceed the MIC for the organism being treated concentration-dependent antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones rely on the peak plasma concentration of the antibiotic for ef- ficacy.18202231 Whereas enteral dosing in the feed and water may be effective for time-dependent antibiotics parenteral injectable bolus dosing is more appropriate for concentration- dependent antibiotics.20 Two research groups investigated the enteral administration of commonly used antibiotics both time and concentration-dependent in mice and both found that the plasma antibiotic levels from water20 and feed22 do not achieve the MIC for any but the most sensitive of bacteria.

Delivery in the food or water is an attractive mode of administration for research rodents because handling for topical or parenteral therapy is inefficient stressful for the animals and may disrupt research.2022 But for administration through the water or food to be effective the drug has to be soluble in the water which may be treated or processed and evenly distributed throughout the food.2022 Whereas sick rodents may drink or eat less than their healthy counterparts animals treated enterally have to drink or eat sufficient amounts to attain plasma levels of the drug that will combat infection.2022 In addition a rodent medicated through the water or feed either has to be singly housed a practice that has been shown to negatively affect immunity and wound healing28 or cage-mates without clinical disease will ingest antibiotics unnecessarily in the water or feed provided to the cage.
