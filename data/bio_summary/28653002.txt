NGM3 n11 samples showed depletion of Bifidobacteria Lactobacillus Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia and an increased relative risk of multisensitised atopy at age 2 years and parental-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 4 years.

At 6 months of age the infant microbiome no longer fitted to these three states but rather fitted two that did not associate with multi sensitized atopy.

Although the relative risk for multi-sensitized atopy was higher in neonates identified as NGM3 infants identified as NGM1 13 out of 70 and NGM2 13 out of 49 still developed the condition and a significant proportion of those identified as NGM3 did not develop disease 511.

A separate study analyzing the fecal microbiota of children aged 3 months found similar depletion of bacterial taxa to be associated with atopy 6 and bacterial depletion by early-life antibiotic treatment has been associated with allergic asthma developmentHepatoBiliary Surgery and Nutrition Vol 6 No 3 June 2017191ABFigure 1 Summary of features of early life microbiota reported by Fujimura et al.

One of these conformations was significantly associated with higher risk of developing atopy an allergic hypersensitization predisposing individuals to asthma 4 but was only detectable in children under 6 months of age.

studied a cohort of 298 children whose fecal bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed at one month of age n130 termed neonates andor at six months of age n168 termed infants.

Between individual children the bacterial and fungal communities became increasingly different to each other with age indicative of the establishment of a diverse community which is to large degree specific to individuals.To identify signatures associated with atopy Fujimura et al.

Given the instability of the microbiome in early life it's possible that a single time-point may not reflect significant periods in which the microbiome may fluctuate in different states.

highlights that analyzing the composition of the microbiome in the neonatal period could be critical to identifying associations with multi sensitized atopy.
