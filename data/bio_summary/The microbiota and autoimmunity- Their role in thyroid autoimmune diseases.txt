Hopefully results will answer these questions and provide insight into the influ- ence of environmental factors on gene-microbe interactions and the potential role of intestinal bacteria in the onset and progression of Graves' disease.FundingThis work was supported by People Marie Sklodowska-Curie Ac- tions Marie Curie Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways grant agreement number 612116.Declaration of interestAll authors declare that they have no competing interests.References.2..8.8.8...0.....2.7.........6.9.3.0...1.2...9.0....3.1.1..4..0..8.5.1.

Current mechanisms suggested to lead to autoimmune processes after a bacterial infection include molecular mimicry epitope spreading bystander activation and cryptic antigens .In autoimmune thyroid diseases AITD especially Hashimoto thy- roiditis HT and Graves' disease GD evidence for possible bacterial involvement in onset and progression is based solely on retrospective measures of bacterial antibodies in AITD patients .

An understanding of the precise mechanisms of interaction between bacterial agents in inducing thyroid autoimmunity could result in the development of new strategies for prevention and treatment.This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the role of themicrobiota in thyroid autoimmunity and will focus on the bacterial component.Autoimmune thyroid diseaseAutoimmune disorders are a broad range of related diseases in which inappropriate immune responses of the body arise against its own cells tissue and organs resulting in inflammation and damage.

The bacterial communities in these sites may have po- tential impact on AITD and to assess this a precise characterization of the bacterial diversity and metabolic profile of commensal bacteria from healthy persons is needed.Due to its high vascularity good lymphatic drainage encapsulated po- sition and its generation of hydrogen peroxide for the synthesis of thyroid hormone the thyroid is remarkably resistant to infection and is rarely in- fected .

Role of bacteria in autoimmune thyroid disease publications on this topic focusing on the five most cited bacterial organisms.such as in autoimmune thyroiditis or may be systemic such as sys- temic lupus erythematosus.
