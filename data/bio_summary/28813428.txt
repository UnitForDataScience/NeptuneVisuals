On the other hand although the highest lead concentrations were measured in ornithogenic soils of sites located in the Antarctic Peninsula CC CU and RO when the rest of samples were considered lead did not clearly show higher concentrations in ornithogenic soils of other locations compared to less penguin affected soils .shows a principal component analysis for the physical variables and the most signifi- cant chemical element concentrations of all soil samples.

The highest Fe Mn concentrations are found in ultrabasic igneous rocks followed by basic rocks gabbro and basalt whereas sedimentary rocks are especially poor in As Se and heavy metals.The significance of background levelsThe analysis of the concentrations of metals and other pollutants requires background infor- mation for each particular site since soil parameters including the concentrations of different chemical elements can vary significantly at relatively small spatial scales especially in volcanic areas as those widely spread over the maritime Antarctic.

Even if differential bioaccumulation could exist between these two penguins' species the increasing of elementary concentrations in ornitho- genic soils depends not only on this bioaccumulation but also on the dropping through pen- guin excrements.Consequences for soil microbiota in the rookeriesConcerning the composition of the soil microbiota we performed a molecular study of soil samples collected in 4 different areas Chinstrap penguin rookeries from Deception Island CV MB PE and PM.

This shows the strong influence of penguin drooping on the relative bacterial abundance shaping the bacterial soil community.Although we have demonstrated that the areas most influenced by penguins also present higher concentrations of the biotransported elements it is likely that the main changes pro- moted in the soil microbiota are determined by the extraordinary supply of faecal bacteria with penguins excrements which totally alters the relative abundance of soil bacterial taxa within the community but cannot be specifically attributed to increased organic or metal con- tent but instead to direct dropping with penguin faeces.These ornithogenic soils enriched with guano-derived compounds generally present low CN ratio values   which may be due to the presence of high levels of inorganic N forms .

Some observed very low CN ratios in analysed soil samples also suggest different ratesof transformation of the organic matter and mineral nitrogen in the guano deposits by soil microbiota .ConclusionsOur current findings demonstrate that penguins do transfer organic and inorganic nutrients metals and other elements mainly As Cd Cu Se and Zn from the sea to the terrestrial eco- system being an important pathway system for pollutant transport to Antarctic coastal areas.

In addition to demonstrating that penguins act as metal biotransporters our study has identified a which elements are increased to higher concentrations in the rookeries b in which sites this increase has exceeded the background levels generating biogenic pollutionwhat are the differences existing between the two analyzed penguin species and d what consequences this enrichment has for the soil microbiota.Elements accumulated in rookeriesEven though ICP analyses allowed for the sequential determination of many elements among those elements analysed our focus was posed on the concentrations of potential harmful ele- ments that can be associated to anthropogenic pollution mainly As Cd Cu Pb and although they can be considered as micronutrients also Zn and Se.

We obtained concentrations above the background levels but much lesser than those recorded in polluted sites close to Antarctic research stations  or areas used during the 'Heroic Age' of Antarctic exploration .Therefore Zn concentration may be higher than expected because of the penguins' activity but without generating strong local contaminations.Summarizing as the PCA and other analyses shows the association of elements with factors can be indicated by natural geogenic and pedogenic characteristics and animal influences BEF.

How- ever in our samples As values are in the same level of magnitude as the baseline concentrations proposed for different Antarctic sites  and far away for the extreme values obtained in sites with a distinctive magmatic evolution as Murature Beach in Deception Island .Arsenic concentrations recorded in highly contaminated sites in Fildes Peninsula by Padeiro et al.

Contrastingly local factors as shown by the PE site showing the highest pollution in the place nearest to the most intense ship traffic Data for rookeries and background levels of metal concentrations mg Kg-1 in the different study sites located in the South Shetland Islands.Metal concentrations for rookeries out from the background range are in bold  the 95 confidence interval is below the background range  the 95 confidence interval is above the background range.and the Byers Peninsula and Macaroni Point rookeries farther from ship routes displaying the lowest concentrations of pollutants can be more important.
