this shows the strong influence of penguin drooping on the relative bacterial abundance shaping the bacterial soil community.although we have demonstrated that the areas most influenced by penguins also present higher concentrations of the biotransported elements it is likely that the main changes pro- moted in the soil microbiota are determined by the extraordinary supply of faecal bacteria with penguins excrements which totally alters the relative abundance of soil bacterial taxa within the community but cannot be specifically attributed to increased organic or metal con- tent but instead to direct dropping with penguin faeces.these ornithogenic soils enriched with guano-derived compounds generally present low cn ratio values   which may be due to the presence of high levels of inorganic n forms .

on the other hand although the highest lead concentrations were measured in ornithogenic soils of sites located in the antarctic peninsula cc cu and ro when the rest of samples were considered lead did not clearly show higher concentrations in ornithogenic soils of other locations compared to less penguin affected soils .shows a principal component analysis for the physical variables and the most signifi- cant chemical element concentrations of all soil samples.

there clustering by the microbial community fingerprinting coin- cides with that given by the relative abundance of c n and p as markers of penguin affection of soils showing that penguin influence also shapes the composition of the soil microbial community.it is widely accepted that the intensity of each dgge band can be directly related to the rel- ative abundance of the population of each bacterial taxon so that we can also relate the relative intensity of the different bands once sequenced with penguin influence on the shaping of the soil bacterial community.

up to 46 soil samples were taken from the upper 10-15 cm layer at 10 different locations and  distributed all within the maritime antarctic region covering penguin breeding colonies rookeries of the genus pygoscelis either of gentoo p. papua forster 1781 or chinstrap p. antarctica forster 1781 penguins.these penguin species are characterized by their wide distribution not exclusively antarc- tic being also present in sub-antarctic areas and in the case of gentoo penguin even in list of samples collected in each site and sample design applied.patagonia.

even if differential bioaccumulation could exist between these two penguins' species the increasing of elementary concentrations in ornitho- genic soils depends not only on this bioaccumulation but also on the dropping through pen- guin excrements.consequences for soil microbiota in the rookeriesconcerning the composition of the soil microbiota we performed a molecular study of soil samples collected in 4 different areas chinstrap penguin rookeries from deception island cv mb pe and pm.

the highest fe mn concentrations are found in ultrabasic igneous rocks followed by basic rocks gabbro and basalt whereas sedimentary rocks are especially poor in as se and heavy metals.the significance of background levelsthe analysis of the concentrations of metals and other pollutants requires background infor- mation for each particular site since soil parameters including the concentrations of different chemical elements can vary significantly at relatively small spatial scales especially in volcanic areas as those widely spread over the maritime antarctic.

touristic site scientific station specially protected site are also listed with the sampled penguin rookeries highlighted in bold.in this study we sampled different penguin rookeries located in deglaciated areas  of the maritime antarctic region in order to analyse the concentration of chemical elements in surface soils and to describe the associated soil microbiota.

potential differences in element biotransport trends due to geographical south shetland islands vs antarctic peninsula and biological effects two penguin species gentoo penguin vs chinstrap penguin were also tested.

in bold the most penguin affected soils cv2 cv  cv4 and cv7 note that they cluster together.our study provides evidences to the insights of other recent papers where the increase of cer- tain element concentrations in ice-free antarctic soils due to penguin influence is suggested .

in addition to demonstrating that penguins act as metal biotransporters our study has identified a which elements are increased to higher concentrations in the rookeries b in which sites this increase has exceeded the background levels generating biogenic pollutionwhat are the differences existing between the two analyzed penguin species and d what consequences this enrichment has for the soil microbiota.elements accumulated in rookerieseven though icp analyses allowed for the sequential determination of many elements among those elements analysed our focus was posed on the concentrations of potential harmful ele- ments that can be associated to anthropogenic pollution mainly as cd cu pb and although they can be considered as micronutrients also zn and se.

the purpose of these additional analyses was to assess if the eutrophication and the enrichment in certain pollutants related to the presence of penguin colonies could also drive changes in the soil microbial community and whether this was affected by biological contamination from penguin excreta.

in order to avoid any possible bias due to the distance and geological features among the sam- pling sites the study of the soil microbiota was centred on samples from deception island which present similar soils and thus the differential effect of penguins on soil microbiota can be tested.for dna extraction and purification 1 gram of each fresh melted sample was processed using a commercially available kit e.z.n.a.tm soil dna kits omega bio-tek following the manufacturer's protocol.

contrastingly in non- ornithogenic soils even though they are also somewhat affected by penguin dropping as being in marginal areas of the rookeries faecal bacteria share their dominance with a much more diverse soil community dominated by typical soil actinobacteria actinomycetales.

contrastingly our study shows that the non-ornithogenic soils of the marginal areas of the chinstrap penguin rookeries even they are somewhat affected by penguin activity show a much more diverse bacterial community in which typical soil.
