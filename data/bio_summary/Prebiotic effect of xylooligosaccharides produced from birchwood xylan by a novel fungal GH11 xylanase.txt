The capacity of the enzyme for converting xylan into xylooligosaccharides was evaluated and the prebiotic potential of the resultant XOS mixtures demonstrated.Material and methodsMaterials5 ml-HiTrap QFF cartridge SuperdexTM 75 10300 GL column and Low Molecular Weight Gel Filtration Kit 17-0442-01 were purchased from GE Healthcare Chicago IL USA.Beechwood and birchwood xylan Avicel glucose cellobiose carboxymethylcellulose nitrophenyl NP substrates and Coomas- sie Brilliant Blue R-250 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA.

The peaks were found as MNa and MK adducts in the positive mode B and as M H- and MCl- adducts in the negative mode C. The presence of xylose 173.04 mz glucose 203.05 mz xylobiose 305.08 mz 321.05 mz xylotriose 437.20 mz 453.09 mz and xylotetraose 569.16 mz was confirmed in agreementwith the previous results obtained by HPAEC-PAD A.

The enzyme was purified characterized and used to produce a mixture of xylooligosaccharides XOS from birchwood xylan.

The first type of hemicellulases cut the xylan backbone into soluble oligosaccha- rides XOS which can be depolymerized to xylose by the action of b-xylosidases .

The enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan is carried out by endoxylanases a broad group of glycosidases that according to the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database CAZy  are distributed among the families GH8 GH10 GH11 GH30 GH43 and GH51.

The standard reaction mixture consisted of 2.5 xylan 50 mM sodium acetate AcONa buffer pH 5 and the appropriate dilution of the purified enzyme or culture crude extract.

The compounds selected for the assay were KCl MgSO4 CaCl2 BaCl2 MnCl2 FeSO4 CoCl2 NiSO4 CuSO4 AgNO3 ZnSO4HgCl2 PbNO32 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA and 2- mercaptoethanol 2-ME.Substrate specificityXynM activity was tested against other substrates apart from xylan in order to study its specificity.

The enzyme activity was also measured against 20 mM of the disaccharide cellobiose and the polysaccharides Avicel and carboxymethylcellulose at final concentrations of 10 and 20 gl respectively.The kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of beechwood xylan by XynM were determined.

The endoxylanase-inducer effect of 1 glucose 1 Avicel or 1 2 or 3 beechwood xylan in 6 day-old cultures was assayed Fig.

The thermal and end-product inhibition of XynM as well as the decrease of accessible hydrolytic sites in the polysac- charide may explain the stagnation of the global yield  .The maximum output of neutral XOS 28.8 is expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of birchwood xylan and was cal- culated from the sum of the concentrations of uncharged XOS from Xyl2 to Xyl6 measured from HPAEC-PAD .
