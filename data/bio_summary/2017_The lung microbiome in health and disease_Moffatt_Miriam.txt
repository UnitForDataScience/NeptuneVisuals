Carl Woese and others during the late 1970s pioneered sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal 16S rRNA gene rrnA to address bacterial phylogeny.56 This gene was particularly suitable because ribosomes are a conserved component of the transcriptional apparatus of all DNA-based life forms.The gene comprises nine constant regions C and nine hypervariable regions V1-V9.7 The variable regions enable sequence-specific discrimination between different bacteria.

For CF there are more than 2000known mutations of the gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR making stratification of microbial findings by genotype other than D508 daunting.Of interest is that restitution of CFTR function withivacaftor modified the microbiome presumably for the better.32 For idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF the most-common mutation in the gene encoding Mucin 5BMuc5B was found to be associated with the total levels burden of bacteria present.33 More interesting perhaps is the recent study of the Fucosyltransferase 2 FUT2 genotype in non-CF bronchiectasis and its impact on P. aeruginosa dominance of the microbiota present.34 For asthma it is notable that the genetic risk factors identified by genome- wide association studies are expressed by or within the respiratory epithelium perhaps reflecting the importanceof the respiratory microbiome.35 Understanding more about host-microbiome interactions could follow from comparing gene expression in airway samples to microbial communities in various diseases.MetagenomicsAlmost all respiratory microbiome studies to date have relied only on sequencing the 16S rRNA gene.
