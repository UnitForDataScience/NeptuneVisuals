a significant difference between the mean number of antibiotics received per patient per risa cluster was detected anova p  2.2 10-05. patients of clus- ter iip dominated by pn sputa received significantly less antibiotics than patients of clusters ip and iiip tukey hsd tests iiip versus ip p  0.05 iiip versus iip p  1 10-04. however only patients of cluster iip received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid .

finally the incidence of confounding factors such as antibiotic therapies and clinical characteristics of the patients on the risa datasets was investigated.experimental proceduresethic statementethic approval for this study was granted by the commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertes cnil under the reference 913442. samples were those from routine bacteriological analyses of cf patients and did not require any additional obligation.

the pp microbiota were composed of 64.8 of shared risa bands that one could consider the core species of this group of patients and the pn microbiota were found to share risa bands at about 39.6 chi2 test p  8.4 10-05.a dendrogram was computed to compare the 104 risa profiles from the pp and pn sputa .

however clones were most often restricted to a single cluster of risa profiles exception for clone g. clone e was recovered from two patients which shared closely related risa profiles .analysis of confounding factorsthe effects of factors other than the presence of p. aeruginosa that might have contributed to the observed risa profiles were investigated.

significant differences p0.05 between the pp and pn groups were detected by univariate wilcoxon mann-whitney statistical tests while considering reads of each otu identified per genera with n otu  5 per genera see materials and methods for the computing and for the number of reads per genera and variance analyses of read numbers per otu among a genus.doi10.1371journal.pone.0173022.g001cluster iip was significantly richer than the other two with a mean of 10.43 risa bands per sample whereas clusters ip and iiip had means of 6.53 and 5.43 risa bands per sample respectively steel dwass tests iip vs iiip p  1.1 10-04 iip vs ip p  2.49 10-02. no signifi- cant difference was found in the its richness of clusters ip and iiip p  7.9 10-01. in the same way the cluster iip was the most diverse shannon index steel dwass tests iip vs ipp  4.05 10-02 iip vs iiip p  1.1 10-04 simpson d index steel dwass tests iip vs ip p  4.5 10-02 iip vs iiip p  1.14 10-04. no significant difference between the diversity indices ofhierarchical clustering of risa profiles obtained from 104 independent cf sputa dna extracts.

all risa profiles obtained from the 52 pp sputa harbored the p. aeruginosa its peak with a length of560.15 pb sd  0.55. comparisons of mean numbers of risa bands per sample suggested the pp profiles to have a lower richness than those of the pn sputa mean of 6.6 versus 10.8 risa bands  sample student t-test p  1.6 10-04. indeed pp and pn microbiota presented respectively a total of 94 and 154 risa bands.

cf patients of cluster iip had received significantly less antibiotics than patients of clusters ip and iiip but harbored the most resistant p. aerugi- nosa strains.

however as for patients with respiratory disorders like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd studies based onnon-cultural analysis showed the presence of complex lung microbiota in cf patients -.

maltophilia on the patients' status remains unclear  these results highlighted an associa- tion andor succession between two non-fermenting cf pathogens in cf lungs that should be followed by clinicians.in this study a negative correlation between the presence of pseudomonas and haemophilus was observed and confirmed previous reports .

in our study patients from cluster iiip received more antibiotic treatments and in particular tobra- mycin and colistin aerosol both targeting p. aeruginosa than patients from cluster ip leading to the hypothesis that the nature of the antibiotic treatments could have divided the pseudomo- nas risa profiles into two clusters ip and iiip.

third clinical status and particularly cf exacerbation can induce significant changes in the cf microbiota and lead to andor result from an evolution from a stable to a disturbed state .among factors leading to modifications in the structure of cf microbiota several bacterial properties that favor microbial interactions have been proposed.

the significance of factors such as age antibiotic therapies and presence of p. aeruginosa on the structuration of risa datasets was evaluated by a redundancy rda analysis.resultsv5-v6 rrs meta-taxogenomic analysis of cf sputacf sputa were recovered from 104 patients.

other genera such as streptococcus and staphylococcus did not reveal significant differences in the distribu- tion of their respective otus.risa of individual cf sputum dna extracts and clusteringall individual 104 dna extracts from cf sputa were analyzed by risa .
