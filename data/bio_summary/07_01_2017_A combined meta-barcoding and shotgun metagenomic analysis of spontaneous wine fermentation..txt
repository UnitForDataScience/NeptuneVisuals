following sequencing and barcode and adap- tor trimming 8.8 million reads were assigned across the samples table s1 with an average of over 100 000 reads per sample.to consistently describe and compare the number of opera- tional taxonomic units otus across the samples all 8.8 million reads were first analyzed as a large single batch.

the weightings of each reference genome are overlaid on the plot with the size of the gray circles around each node proportional to the total abundance of each reference genome across all of the samples no shading for nodes 10.comparing the shotgun metagenomic values obtained for the 4 control experiments to those expected from the estimated numbers of input cells showed that the outcomes of the shotgun analysis were within 2-fold of each other in all but 2 cases and that they were highly correlated with the its results r2  0.99 table .when multidimensional analysis principal coordinate anal- ysis pcoa using bray-curtis distances was used to compare the shotgun samples the presence of high amounts of hanse- niaspora spp.

this reference sequence was divided up into discrete windows of 10 kb using bedtools2 v. 2.24.0 makewindows -w 10 000 .each of the filtered shotgun datasets was then aligned to this reference set using bowtie2 in paired-end mode with un- aligned reads saved for later analysis -fr -maxins 1500 -no- disconcordant -no-unal -un-conc .

these iden- tity values were generally above 99 for the reference genomes but were found to be significantly lower for reference sequences including mucor circinelloides pseudomonas syringae and hanse- niaspora valbyensis suggesting that the actual species or strains present in the fermentation were significantly different than the reference used fig.

mildly fermentative yeasts such as hanseniaspora uvarum candida stellata metschnikowia pulcherrima torulaspora delbrueckii and lachancea thermotolerans can proliferate and survive well into the fermentation but fall in numbers as ethanol levels increase al- though it has been reported that c. stellata can survive up to 12 ethanol and complete fermentation 2-5.despite the vastly higher numbers of non-saccharomyces yeasts early in the fermentation process the major wine yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for the bulk of the ethano- lic fermentation.

in addition to coverage values the average identity of each mapped read was calculated for each window using cus- tom scripts that counted the number of mismatches per read bowtie2 xm tag for each read compared to overall read length.de novo metagenomic assemblyfor the assembly of uncultivated sequences that were unrep- resented in early versions of the shotgun reference collection reads that failed to align during the shotgun metagenomic anal- ysis were de novo assembled using spades v. 3.5.0 -sc -careful .

final results were assembled in qiime tabular format using custom scripts table s2.multidimensional data analysis was performed with the r phyloseq package  using pcoa and bray curtis dissimilarity measures based upon the 30 most abundant otus across the samples.shotgun metagenomics analysisdna from 4 control populations and 16 fermentation samples from 2 wineries were subjected to whole-genome metagenomic sequencing.

dereplicated otus were then clustered using swarm -z-differences 1 -fastidious  with a minimum final otu size of 10 implemented using custom scripts.following clustering the likely taxonomic identity of the representative sequence of each otu was determined using the assign taxonomy.py module of qiime using a modified form of the standard qiime unite database in which any unclassified or unidentified sequences were removed and each its region was trimmed to the extent of the bits primers used for the original its amplification -t sh taxonomy qiime ver6 dynamic s 10.09.2014.txt -r sh refs qiime ver6 dynamic s 10.09.2014.bit.unclassified.unidentified.fasta-muclust-uclust similarity  0.98 -uclust max accepts  10 -uclust min consensus fraction  0.4 .

however at- tempts at aligning to a preliminary reference genome set for shotgun abundance estimation see below resulted in up to 15 of reads being unable to be aligned.to determine if this was due to a lack of suitable reference genomes for key species that were represented in the shotgun data all unaligned sequences were subsequently de novo assem- bled with the resulting contigs partitioned according to their likely genus.

after filtering each sample for reads that matched the grapevine reference genome 1 per sample each filtered sample was aligned to the reference genome set.

normalized abundance measurements were scaled for both the shotgun and its experimental designs relative to a theoretical abundance of s. cerevisiae of 100 1 million reads per 1 million its fragments or 1 million shotgun reads per 1 million reads per 10-kb genomic window.

all unaligned reads for which both reads in a pair failed to align to the grapevine genome were retained for further analysis.to provide a reference sequence for read mapping whole genome sequences were collected where possible from a com- bination of species comprising either known grape and wine mi- crobiota including bacteria or other fungal species identified as being present in the fermentations analyzed in this study via its phylotyping table s3.

contigs were then partitioned according this taxonomic grouping at the genus level with gen- era being manually combined where appropriate.comparison of shotgun and its phylotyping datato compare the shotgun and its datasets normalized abun- dance measurements for common species from both the shot- gun and its experiments were scaled relative to a theoretical abundance of s. cerevisiae set at 100 1 million reads per 1 mil- lion its fragments or 1 million shotgun reads per 1 million reads per 10-kb genomic window.
