Following sequencing and barcode and adap- tor trimming 8.8 million reads were assigned across the samples Table S1 with an average of over 100 000 reads per sample.To consistently describe and compare the number of opera- tional taxonomic units OTUs across the samples all 8.8 million reads were first analyzed as a large single batch.

Mildly fermentative yeasts such as Hanseniaspora uvarum Candida stellata Metschnikowia pulcherrima Torulaspora delbrueckii and Lachancea thermotolerans can proliferate and survive well into the fermentation but fall in numbers as ethanol levels increase al- though it has been reported that C. stellata can survive up to 12 ethanol and complete fermentation 2-5.Despite the vastly higher numbers of non-Saccharomyces yeasts early in the fermentation process the major wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for the bulk of the ethano- lic fermentation.

A representative collection of ref- erence genomes was therefore obtained from existing genomic resources for fungal and bacterial genera that were known orquences likely represent species for which an adequate refer-set estimations of species abundance were made from averageaSequencing reads from each sample pre-filtered to remove grapevine matches were aligned against the wine reference consortium Table S3.suspected of being wine associated Table S3.

All unaligned reads for which both reads in a pair failed to align to the grapevine genome were retained for further analysis.To provide a reference sequence for read mapping whole genome sequences were collected where possible from a com- bination of species comprising either known grape and wine mi- crobiota including bacteria or other fungal species identified as being present in the fermentations analyzed in this study via ITS phylotyping Table S3.

As yet shotgun metagenomics has not been applied to the study of wine fermentation or to assess the accuracy of amplicon-based abundance estimates of wine fer-mentation.Fungal-specific internal transcribed spacer ITS phylotyping was performed over 4 key fermentation stages in 5 independent commercial Chardonnay juice fermentations in triplicate.

The weightings of each reference genome are overlaid on the plot with the size of the gray circles around each node proportional to the total abundance of each reference genome across all of the samples no shading for nodes 10.Comparing the shotgun metagenomic values obtained for the 4 control experiments to those expected from the estimated numbers of input cells showed that the outcomes of the shotgun analysis were within 2-fold of each other in all but 2 cases and that they were highly correlated with the ITS results R2  0.99 Table .When multidimensional analysis principal coordinate anal- ysis PCoA using Bray-Curtis distances was used to compare the shotgun samples the presence of high amounts of Hanse- niaspora spp.

These iden- tity values were generally above 99 for the reference genomes but were found to be significantly lower for reference sequences including Mucor circinelloides Pseudomonas syringae and Hanse- niaspora valbyensis suggesting that the actual species or strains present in the fermentation were significantly different than the reference used Fig.

Ultimately as more shotgun metagenomic andsingle-strain de novo assemblies for key wine species become available the accuracy of both ITS-amplicon and shotgun studies will greatly increase providing a powerful methodology for deciphering the influence of the microbial community on the wine flavor and aroma.Keywords wine metagenomics phylotyping yeast diversityReceived 8 February 2017 Revised 26 April 2017 Accepted 30 May 2017QC The Author 2017.

This will provide a key methodology for deciphering the influ- ence of the microbial community on the wine flavor and aroma and how winemaking interventions may be used to shape these outcomes.MethodsMock control populationsTo assemble control samples of known microbial composition individual cultures of 7 wine yeasts Table  were grown to sta- tionary phase in YPD with each culture microscopically enu- merated using a hemocytometer.

Accordingly these techniques are now being adapted for the study of wine fermentation and several amplicon-based studies have been conducted to investigate vineyard and wine microbiomes 9-14.
