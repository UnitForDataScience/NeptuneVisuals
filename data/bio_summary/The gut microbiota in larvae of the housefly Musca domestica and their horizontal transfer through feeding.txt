Each treatment included three biological replicatesthat they might have been transferred from the gut of the house fly to the wheat bran during feeding and might be involved in degrading and utilizing polysaccharides in the cell walls of wheat bran.The bacterial communities in the guts of house fly lar- vae were dominated by the phylum Proteobacteria andprimarily the class Gammaproteobacteria Additional file  Table S1.

We are interested in 1 the microbial dynamics of the gut microbiota in house fly larvae and 2 their horizontal transfer through feeding.Materials and methodsSample collectionThe house fly colony has been reared for more than 20 years in our lab.

The rarefaction curve for every sam- ple tended to saturation Additional file  Figure S1 indicating that our sequencing results captured most of the bacterial diversity.Bacterial diversity in house fly larvaeThe bacterial communities in the house fly larvae sam- ples were dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria and Fir- micutes Fig.

Some bacteria in the phyla Actinobacteria Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were either unique to the WBMd96h sam- ples or had much higher abundances in the WBMd96h samples compared with the WB96h samples suggestingTable 1 Richness and diversity estimates of the 16S rRNA gene libraries from the sequencing analysisMD02h MD24h MD48h MD72h and MD96h refer to Musca domestica larvae reared on moistened wheat bran for 2 24 48 72 and 96 h.

The larvae also represent a sustainable and prolific source of proteins used in poultry and fish feed Van .Because large volumes are required to supplement commercial poultry diets the rearing technology for fly larvae requires further development.

is a superior diet for house fly larvae Aniebo et al.

In this study we used Illu- mina MiSeq 16S rDNA sequencing to identify the micro- bial dynamics of the gut microbiota in house fly larvae and their food.

The house fly adults were fed with milk powder and water and the larvae were reared on moistened wheat bran wheat bran gwater ml  11.8.

In this experiment newly hatched house fly eggs were inoculated into moistened wheat bran.
