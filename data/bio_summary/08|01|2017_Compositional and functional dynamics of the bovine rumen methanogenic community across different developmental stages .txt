The anaerobic metabolism necessary for the degradation and fermentation of plant material carried out by this complex microbial community is driven by an electron flow across a redox potential gradi- ent which mostly ends with the reduction of carbon to methane Thauer et al.

The methanogenic archaea responsible for this process occupy approximately 2-5 of the mature rumen microbiome Brulc et al.

2009 and are a driving force for the complex rumen microbial communi- ties' metabolism serving as an electron sink for the entire rumen microbial ecosystem Sharp et al.

Methanogens can utilize different substrates obtained from the fermentation process for methanogene- sis each characterized by distinct mechanisms Rouviere and Wolfe 1988 Garcia et al.

It is also a potent greenhouse gas that contrib- utes significantly to the greenhouse effect Hook et al.

A large body of research exists on the composition and functionality of these methanogenic archaeal commu- nities in the mature rumen where the microbiome is considered to be more stable in composition Janssen and3366 N. Friedman E. Jami and I. MizrahiKirs 2008 Jeyanathan et al.
