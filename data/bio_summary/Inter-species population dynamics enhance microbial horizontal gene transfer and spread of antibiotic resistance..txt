Survival of E. coli in the three-strain culture was reduced by about 104-fold fourth bar p0001 although their survival was improved rel- ative to E. coli mixed with only WT Acinetobacter where E. coli were reduced below the 10 CFUs limit of detection p 14 0011 presumably due to the lower fraction of killing cells in the three-strain culture.Consistent with the model killing of E. coli by WT Acinetobacter in three-strain cultures was sufficient to increase HGT to co-cultured Acinetobacter Dhcp by about 100-fold  compare two- to three-strain com- munities in right bar group p0001 while HGT to the WT remained unchanged relative to a two-strain community  left bar group p 14 068.

Acinetobacter takes up DNAwith maximal rate c and saturation constant KDNA this DNA transforms Acinetobacter from species A1 to A2 with efficiency E Acinetobacter kills E. coli thereby releasing DNA and E. coli leaks DNA at a basal level rleak.

The reduced efficacy of competing DNA in this condition is likely because the high initial killing rate releases a large amount of prey DNA at once overcoming com- petitive inhibition.Interestingly competing DNA was nearly 10-fold less effective than predicted which may reflect its physical exclusion from dense microbial communities or the fact that our model does not reflect the spatial heterogeneity of DNA released from lysing E. coli.

Presumably the residual HGT to Acinetobacter Dhcp results from slow but con- tinued spontaneous DNA release from E. coli possibly from spontaneous cell lysis.Together these results and those reported for Vibrio cholera  support a model in which the T6SS of Acinetobacter promotes HGT by killing neighboring E. coli which then releases its DNA for subsequent uptake by Acinetobacter.

We placed the cm resistance gene in a region of the E. coli genome with minimal homol- ogy to Acinetobacter to preclude its horizontal transfer enabling us to quantify the remaining E. coli and thereby measure killing efficiency.We co-cultured Acinetobacter spect and E. coli cmkan seeded together at roughly equal concentrations on agar plates at 30oC overnight to allow for T6SS-mediated killing and HGT.

Similarly killing pro- vides less HGT enhancement when the interac- tion time is longer because killing Acinetobacter deplete their donor DNA source by killing neigh- boring prey E. coli whereas the non-killing mutants have a slower but exponentially grow- ing source of DNA from spontaneously lysing E. coli.Interestingly this seeding ratio at which con- tact-dependent killing most enhances HGT - when the predator outnumbers the prey - is the same condition in which it provides the strongestcompetitive advantage in terms of cell growth .

We measured plasmids per E. coli cell by growing a shaking tube of cells to exponential phase counting cell density by spotting serial dilutions isolating plasmid DNA with a standard miniprep kit measuring obtained DNA density with a spectrophotometer and converting ng of DNA to plasmids per cell.

Serendipitously a few Acinetobacter cells spontaneously began expressing GFP suggesting that they had acquired the GFP gene via HGT from DNA released by lysed E. coli.In our initial experiments the GFP-expressing plasmid in E. coli had a ColE1 origin of replication that does not stably replicate in Acinetobacter .

In con- trast the transformation frequency of killing-deficient Acinetobacter was mainly dependent on only the E. coli seeding density  because DNA release from spontaneous lysis depends only on the number of E. coli.From these results we calculated how the relative importance of killing for HGT depends on seeding density.

We simulated surfaces seeded with varying numbers of E. coli mixed with either killing or non-killing Acinetobacter either with DNA half life fixed to 1 min  or with 1011 kb of competing DNA added at time 0 .
