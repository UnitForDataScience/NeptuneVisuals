In CKD patients correction of metabolic acidosis may even be important to delay the progression of renal damage .This paper analyzes the content of Vitamin K1 alkali and fiber of different renal diets used in pre-dialysis CKD patients and deals with the importance of these nutrients within the dietary management of CKD.Materials and MethodsWe examined the energy and nutrients composition of four types of renal diets  according to their protein content normal diet ND 0.8 g proteinkg body weight low protein diet LPD 0.6 g proteinkg bw vegan diet VD 0.7 g proteinkg bw very low protein diet VLPD 0.3 g proteinkg bw.For each type of diet 12 daily meal plans adapted for a 70 Kg patient were analyzed and the results reported as daily average values.

In the early phases of CKD normalization of protein 0.8 gkgday and salt 6 gday intake are usually implemented with the aim of enhancing the anti-proteinuric response to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system RAAS inhibitors and to prevent abnormalities of calcium-phosphate metabolism .When renal insufficiency progresses more specific renal diets are prescribed to reduce uremic toxin retention phosphate and sodium load.

They include low-protein regimens namely the conventional animal-based low protein 0.6 gkgday or the vegan low protein 0.7 gKgday diet or the vegan very low protein 0.3 gkgday diet supplemented with essential amino acids and keto-acids .These renal diets are based on the control of protein sodium and phosphate intake while preserving nutritional status by high energy intake and adequate essential amino acids supply.Hence a progressive protein restriction is highly recommended along with the progression of renal insufficiency  however this is only one aspect of the dietary management of CKD patients.

This is the reason why dietary manipulation in renal patients is historically related to protein intake which is strictly linked to sodium and phosphorus intake.This paper focused on additional aspects namely vitamin K1 and fiber content and alkalizing power of these renal diets factors that can play an important role in the management of CKD patients.

Hence iron status VitB12 zinc levels should be monitored in CKD patients in general and in particular in the elderly and in those following a vegan or very low protein diet for a long time.ConclusionsIn conclusion renal diets for advanced chronic renal insufficiency are structured to achieve the main goal of lowering protein phosphate and sodium intake while supplying adequate energy.

In the case of vegetarian diets attention must be paid to serum potassium levels.Keywords Renal diets Vitamin K1 PRAL fiber gut microbiota uremic toxins low protein diet renal nutrition metabolic acidosis CKDIntroductionNutritional treatment plays a pivotal role in the care of patients affected by chronic kidney disease CKD.

Thus it is not surprising that prescription of a normal diet that is a diet covering the WHO recommendations may be a successful first-step intervention able to reduce sodium load nitrogen waste product retention and calcium-phosphate metabolism abnormalities.While adopting healthy dietary patterns such as the DASH or Mediterranean diets may be useful as a prevention strategy in a population-based setting specific renal diets aimed at protein sodium and phosphorus controlled intake may be needed in advanced stages of renal insufficiency.
