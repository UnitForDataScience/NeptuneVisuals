This highlights that taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome alone is able to predict use of these NSAIDs.47 Platelet aggregation inhibi- tors were positively associated with Streptococcus anginosus coeffi- cient  0.030 adjusted P  .063 and Streptococcus parasanguinis coefficient  0.057 adjusted P  .049 in a cohort of 1135 Dutch participants.29 MEURakivuokko et al found that faecal samples from elderly NSAID users were depleted in Dialister Coprobacillus and Col- linsella compared to young adults and were depleted in Lactobacillus and Collinsella aerofaciens but enriched in Roseburia compared to elderly NSAID non-users.48 In a cohort of 98 hospitalised patients using a multivariate analysis use of NSAIDs was associated with a significant increase in unclassified Clostridiales Family XI esti- mate  3.76 P  .058 and a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Clostridium estimate  -2.1 P  .020.36 In contrast a study from Bokulich et al showed that sort-term exposure to celecoxib did not induce significant taxonomic changes in faecal samples.46 OpioidsMorphine is often the drug of choice in cases of moderate or severe pain.49 However previous works demonstrated that opioid drugs enable bacterial translocation by means of gut barrier disruption.50-52 Richness and diversity in the gut microbiota of opioid usersIn a cohort of 98 hospitalised patients Vincent et al found that opi- oid treatment was associated with an increase in a diversity in a cohort of hospitalised patients estimate  0.13 P  .0202.36 In a cohort of patients with hepatic encephalopathy HE ss diversity tests revealed a significant difference between HE patients on opi- oids compared to HE patients not on opioids P  .05 as well as between patients without HE on opioids vs not on opioids P  .03.53 Moreover Zhernakova et al in a cohort of 1135 Dutch participants found that opioid medication was strongly associated with composition distance adonis R2  .002 adjusted P  .01 a measure of ss diversity showing that opioid use is associated with specific changes in the architecture of the intestinal microbiome.29 Taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota of opioid usersIn a cohort of 98 hospitalised patients opioid use was positively associated with Parabacteroides P  .003 PropionimicrobiumP  .004 Alistipes P  .016 Sutterella P  .017 Clostridium P  .026 Bifidobacterium P  .026 unclassified Lachnospiraceae P  .0295 and Pyramidobacter P  .038 and negatively associated with Polyomavirus P  .0002 Pseudomonas P  .0003 unclassified Ruminococcaceae p  .003 Candida P  .019 and Megamonas P  .028.36 Acharya et al reported that Clostridiales XIV P  .04 Ruminococcaceae P  .02 and Bacteroidaceae P  .03 were decreased in morphine treated patients.

Prolonged exposure to metformin in the gut after oral administration may lead to continual flux through gut epithelial cells via the OCT1 and other metformin-associated transporters which could promote this inhibition of bile acid reuptake.TABL E 2 Proposed mechanisms of gut microbiome alterations induced by prescription drugsSpecifically in a mouse model of sepsis Meng et al documented that opioid use leads to increased Staphylococcus and Enterococcus Gram-positive organisms in the gut microbiota and enables theirPPIAcid suppression in the proximal duodenum associated with ph- independent mechanismsMetforminAlteration of the enterohepaticrecirculation of bile acids involving modulation of gut microbiomeNSAIDAlteration of function of small intestine likely depending on the particular type of nsaid ingestedOpioidsModulation of the host immune system causing microbiome alterationStatinsInteraction with bile acids and impact upon expression of inflammatory markers known to influence microbial community structureAntipsychoticsDirectly affects the growth oforganisms within the gutFreedberg et al89Napolitano et al108Rogers and Aronoff47Meng et al50Nolan et al115Davey et al83 Morganet al85dissemination to organs.

They also reported an increase in relative abun- dance of A. muciniphila in participants treated with metformin for 4 months but did not find significant correlations between HbA1c and A. muciniphila P  .1.43 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely prescribed for pain and inflammatory conditions.44 NSAIDs block the biosynthesis of prostanoids via inhibition the cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 enzymes.45 These medications are commonly associated with adverse gastroin- testinal events.45 Richness and diversity in the gut microbiota of NSAID usersIn a cohort of 98 hospitalised patients use of NSAIDs was not associ- ated with changes in intestinal microbiota diversity estimate  0.08 P  .33.36 Moreover Bokulich et al showed in ten obese post- menopausal women who received celecoxib 200 mg twice daily that sort-term exposure to celecoxib did not alter a or ss diversity.46 More- over Zhernakova et al in a cohort of 1135 Dutch participants found that NSAID medication was not associated with changes of ss diver- sity adonis R2  .001 adjusted P  .20 demonstrating differences in the bacterial community structure associated with metformin use.39 Taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota of NSAID usersIn a human cohort with 155 participants Rogers et al found that the relative abundance of a specific OTU in family Enterobacteriaceae was significantly higher P  .0001 in participants using the NSAID naproxen 20 than in participants not using any medications 0.7.

Micrococ- caceae Scardovia Actinomyces Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia mucilaginosa as well as by Jackson et al who reported positive cor- relations between PPI use and microbial families in the mouth throat skin and nose.3588 However since hypochlorhydria induced by PPIs is restricted to the stomach and the proximal duodenum other pH-independent mechanisms could also be responsible for altering gut microbiota throughout the human gastrointestinal lumen.89 Various hypothesis were proposed including 1 hypergas- trinemia and hyperparathyroidism induced by PPIs that have the potential to alter the gastrointestinal bacterial environment90 2 alteration of luminal contents by PPI which could interfere with nutrient absorption and change the amount or location of bacterial food substrates9192 and 3 binding of PPIs to non-gastric HK- ATPases on human cells such as colonic epithelial HK-ATPases or those of commensal bacteria and fungi.93 PPIs are a mainstay of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy and seem to have direct bac- teriostatic activity against this bacterium in addition to an indirect activity via increases in gastric pH.94 Indeed previous studies reported that omeprazole inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro including H. pylori.94-96 This effect may be due to a direct effect on the proton pumps of the bacteria as such enzymes have been identified in H. pylori and S. pneumo- niae.9798 Kanno et al and Garcia-Mazcorro et al also suggest that the increase in the bacterial load entering the large intestine may be partly responsible for the faecal microbiome alterations associated with PPI medication.99100 Another contribution to faecal microbiome alterations associated with inhibition of gastric acid may be the change in the composition of dietary protein reaching the large intestine.100101 Often prescribed to provide gastric protection in patients who are co-ingesting NSAIDs PPIs combined with theseFI GU RE 2 Proposed mechanisms by which drugs influence the gut microbiomeagents may lead to a paradoxical cytotoxic effect on the small bowel.76 This injury seems to be mediated by dysbiosis because injury was ameliorated when PPI-treated rats were engrafted with a Bifidobacteria-enriched microbiota.

Antibiotics have a well-described impact on the intestinal microbiome with long-stand- ing effects in patients56 and it is known that chemotherapy induces specific gut microbiome dysbiosis.78 Maurice et al evaluated the impact of a variety of drugs including antibiotics digoxin phenace- tin and sulfasalazine and found that antibiotics had the greatest impact on the gut microbiome.9 Recently Falony et al showed that medication has the strongest combined effect size on the micro- biome.10 In the present work we systematically review studies reporting non-antibiotic prescription drug-induced human gut micro- biome changes focusing on the most frequently prescribed thera- peutic drug categories from the aforementioned national ambulatory medical care survey.1 MATERIALS AND METHODS  Search strategy for the systematic reviewWe conducted a systematic review of studies that evaluated association between medications and members of the intestinal microbiome.

A longitudinal analysis highlighted a pro- gressive decrease in the BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio during Ris- peridone treatment that also correlated with body mass index gain.60 In the 1135 participants from a Dutch cohort antidepressants were positively associated with B. dorei coefficient  0.131 adjusted P  .051 and Coprococcus eutactus coefficient  0.114 adjusted P  .041 and negatively associated with Eubacterium hallii coeffi- cient  -0.084 adjusted P  .055.29 DISCUSSION Global prescription drug use has been increasing continuously for decades in the United States and in European countries.12 The gut microbiome mainly composed of bacteria which outnumber human cells is a key contributor to human health.61 Indeed dysbiosis in the microbiome was identified and associated with predisposition to numerous human diseases.4 Moreover antibiotics have a well- described impact on the intestinal microbiome with long-standing effects in patients.56 Recently Falony et al showed that medications were associated with microbiota compositional variation and explained the largest total variance of beta diversity.10 Another pop- ulation-based cohort showed a strong relationship between the gut microbiome and 19 drug groups mainly PPI statins and antibiotics.29 Here we systematically reviewed studies that reported prescription drug-induced gut microbiome alterations in humans focusing on the most frequently prescribed drugs as documented by the 2013 national ambulatory medical care survey.3 As such we included stud- ies that reported gut microbiome alterations associated with use of PPIs metformin NSAIDs opioids statins and antipsychotics.

difficile.32 In a trial with 12 healthy volunteers Freedberg et al found that a 4-week regimen of PPI medication omeprazole 40 mg twice was not associated with within-individual changes in diver- sity.33 O'Donoghue et al found that PPI use was significantly associ- ated with increased microbial diversity but only in patients receiving more than two antibiotics P  .01 and suggested that PPI use may counter antibiotics-associated dysbiosis.34 Taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota of PPI usersJackson et al identified 22 OTUs with significantly lower abundance in PPI users and 32 OTUs positively associated with PPI use ad- justed P-value association with PPI use .05 as detailed in Table 1.

Another important finding was the over-representa- tion of multiple oral bacteria in the faecal microbiome of PPI-users the most significantly increased being genera Rothia Scardovia and Actinomyces adjusted P .05.30In a prospective cohort study of 98 hospitalised patients Vincent et al found that PPI medication was positively associated with Poty- virus P  .006 Morganella P  .011 and Pyramidobacter P  .04 and negatively associated with Adlercreutzia P  .003 Mitsuokella P  .004 unclassified Clostridiaceae P  .004 Campylobacter P  .006 Pseudoflavonifractor P  .007 Coprobacter P  .01 Eubacterium P  .02 Odoribacter P  .02 Streptococcus P  .02 Ruminococcus P  .03 unclassified Clostridiales Family XI P  .03 and Coprobacillus P  .04.363.2  MetforminMetformin a drug that lowers oral blood glucose is one of the most widely prescribed medications for type 2 diabetes T2D patients.37 However about 30 of metformin-treated patients report adverse gastrointestinal effects including abdominal pain and diarrhoea which may be linked to metformin-induced dysbiosis.383.2.1  Richness and diversity in the gut microbiota of metformin usersForslund et al in an international metagenomic dataset with Danish Swedish and Chinese participants found that T2D metformin- treated patients n  93 did not exhibit a decreased richness or diver- sity compared to T2D patients not treated with metformin n  106 or healthy controls n  554 richness T2D without metformin M SD 149.12 55.44 T2D with metformin 156.23 41.88 controls163.43 42.58 adjusted P  .38 Shannon diversity T2D without metformin 11.67 0.66 T2D with metformin 11.89 0.53 controls11.79 0.60 adjusted P  .914.39 de la Cuesta-Zuluaga et al analysed faecal samples from Colombian adults with metformin-treated T2D n  14 T2D patients not treated with metformin n  14 and con- trol participants n  84.

muciniphila and several bacterial taxa producing short chain fatty acids including Butyrivibrio Megasphaera and Prevotella.40 Moreovershort chain fatty acid concentrations especially proprionate were significantly higher in metformin users compared to non-users.29 These findings corroborate previous results from mice models sug- gesting that the beneficial effects of metformin may be linked to an enhancement of the intestinal mucosal barrier.105-107 In illustration mice supplemented with A. muciniphila exhibited significant improve- ment in mucin-producing goblet cells glucose tolerance and adipose tissue inflammation by inducing Foxp3 regulatory T cells in the vis- ceral adipose tissue.106 Moreover significant correlation between serum cholic acid the most abundant primary biliary acid and taxo- nomic composition observed by Napolitano et al in metformin-trea- ted patients suggests a role played by the biliary acid pool in the composition of the gut microbiome.108 An interplay between the size and composition of the bile acid pool and the gut microbiota was previously reported.109 The mechanism involved in metformin- induced changes in gut microbiota could be an inhibition of the reab- sorption of bile acids by metformin due to an alteration of the func- tion of the sodium-dependent intestinal bile acid transporter.

However changes in bacterial composition of the gut microbiome also depend on the type of ingested NSAID suggesting particular mechanisms specific to NSAID class.47 Further- more in a mouse model Liang et al found evidence of bidirectional interactions with NSAIDs altering the composition of the intestinal microbiota and the intestinal microbiota in turn altering indometha- cin metabolism.112 OpioidsOpioid use is associated with severe constipation which could be implicated in the creation of a disrupted gut environment leading to altered gut microbiota in the form of small bowel overgrowth and subsequent microbial translocation.
