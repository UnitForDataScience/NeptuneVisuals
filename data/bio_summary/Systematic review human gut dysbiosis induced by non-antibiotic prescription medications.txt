A longitudinal analysis highlighted a pro- gressive decrease in the BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio during Ris- peridone treatment that also correlated with body mass index gain.60 In the 1135 participants from a Dutch cohort antidepressants were positively associated with B. dorei coefficient  0.131 adjusted P  .051 and Coprococcus eutactus coefficient  0.114 adjusted P  .041 and negatively associated with Eubacterium hallii coeffi- cient  -0.084 adjusted P  .055.29 DISCUSSION Global prescription drug use has been increasing continuously for decades in the United States and in European countries.12 The gut microbiome mainly composed of bacteria which outnumber human cells is a key contributor to human health.61 Indeed dysbiosis in the microbiome was identified and associated with predisposition to numerous human diseases.4 Moreover antibiotics have a well- described impact on the intestinal microbiome with long-standing effects in patients.56 Recently Falony et al showed that medications were associated with microbiota compositional variation and explained the largest total variance of beta diversity.10 Another pop- ulation-based cohort showed a strong relationship between the gut microbiome and 19 drug groups mainly PPI statins and antibiotics.29 Here we systematically reviewed studies that reported prescription drug-induced gut microbiome alterations in humans focusing on the most frequently prescribed drugs as documented by the 2013 national ambulatory medical care survey.3 As such we included stud- ies that reported gut microbiome alterations associated with use of PPIs metformin NSAIDs opioids statins and antipsychotics.

Antibiotics have a well-described impact on the intestinal microbiome with long-stand- ing effects in patients56 and it is known that chemotherapy induces specific gut microbiome dysbiosis.78 Maurice et al evaluated the impact of a variety of drugs including antibiotics digoxin phenace- tin and sulfasalazine and found that antibiotics had the greatest impact on the gut microbiome.9 Recently Falony et al showed that medication has the strongest combined effect size on the micro- biome.10 In the present work we systematically review studies reporting non-antibiotic prescription drug-induced human gut micro- biome changes focusing on the most frequently prescribed thera- peutic drug categories from the aforementioned national ambulatory medical care survey.1 MATERIALS AND METHODS  Search strategy for the systematic reviewWe conducted a systematic review of studies that evaluated association between medications and members of the intestinal microbiome.

We also found that antipsychotic treatment usually associated with an increase in body mass index was marked by a decreased ratio of BacteroidetesFirmicutes in the gut microbiome resembling trends seen in obese patients.Conclusions Non-antibiotic prescription drugs have a notable impact on the overall archi- tecture of the intestinal microbiome.

However the two largest observational cohort studies with the highest methodological quality in addition to an intervention study on healthy volunteers found that PPI use does significantly lower a diversity of the gut microbiota.283033 As for metformin and NSAIDs the reviewed stud- ies consistently reported that these drugs did not produce a signifi- cant change in a diversity.2936394046 For opioids only one study evaluated a diversity and reported an increase in this metric in opi- oid users.36 Atypical antipsychotic treatment was associated with decreased a diversity in one study59 however long-termRisperidone use 12 months was associated with increased a diver- sity in a small cohort of 28 children.60Reduced microbiome a diversity has well-documented associa- tions with inflammatory states and diseases.6263 Thus a marked drop in a diversity was reported in immune related diseases like allergy inflammatory bowel diseases type 1 diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis as well as colorectal cancer and metabolic disor- ders like obesity and T2D mellitus which primarily affect Western countries.6465 Moreover reduced a diversity was previously associ- ated with increased susceptibility to C. difficile infection.306667 Since b diversity was altered for all drug classes but NSAIDs this indicates that all of the remaining drugs reviewed produce compositional microbiome signatures capable of distinguishing users of these drugs from non-users.

A less acidic environment may enable organisms in the oral microbiome to colo- nise the intestinal microbiome of PPI users Figure 2 Table 2.

Prolonged exposure to metformin in the gut after oral administration may lead to continual flux through gut epithelial cells via the OCT1 and other metformin-associated transporters which could promote this inhibition of bile acid reuptake.TABL E 2 Proposed mechanisms of gut microbiome alterations induced by prescription drugsSpecifically in a mouse model of sepsis Meng et al documented that opioid use leads to increased Staphylococcus and Enterococcus Gram-positive organisms in the gut microbiota and enables theirPPIAcid suppression in the proximal duodenum associated with ph- independent mechanismsMetforminAlteration of the enterohepaticrecirculation of bile acids involving modulation of gut microbiomeNSAIDAlteration of function of small intestine likely depending on the particular type of nsaid ingestedOpioidsModulation of the host immune system causing microbiome alterationStatinsInteraction with bile acids and impact upon expression of inflammatory markers known to influence microbial community structureAntipsychoticsDirectly affects the growth oforganisms within the gutFreedberg et al89Napolitano et al108Rogers and Aronoff47Meng et al50Nolan et al115Davey et al83 Morganet al85dissemination to organs.

Thyroid hormones another frequently pre- scribed class of drugs may have an impact on the intestinal micro- biome and understanding potential bidirectional relationships between the host endocrine system and gut microbiome is funda- mental.121 Contraceptive agents may also have impact on the intesti- nal microbiome and should be studied in humans and mouse models.10 Moreover intervention studies investigating the effects of antihypertensive drugs diuretics angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blocking agents on the gut micro- biome may be of interest as a study in a mouse model reported on the protective cardiovascular effects of probiotics for genetic hyper- tension.

Modulation of the intestinal microbiomeAs there is a clear association between the composition of the microbiome and prescription drug use and evidence that altered gut microbiota may mediate some drug effects another future direction may be to investigate these and other drugs with the goal of amelio- rating or reversing some of their adverse effects.43 Future studies should investigate modulation of the gut microbiota with live bio- therapeutics based on microbiome biomarkers of drug-induced dys- biosis to counter taxonomic changes associated with drug prescription that may predispose patients to adverse outcomes.

Further mechanistic studies and intervention trials based on principles of good clinical practice focusing on the link between intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and gut microbiome dysbio- sis induced by medications are needed to better understand gut microbiome alterations and to define biomarkers of specific drug- induced dysbioses.
