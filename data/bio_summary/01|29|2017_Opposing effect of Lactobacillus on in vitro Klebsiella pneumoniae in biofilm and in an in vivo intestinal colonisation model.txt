Moreover the capacity of K. pneumoniae LM21 to form biofilm on abiotic surfaces after being conditioned by L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant was significantly increased P0.0022 Figure 4C.Influence of Lactobacillus plantarum CIRM653 on intestinal colonisation by Klebsiella pneumoniae in a murine modelSince colonisation of the intestinal tract is a K. pneumoniae feature the murine model of K. pneumoniae intestinal colonisation was challenged with L. plantarum CIRM653.

Macroscopic observations were performed with 24 h old biofilm formed on microfermentor spatulas inoculated 10 min with 1.5x108 cfu of K. pneumoniae LM21 andor L. plantarum CIRM653 viable or UV-killed perfused with BHI medium or L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant Sn.

After 1 day and subsequently every day for 5 days they were intragastrically fed with L. plantarum CIRM653 1.9x109 cfuml Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35 2.07x109 cfu ml L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant PBS or BHI controls in a total volume of 200 ml.

The addition of each of the Lactobacillus supernatants to 2h-old K. pneumoniae CH1034 biofilm reduced the biofilm biomass of the pathogen although only statistically significantly with L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant 67.4 decrease P0.006 Figure 2B.Scanning electron microscopy observations SEM of biofilms formed in the presence of L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant were made with K. pneumoniae CH1034 and the well characterised biofilm forming K. pneumoniae LM21.

After 24 h all spatulas inoculated with K. pneumoniae LM21 had a thick biofilm except those incubated in the presence of L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant or with viable L. plantarum CIRM653 Figure 3A.

Parallel counts of L. plantarum CIRM653 cells showed a 2-log increase within mixed biofilm compared to L. plantarum CIRM653 monospecies biofilm Figure 3B.

A Macroscopic observations of 24 h-old biofilm on microfermentor spatulas inoculated 10 min with 1.5x108 cfu of K. pneumoniae LM21 andor L. plantarum CIRM653 viable or UV-killed perfused with brain-heart infusion BHI medium or L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant Sn.

The results are expressed as a  of L. plantarum CIRM653 biofilm biomass  - standard error of the mean n3 compared to BHI medium 100  P0.01.Western blot analysis performed with biofilm whole cell extracts and MrkA specific antibody showed that the major subunit of type 3 pili was produced 20 more in K. pneumoniae LM21 cultured in the presence of L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant than in the control Figure 4B.

However when L. plantarum CIRM653 supernatant was orally given instead of live L. plantarum CIRM653 the number of K. pneumoniae LM21 cells in faeces was unchanged compared to the number observed in the control group challenged with K. pneumoniae LM21 alone Figure 5B.

To determine if the anti-biofilm activity of L. plantarum CIRM653 was due to jamming of the genes involved in K. pneumoniae biofilm development we investigated the influence of L. plantarum CIRM653 on the expression of K. pneumoniae LM21 biofilm-related genes.
