moreover the capacity of k. pneumoniae lm21 to form biofilm on abiotic surfaces after being conditioned by l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant was significantly increased p0.0022 figure 4c.influence of lactobacillus plantarum cirm653 on intestinal colonisation by klebsiella pneumoniae in a murine modelsince colonisation of the intestinal tract is a k. pneumoniae feature the murine model of k. pneumoniae intestinal colonisation was challenged with l. plantarum cirm653.

it is likely that l. plantarum cirm653 takes advantage of the metabolism of k. pneumoniae and then invades the surface as observed with l. rhamnosus co- cultured with listeria monocytogenes woo and ahn 2013. another explanation would be that biofilms formed by l. plantarum cirm653 are very sensitive to shear stress and that the presence of klebsiella in mixed biofilm increases the global biofilm stability allowing to accumulate high biomass.

macroscopic observations were performed with 24 h old biofilm formed on microfermentor spatulas inoculated 10 min with 1.5x108 cfu of k. pneumoniae lm21 andor l. plantarum cirm653 viable or uv-killed perfused with bhi medium or l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant sn.

after 1 day and subsequently every day for 5 days they were intragastrically fed with l. plantarum cirm653 1.9x109 cfuml lactobacillus rhamnosus lcr35 2.07x109 cfu ml l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant pbs or bhi controls in a total volume of 200 ml.

the addition of each of the lactobacillus supernatants to 2h-old k. pneumoniae ch1034 biofilm reduced the biofilm biomass of the pathogen although only statistically significantly with l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant 67.4 decrease p0.006 figure 2b.scanning electron microscopy observations sem of biofilms formed in the presence of l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant were made with k. pneumoniae ch1034 and the well characterised biofilm forming k. pneumoniae lm21.

after 24 h all spatulas inoculated with k. pneumoniae lm21 had a thick biofilm except those incubated in the presence of l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant or with viable l. plantarum cirm653 figure 3a.

parallel counts of l. plantarum cirm653 cells showed a 2-log increase within mixed biofilm compared to l. plantarum cirm653 monospecies biofilm figure 3b.

the results are expressed as a  of l. plantarum cirm653 biofilm biomass  - standard error of the mean n3 compared to bhi medium 100  p0.01.western blot analysis performed with biofilm whole cell extracts and mrka specific antibody showed that the major subunit of type 3 pili was produced 20 more in k. pneumoniae lm21 cultured in the presence of l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant than in the control figure 4b.

however when l. plantarum cirm653 supernatant was orally given instead of live l. plantarum cirm653 the number of k. pneumoniae lm21 cells in faeces was unchanged compared to the number observed in the control group challenged with k. pneumoniae lm21 alone figure 5b.

2016. to determine if the anti-biofilm activity of l. plantarum cirm653 was due to jamming of the genes involved in k. pneumoniae biofilm development we investigated the influence of l. plantarum cirm653 on the expression of k. pneumoniae lm21 biofilm-related genes.

1999. to investigate the activity of l. plantarum cirm653 towards k. pneumoniae in such an in vivo complex model l. plantarum cirm653 was daily administrated to mice after colonisation of their intestine by k. pneumoniae lm21.

we can thus speculate that the in vitro non-biocidal anti-biofilm activity of l. plantarum cirm653 which led in vitro to the dispersal of biofilm cells with high adherence ability is likely to destabilise intestinal microbiota in vivo and to increase k. pneumoniae dispersal to other parts of the gut.in conclusion the present study identified an in vitro anti-biofilm activity of the l. plantarum cirm653 strain independently of any bactericidal effect against the pathogen k. pneumoniae.

the anti-biofilm activity of the three other strains l. plantarum cirm653 l. delbrueckii cirm267 l. delbrueckii cirm268 was then assessed by measuring the effect of their supernatant on the viability of the k. pneumoniae ch1034 sessile cells.

microscopic observation of the output stream of an 8h-old k. pneumoniae lm21 biofilm challenged with l. plantarum cirm653 showed the release of micro-aggregates whereas in unchallenged k. pneumoniae biofilm individual cells were mainly observed data not shown.confocal microscopy observation of 8 h-old l. plantarum cirm653k.
