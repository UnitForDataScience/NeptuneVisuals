In Bangladesh infectious diseases due to multidrug resistant MDR bacteria are at rise although the reservoir for such MDR bacteria is not well defined.

We confirmed the gut of children under 5 years of age as an important reservoir for MDR bacte- rial genera belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae which included surface water bacteria including impor- tant human pathogens carrying major virulence plasmids and related genetic elements responsible for multidrug resistance.MethodsStudy subjectsThis study was conducted in Dhaka city during Febru- ary 2011-July 2012 on gut bacteria of 15 non-diarrheal children from moderate socioeconomic status.

As shown in Table  bacteria isolated from the gut of young children included important pathogenic bacteria along with the ones that are widely known as commensals and were predominated by the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.

The results of this culture-based gut microbiota study appear in agreement with the data obtained in our immediate past culture- independent metagenomic study showing the presence in the gut of pathogenic bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae which included pathogenic bacteria occurring naturally in the aquatic environments .

Drug resistant E. coli was reported from healthy children of USA Venezuela and China - how- ever to our knowledge MDR gut bacteria carrying EHEC genes namely stx-2 and eae are unique in the present study which indicate a potential health risk for the young children of Bangladesh.Enterobacter cloacae a commensal gut bacteria occur- ring widely in the environment has the ability to cause opportunistic infections in human  .

To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the presence of such major plasmids in bacteria other than Shigellae occurring in the gut of young children which can transfer resistance and related genes horizontally across different genera.The gene cassettes such as classes 1 and 2 integrons are responsible for multidrug resistance in Gram-nega- tive bacteria .
