Here proper mucin secretion mediated by VAMP8 had conse- quences for protection against E. histolytica allowing increased contact of E. histolytica with epithelial cells.Increased association of E. histolytica in cells lacking VAMP8 leads to cyto- pathic effects and apoptosis.

These results demonstrate that VAMP8 is critical in facilitating mucus secretion and is specifically activated upon interaction with E. histolytica in vitro.Lack of VAMP8 and mucin exocytosis increases E. histolytica contact with goblet cells.

In contrast VAMP8KD TurboRFP cells showed a 2-fold increase in the level of E. histolytica cells that directly bound quadrant 2 Q2 and the lack of mucin secretion also affected bystander cells that were not knocked down with an increase in the total amount of E. histolytica .

D and E Uninduced LS174T cells D had less E. histolytica direct binding than VAMP8KD cells E. Additionally Q2 had more E. histolytica bound in TurboRFP VAMP8KD cells than in uninduced cells in the same well Q1.

histolytica directly bound to VAMP8KD cells was higher than that seen with unin-FIG 3 VAMP8KD increases E. histolytica contact with goblet cells due to aberrant mucin exocytosis.

To distinguish E. histolytica cells from epithelial cells E. histolytica was labeled with allophycocyanin APC-CellMask and epithelial cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester CFSE.

The total amount of E. histolytica normalized to the total number of cells was quantified as the multiplicity of infection MOI and VAMP8KD cells were found to have more adherent E. histolytica cells .

A LS174T cells were labeled with CFSE and infected with APC-Cellmask-labeled E. histolytica for 30 min washed with PBS to eliminate nonadherent E. histolytica dissociated using trypsin and analyzed by flow cytometry.

B Uninduced and VAMP8KD cells were infected with E. histolytica and the total amount of E. histolytica was analyzed by the use of APC- CellMask.

A prerequisite for E. histolytica pathogenesis is direct binding resulting in E. histolytica killing target cells and overcoming epithelial barrier function.
