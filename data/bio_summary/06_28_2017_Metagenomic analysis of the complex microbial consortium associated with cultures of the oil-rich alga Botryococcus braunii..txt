To investigate the nature of the B. braunii microbial consortium and to discover which taxonomic units spe- ciesgenera are present in close association with the alga we used a combination of metagenomic analysis and identification of cultured isolates to investigate the bacterial species present in a laboratory culture of B. braunii strain Guadeloupe Race B Metzger David  Casadevall 1986.To drastically perturb the microbiota present in the B. braunii cul- ture and identify bacteria that may be more closely associated withB.

The B. braunii consortium is not sensitive to antibiotics that in- hibit peptidoglycan synthesis whereas antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis had a significant effect on the B. braunii consortium strep- tomycin kanamycin and paromomycin prevented growth of B. brau- nii resulting in decomposition of the algae rifampicin erythromycin gentamycin and chloramphenicol reduce growth rate relative to the untreated culture without killing the algae.The culturable bacteria species likely to be from the genera Variovorax Achromobacter and Flavobacterium were resistant to ci- profloxacin 10 mg ml-1 whereas the Agrobacterium sp.

While the association with microorganisms is not essential for hydro- carbon production in B. braunii the addition of single bacterial species to previously axenic B. braunii culture increased algal biomass and hy- drocarbon yields Chirac et al.

To investigate further the nature of the B. braunii microbial consor- tium we profiled the microbiota of an established laboratory culture of B. braunii under different conditions using high throughput Illumina sequencing of metagenomic samples.2  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Modification of Botryococcus braunii culture conditionsUnderstanding the structure of algal-bacterial interactions using metagenomics offers the potential to ensure more robust culturesand exploit for industrial or nutritional use a wider variety of species than currently deployed.

In order to culture B. braunii cost effectively at scale understanding the composition of the community is essential.Our results indicate that sequences attributed to the co-cultured bacterial community were dramatically altered by the perturbations to the B. braunii culture.

However highly se- lective conditions are required which favor hydrocarbon synthesis and maintain the dominance of the algal crop over other species.The majority of B. braunii cultures are not axenic Chirac Casadevall Largeau  Metzger 1985 Dayananda Sarada Usharani Shamala  Ravishankar 2007 Metzger  Largeau 2005 Wolf et al.

Furthermore the nature of the bacterial association with B. braunii was different when the algae were grown as a planktonic culture or in a biofilm Rivas et al.

It is clear therefore that microorganisms in the B. braunii consortium can have unpredictable and sometimes contrasting effects on algal biomass and hydrocarbon yield which are essential considerations for sustainable biofuel production.Metagenomic shotgun sequencing is a powerful alternative to rDNA sequencing for analyzing complex microbial communities Cooper  Smith 2015 Tringe  Rubin 2005 von Mering et al.

braunii culture conditions were altered from those routinely used Condition A by either repeated centrifugation and rinsing ConditionB or by addition of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin Condition C to a laboratory culture of B. braunii Figure 1.Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that inhibits DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV activity Maxwell 1997 resulting in incomplete DNA synthesis during DNA replication and inhibition of bacterial growth.
