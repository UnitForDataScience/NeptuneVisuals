We conclude that mucus reduction and subsequent increased host-bacterial contact did not affect overall disease progression in NOD mice.Abbreviations DSS dextran sulfate sodium NOD nonobese diabetic OTU operational taxonomic unit Treg regulatory T cellsThe nonobese diabetic NOD mouse is an extensively stud- ied spontaneous genetic model for the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Some have suggested that NOD mice already have a 'diabetogen- ic' microbiota.5 One study found fewer colonic Alphaproteobacte- ria Bacteroides and Ruminococcus and the presence of Prevotella generally concluding that NOD mice contained more pathogenic strains and an overall different metabolic profile compared with diabetes-resistant mice.5 In that study after fecal transplanta- tion of NOD microbiota to diabetes-resistant mice the normally limited insulitis of the diabetes-resistant mice was exacerbated.

For example a change from neutral to acidified water decreased diabetes incidence with a shift to decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteriodetes Acti- nobacteria and Proterobacteria and upregulation of Th17 and regulatory T cells Treg.34 In the current study we weaned NOD pups to drinking water supplemented with a low dose of dextran sulfate sodium DSS which compromises the gut barrier higher concentrations of DSS usually 3 to 5 cause colitis in rodents depending on strain duration and concentration.1828We have previously shown that low-dose DSS treatment compromises the gut barrier due to an acute regulatory immunologic response in- fluenced by dietary antigens and that DSS treatment changes theEarly-life gut mucosal compromise in NOD micecomposition of gut microbiota toward decreased gram-positive and increased gram-negative species4 which findings best are in line with other studies.

No pathologic changes were found upon histologic evaluation of control or DSS-treated NOD mice.of the mice are still alive was 184 d for the control group com- pared with 205 d for DSS-treated NOD mice.

However relative abundancy of taxa did not differ between DSS-treated and control NOD mice at week 4 6 or 13 Figure 9.DiscussionIn this study we tested whether a brief early-life intervention would influence disease development in NOD mice.

In another study the mice failed to develop a significant difference in insulitis until 20 wk even though sig- nificant differences in microbiota gastrointestinal pH and FoxP3 expression were demonstrated from 2 wk of age.34 These data further emphasize the robustness of the end-disease outcome of NOD mice.The low-dose DSS treatment we used had some effect on the gut of NOD mice demonstrated by the robust differences in cecal length and weight from week 4 through 13.

In another report administra- tion of vancomycin to NOD mice from fetal life until the end of the study increased disease incidence Akkermansia species and Th1-type cells pointing to a different microbiotal starting point as well as a difference between brief early-life manipulation and prolonged microbiotal intervention.5 Very early-life events that affect the establishment of the diabetogenic microbiota clearly seem to be important for disease development in the NOD model.

The insulitis is of a mixed and progressive nature with infiltration innately initiated by neutrophils den- dritic cells and macrophages and continued through both T and B lymphocyte reactivity.1129 Typically NOD mice are diagnosed when blood glucose reaches 12 mmolL reference value 4 to 6 mmolL beginning at approximately 10 wk of age however prediabetic mechanisms are recognizable from as early as 3 to 6 wk.711 Despite the strong genetic and molecular background the model is further complicated in its etiology by many exter- nal manipulations that affect disease outcome.

In addition to a sex-associated bias with an incidence of 40 to 90 in females compared with 10 to 40 in males11 the incidence progression and severity of the hyperglycemia in NOD mice are dependent on environmental circumstances from fetus to adult.
