we conclude that mucus reduction and subsequent increased host-bacterial contact did not affect overall disease progression in nod mice.abbreviations dss dextran sulfate sodium nod nonobese diabetic otu operational taxonomic unit treg regulatory t cellsthe nonobese diabetic nod mouse is an extensively stud- ied spontaneous genetic model for the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus.

some have suggested that nod mice already have a 'diabetogen- ic' microbiota.5 one study found fewer colonic alphaproteobacte- ria bacteroides and ruminococcus and the presence of prevotella generally concluding that nod mice contained more pathogenic strains and an overall different metabolic profile compared with diabetes-resistant mice.5 in that study after fecal transplanta- tion of nod microbiota to diabetes-resistant mice the normally limited insulitis of the diabetes-resistant mice was exacerbated.

however relative abundancy of taxa did not differ between dss-treated and control nod mice at week 4 6 or 13 figure 9.discussionin this study we tested whether a brief early-life intervention would influence disease development in nod mice.

in another study the mice failed to develop a significant difference in insulitis until 20 wk even though sig- nificant differences in microbiota gastrointestinal ph and foxp3 expression were demonstrated from 2 wk of age.34 these data further emphasize the robustness of the end-disease outcome of nod mice.the low-dose dss treatment we used had some effect on the gut of nod mice demonstrated by the robust differences in cecal length and weight from week 4 through 13. colonic shortening a standard effect of colonic dss treatment was not significant at week 6 however there was a tendency toward delayed shorten- ing in the dss-treated mice at week 13 despite the lack of changes in the histologic evaluation.

in another report administra- tion of vancomycin to nod mice from fetal life until the end of the study increased disease incidence akkermansia species and th1-type cells pointing to a different microbiotal starting point as well as a difference between brief early-life manipulation and prolonged microbiotal intervention.5 very early-life events that affect the establishment of the diabetogenic microbiota clearly seem to be important for disease development in the nod model.

the insulitis is of a mixed and progressive nature with infiltration innately initiated by neutrophils den- dritic cells and macrophages and continued through both t and b lymphocyte reactivity.1129 typically nod mice are diagnosed when blood glucose reaches 12 mmoll reference value 4 to 6 mmoll beginning at approximately 10 wk of age however prediabetic mechanisms are recognizable from as early as 3 to 6 wk.711 despite the strong genetic and molecular background the model is further complicated in its etiology by many exter- nal manipulations that affect disease outcome.

in addition to a sex-associated bias with an incidence of 40 to 90 in females compared with 10 to 40 in males11 the incidence progression and severity of the hyperglycemia in nod mice are dependent on environmental circumstances from fetus to adult.

housing handling and transportation stress have often been claimed to alter incidence likely mediated through stress-related changes in the gut microbiota.230 gluten in the diet is known as a strong trigger nod mothers kept on a gluten-free diet give birth to lowreceived 30 may 2016. revision requested 09 aug 2016. accepted 08 jan 2017.

in fact a gluten-free diet is a promising prevention in maintaining children off insulin treatment.32because 'diabetogenic' microbiota compositions have been proposed5 factors that influence the gut microbiota composition in nod mice should be assessed.
