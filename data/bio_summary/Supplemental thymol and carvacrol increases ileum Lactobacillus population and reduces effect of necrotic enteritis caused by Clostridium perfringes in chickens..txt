The functional roles of these changing host bacterial populations coupled with the putative reduced pathogenicity of C. perfringens by BEOs contributed to the reduction in gut lesions and mortality in infected chickens.

The etiological agent of NE is C. perfringens a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium .

The genus Clostridium is grouped in the phylum Firmicutes the class Clostridia the order Clostridales and the family Clostridiaceae.C.

The C. perfringens challenge also resulted in a significant increase in bacterial translocation and induced strong inflammatory response in1State Key Laboratory of Animal Nutrition College of Animal Science and Technology China Agricultural University Beijing China.

The traditional identification methods of bacteria have their limitations.

The C. perfringens challenged broilers whose diet was supplemented with BEOs had almost a 5-fold reduction 4 vs 20 in mortality compared to their control counterparts that did not receive the BEOs-supplementation Fig.

The BEOs supplemented birds also had significant reduction in lesion scores P  0.01 compared to their control counterparts Fig.
