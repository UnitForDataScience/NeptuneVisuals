collectively these results indicate that repression of ncoa3 by mir2593 is required for the suppression of cgas in response to hypoxia.the biological significance for mir2593 and cgas in clinical tissuesto test the relevance of these findings to human cancer we first examined the prognostic impact of mir2593.

for panels a-c control n4 tumors from 4 different animals mir2593 n5 tumors from 5 different animals cgas n5 tumors from 5 different animals.

5a and b. likewise tregs were decreased in cgas re-expressing tumors compared with mir2593 overexpressing tumors fig.

inf-b levels were restored in hif-1a-overexpressing tumors in which mir2593 were inhibited as well as in mir2593-overexpressing tumors in which cgas was re-expressed fig.

s6a and b. together these results reveal that the tet1-mir2593 signaling pathway represses a cgas-dependent immune response that results from hypoxia-mediated release of mtdna.to ensure that cgas functions to dampen the immunosuppressive microenvironment we constitutively expressed cgas in mir2593 overexpressing tumors.

analysis of the 3'-utr of the cgas gene did not identify a putative mir2593 target sequence which led us to conclude that mir2593 suppresses cgas expression by targeting other regulators.

we observed decreased levels of inf-b and cgas in hypoxic tumors andhif-1a overexpressing tumors fig.

3i and j. furthermore in tumors overexpressinghif-1a or mir2593 cgas levels were consistently down-regulated fig.

for panels g and h n5 tumors from 5 different animals.for panels j and k control n10 tumors from 10 different animals mir2593 n13 tumors from 13 different animals.

s3g and h. together these results indicate that elevated levels of mir2593 in tumor cells drive the establishment of an immunosuppressive environment.tet1 is important for the up-regulation of mir2593 in response to hypoxiato investigate the molecular mechanism underlying hypoxia-induced mir2593 expression we first examined the role of hif-1a.hif-1a expression was required for hypoxia to induce the expression ofmir2593 fig.

mechanistically mir2593 targets ncoa3 an epigenetic factor that maintains basal levels of cgas expression leading to repression of cgas upon hypoxia.

s7i-k.mir2593 indirectly regulates cgas expression by targeting ncoa3 upon hypoxianext we sought to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which mir2593 represses cgas.

to promote immune avoidance mir2593 repressed cgas by disrupting the epigenetic machinery that maintains basal levels of cgas this machinery includes ncoa3.

5i.in addition we found that tumors lacking cgas were more proliferative than control tumors.

effector cd8 cytotoxic t cells were defined by the production of tnf-a and ifn-g. c decreased levels of cd4foxp3 tregs in cgas re-expressing tumors as compared to mir2593- overexpressing tumors.
