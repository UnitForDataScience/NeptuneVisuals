When growing in a community bacteria can benefit from the metabolic activity of nearby bacteria and gain access to nutrients that would not be available to planktonic bacteria.

Physical interactions can both happen between bacteria and between fungi and bacteria.

To become incorporated in oral microbial communities bacteria often rely on metabolic cooperation of other bacteria and fungi.

An example of this are particular anaerobic bacteria which are dependent on the reduction of local oxygen levels by the rapid oxygen consumption of aerobic bacteria .

Anaerobic bacteria are even able to live when cultured in ambient oxic conditions even though this kind of environment is usually lethal to anaerobic bacteria .

The healthy oral cavity is represented by a great microbial diversity including both bacteria and fungi.

This review set out with the aim of assessing the importance of metabolic interactions between fungi and bacteria in the healthy oral cavity.Keywords oral biofilms bacterium-fungus interactions healthy oral cavity oxygen gradientsIntroductionImportance of Oral HealthPeople are aware that good oral health is very important.

In the oral cavity bacteria convert the NO3 to NO2 that is taken up by the host.

Thus the oral bacteria are truly important for a healthy physiology.J.

He proposed the now widely accepted idea that the resident plaque microflora can shift to a disease-associated species composition by a change in a key environmental factor .The healthy oral cavity is represented by a great diversity of bacteria and fungi.
