aerobic capacity will be used as a reference point to determine the appropriate exercise workloads necessary to meet the energy require- ments for phase 2. participants will perform this assessment at standard ambient indoor temperature and humidity conditions.testosterone and placebo administrationparticipants will receive either 200 mg testosterone enanthate or placebo 1 ml sesame oil by intramuscular injection on days 15 21 28 and 35. based on previous dose-response studies 200 mg of testosterone enanthate was chosen as an effective dose to maintain testosterone within normal physiological ranges while minimizing risk of adverse secondary health effects e.g.

maintaining testosterone within normal physiological ranges is expected to attenuate the loss of ffm by 25 such that those assigned to the testosterone group will lose proportion- ally 30 the same percentage of ffm lost in our previous study when testosterone levels were largely unchanged in participants consuming a higher-protein diet 1.6 gkg-1d-1 energy deficient diet for 21 d .
