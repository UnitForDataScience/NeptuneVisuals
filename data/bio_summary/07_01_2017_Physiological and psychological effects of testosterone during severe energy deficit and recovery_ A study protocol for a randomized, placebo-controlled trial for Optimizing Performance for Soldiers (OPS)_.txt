Varied low- moderate- and high- intensity 40-85 of predetermined VO2peak endurance-type exercise will be performed during the 28-d live-in phase to increase TDEE 50 above phase 1 phase 1 EIEE 50 of phase 1 TDEE  phase 2 EIEE.

Maintaining testosterone within normal physiological ranges is expected to attenuate the loss of FFM by 25 such that those assigned to the testosterone group will lose proportion- ally 30 the same percentage of FFM lost in our previous study when testosterone levels were largely unchanged in participants consuming a higher-protein diet 1.6 gkg-1d-1 energy deficient diet for 21 d .

This interventional trial will delineate the contribution of testosterone declines and benefits of testosterone replacement on complex markers of physiolo- gical and psychological status during prolonged severe energy deficit addressing a direct and consistently observed gap in knowledge.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at .AbbreviationsDEF55 energy deficit diet group with placebo administration- DEF  TEST55 energy deficit diet group with testosterone administrationDXAdual-energy X-ray absorptiometryEIEEex- ercise-induced energy expenditureEOSend of studyFCI-2Food Cravings Inventory 2FCQ-traitFood Cravings Questionnaire- traitfMRIfunctional magnetic resonance imagingHRRheart rate reserveFFMlean body massMMPI-2Minnesota Multipha- sic Personality Inventory-2OPSOptimizing Performance for SoldiersPBRCPennington Biomedical Research CenterTDEEt- otal daily energy expenditureTrial statusThis trial is currently recruiting participants and was approximately 50 complete as of 1 January 2017.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsSMP CEB JPK and HRL were responsible for the conception and design of the study and manuscript writing.

After completing a 14-d energy-adequate diet acclimation phase protein 1.6 gkg-1d-1 fat 30 total energy intake participants will be randomized to undergo a 28-d 55 energy deficit phase with DEF  TEST 200 mg testosterone enanthate per week or without DEF exogenous testosterone.

In addition testosterone measurements will be taken every 90-d starting from day 42 to assure full recovery of endogenous testoster- one production testosterone concentration  300 ngdL once the study has been completed.Experimental physical activityPhysical activity will be highly-controlled and supervised starting on day 15 when phase 2 begins.

Furthermore the effect of testosterone supple- mentation on sleep quantity and quality has not been examined but there may be a relationship between endogenous testosterone levels and both sleep duration and length of wakefulness .Effects of testosterone on appetite regulation during energy deficitAppetite-mediating hormones including peptide-tyrosine tyrosine PYY glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 and ghrelin contribute to the motivation to eat and hunger after weight loss and may underlie thecommon tendency for weight regain .

This study will also assess the effects of normalizing testosterone levels during severe energy deficit and recovery on gut health and appetite regulation.Methods Fifty physically active men will participate in a 3-phase randomized placebo-controlled study.
