Because the proposed test provides a nonparametric group compari- son for microbial interdependence we term our proposed test as the nonparametric microbial interdependence test NMIT.

The definition of hub and the choice of threshold do not affect the test performance we proposed here.In order to test these differences statistically we implementthe NMIT test on this study and present its analysis flowchart in Figure 3.

We also performed the proposed test based on the Pearson and MIC methods and the P-values were 0.001 and 0.003 respectively.Early childhood antibiotics and the microbiome StudyWe also applied the proposed test to a more complex human study.

The ability to incorporate mul- tiple covariates and to adjust the confounding covariates of our proposed test is fulfilled by the permutation MANOVA test utilized in the step 4 of Figure 3.

In Section 2 we describe the data structure and the proposed test.

In Section 3 we illustrate the performance of the test by real data examples and simulations.

Our goal is to test the association between the temporal microbial interde- pendence profiles and the covariates of interest.We propose to first capture the interdependence profile foreach subject by a x pair-wised taxa correlation matrix forand are subject to the irregular sampling times and compli-each subject.

' which measures the temporal correlationIn this paper we propose a novel method to test how inter- dependence of microbial species within a community might differ between groups over time or how these might be asso- ciated by continuous environmental factors such as a drug or diet.

Our method is simple and powerful based on a multivari- ate distance-based nonparametric test.
