Mb1 the DW1 genome sequence was recovered from sequencing of a mixed culture consisting of strains DW1 and Mb1Maus et al.

ING2-D1G are only dis- tantly related to known bacterial species of the familyMaus et al.

Genome analyses provided insights into the life- style and functional roles of bacterial and archaeal strains.Maus et al.

Considering the fact that strain 1A1 originally was isolated from a co-culture also containing C. thermocellum  it is assumed that B. thermoamylovorans 1A1 further metabolizes cellobiose produced by cellulolytic Clostridia.Maus et al.

22-37 M. formicicum MFT M. formicicum Mb9 M. con- golense Buetzberg and C. cellulosi DG5 seem to be if at all of minor importance in most BGPs group IV.Furthermore the non-cultivable fractions of the biogas microbiomes residing in BGPs 1 to 4 were studied by Stolze et al.
