2013. a dentist made a small survey in dental prac- tice and found that the diet of patients with extrinsic black stains on their teeth was rich in cheese which con- tains lactoferrin a protein known for its high affinity for iron mesonjesi 2012. iron existed extensively in the diet the residue on the teeth may participate in the formation of black stain.as one of the most important metal element in human it is not surprising to find iron in both black stain and dental plaque.

the iron levels were significantly higher in the bs than in the pc p  0001 which were in accord with reid suggesting a role for iron in the black material of the teeth.

3. it is interesting that some ko enriched in black stain were composite of ferrous iron k04758 k04759 while ko enriched in plaque of control group were composite of ferric iron k02010k02011 k02012.

iron primarily exists as two cations the oxidized ferric fe3 form and the reduced ferrous fe2 form cassat and skaar 2013. it was inferred that some bacteria in black stain were anaerobic iron existed as ferrous form in them.iron plays an important role in transporter system.

2014. it was interesting to find the magne- siumiron transport system group m00317 shows increased activity in the bs group while the magnesium iron transporter m00319 and the iron iii transporter m00190 showed increased activity for the ps group.

different bacteria use different iron sources through dif- ferent iron transporters lau et al.

letters in applied microbiology issn 0266-8254original article a preliminary study on the relationship between iron and black extrinsic tooth stain in childrenf.

to determine whether iron exists in black stain we collected 10 samples of black stain and 10 samples of plaque separately from children with and without black stain using sterile titanium implant curettes and analysed the samples by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.

iron was present in both black stain and plaque with concentrations ranging from 7612 to 111688 lg g-1.

the contents of iron in black stain were significantly higher than in plaque.

1977 suggested that the pigment in chil- dren's teeth was probably ferric sulphide formed by the reaction between hydrogen sulphide produced by bacterial action and iron in the saliva or gingival exudate.

the eds enabledmain element identification with a precision of -1. we do not fully accept this opinion because metallic ions such as iron widely exist in food as minor elements and inevitably have trace amounts of residual on the teeth.
