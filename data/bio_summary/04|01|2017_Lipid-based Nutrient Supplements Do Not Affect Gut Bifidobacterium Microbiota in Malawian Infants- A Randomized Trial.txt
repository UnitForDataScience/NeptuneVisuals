A linear relation was observed between cell numbers and Ct values r2 0.99-0.97.The following reference strains were used to construct the corresponding standard curves B longum DSM 20219 this strain was also used as the standard strain for quantification of total bacteria and the Bifidobacterium genus B catenulatum JCM 7130 B bifidum DSM 20456 B lactis DSM 220606 B infantis DSM 20090 B adolescentis DSM 20083 B breve DSM 20213 and S aureus DSM 20231.

Interestingly the Bifidobacterium microbiota seemed to change toward a more of an adult-type profile with lower prevalence or counts of B infantis B lactis and B longum B bifidum and B breve and higher levels of B catenulatum.

The colonization rates of B longum B bifidum B infantis B breve and B lactis were lower at 12 months compared with 6 months of age 100 vs 91.7P 0.001 94.5 vs 82.8 P 0.001 94.5 vs 84.1 P 0.01295.9 vs 83.4 P 0.001 and 78.6 vs 60.0 P  0.001respectively.

When looking at the total study population higher counts of total bacteria P 14 0.028 Bifidobacterium genus P 14 0.027 B catenulatum P 14 0.031 and lower counts of B infantis P  0.001 B lactis P  0.001 B longum P  0.001 and S aureus P  0.001 were detected in the children's stools at 12 months rather than at 6 months of age.

Bifidobacteria were detectable in all study infants and the highest colonization rates were noted for the species B longum B bifidum B infantis and B breve which were all detected in at least 90 of the infants at baseline 2.

It seems that bifidobacteria formed a major part of the gut microbiota of the study infants with bacterial counts reaching 10 log cellsg and higher for the species B longum and B infantis at baseline across all intervention groups 3.The dietary supplements did not have an effect on the colonization rates or bacterial counts when the analysis was con- trolled for baseline values P  0.05.

In this model the intervention type and time were added as independent variables the primary variable eg B longum or B infantis measured at baseline was included as a covariate and individual was included as a random factor.
