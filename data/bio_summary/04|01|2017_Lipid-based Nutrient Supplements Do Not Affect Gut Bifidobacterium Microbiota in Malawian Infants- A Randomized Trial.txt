at baseline only 2 infants had been exclusively breast-fed whereas the other infants had received complementary local foods such as fluids including tea waterand rice water and solid foods including thin maize porridge bean fish meat and vegetable soup 1. five infants were hospi- talized during the study period but only 2 of the study infants received antibiotics during the follow-up 1.the colonization rates of different bacteria at 6 and 12 months of age are shown in 2. bifidobacteria were detectable in all study infants and the highest colonization rates were noted for the species b longum b bifidum b infantis and b breve which were all detected in at least 90 of the infants at baseline 2. similarly the counts of each bacterial species at both time points are presented in 3. it seems that bifidobacteria formed a major part of the gut microbiota of the study infants with bacterial counts reaching 10 log cellsg and higher for the species b longum and b infantis at baseline across all intervention groups 3.the dietary supplements did not have an effect on the colonization rates or bacterial counts when the analysis was con- trolled for baseline values p  0.05. nevertheless changes in the microbiota composition were observed in the whole population over time.

a linear relation was observed between cell numbers and ct values r2 0.99-0.97.the following reference strains were used to construct the corresponding standard curves b longum dsm 20219 this strain was also used as the standard strain for quantification of total bacteria and the bifidobacterium genus b catenulatum jcm 7130 b bifidum dsm 20456 b lactis dsm 220606 b infantis dsm 20090 b adolescentis dsm 20083 b breve dsm 20213 and s aureus dsm 20231. the primer sequences of the reference611aakko et aljpgn  volume 64 number 4 april 2017strains and the annealing temperatures of the primers have been published elsewhere statistical methodsbacterial counts were not normally distributed and therefore nonparametric methods were used for the analysis.

interestingly the bifidobacterium microbiota seemed to change toward a more of an adult-type profile with lower prevalence or counts of b infantis b lactis and b longum b bifidum and b breve and higher levels of b catenulatum.

the colonization rates of b longum b bifidum b infantis b breve and b lactis were lower at 12 months compared with 6 months of age 100 vs 91.7p 0.001 94.5 vs 82.8 p 0.001 94.5 vs 84.1 p 0.01295.9 vs 83.4 p 0.001 and 78.6 vs 60.0 p  0.001respectively.

when looking at the total study population higher counts of total bacteria p 14 0.028 bifidobacterium genus p 14 0.027 b catenulatum p 14 0.031 and lower counts of b infantis p  0.001 b lactis p  0.001 b longum p  0.001 and s aureus p  0.001 were detected in the children's stools at 12 months rather than at 6 months of age.

in this model the intervention type and time were added as independent variables the primary variable eg b longum or b infantis measured at baseline was included as a covariate and individual was included as a random factor.

it has been reported that microbial antigens possess immunomodulatory properties which may affect the immune development and normal responses in a positive manner in addition a study conducted by lundell et aldemonstrated that infants who harbored low numbers of s aureus in the gut during the first weeks of life had decreased risk of developing food allergy compared with children devoid of this species.
