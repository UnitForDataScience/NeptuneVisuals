The no- slip boundary conditions are enforced on solid including biofilm cell surfaces through the half-way bounce-back scheme Sukop and Thorne 2007 which means that the physical boundary is located half-way between the fluid and solid cells.The resulting flow field and the biomass concentration field from the previous time t are used to solve the chemical species equation Equation 3 through the explicit finite difference method in which small time steps are used to ensure numerical stability.The resulting chemical species concentration field and the flow field are used to solve the biomass equations Equations 7-10 using the cellular automaton.

vin Cupperin Clowerin in Table I we simulate the distribution of biomass species concentrations of chemical species and fluid flow in the flow cell for 500 days.Distribution of Biomass SpeciesFigure 3 shows the simulated distributions of biomass species.

The flow and biofilm interact while the biofilms are generally oriented along the flow directions due to shearing effects the flow velocity and porosity both decrease in the pore due to biomass growth.

In this work we simulate a microfluidic flow cell that mimics the transverse mixing zone in bioremediation of UIV.

Thus two-dimensional simulation will be conducted throughout this work.Numerical ModelSimulated ScenarioThe microfluidic flow cell that we simulate is widely used to study the pore-scale porous media e.g.

As shown in Figure 1 the dimensions of the flow cell are small 1820 mm length 1820 mm width 15 mm depth to save computa- tional time.

Since the depth of the flow cell is two orders of magnitude smaller than the length and width the model can be simplified to be two-dimensional i.e.

The flow cell contains a staggered periodic array of uniform cylindrical posts 300 mm in diameter with 180 mm pore bodies 40 mm pore throats and a porosity of 0.39.
