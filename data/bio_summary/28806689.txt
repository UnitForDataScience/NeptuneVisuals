The data underpinned the prevalence of Yarrowia lipolytica and Galactomyces geotrichum for both microbiotas.

The metagenomic revealed also the presence of Kluyveromyces and Debaryomyces species.IntroductionAdvances in genomic and metagenomic sequencing are providing researchers and industrialists with insightful informations on the bac- terial fungal and viral diversities in many traditionally produced foods.

The 5.8S rDNA is highly conserved and could permit accurate taxo- nomic information conversely to the ITS1 and ITS2 regions which are highly variable give the species status .

The NGS Illumina sequencing allow high throughput sequencing of total DNA without any prior culture and provide therefore data on the viable-but- not-cultivable strains .

The NGS Illumina technology is anticipated to evolve and become likely a routinely used method because of its swiftness and ease of utilization  .

The use of a culture- dependent approach  and a metagenomic technology  permitted to draw the first yeast and bacterial snapshots.

The forward primer ITS3KYO2 5'- GATGAAGAACGYAGYRAA-3' and the reverse primer ITS4 5'- TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3' were used for their high coverage of fungi taxon .

The PCR products were purified as indicated above.

The clustering distance for operational taxonomic unit OTU is 0.03.

The sequences corresponding to the starter D. hansenii were ranging from 0.08 at the beginning to 0.02 at the end of the repining.
