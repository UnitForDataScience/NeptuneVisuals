These results confirm that B. desmolans ATCC 43058 elaborates a 20-HSDH but lacks 20-HSDH activity.Identification of the steroid-1720-desmolase operon and prediction of a novel 20-HSDH gene in B. desmolans ATCC 43058The desA-deduced amino acid sequence CLOSCI00899 from C. scindens ATCC 35704 was used to query the nonre- dundant protein database BLASTP.

2.Characterization of mRNA encoding desEAB operon in B. desmolansTo determine whether the desEAB genes are coex- pressed as a polycistronic operon we isolated total RNA from mid-log phase B. desmolans and designed oligonu- cleotides supplemental Table S1 spanning the intergenic regions between desE-desA and desA-desB.

Indeed desAB genes were not found in any other members of clusters 1 2 and 3 except for B. desmolans C. cadaveris and P. lymphophilum.Verification of functional steroid metabolic activity by selected members of cluster III of the 20-HSDH phylogenyWe next sought to determine whether two organisms whose gene products cluster closely with the 20-HSDH from B. desmolans ATCC 43058 exhibited 20-HSDH activity.

We detected the formation of 20- dihydrocortisol when cortisol was the substrate however we did not detect the oxidation of 20-dihydrocortisol by whole-cells of B. scardovii which is consistent with the ob- servation that at equilibrium the recombinant 20-HSDH from B. desmolans converted 98 of cortisol to 20- dihydrocortisol in vitro over a 24 h period.

In this work we identified and located a gene encoding 20-HSDH in both B. desmolans and C. cadaveris.

The 20-HSDH of B. desmolans was heterologously overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli.

Phylogenetic analy- sis of the 20-HSDH from B. desmolans suggested that the 20-HSDH is found in several Bifidobacterium spp.

Unlike C. scindens ATCC 35704 which elaborates 20-HSDH both C. cadaveris and B. desmolans have been reported to express 20-HSDH activity 10.

desmolans ATCC 43058 B. scardovii ATCC BAA-773 and C. scindens ATCC 35704 were cultivated in supplemented brain heart infusion BHI broth containing 5 g l1 of yeast extract.P.
