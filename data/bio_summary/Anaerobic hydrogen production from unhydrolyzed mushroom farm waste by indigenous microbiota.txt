The proper pH for the fermentative bioH2 production from MW using indigenous bacteria ranged from 5 to 10 with an optimal value of8.2 for peak HY and HPR.also reveals that HAc was the main soluble metabolite and the metabolic pathway during bioH2 production from MW did not affect by various pH.Substrate concentration effect and kinetics The MW con- centration effect on bioH2 production performance was studied in a batch experiment with initial pH 8.0 Endo nutrient formula tem- perature 55oC MW substrate concentration 10e60 gL and enriched MW indigenous bacteria 2.8 g VSSL.

Therefore the present study aims to determine a suitable model to describe the MW concentration effects on anaerobic hydrogen production rate.This study evaluates the effects of various concentrations ofenriched indigenous microbiota operating pH and substrate con- centration on bioH2 production from unhydrolysed MW.MATERIALS AND METHODSSubstrate and seed inoculum Mushroom waste MW was collected from a mushroom farm located in Central Taiwan.

Our results demonstrate that a mild alkaline condition resulted in enhanced bioH2 production from MW probably due to cellulosic materials hydrolysis into reduced sugars and served as pretreating MW for fermentation in a single step.

A simple bioH2 production pro- cess without a hydrolysis pretreatment step for MW fermentation via MW indigenous bacteria was developed.

Using the enriched MW indigenous bacteria at 2.8 g VSSL for bioH2 fermentation at pH 8 and MW concentration of 20 gL could give peak HY of 0.61 mmol H2g TVS.

MW indigenous bacteria were enriched using thermophilic temperature 55oC for use as the seed inoculum without any external seeding.

The fermentation bioH2 production from MW is in an acetate-type metabolic path.c 2017 The Society for Biotechnology Japan.
