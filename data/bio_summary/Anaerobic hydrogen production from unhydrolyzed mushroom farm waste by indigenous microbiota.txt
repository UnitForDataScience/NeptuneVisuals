therefore the present study aims to determine a suitable model to describe the mw concentration effects on anaerobic hydrogen production rate.this study evaluates the effects of various concentrations ofenriched indigenous microbiota operating ph and substrate con- centration on bioh2 production from unhydrolysed mw.materials and methodssubstrate and seed inoculum mushroom waste mw was collected from a mushroom farm located in central taiwan.

the maximum cumulative bioh2 production of29.6 ml hy of 0.55 mmol h2g tvs and hpr of 4.16 mmol h2l- d were obtained at ph 8.0. at ph 9.0 although an hy of 0.52 mmol h2g tvs a small decrease -5 was obtained the hpr reduced from 4.16 mmol h2l-d to 3.57 mmol h2l-d a decrease of 14. our results demonstrate that a mild alkaline condition resulted in enhanced bioh2 production from mw probably due to cellulosic materials hydrolysis into reduced sugars and served as pretreating mw for fermentation in a single step.

a simple bioh2 production pro- cess without a hydrolysis pretreatment step for mw fermentation via mw indigenous bacteria was developed.

using the enriched mw indigenous bacteria at 2.8 g vssl for bioh2 fermentation at ph 8 and mw concentration of 20 gl could give peak hy of 0.61 mmol h2g tvs.

yuanlin city changhua county 510 taiwan6received 6 november 2016 accepted 2 may 2017available online 7 june 2017the cultivation of mushrooms generates large amounts of waste polypropylene bags stuffed with wood flour and bacterial nutrients that makes the mushroom waste mw a potential feedstock for anaerobic bioh2 fermentation.

mw indigenous bacteria were enriched using thermophilic temperature 55oc for use as the seed inoculum without any external seeding.

the fermentation bioh2 production from mw is in an acetate-type metabolic path.c 2017 the society for biotechnology japan.

mushroom waste mw has attained attention as feedstock for anaerobic bioh2 production because its components are produced in large amounts and easily collected .

mw is comprised of mushroom poly- propylene bags stuffed with wood flour and nutrients.

taiwan produces about 150 million bags 80000 tons of mw annually and proper disposal or usage is necessary to avoid environmental problems.

the mw lignocellulosic components are converted into reduced sugars using concentrated sulfuric acid via hydrolysis with a one or two-step process.

the pretreated mw was used to increase the reducing sugar yield but it also increased the process complexity corresponding author at green energy technology research group ton duc thang university 19 nguyen huu tho district no.
