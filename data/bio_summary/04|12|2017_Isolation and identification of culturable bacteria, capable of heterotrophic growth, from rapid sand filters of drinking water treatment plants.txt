The bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy number of both SF samples was determined using real-time quantitative PCR qPCR as described previ- ously .Isolation of sand filter bacteria and DNA extraction from pure culturesSF suspensions were obtained by dispersing 5 g SF material in 100 mL 0.01 M MgSO4 stirring for 3 h at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker and settling of coarse material for 1 h. A tenfold dilution series from 1 to 1000  was made from this sus- pension and 100 mL of each dilution was plated on different media including LuriaeBertani LB Reasoner and Geldreich R2A  MMO composition of the media provided in Table S2 and a number of media based on 10-fold diluted LB.

Obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KU233235 - KU233260.454 bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencingThe bacterial community composition of both SF samples was determined by 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons.

Tree was rooted using the 16S rRNA gene sequence of isolate K27 Rhodococcus sp..Whole sand filter bacterial community composition as revealed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencingIn total 326 bacterial OTUs were identified with 454 pyrosequencing 169 and 76 OTUs were unique for Kluizen and Klein-Sinaai respectively and 81 were common in both SF samples.

It remains to be elucidated whether or not the SFI are strict heterotrophs and which metabolic pathways they use in the SF environment.In conclusion the use of long incubation times and diluted media that mimic the natural environment shows great po- tential for cost- and labor-effective isolation of drinking water SF bacteria.

This is important since organisms that can perform a heterotrophic or mixotrophic lifestyle i will contribute to AOC reduction and hence affect the risk of bacterial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems  ii are likely responsible for organic xenobiotic degradation and iii might affect the survival and activity of accidentally or deliberately introduced organisms .While NGS-based studies have increased our knowledge of SF microbial ecology pure cultures remain of interest.

Focusing on hetero- trophic carbon metabolism bacteria were isolated from SFs using conventional media and media that contained SF extracts to mimic the SF environment.

To attain those objectives a thorough understanding of the composition and functionality of the resident SF microbiome is needed.Little is known however about SF microbial commu- nities their dynamics and functionality.

The fourth and fifth media were identical to the second and third media but supplemented with a phosphate buffer LB110-K-P and LB110-S-P. SF extracts were prepared by suspending 300 g SF material in 1 L mQ- H2O shaking of the suspension for 3 h at 150 rpm centrifu- gation and filtration of the supernatant using 0.22 mm pore size filters.
