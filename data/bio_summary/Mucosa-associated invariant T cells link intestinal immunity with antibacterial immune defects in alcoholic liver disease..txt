these alterations were stronger in SaH where surrogate markers of bacterial infection and microbial translocation were higher than arc.ethanol exposure in vitro in vivo alcohol withdrawal and treatment with Escherichia coli had no effect on Mait cell frequencies whereas exposure to faecal bacteria antigens induced functional impairments comparable with blood Mait cells from alD and significant Mait cell depletion which was not observed in other t cell compartments.Conclusions in alD the antibacterial potency of Mait cells is compromised as a consequence of contact with microbial products and microbiota suggesting that the 'leaky' gut observed in alD drives Mait cell dysfunction and susceptibility to infection in these patients.InTroduCTIonAlcohol-related liver cirrhosis ARC induces a state of profound immunodeficiency known as cirrhosis-associated immunodeficiency syndrome CAIDS.

CD69 can suppress T cell functions through binding with its putative ligand Galectin 1 Gal1and we found that Gal1 expression was stronger in SAH liver tissue than controls p0.001  suggesting greater ability of CD69-medi- ated intrahepatic MAIT cell inhibition in these patients.We then assessed whether MAIT cells exhibited signs of exhaustion and immune senescence and found no evidence of this phenotype in ALD expression of immune checkpoint receptors PD1TIM3LAG3 on blood MAIT cells was compa- rable in patients and controls  culture of MAIT cells with anti-PD1 antibodies did not modulate MAIT cell pheno- type or function data not shown furthermore proliferation or senescence markers Ki67CD57 were comparable on blood MAIT cells in all subjects .We next measured MAIT cell antibacterial cytokine produc- tion IFNgTNFaIL-17 and cytotoxic capabilities GranzymeB CD107aPerforin in response to E. coli challenge.

Moreover in ALD it is well described that dysbiosis and micro- biota composition are further detrimental to gut barrier integrity due to the increased production of toxic bacterial metabolites such as phenolic compounds which increase inflammation and directly drive intestinal permeability.Several other mechanisms could also have been responsible for the observed MAIT cell depletion during ALD including direct ethanol toxicity or loss of detection due to activation-re- lated CD161 downregulation.We excluded these hypotheses experimentally and our data suggest that MAIT cell depletion is a direct consequence of contact with gut bacteria bacterial anti- gens and metabolites due to loss of gut integrity and increased gut permeability as likelier pathogenic mechanisms possiblythrough activation-induced cell death.

Our investigation excludes caspase-dependent apoptosis as the driving cause of MAIT cell loss in our study and we believe that other pathways of both programmed and accidental caspase-independent cell death may be at play such as autophagy necroptosis pyroptosis or necrosis.The processes by which MAIT cells die have not been fully elucidated in the literature and this does require more in-depth investigations.It has been suggested that recent excess drinking may cause a significant decrease in circulating lymphocyte levels in alcohol users compared with those without recent drinking.As all the patients in the current study were actively drinking this could be a contributing factor to the observed MAIT cell reduction.

Intrahepatic MAIT cell preservation and increased MR1 expression in ALD livers may also favour intensified MAIT-mediated tissue damage as MAIT cells can kill MR1-expressing cells.Notably not only did we observe higher basal expression of MAIT cell cytotoxicity markers in ALD than controls but among ALD patients we also observed a small trend for stronger bacteria-induced MAIT cell cytotox- icity in those with increased plasma markers of bacterial trans- location.

One of the most potent MAIT-stimulating cytokines IL-7 induced MAIT cell functional restoration in HIVreactivating MAIT cell proliferation and cytokine production including IL-17.IL-7 is relevant to liver disease being one of the first and strongest cytokines produced by hepatocytes during liver inflammation.However in our study blood MAIT cells expressed IL-7R CD127 regardless of disease status suggesting IL-7 as potential novel immunotherapeutic target for MAIT cell functional rescue in ALD.

We believe that MAIT cell defects may be important for the susceptibility to infection observed in ALD responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in these patients.Further- more we believe that MAIT cells provide an important link to the intestinal immunity which has to date remained elusive in this disease.The state of immunoparesis characteristic of patients with ALD especially patients with SAH may be intensified by the combination of quantitative MAIT cell depletion and func- tional defects associated with the residual MAIT cell popula- tion.

Infection in ARC precipitates severe complications including septic shock acute-on-chronic liver failure and multi- organ failure.Therefore it is imperative that we delineate common and divergent immune pathways in ARC and SAH to develop specific and targeted immunotherapeutic strategies to reconstitute the host immunity rather than the continued use of antibiotics in an era of multidrug resistance.MAIT cells are innate-like CD161-positive antibac- terial T cells considered key for the immune control of gut microbiota bacterial infection and inflamma- tory diseases.Initially characterised in the intes- tinal mucosa they are now known to be the most predominant population of intrahepatic T cells and appear in high frequencies in the peripheral blood physiologically.MAIT cells have a semi-invariant T cell receptor containing the Va7.2-Ja33 chain and a diverse Vb-chain pool.They recognise riboflavin metabolites of bacterialfungal origin presented via the major histocompatibility complex MHC-related molecule 1 MR1which is inducible upon bacterial infectionor IFNg stimulationand expressed on various cells including B cells and monocyte.Mature MAIT cells are predominantly CD8 single-posi- tiveexpress the immunoenzyme CD26 the inter- leukin IL-7IL-18 receptors and respond to both T cell receptor TCR-dependent and TCR-indepen- dent stimulation.Activated MAIT cells perform antibacterial functions by secreting cytokines IFNgTNFaIL-17 and killing MR1-positive infected cells.Given that MAIT cells defend the host at key loca- tions associated with alcohol-induced liver injury namely the gut and the liver we hypothesised that918Riva A et al.
