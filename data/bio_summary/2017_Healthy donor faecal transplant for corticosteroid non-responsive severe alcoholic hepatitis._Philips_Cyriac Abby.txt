In mice model Llopis et al demonstrated thatindividual susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease ALD was substantially driven by intestinal micro- biota IM and that IM manipulation could help prevent and manage ALD.Ferrere et al confirmed that manipulation of IM prevented alcohol-induced liver injury in mice and IM manipulation be consid- ered as a new therapeutic target in ALD.A small pilot study on faecal microbiota transplantation FMT in patients with SAH who were ineligible for steroid treatment due to various contraindica- tions demonstrated significant survival benefit in the short and long term in comparison to histor- ical controls with similar disease severity profile.

In the study by Philips et al in steroid ineligible SAH resolution of ascites and HE following FMT associated with improved 1 year survival rate compared with historical controls 87.5 compared with 33.3 was noted.Bajaj et al in their study on FMT versus standard of care for recurrent HE found that none of the patients in the FMT arm developed overt HE and that FMT increased diversity and beneficial taxa in treated patients.

On principal component analysis  a statistical analysis technique used to emphasise variation we found that the patient and donor microbiome profiles werePhilips CA et al.

This could have been due to durable coexistence of donor and patient microbial communities post-FMT as was shown in the study by Li et al.

Healthy donor FMT could be safe and efficacious in SAH not responding to corticosteroid treatment as a bridge to liver transplantation LT orin candidates who are unwilling or not ideal for LT for improvement in short-term transplant free survival.Larger controlled studies are required for confirmation.BackgroundPatients with severe alcoholic hepatitis SAH defined as patients with clinical and biochem- ical features of AH with discriminant function DF 32 or model for end-stage liver disease MELD 21 or presence of hepatic encephalop- athy HE 2 are treated with corticosteroids CS prednisolone at a dose of 40 mg per day as per current guideline recommendations.The Lille model score is used to evaluate response to CS therapy at day 7.

Given worsening liver severity indices and clinical status the family was counselled regarding liver transplantation as the cura- tive treatment of choice.

FMT could be safe beneficial efficacious and cost-effective in patients who are not immediate candidates for liver transplantation as a bridge therapy and for patients with SAH not willing for or poor candidates for liver transplantation as salvage therapy for improving short-term and long-term transplant-free survival.contributors CAP study concept and design acquisition of data analysis NP and KG interpretation of data and analysis PA critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content all authors finalised manuscript content.competing interests None declared.patient consent obtained.provenance and peer review Not commissioned externally peer reviewed.c BMJ Publishing Group Ltd unless otherwise stated in the text of the article 2017.

The cost and risks associated with curative living donor liver transplantation and prolonged wait list timing on the deceased donor programme is a major deter- rent towards patient and family compliance to this treatment3 learning pointsmodality in a developing country like India.

Spontaneous improvement in our patient in the wake of high liver disease and alcoholic hepatitis severity scores was unlikely.
