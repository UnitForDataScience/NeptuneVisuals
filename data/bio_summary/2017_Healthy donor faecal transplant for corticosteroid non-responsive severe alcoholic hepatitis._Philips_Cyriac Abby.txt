in mice model llopis et al demonstrated thatindividual susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease ald was substantially driven by intestinal micro- biota im and that im manipulation could help prevent and manage ald.ferrere et al confirmed that manipulation of im prevented alcohol-induced liver injury in mice and im manipulation be consid- ered as a new therapeutic target in ald.a small pilot study on faecal microbiota transplantation fmt in patients with sah who were ineligible for steroid treatment due to various contraindica- tions demonstrated significant survival benefit in the short and long term in comparison to histor- ical controls with similar disease severity profile.

in the study by philips et al in steroid ineligible sah resolution of ascites and he following fmt associated with improved 1 year survival rate compared with historical controls 87.5 compared with 33.3 was noted.bajaj et al in their study on fmt versus standard of care for recurrent he found that none of the patients in the fmt arm developed overt he and that fmt increased diversity and beneficial taxa in treated patients.

on principal component analysis  a statistical analysis technique used to emphasise variation we found that the patient and donor microbiome profiles werephilips ca et al.

this could have been due to durable coexistence of donor and patient microbial communities post-fmt as was shown in the study by li et al.

we found discrepancies on principal coordinate analysis of the patient microbial communities between day 8 more towards donor profile and day 30 in between donor and patient profiles.
