however the stringentregulation of probiotics is beginning to detrimentally affect the field and limit their application.introductionthe fermentation of food by microbes has been employed for millennia as a process to ensure extended shelf life and improve the functionality texture and flavour of food products.

traditionally the presence of bas in food products is associated with undesirable microbial activity indicating food spoilage or defective manufacture.

it is essential that labelling of fermented food products with clinically proven health benefits is permitted to allow industry to begin to profit from funding these trials or they will begin to invest in marketing strategies rather than the much-needed research.

probiotics and their fermented food products are beneficial for health.

the focus of this review is to look at advances in the past three years in the field of microbial fermenta- tion with a focus on food and added health benefits of fermentation including extraneous commercial and legislative factors impacting the field .fermentation starter cultures and by-products of fermentationstarter cultures which carry out the fermentation process are used to ensure consistency in commercial products by using known species with desirable traits such as a high rate of acidification through the production of lactic acid andor the secretion of secondary metabolites into the fermentate matrix .

this is in stark contrast to the health claims made for most commercial fermented dairy products that indicate the benefits of using safe known starter cultures.prebioticsin 2008 prebiotics were defined by the international scientific association for probiotics and prebiotics isapp as a selectively fermented ingredient that results in specific changes in the compo- sition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus con- ferring benefits upon host health'' a definition that is currently being further revised by isapp.

though the lab are a diverse group of bacteria many species enjoy historical generally regarded as safe gras and qualified presumption of safety qps status by the food and drug administration fda and european food safety authority efsa respectively.

now that the mechanisms by which these fermentations can beneficially affect human health are beginning to be elucidated food guidelines around the world are slowly beginning to recommend their con- sumption.

japanese authorities list fermented foods in the food of specified health use foshu category and in india the guide- lines specifically encourage the consumption of fermented foods.

these studies will hope- fully lead to a change in labelling laws to allow for clinically proven health claims to be present on fermented dairy products.conclusionmicrobial fermentation holds the key to some extremely complex interactions between bacterial species and the food matrix they are fermenting.

dietary interventions in adoles- cents of more fermented foods containing beneficial brain bacteria could help prevent the onset of depression and anxiety among other mental health issues which are becoming more prevalent.national recommendationsfermented foods have been consumed worldwide for thousands of years before any direct health benefits were truly understood.

since december 2012 in europe labelling of a probiotic was banned along with the use of health claims in any product without receiving approval from efsa which has yet to approve any probiotic health claim.
