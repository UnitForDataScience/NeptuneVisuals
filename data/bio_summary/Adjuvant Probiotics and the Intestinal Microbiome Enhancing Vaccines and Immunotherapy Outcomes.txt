The intestinal bacteria whether pathogenic or commensal interact with the intestinal mucosal lymphoid system through PRRs that are expressed on specialized intestinal epithelial M cells and dendritic cells.

A plausible posit is that probiotics can improve vaccine responses by encouraging the intestinal microbiome to restore eubiosis that restores intestinal immunological homeostasis.

paracasei NTU 101 that had been administered daily to mice for three to nine weeks induced a more pronounced effect between CD4 T cells and dendritic cells and enhanced the proliferation of CD4T cells and B cells .

Moreover a similar effect was observed for the tetanus antigen but there was no such effect observed for the probiotic group on haemophilus influenza type b vaccination.In response to hepatitis B vaccination in allergy-prone infants formula-fed supplemented with Bifidobacterium longum BL999 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LPR or a control formula without probiotics in the first 6-months of life in new-borns there was no reported significant trend for the probiotic formulation to increase hepatitis B virus surface antibody responses in the infants that received hepatitis B hexavalent diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis combination vaccine .

Probiotics are reported to improve intestinal microbial profiles by balancing and promoting homeostasis in the microbial community following perturbing events that can trigger intestinal microbial dysbiosis as well as intestinal epithelial cell dysbiosis a gut barrier abnormality such as the administration of antibiotic therapy .

An intestinal resident immunity equilibrium is present that links the intestinal bacteria the intestinal epithelia and the host's immune response that leads to homeostasis maintenance.

The intestinal epithelia through its secretory antibacterial peptides and innate and adaptive immune system network of cells regulate intestinal immunity.

Probiotics can mediate immunological effects directly through their interaction with intestinal immune cells and epithelial cells or indirectly through modulation of theintestinal microbiome .
