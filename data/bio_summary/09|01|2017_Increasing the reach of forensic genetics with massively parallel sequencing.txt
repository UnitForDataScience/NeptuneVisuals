However microbial foren- sics now can contribute to human identification potentially geolocation and human networking postmortem interval esti- mation  and even profiling of evidentiary soil samples .The human genome contains approximately 20000 genes however the human microbiome carries well over 1000000 genes -.

The advent of MPS will impact forensic science in many ways - hopefully all to the benefit of society.Key pointsForensic genetics has made great strides both scientifical- ly and as a forensic science standard since its inception in the 1980s.The latest technology being embraced by forensic genet- ics is massively parallel sequencing MPS.MPS offers higher throughput so more markers different classes of markers and multiple individuals can be ana- lyzed simultaneously.MPS also offers a unified approach that can be applied for human identification and beyond to analysis in molecular autopsy and identification of animals plants and microbes.Compliance with ethical standards The authors state that they have no conflicts of interest to declare related to this Review.

Long before the inception of microbial forensics epidemiologists were sequencing microbes in civil and criminal investigations such as tracing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus HIV from healthcare pro- viders to their patients or lovers   which continues to this day with a landmark case example of identifying the health care provider source of a large epidemic outbreak of hepatitis C virus HCV transmission to patients in Spain .

However the through- put power of MPS allows for sequencing entire human ge- nomes and with effective bioinformatics tools to compare both genomes those few variants can now be elucidated.

But whole human genome sequencing although not likely to be used routinely will potentially create some privacy issues.
