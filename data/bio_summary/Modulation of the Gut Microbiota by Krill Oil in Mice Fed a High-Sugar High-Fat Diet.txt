To discern whether krill oil changes the structure of the gut microbiota during the hyperlipidemia treatment 72 mice were acclimatized with a standard chow diet for 2 weeks and then randomly allocated to receive a standard chow diet control group n  12 or a high-sugar-high-fat HSHF diet supplemented with a low 100 uggd HSHFLD group n  12 moderate 200 uggd HSHFMD group n  12 or high dosage of krill oil 600 uggd HSHFHD group n  12 simvastatin HSHFS group n  12 or saline HSHF group n  12 continuously for 12 weeks.

And the raw reads in each group are control group 39207 36383 and 26214 HSHF group 40795 31757and 21003 HSHFLD group 21404 41845 and 23910HSHFMD group 37709 45256 and 30429 HSHFHDgroup 27117 29835 and 26325 and HSHFS group 3484930748 and 19576.The diversity of the microbial communities was measured using the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices Figure S3.

The OTUs with a decreased abundance after HSHF diet treatment and a restored abundance after krill oil treatment are labeled in red and the OTUs with an increased abundance after HSHF diet treatment and a restored abundance after krill oil treatment are labeled in green.

The low- and moderate-dose krill oil treatments shifted the overall compositions of the gut microbiota in the HSHF group toward the composition of the control group whereas the HSHFHD group showed a unique pattern that was different from that in the HSHF and control groups.

The low and moderate-dose krill oil treatment attenuated the changes in the gut microbiota structures whereas the high-dose treatment aggravated the changes in some phyla Figure 4A Table S4.

The effects on the obesity was not obvious after low and moderate dose krill oil treatment and a control-like gut microbiota structure with increased abundance of Serratia Delftia and Streptococcus in the gut and decreased proportion of Ralstonia were observed.

The other three groups were maintained on the HSHF diet with a gavage of krill oil purchased from Sino-Ocean Co. Ltd. Dalian China by gavage at low 100 uggd HSHFLD group moderate 200 uggd HSHFMD group and high dosages 600 uggd HSHFHD group for 12 weeks.

The LDL TC and TG levels weresignificantly decreased in the HSHFMD group P  0.05 and the HSHFHD group P  0.01 compared to those in the HSHF group.

The biochemical blood indices liver index and shift in the structure of the gut microbiota in response to krill oil treatment at different doses were examined in mice.

The krill oil treatment restored the bacterial diversity regardless of the krill oil dose with an increased Shannon index as well as a reduced Simpson index compared with those in the HSHF group.The overall compositions of the gut microbiota in the six groups were analyzed via Weighted and Unweighted UniFrac PCoA Figure 3 Figure S4.
