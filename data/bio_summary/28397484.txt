The set of microor- ganisms living in our gut is defined gut mi- crobiota which is considered now a functional organ of our body.

Finally a growing body of evidence points to the microbiota playing a significant role in modulating brain function and behaviour and that the microbiota-gut- brain axis poised as a bidirectional communi- cation pathway enabling gut microbes to com-municate with the brain and the brain with the gut.

in 2016 an european consensus conference on fecal transplantation in clinical practice was hold in rome.The continuous use of words such as gastro- intestinal microbiome probiotics prebiotics fecal microbiota transplantation also through the media communications suggests that this monography which is totally dedicated to the main relationships between gut echological system and diseases based on the most recent literature could be a useful instrument both for research and for clinical practice in medicine and biology.Conflicts of interest.--The authors certify that there is no conflict of interest with any financial organization regarding the material discussed in the manuscript.Article first published online April 7 2017.Cite this article as loguercio c. about gut microbiota why Minerva Gastroenterol Dietol 201763327-8.

Disorders associated with the im- pairment of gut microbiota include functional gastrointes tinal diseases intestinal infectious diseases inflammatory bowel disease IBD liver and pancreatic diseases gastrointestinal malignancies but also metabolic syndrome and diabetes and obesity allergic diseases autism and others.

For example it is long time recognized the importance of gut micro-organisms as a whole essential metabolic organ in biotransformation of bile acids and breakdown of otherwise in- digestible dietary components such as plant polysaccharides and production of short-chain fatty acids a major energy source for colonic epithelium from fermentable carbohydrates.

in this setting microbiota promotes absorp- tion of monosaccharides from the gut lumen with consequent induction of hepatic lipogen- esis moreover it suppresses fasting-induced adipocyte factor a lipoprotein lipase inhibi- tor allowing the deposition of triglycerides in the adipocytes.

The mechanisms of communication include immune neural endocrine and meta- bolic pathway.Based on these recent knowledges there is increasing interest on gut microbiota modu- lation as both a preventive strategy or as a therapeutic option in different gastrointestinal hepatic and systemic diseases.

Many stud- ies have tried to find out the impact of diet prebiotic probiotic and antibiotics on gut mi- crobiota composition and function obtaining very heterogeneous and sometimes conflicting results especially as regards the effect on clin- ical outcomes.
