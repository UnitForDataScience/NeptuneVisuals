Nevertheless these changes must be made without patients in the room as the water drops during the change are contaminated with OXA48 bacteria and if not thoroughly cleaned and disinfected the sprinkled surfaces may allow bacteria transmission to patients.In other rooms of our hospital where OXA48 was detect- ed in the sinks we used heat plus 5 l of chlorinated dis- infectant and in all of them the OXA48 bacteria were eliminated we now indicate this double treatment when it is not possible to change the siphons.

The OR room with OXA48 to room without OXA48 was 3.1 1.4-7.1 p  0.01 that is we have a suggestive coincidence causality between a water reservoir for specific rooms and their patients but that is only true in the case of bacteria with OXA48 but not with VIM.Drains were not changed in the Traumatology area be- cause it would have required construction work.

A large possibility of diffusion from contaminated hands which continue to transmit high numbers of microorganisms after more than 10 successive surface contacts was highlighted OXA bacteria were more persistent than VIM bacteria.

All these da- ta suggest that OXA48 exposure from a contaminated sink is a probably interesting causal factor and can be eliminated by changing the siphons without changing the other factors that continue to operate normally in the other rooms.Lastly the conjugation of OXA48-K. pneumoniae with other intestinal species of bacteria is not easy because less than 0.5 of colonized patients by OXA-bacteria in our hospital have two or more different species with OXA-plasmid having been studied a grand number of rectal swabs in Oncology 2602 and Traumatology 2733 during the investigate period.DiscussionPrincipal featuresHigh possibility of microorganism diffusion from contaminated hands which continue to transmit a large number of microorganisms after more than 10 successive contacts to surfaces but was more intense higher number of FCU in OXA than VIM bacteria.

These are especially important for healthcare work- ers but also for the patient and hisher family.Microbial competition shows that VIM bacteria are inhibited by OXA organisms.In another paper 22 we have demonstrated that these bacteria have a large capacity for survival on dry sur- faces same germ-carrier as used in experiments of diffusion from the hands VIM and OXA48 bacte- ria can respectively survive for 35 and 21 days in the environment.

After to get OXA48-K. pneumoniae to nasal or oral cavities these bacteria can transfer its bla-OXA-plasmid due to its grand rate of conjugation 23 toward Klebsiella endogenous and in few days all digestive tract will be contaminated with OXA48-K. pneumoniae allowing be detected by rectal swab.ConclusionsThe discovery of OXA48-K. pneumoniae in the bio- film of sinks inside hospital rooms is a result of a colonized patient's stay and the permanence of the bacteria as a reservoir may contribute to the perpet- uation of an outbreak in hospital patients.OXA48-K. pneumoniae grows better than VIM-En- terobacteriaceae on a biofilm example in the si- phon of a sink.After contamination of a patient family or health worker's hand they can distribute OXA48-K. pneu- moniae to a large number of surfaces.

Therefore if a new patient is contaminated it must be due to microor- ganisms being carried by healthcare workers who have not followed contact precautions or from microorganism reservoirs that are difficult clean during the inter-patient room cleaningdisinfection 17 18.Reservoirs have sometimes been seen with hydrophilic bacteria like P. aeruginosa or B. cepaciae or Enterobac- teriaceae as KPC-K. pneumoniae 19 but not among OXA-K. pneumoniae or VIM-Klebsiella oxytoca carbe- penemase a metallo-b-lactamase that gives resistance to most antibiotics used in our hospitals.

In cases where it had not we increased the vol- ume of the disinfectant poured down the sink by 5 l. In one room we failed to kill bacteria with this method so we applied heat by using steam through a steam cleaner La- vorwashr model Starsteam type HP58DS-M which has been reported to destroy slime.

or B-lac- tamase type ESBL bacteria or microorganisms without antibiotic resistance were detected.If we accept contamination from the water reservoir as possible only if species and strain match in each room this occurred in 10 of the 26 cases with OXA48-K pneu- moniae.

However none of the siphons colonized byVIM matched the bacteria found in the patients in the same room being different species it was not neces- sary to type them see Table I.
