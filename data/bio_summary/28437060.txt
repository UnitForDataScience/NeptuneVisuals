a total of 61 of the compounds were identified in all three body fluids such as 3-3-hydroxyphenyl-3-hydroxypropanoic acid 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid 4-hydroxybenzoic acid butyric acid hippuric acid phenylacetic acid etc.

3-indolepropionic acid 4-hydroxycinnamic acid 4- hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid putrescine salicyluric acid vanillic acid etc.

moreover the accumulation of fragmentation mechanisms provides information that may be used to solve structure problems for unknown metabolites that have no available authentic standards but have similar chemical structures to known metabolites.microbial metabolites identified in human and microbial samplesbased on our library of mcf and ecf derivatives a subset of 125 metabolites were identified in human samples including 92 metabolites in serum 103 in urine and 118 in feces samples figure 1b.

indole cresol pipecolic acid ortho-hydroxyphenylacetic acid n-methylnicotinamide hydroxyphenyllactic acid etc..e. coli strains are commonly present in human gut microbiota and the species has been the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism in microbiological research33.

to be noted some compounds such as 3-hydroxybutyric acid 3-indolepropionic acid 4- hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan etc.

any intercellular metabolic transformation metabolic fingerprint due to the differences in microbial communities could cause significant alterations of the extracellular metabolome in the host metabolic footprints.while it is useful to understand changes in gut microbial phylaspecies that affect host health it is much more useful to characterize changes in microbial metabolites that can be analyzed in easily obtainable body fluids such as plasma or urine and correlate changes in microbial metabolites with a patient's condition.

we found that the lyophilization process produced stronger signal intensities for most of metabolites identified in urine and cell samples and as a result a greater number of metabolites were identified with lyophilization compared to the procedure without lyophilization data not shown.

this big panel of human and gut microbiota co-metabolites particularly those metabolites that were simultaneously identified in multiple matrices are likely to be of great importance in exploring host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions.conclusionin this work we developed an automated high-throughput sample derivatization and analysis method for the simultaneous identification of 92 103 118 and 52 microbial metabolites in human serum urine feces and e. coli cell samples respectively in a single run analysis of15 minutes.

among them a total of 47 metabolites were also identified in e. coli cell as the numbers in parenthesis shown.zhao et al.page 13figure 2.gctofms total ion current tic chromatograms of mcf derivatives in human serum urine and feces samples a sample of intracellular metabolites extracted from e. coli cell a mixture of reference standards and a mixture of 13 alkanes c8-c30 which act as internal ri markers for the conversion of retention times to classic kovats ri.zhao et al.page 14figure 3.pca scores plots of 76 human serum yellow circle urine blue circle and feces samples green circle and their 5 qc samples that were either purchased commercially or collected from volunteers red circle.

in this study we compiled a msri library consisting of mcf and ecf derivatives from 145 reference standards table 1. as shown in figure 1a these compounds span a large number of chemical classes including fatty acids 29  amino acids and derivatives 26  carboxylic acids and derivatives 11  hydroxy acids and derivatives 6  phenols phenylacetic acid benzyl alcohols benzoic acid and their derivatives 12  indoles 6  cinnamic acids keto-acids sugar acids and their derivatives 4  and other nitrogen- containing compounds generally found in human urine or feces 6 .

could not be detected at lower concentrations due to the detection limit and some compounds such as hydrocinnamic acid l-phenylalanine l-glutamic acid l-cysteine etc.

to date analytical protocols that quantitatively measure a complete panel of microbial metabolites in biological samples have not been established but urgently needed by the microbiome research community.

here we report an automated high-throughput quantitative method using a gas chromatographytime-of-flight mass spectrometry gctofms platform to simultaneously measure over one hundred microbial metabolites in human serum urine feces and escherichia coli cell samples within 15 minutes per sample.
