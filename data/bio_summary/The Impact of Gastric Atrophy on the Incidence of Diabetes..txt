after excluding these 26 subjects with sero-conversion there was still no significant association between h. pylori infection and the incidence of diabetes hr 1.00 95 ci 0.99-1.00 p 0.608.in 1 we divided the population into two categories according to tertile of serum pg iii ratio as followsgroup 1  the lowest tertile serum pg iii ratio  4.125 group 2  the combination of the middle and the highest tertile serum pg iii ratio 4.125. the kaplan-meier curve demonstrated that subjects with a lower serum pg iii ratio which means more extensive gastric atrophy had a lower risk of incident diabetes p  0.05 by log-rank test.discussionin this prospective cohort study subjects with gastric atrophy had a lower risk of incident diabetes compared to those without gastric atrophy.

the association between serum pg iii ratio and incident diabetes remained significant after further adjustment for log-transformed homa2-ir log-transformed homa2b model 2 family history of diabetes hba1c blood pressure and lipid profiles model 3. for gastric atrophy it was borderline significantly associated with incident diabetes in model 1 and was significantly associated with incident diabetes in model 2 and 3 model 1 hr 0.35 95 ci 0.11-1.12 p 0.076 model 2 hr 0.28 95 ci 0.08-0.90 p 0.05 model 3 hr 0.28 95 ci 0.09-0.91 p 0.05.serum pg iii ratio and gastric atrophy remained significantly associated with incident diabetes when h. pylori infection was introduced as a covariate serum pg iii ratio adjusted hr 2.21 95 ci 1.10-4.46 p 0.05 gas- tric atrophy adjusted hr 0.29 95 ci 0.09-0.97 p 0.05 both adjusted for age gender bmi log-transformed homa2-ir log-transformed homa2b family history of diabetes hba1c systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure log-transformed triglyceride total cholesterol and serostatus of h. pylori infection.

the negative relationship of serum pg i ii ratio to homa2-ir and h. pylori igg titer remained significant after adjusting for age and gender p  0.05. neither male sex fasting glucose ogtt 2-h glucose hba1c nor hscrp showed any significant association with serum pg iii ratio all p  0.05. although the correlation coefficient between serum pg iii ratio and homa2b did not reach statistical significance the partial correlation test confirmed this negative relationship after adjusting for age and gender partial correlation coefficient r  -0.0778 p 0.0233. supplementary table 2 shows the relationship between gastric atrophy h. pylori-specific igg antibody titers and other important risktable 2. the relationship between serum pepsinogen iii ratio and other clinical characteristics.

in practice serum pepsinogen pg i and ii can be used as a screening tool for gastric atrophy defined by a low serum pg i 70 ngml and a low pg iii ratio 3. a decreased serum pg i level or pg iii ratio not only reflects an increasing extent of gastric atrophy but also correlates with a decreased plasma ghrelin which is an important gut hormone involved in glucose homeostasis.

in addition inclusion of hscrp in the model 3 did not change the effect of gastric atrophy and serum pg iii ratio on incident diabetes gastric atrophy adjusted hr 0.28 95 ci 0.09-0.92 p 0.05 serum pg iii ratio adjusted hr 2.07 95 ci 1.11-3.86 p  0.05. on the other hand neither h. pylori serostatus nor serum pg i concentrations were associated with the incidence of diabetes in univariate and multivariate models.

in univariate analyses serum pg iii ratio was associated with the incidence of diabetes with borderline significance hr 1.84 95 ci 0.94-3.60 p  0.073. subjects with serum pg iii ratio in the middle and the highest borderline significance tertile had a higher risk of incident diabetes compared with those in the lowest tertile the middle tertile hr 1.87 95 ci 1.02-3.42 p  0.05 the highest tertile hr 1.86 95 ci 0.99-3.47 p  0.052. in model 1 serum pg iii ratio was sig- nificantly associated with incident diabetes adjusted for age gender and bmi hr 2.14 95 ci 1.12-4.11 p  0.05. the hrs for incident diabetes in the middle and highest tertile of serum pg iii ratio were 2.13 95 ci 1.16-3.90 p 0.05 and 2.15 95 ci 1.15-4.04 p 0.05 respectively in this model.

the hazard ratio hr for incident diabetes in subjects with h. pylori infection has been reported to be 2.69. therefore the sample size needed to detect a difference in the incidence of diabetes between subjects with and without h. pylori infection at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and power of 80 is 324 when the prevalence of h. pylori infection is 50 or 505 when the prevalence of h. pylori infection is 80. continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as means-standard deviation sd.

when adjusted for age male sex was borderline significantly associated with gastric atrophy adjusted odds ratio0.59 95 ci 0.35-1.00 p  0.050. neither bmi fasting glucose ogtt 2-h glucose hba1c homa2-ir homa2b nor hscrp showed any significant association with gastric atrophy all p 0.05.we used cox proportional hazards models to calculate the hrs of h. pylori infection serum pg iii ratioand gastric atrophy to predict the incidence of diabetes t3.

since the improved insulin sensitivity with increasing serum pg iii ratio may be offset by the attenuated b-cell function the negative association of serum pg iii ratio to homa2-ir and homa2b can explain why serum pg iii ratio was not associated with plasma glucose levels.

have investigated the relationship between serum pg i serum pg ii serum pg iii ratio and the gastric mucosal histology.

since the increase in serum pg ii was greater than the increase in serum pg i these subjects had a lower serum pg iii ratio than normal subjects.

as a result their serum pg iii ratio decreased further to less than 3. in subjects with severe atrophic gastritis serum pg i was markedly reduced whereas serum pg ii was similar to that in normal subjects.

taken together further longitudinal studies from different populations are needed in order to understand the interaction of race or ethnicity prevalence of h. pylori infection and gas- tric atrophy and age on the relationship between h. pylori infection and the incidence of diabetes.this is the first prospective study to investigate the role of gastric atrophy on the incidence of diabetes.

since the duration of h. pylori infection is not available in this study it remains unknown whether the relationship between gastric atrophy and the incidence of diabetes is independent to the duration of h. pylori infection in order to know the independent relationship between local inflammation and the incidence of diabetes.in conclusion we have demonstrated that subjects with gastric atrophy are associated with a lower incidence of diabetes.
