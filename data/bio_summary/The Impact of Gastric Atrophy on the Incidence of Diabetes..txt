For gastric atrophy it was borderline significantly associated with incident diabetes in model 1 and was significantly associated with incident diabetes in model 2 and 3 model 1 HR 0.35 95 CI 0.11-1.12 p 0.076 model 2 HR 0.28 95 CI 0.08-0.90 p 0.05 model 3 HR 0.28 95 CI 0.09-0.91 p 0.05.Serum PG III ratio and gastric atrophy remained significantly associated with incident diabetes when H. pylori infection was introduced as a covariate serum PG III ratio adjusted HR 2.21 95 CI 1.10-4.46 p 0.05 gas- tric atrophy adjusted HR 0.29 95 CI 0.09-0.97 p 0.05 both adjusted for age gender BMI log-transformed HOMA2-IR log-transformed HOMA2B family history of diabetes HbA1c systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure log-transformed triglyceride total cholesterol and serostatus of H. pylori infection.

Therefore the sample size needed to detect a difference in the incidence of diabetes between subjects with and without H. pylori infection at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and power of 80 is 324 when the prevalence of H. pylori infection is 50 or 505 when the prevalence of H. pylori infection is 80.

After excluding these 26 subjects with sero-conversion there was still no significant association between H. pylori infection and the incidence of diabetes HR 1.00 95 CI 0.99-1.00 p 0.608.In 1 we divided the population into two categories according to tertile of serum PG III ratio as followsgroup 1  the lowest tertile serum PG III ratio  4.125 group 2  the combination of the middle and the highest tertile serum PG III ratio 4.125.

Taken together further longitudinal studies from different populations are needed in order to understand the interaction of race or ethnicity prevalence of H. pylori infection and gas- tric atrophy and age on the relationship between H. pylori infection and the incidence of diabetes.This is the first prospective study to investigate the role of gastric atrophy on the incidence of diabetes.

Since the duration of H. pylori infection is not available in this study it remains unknown whether the relationship between gastric atrophy and the incidence of diabetes is independent to the duration of H. pylori infection in order to know the independent relationship between local inflammation and the incidence of diabetes.In conclusion we have demonstrated that subjects with gastric atrophy are associated with a lower incidence of diabetes.

Furthermore H. pylori infection leads to chronic inflamma- tion of stomach and that is why H. pylori infection correlates with PGIII ratio which is a marker for gastritis.

Taken together these reports suggest that gastric atrophy may be associated with the incidence of diabetes.Among various causes of gastric atrophy Helicobactor pylori H. pylori infection is a major one.

However controlling for markers of systemic inflammation including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 did not attenuate the effect of H. pylori infection suggesting that factors other than systemic inflam- mation such as above-mentioned changes in gastric atrophy may contribute to the link between H. pylori infec- tion and the incidence of diabetes.1Health Management Center Far Eastern Memorial Hospital New Taipei City Taiwan.
