NS-CE natural soil contaminated with 20 mg kg-1 chlorimuron-ethyl NS-CE-B natural soil contaminated with 20 mg kg-1 chlorimuron-ethyl and inoculated with the bacterial consortium.Remediation of chlorimuron-ethyl-contaminated soil by a bacterial consortiumChlorimuron-ethyl degradation in experimental soilThe results of the effects of the bacterial consortium dosage in the soil on the chlorimuron-ethyl degradation rate showed that the degradation efficiency peaked when the dosage was 1 g kg-1 Fig.

All of the samples were processed and the degradation rates were determined as described in .Remediation of chlorimuron-ethyl-contaminated soil by a bacterial consortiumOptimization of the dosage of the bacterial consortium added to the soilThe dosage of the bacterial consortium added to the soil was optimized in a greenhouse.

The effects of the bacterial consortium on the indigenous bacterial community were evaluated in the chlorimuron-ethyl-contaminated soil using Illumina MiSeq sequencing.Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes bacterial diversity and relative abundance in the soil samplesDNA was extracted from the soil following the protocol of and purified using an EasyPurer Quick Gel Extraction Kit TransGen Biotech Beijing China according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The chlorimuron-ethyl degradation rate reached 80.02 after 60 d demonstrating that the application of the chlorimuron-ethyl- degrading bacterial consortium could promote the degradation of chlorimuron-ethyl in the soil and reduce its phytotoxicity to wheat.

The degradation of chlorimuron-ethyl in chlorimuron-ethyl-contaminated soil with or without the addition of bacterial consortium was monitored  and a remarkable difference in the amount of residual chlorimuron-ethyl between treat- ments was identified in the presence of the bacterial consortium.

The microbial community was evaluated by Illumina MiSeq sequen- cing which showed that inoculation with the bacterial consortium could somewhat alter the bacterial community composition of chlor- imuron-ethyl-contaminated soil and that the chlorimuron-ethyl-degrad- ing bacteria in the bacterial consortium could survive and play an important role in the degradation of chlorimuron-ethyl.

The bars represent the SDs of assays performed in triplicate.Optimization of the preparation conditions for the bacterial consortium using RSMa shows that the number of live bacteria and the chlorimuron- ethyl degradation rate peaked at 3 d. The effects of inoculum quantity on the activity of the fermentation liquid at the optimal temperature for chlorimuron-ethyl degradation are presented in b which shows that the yield of live bacteria and the chlorimuron-ethyl degradation rate peaked 1.22x1010 CFU mL-1 and 81.63 respectively when3.0 mL of inoculum was used.

The soil characteristics pH total N P and K and water-holding capacity were determined.The physical and chemical properties of the soil were as follows total nitrogen N 93.5 mg kg-1 total phosphorus P 42.1 mg kg-1 total potassium K 416.9 mg kg-1 water-holding capacity 2.9 andpH 6.23.Optimization of the conditions for preparing the chlorimuron-ethyl- degrading bacterial consortiumThe growth interactions between strain D310-1 and D310-5 and the effects of carbon sources on the growth of mixed bacteria and chlorimuron-ethyl degradation were studied.

The bacterial consortium made a positive impact on the remediation of chlorimuron-ethyl-contaminated soil and somewhat altered the composition of the bacterial community in the chlorimuron-ethyl-contaminated soil.
