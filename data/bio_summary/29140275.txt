a more extended description of food classification according to their processing degree is shown in table .figure 1. industrial processing stages from fresh food to ultra-processed food products.consumption of processed and ultra-processed food products has increased in the last decades in both developed and developing countries.

also in a spanish cohort of middle-age adults there was a positive association between ultra-processed food consumption and hypertension risk  which can be associated to salt content and other lifestyle behaviors.table 1. classification of food according to its processing degree .groupdefinitionprocessingexamplesunprocessed foodsfresh foods directly obtained from plants or animals.no industrial processing.fresh fruits vegetables meat eggsminimally processed foodsprocessed culinary ingredientsprocessed food industry ingredientsprocessed foodsultra-processed foodsphysical alteration of unprocessed foods.substances extracted from unprocessed or minimally processed foods used to prepare dishes and meals.substances extracted from unprocessed or minimally processed foods used in the formulation ofultra-processed foods.products made by adding sugar salt oil fats or other culinary ingredients to minimally processed foods.industrial formulations manufactured mainly from processed food industry ingredients.peeling cutting drying pasteurization refrigeration freezing vacuum packing simple wrapping.pressing refining grinding milling.hydrogenation hydrolysis use of enzymes and additives.preservation or cooking methods non-alcoholic fermentation.frying deep frying curing extrusion molding extensive use of additives such as preservatives colorants flavoringsnon-sugar sweeteners emulsifiers etc.chilled frozen or dried fruits vegetables meat and poultry pasteurized or powdered milk vegetables or fruit juices without added sugar.salt sugar flour vegetable oil starches butter etc.high fructose corn syrup lactose milk and soy proteins.bread cheese canned vegetables and legumes fruits in syrup salted nuts and seeds smoked and salted meat.ready-to-heat ready-to-eat or ready-to-drink products like carbonated drinks sweet or savory snacks breakfast cereals fruit yoghurt sausages hams instant soups pre-prepared meals and dishes infant formulas baby food.

thus to decrease the susceptibility to autoimmunity genetically predisposed children should avoid ultra-processed food products and encourage the consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods.keywords ultra-processed food products autoimmunity risk type 1 diabetes celiac disease microbiotaintroductiontype 1 diabetes t1d and celiac disease cd are the most important autoimmune disorders in childhood they share the genetic predisposition given by the haplotypes dq2 and dq8 of the human leucocyte antigen hla-dq2 and -dq8 and some environmental risk factors.

surprisinglymany food products exclusively designed for infants such as baby foods milk formulas and ready- to-eat breakfast cereals are in the classification of ultra-processed food products .in children an adult-like microbiota is established around 3-5 years old and its composition remains relatively stable throughout life  except by 30-40 of its structure which can be modified by diet and other environmental factors .

children in the urban area had a higher intake of ultra-processed food products they ate frequently fast food more meat or meat products and confectionary i.e.

according to the processing degree and purpose food products can be unprocessed or minimally processed foods processed culinary or food industry ingredients processed foods and ultra-processed food and drink products .

figure shows an example of the stages and purposes of food processing as well as the names of food products in each stage from fresh and minimally processed to ultra-processed food products.

mexican children with t1d at onset had higher abundance of bacteroides than their healthy counterparts 44 vs. 12. this abundance decreased in controlled t1d children treated for at least two years 23 but did not reach the level of healthy children .

african children consumed a grain-based diet with high dietary fiber intake and their microbiota was abundant in bacteroidetes especially in the prevotella genus meanwhile italian children had a westernized diet high in fat and animal protein and firmicutes mainly faecalibacterium dominated their microbiota.subsequently other studies found that dietary components like fat carbohydrates protein fiber and some food additives were associated to specific changes in the microbiota composition .

nowadays due to the parent's lack of time children end up eating ultra-processed and fast foods on a regular basis .food processing comprises all the methods and techniques used to prepare products from fresh food and other ingredients .

in brazil processed and ultra-processed food products contributed with 19.7 and 37 of the energy intake in children younger and older than 24 months respectively .

based on the reviewed evidence ultra-processed food products have nutrients and ingredients that enhance the susceptibility to develop autoimmunity for t1d or cd in predisposed children.

thus if prevention is the goal a balanced old fashioned diet should be provided to children since early age.are old fashioned diets betterdisadvantages of ultra-processed food excessive consumption have been described along this review but little was addressed about the benefits of a fresh and minimally processed food-based diet.

ultra-processed food products have dysbiosis-inducing nutrient profile high fat and sugar and low protein and micronutrients and are highly consumed by children.

food consumption of children younger than 6 years according to the degree of food processing.
