Thus to decrease the susceptibility to autoimmunity genetically predisposed children should avoid ultra-processed food products and encourage the consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods.Keywords ultra-processed food products autoimmunity risk type 1 diabetes celiac disease microbiotaIntroductionType 1 diabetes T1D and celiac disease CD are the most important autoimmune disorders in childhood they share the genetic predisposition given by the haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 of the human leucocyte antigen HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 and some environmental risk factors.

Surprisinglymany food products exclusively designed for infants such as baby foods milk formulas and ready- to-eat breakfast cereals are in the classification of ultra-processed food products .In children an adult-like microbiota is established around 3-5 years old and its composition remains relatively stable throughout life  except by 30-40 of its structure which can be modified by diet and other environmental factors .

Thus due to its nutritional and processing characteristics many gluten-free products could be classified as ultra-processed foodstuffs.Canadian children and adolescents with CD in gluten-free diet had higher intake of fiber than their healthy counterparts although the gluten-free diet was higher in glycemic index and load due to the consumption of gluten-free and processed products .

This promotes a pro-inflammatory response an increase in gut permeability and the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as CD and T1D in genetic predisposed children .Due to its convenience and accessibility ultra-processed foods namely ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat products have gained popularity in the last decades.

Nowadays due to the parent's lack of time children end up eating ultra-processed and fast foods on a regular basis .Food processing comprises all the methods and techniques used to prepare products from fresh food and other ingredients .

In Brazil processed and ultra-processed food products contributed with 19.7 and 37 of the energy intake in children younger and older than 24 months respectively .

Metabolite and microbiota profiles correspond to the differences in dietary patterns between both populations marked by a high consumption of ultra-processed products by the American children .Altogether these findings indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties and the capacity of modulate gut microbiota of unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids could reduce susceptibilityto T1D and CD autoimmunity.

Based on the reviewed evidence ultra-processed food products have nutrients and ingredients that enhance the susceptibility to develop autoimmunity for T1D or CD in predisposed children.

Long term dietary fiber intake is associated to high abundance of Prevotella and bacteria as Roseburia Eubacterium rectale and Ruminococcus bromii able to metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides and produce butyrate .Finally the attempt is not to force children at risk of autoimmunity to follow a vegan or Mediterranean diet but to show some examples of dietary patterns that contrast with the actual trend of high ultra-processed products consumption.

Hence an adequate old fashioned diet that avoids ultra-processed products must be provided to genetically predisposed children since an early age in order to reduce the susceptibility to develop T1D or CD.Acknowledgments The authors thank Maribel Y. Valencia for English edition.
