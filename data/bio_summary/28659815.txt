The observation that in our network these genes are shared between S24-7 and Bifidobacteria underscores the here hypothesized importance of S24-7 and indicates that these two bacterial groups are indeed closely related in function as hypothesized before Ormerod et al.

thl and thh where selected for each network so that only top 5 of the highest positive and lowest negative weights were kept for building the networks.Networks represented by these adjacency matrix were transformed into the edge-list format a two column table of the connected nodes in a network were each row represents an edge and visualized in Cytoscape Shannon et al.

The organism- associated microbiota especially those in the gut can be regarded as a separate internal phenotypic layer because it is not only dependent on the host genome but also heavily influenced by its environment particularly by nutrition Schwartz et al.

The identified connections may be crucial for the identification of causal relationships Civelek and Lusis 2014 between various biological scales and to uncover mechanisms involved in determining external phenotypes.MATERIALS AND METHODSOrigin of DataWe used data from an experiment with 6-week old inbred mice that were fed for 4 weeks with six different semi-synthetic diets Kar et al.

The first number indicates the number of variables in the data and the second number denotes the number of samples.is first log transformed and then this data is fitted to a linear model using the function lmFit Phipson et al.

The most highly connected Transcriptomics node Tmem72 Transmembrane Protein 72 has only been studied in the kidney so far Habuka et al.

The first hub Tnfa has the highest number of literature results among all the nodes in the network and the other hub Glutathione has literature validations to the most number of data-types.Tnfa is a connectivity hub in the merged network with links to several neighbors belonging to the four other types of data.

This weight is represented by the matrix value mij.To further prune the network of possibly spurious interaction two additional thresholds thl  0 and thh  0 were imposed to obtain an unweighted adjacency matrix AX Yof size nx x nyAll significantly different data-points were used in the integration which was initially performed with two datasets at a time so that from the 5 datasets 10 integrated networks were generated.1 if mij  thh or mij  thl0 if mij  thl and mij  thh3The integration was performed using the function sPLS sparse Partial Least Squares in regression mode with ncomp  5 from the R package mixOmics Le Cao et al.

We obtained values for the following topological properties of the merged network Barabasi and Oltvai 2004 Csardi and Nepusz 2006 Zhu et al.

There are several methods to choose a threshold based on the data use assigned p-values as threshold use network characteristics of the correlations or use a percentage of the correlation distribution.When evaluated by Borate et al.
