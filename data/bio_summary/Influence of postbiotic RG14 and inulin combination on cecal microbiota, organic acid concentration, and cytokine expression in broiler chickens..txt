Commensal bacteria fed as iso- lated strains also can have varying effects ranging from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory Foligne et al.

The population of total bacteria in birds fed T4 was similar P  0.05 to those fed the negative control diet.

The population of Enterobacteria was lower P  0.05 in birds fed pos- itive control T1 T2 T3 and T4 diets compared with those fed the negative control diet.

The acetic acid was significantly P  0.05 higher in birds fed positive con- trol T1 and T4 diests compared to those fed the nega- tive control.

However several countries have prohibited or are in the process of prohibiting non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics in poultry Awad et al.
