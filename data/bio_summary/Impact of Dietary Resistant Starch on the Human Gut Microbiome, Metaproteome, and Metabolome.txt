In general in the HRS diet we see a highly significant increase in fatty acyls HRS 20.3 LRS 1.9 baseline 1.9 and sterol lipids HRS 25.6 LRS 0.4 baseline 1.1 and simultaneously an increase of Faecalibac- terium HRS 1.4 LRS and baseline 0.0 based on all significant features from the OPLS-DA results and .The multiomics data are summarized here in one overview model  to illustrate the main effects of the resistant starch diet on the gut microbiome and functions that they carry out.

Of these several proteins involved in butyrate metabolism were significantly altered as verified with the post hoc Kruskal-Nemenyi test  including butyrate kinase baseline versus HRS P  0.001 HRS versus LRS P  0.01 and enoyl coenzyme A enoyl-CoA hydratase LRS versus baseline P  0.0001 LRS versus HRS P  0.003.

Red arrowsframes increased in HRS blue frames decreased in HRS black arrows not detected or not increased in HRS over baseline green arrowsframes increased in LRS.

The mass signals were assigned to molecular formulas using NetCalc  network tolerance 0.2 ppm NetCalc tolerance 0.2 ppm and searched against the KEGG  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes HMDB  Human Metabolome Database and Lipid Maps  databases using Homo sapiens as a reference organism using the Mass- TRIX web server   with a maximum error of 1 ppm.For multivariate data analysis MVA samples had been divided into 3 main groups baseline blue G1 HRS red G2 and LRS green G3 since orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis OPLS-DA revealed no significant changes between the LRS diets at day 28 and day 56 as well as between the HRS diets at day 28 and day 56.

In order to study the three combined data sets two different OPLS-DA models were built the baseline diet to the HRS diet and the HRS diet to the LRS diet.

In order to evaluate the metabolomics data set with respect to the impact of the different diets on the human gut microbiome all valid classification models of the OPLS-DA were merged to examine the most discriminating features among the baseline HRS and LRS diets.In order to identify significant features of the metabolomics data set a lipidomics-MSMS approach was applied using an Acquity ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography system Waters GmbH Eschborn Germany coupled to a Bruker maXis ultrahigh-resolution-time of flight mass spectrometer UHR-TOF-MS Bruker Daltonik GmbH Bremen Germany as previously described in the work of Witting et al.

For the rarefied OTU data the correlation coefficients were averaged and visualized using the same color code as applied to the proteome data and the treemap polygon sizes correspond to the average counts of OTUs for all samples to visualize their relative amounts in the entire data set.Multiomics integrative analyses.

Pairs of data sets were assembled by matching participants from each individual data set 16S proteomics and metabolomics to provide maximum overlapping data sets 16S plus proteomics proteomics plus metabolomics and metabolomics plus 16S.

Therefore subjects in the high-carbohydrate HC arm of the study consumed either 66 g RS for the HRS diet or 4 g for the LRS diet whereas for the low-carbohydrate LC arm of the study the subjects consumed either 48 g for the HRS diet or 3 g for the LRS diet based on 2500 kcalday menus Fig.

For this reason we classified samples based on the resistant starch load of the diet at the time of sampling baseline HRS or LRS respectively without differentiating if that diet was assigned first or second during the crossover study.In agreement with earlier observations  we reported significantly attenuated postprandial insulin and glucose responses to the HRS meals .
