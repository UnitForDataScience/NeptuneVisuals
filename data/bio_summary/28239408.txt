depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the beck depres- sion inventory bdi and the beck anxiety inventory bai pre- and post-intervention and results showed that while consumption of the probiotic improved anxi- ety scores it had no effect on depressive symptoms .

those at higher genetic risk for social anxiety indexed by high neuroticism showed fewer social anxiety symptoms when they consumed more fermented foods .effects on cognitionthree studies assessed some aspect of cognition and all three of them reported positive effects.

in 2004 marcos and colleagues examined the effects of yogurt cultures with added probiotics on subjects under academic examina- tion stress and while numbers of lymphocytes and cd56 cells increased and decreased respectively levels of stress and anxiety assessed using the state-trait anxiety inven- tory stai remained unchanged .

recently matthew hilimire and colleagues took a different approach and surveyed 710 young adults using self-report question- naires on fermented food consumption as well as neu- roticism and social anxiety using the big five inventory bfi and the social phobia and anxiety inventory spai- 23. the results showed that consumption of fermented foods containing probiotics was negatively associatedtable 1 characteristics of included studies60-75 yearsplacebo-controlled trialsrt vlt rvipstroop taskpss gds-sf.

the objective of this review is to analyze the current body of research assessing the effects of probiot- ics on symptoms of depression in humans such as mood anxiety and cognition and to identify any gaps and dis- cuss future directions in this field.methodsstudy selection criteriaarticles eligible for inclusion in this review were written or available in english and published in peer-reviewed journals.

the studies included in the review were restricted to human trials that assessed sub- jective changes in symptoms of depression such as mood anxiety andor cognition after consuming either a probi- otic supplement or a food or drink containing probiotic cultures for an extended period of time.

results showed that consumption of the probiotic sup- plement significantly decreased bdi scores indicating overall improved symptoms including mood.effects on stress and anxietyseven of the ten included studies assessed anxiety and stress and all but two reported improvements after treat- ment with a probiotic.

it appears that probiotics may have the most significant effect on symptoms of anxiety which is often co-morbid with mdd .

disparities in gender and age effects of pro- biotics are not well understood.alternative treatmentthe use of probiotics as an alternative or adjuvant treat- ment for relieving symptoms of mdd and anxiety could be a critical turning point in the management of the dis- order .

duration of intervention varies widely as does the quantity and strains of the pro- biotics and research is lacking on depressive symptoms apart from mood anxiety and cognition such as sleep.perhaps most notably are the inconsistencies in defining depression across studies.strainsthere are many different species and strains of probiot- ics that inhabit your gut and that are readily available in certain foods and in supplements alike but the beneficial effects on health that probiotics confer are species- and strain-specific.

psychobiotics would thus be classified as highly regulated drugs and may still harbor stigma the way an over-the-counter probiotic supplement may not.using probiotics to alleviate symptoms of mdd could indeed eliminate some of these barriers for effec- tive treatment though there is still much to be accom- plished before probiotics can be considered a front-line treatment for alleviating depressive symptoms including investigating the mechanisms underlying their effects.proposed mechanisms of actionthroughout the literature there appear to be two domi- nant hypotheses addressing possible mechanisms of action through which probiotics exert their effects on mood and cognition.

this increase in serotonin may facilitate regu- lation of the hpa axis and reduce depressive symptoms caused by a depletion of the neurotransmitter.gaps in current researchgaps and inconsistencies in the research on the effects of probiotics on depressive symptoms make it difficult to confirm evidence of efficacy.

there is robust evidence of this in preclinical studies that have demon- strated probiotics' ability to change behavior and improve the mood anxiety and cognition of rodents by altering neurotransmitter activity reviewed below.preclinical studiesin terms of neurotransmission several rodent stud- ies found that consumption of probiotics prevented stress-induced increases in adrenocorticotropic hor- mone acth  corticosterone   adrenaline and noradrenaline .
