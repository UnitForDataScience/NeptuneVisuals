Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depres- sion Inventory BDI and the Beck Anxiety Inventory BAI pre- and post-intervention and results showed that while consumption of the probiotic improved anxi- ety scores it had no effect on depressive symptoms .

Psychobiotics would thus be classified as highly regulated drugs and may still harbor stigma the way an over-the-counter probiotic supplement may not.Using probiotics to alleviate symptoms of MDD could indeed eliminate some of these barriers for effec- tive treatment though there is still much to be accom- plished before probiotics can be considered a front-line treatment for alleviating depressive symptoms including investigating the mechanisms underlying their effects.Proposed mechanisms of actionThroughout the literature there appear to be two domi- nant hypotheses addressing possible mechanisms of action through which probiotics exert their effects on mood and cognition.

This increase in serotonin may facilitate regu- lation of the HPA axis and reduce depressive symptoms caused by a depletion of the neurotransmitter.Gaps in current researchGaps and inconsistencies in the research on the effects of probiotics on depressive symptoms make it difficult to confirm evidence of efficacy.

Wallace and Milev Ann Gen Psychiatry 2017 1614DOI 10.1186s12991-017-0138-2Annals of General PsychiatryThe effects of probiotics on depressive symptoms in humans a systematic reviewCaroline J. K. Wallace and Roumen MilevBackgroundMajor depressive disorder MDD is a complex psychi- atric disorder of unknown etiology that will affect up to 20 of the population at some point in their lifetime  and is a leading cause of disability worldwide .

Depressive symptoms can also be present subclinically and still have a major impact on daily functioning.

Moreover in Western societies depres- sion is more common among low socioeconomic status populations who have also been shown to consume less probiotics and fermented foods than their higher SES counterparts who also experience less depression .These results along with preclinical and clinical study findings suggest that gut microbiota and the use of probiotics could prove useful in alleviating depressive symptoms.

The objective of this review is to analyze the current body of research assessing the effects of probiot- ics on symptoms of depression in humans such as mood anxiety and cognition and to identify any gaps and dis- cuss future directions in this field.MethodsStudy selection criteriaArticles eligible for inclusion in this review were written or available in English and published in peer-reviewed journals.

The studies included in the review were restricted to human trials that assessed sub- jective changes in symptoms of depression such as mood anxiety andor cognition after consuming either a probi- otic supplement or a food or drink containing probiotic cultures for an extended period of time.

Results showed that consumption of the probiotic sup- plement significantly decreased BDI scores indicating overall improved symptoms including mood.Effects on stress and anxietySeven of the ten included studies assessed anxiety and stress and all but two reported improvements after treat- ment with a probiotic.
