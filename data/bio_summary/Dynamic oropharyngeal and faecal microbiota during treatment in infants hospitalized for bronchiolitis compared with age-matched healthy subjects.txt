several genera accounted for the lowered abundance of the op microbiota in the hospitalized infants including neisseria 1.57 vs 12.40 in the healthy infants q-value  0.001 bacteroides 0.71 vs 4.43 in the healthy infants q-value  0.05 haemophilus 0.28 vs 4.72 in the healthy infants q-value  0.001 granulicatella 0.40 vs 2.19 in the healthy infants q-value  0.001 leptotrichia 0.07 vs 1.46 in the healthy infants q-value  0.001 and porphyromonas 0.29 vs 2.78 in the healthy infants q-value  0.01 fig.

according to the association analysis the bronchiolitis onset significantly con- tributed to the differences in the fmop microbiota between the healthy and diseased children q-value  0.001 supplementary table.fm and op microbiota of the infants with bronchiolitis differed from that of the healthy infants.

the infants who harboured positive cultures of streptococcus pneumoniae h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis in their hypopharynx at four weeks of age had a higher incidence of pneumonia and bronchiolitis.the oropharynx op microbiota is more analogous to the lrt microbiota than to the np microbiota .

we explored the following two issues in this study 1. whether the fm and op microbiota in the diseased children differed from those in the healthy infants and 2. whether the fm and op microbiota structures changed after clinical therapy.resultsparticipants and data output.

we established a streptococcus-dominant op microbiota profile in both the hospitalized and healthy infants which could be attributed to the differing microbiota components between the np and op .

we also recruited 22 age-matched healthy infants for this study.the faecal and op microbiota diversity in the patients was lower than that in the healthy children.

klebsiella 20.80 vs 0.86 in the healthy infants clostridium 7.32 vs 1.27 in the healthy infants and enterococcus 11.20 vs 3.19 in the healthy infants were also more prevalent in the fm in the children with bronchiolitis but this differ- ence was not statistically significant fig.

an imbalanced oropharynx op microbiota has been reported in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis however the microbiota dynamics in the op and faeces during therapy remain unexplored.

the infants with the enterobacterveillonella-dominant microbiota cluster exhibited the lowest incidence of bronchiolitis and the bacteroides-dominant microbiota profile was associated with the greatest incidence of bronchiolitis onset.

this study revealed an imbalanced fmop microbiota in children with viral bronchiolitis which is consistent with that identified in other respiratory diseases such as asthma and cystic fibrosis .the distal effect of the gut microbiota gm on respiratory health is profoundly affected by the regulation of the host immune system.

the op microbiota in both the healthy and diseased infants was dominated by streptococcus.
