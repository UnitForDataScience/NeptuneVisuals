Two survey studies with American institutional review board IRB and Canadian research ethics board REB chairs and vice- chairs respectively found that most respondents saw a prominent role for IRBsREBs in defining the criteria circumstances and processes by which individual gen- etic research results should be returned to participants and their families Likewise the roles of IRBs REBs researchers biobank personnel and research participants should be further deliberated in human microbiome research to develop ethical guidelines and practices with respect to return of results.ConclusionsWe have discussed the social and ethical challenges associated with biobanking for human microbiome re- search focusing on the debate over identifiability and ethical challenges of returning individual results and incidental findings for clinical management.

By articulating these ethical challenges we hope to contribute to the discussion on the ELSI of human microbiome re- search in ways that can foster more collaborative dialogue between scientists biobank personnel research ethics boards and relevant regulatory agencies for ethical guid- ance regarding the use of human microbiome research samples and related data.AcknowledgementsWe gratefully acknowledge helpful comments from Susan Wallace and from the Discourse Science Publics research group on an earlier version of this paper.FundingWe gratefully acknowledge funding for this work from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.Availability of data and materialsNA.Authors' contributionsKC conceived the main discussion points carried out the background research and drafted the manuscript.

The unclear delineation between bacterial colonization and infection poses the eth- ical dilemma of assessing under what circumstances and to whom to disclose which requires a careful balance of the potential benefits and harms of disclosing compared to not disclosing.In human genetics and human genomics it has beenrecommended that research results and incidental find- ings that are analytically valid clinically significant and actionable should be returned to participants who have consented to receiving research findings While these recommendations are relevant for human micro- biome research there is a need for more grounded un- derstanding of contextual factors that may be unique to human microbiome research in addressing what criteriato determine returnable findings and developing ethical practices for managing disclosure.

have raised the issue that both human genetic and human microbiome re- search may bring into existence new group stigmas that are unknown to researchers or individuals prior to par- ticipation in the research Of concern is whether existing laws and regulations such as the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act PIPEDA in Canada or the Genetic Information Non- discrimination Act GINA in the U.S.A. are adequate and sufficient to protect individuals or groups from stigmatization and discrimination based on information from their microbiome.Return of individual research results and incidental findingsDespite significant advances in human microbiome re- search there is limited understanding of the practical and clinical relevance of most research findings to date.

In particular we provide a detailed discussion with regard to whether microbiome-related data can provide additional information that is personal and sensitive be- yond genetic data and the potential of returning research findings for clinical care.Categorization and identifiability of the human microbiome In this section we focus on ethical issues associated with categorizing human microbiome research samples and the debate over whether the human microbiome can provide uniquely identifying information.

used the term biobank research systemto illustrate the relationship between three entities 1 primary researchers or collection sites feeding data and samples into the biobank 2 the biobank with some biobanks collecting and analyzing datasamples them- selves and 3 secondary researchers accessing data samples from the biobank for further research Ar- guably a biobank for human microbiome research has the management responsibility to ensure that secondary researchers who receive the coded data andor samples cannot readily re-identify the subjects if the design of the biobank has been established to maintain the possi- bility of re-identification.

examined investigator perspectives on the commercialization of human microbiome research Their study raised concerns over how the scientific value of research into the human microbiome and health is mobilized by the marketplace to promote the consumption of probiotics and dietary supplements despite a lack of regulation and knowledge about the safety and effectiveness of these products.

We focus specifically on 1 ethical considerations of categorization and identifiability of samples biobanked for human microbiome research and 2 clinical actionability of human microbiome re- search and ethical challenges associated with returning in- dividual research results and incidental findings.CF is a common fatal genetic disease among individuals of European backgrounds with an estimated frequency of about 1 in 2500 live births Patients experience progres- sive deterioration of pulmonary function and eventually Correspondence 1Department of Psychology University of Guelph Guelph ONN1G 2W1CanadaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articledeath due to recurrent microbial infections of the respira- tory tracts.

for more details on public health implications of technologies developed on the basis of human microbiome research In the sections below we focus our discussion on the ethical implications of biobanking for human microbiome research that can have profound impact on the individ- uals.

Humans are also framed as hybrids that blur the boundaries between the human self and microbes.From a bioethical perspective in the context of re- search and biobanking it is currently not clear whether the human microbiome should be categorized as part of or separate from the human body  Similar to some samples collected and biobanked for human gen- etic and other research purposes some types of samples biobanked for human microbiome research might otherwise be considered waste e.g.
