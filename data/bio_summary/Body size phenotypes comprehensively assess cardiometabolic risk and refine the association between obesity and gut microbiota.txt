the biochemical and anthropometric characteristics of each resulting group are summarized in 1. overall we observed that the measured variables deteriorate with increased bmi and that there are further discrepancies within a given bmi category when distinguishingthe gut microbiota associates with disease riskto determine whether the used categorizations improve the assessment of differences in the gut microbiota we contrasted several ecological indices.

the gut microbiota has been associated with obesity and cardiovascular healthalbeit with small effect sizes.while our results show that the proportion ofthe variance in the gut microbiota explained by any of the explored categorizations is low the use of bsp allows better distinguishing dissimilarities in the microbial community confirm- ing our first hypothesis.

akkermansia muciniphila has become one of the main targets of research and intervention in the human gutas it has been consistently linked with metabolic health and leanness.similarly other members of this cag such as alistipes and bacteroides from lean mice quickly invade the microbiota of co-housed obese micemembers of the ruminococcaceae-cag such as methanobrevibacter oscillospira and dialister are associated with lower bmi and weight reduction.analyses by otus showed strong agreement with those obtained with cags corroborating that cags are valuable tools that thoroughly capture the complex and multivariate nature of the gut microbiota.a key parameter linking health and the gut microbiota is a- diversity.

regarding obesity early research showed that the gut microbiota of obese mice is enriched in firmicutes and reduced in bacteroidetes relative to lean animals.

rather alterations in the microbiota associated with changes in the nutritional status are observed on particular microorganisms from lower taxonomic ranks for example genus species.

i the incorporation of cardiometabolic data to subdivide three categories of bmi allows a better identification of dissimilarities in the gut microbiota.

ii within a given bmi category marker taxa associated with obesity and cardiometabolic disease are more abundant in cardiometabolically abnormal than healthy individuals marker taxa are groups of microbes that can be quantified to inform about a clinical condition.materials and methodsstudy populationsample size was calculated following a previous study performed by the same team.accordingly 28 subjects per bmi category were necessary to observe significant differences in the gut microbiota at the phylum levelcaloric intake physical activity smoking and medicament use these variables were self-reported using specific questionnaires.

blood insulin served to calculate the insulin resistance index using the homeostasis model assessment homa-ir.body size phenotypesto categorize participants according to their body size phenotypes we used the definition proposed by wildman et al.where bmi categories are subdivided by the cardiometabolic health status of individuals using the strict criteria implemented by tomiyama et al.that is individuals are considered metabolically abnormal when they have 2 of the following conditions systolicdiastolic blood pressure 13085 mm hg or consump- tion of antihypertensive medication fasting triglycerides 150 mg dl - 1 hdl o40 mg dl - 1 men o50 mg dl- 1 women or consumption of lipid-lowering medication fasting glucose 100 mg dl - 1 or consumption of antidiabetic medication homa-ir 43 and hs-crp 43 mg l - 1. we selected homa-ir and hs-crp cutoffs that better reflect the biochemical characteristics of the studied population.gut microbiota characterizationa detailed description of laboratory and bioinformatics procedures can be found elsewhere.briefly each participant collected a fecal sample from which the total microbial dna was extracted using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit.

we processed amplicons using mothur v.1.36 following its standard operating procedure as available on november 2015. operational taxonomic units otus delimited at 97 identity were generated and classified using greengenes 13899. after bioinformatics curation the number of sequences per individual ranged from 3667 to 102700 with a median of 28561. analyses that required absolute otu frequencies were performed on sequence counts rarefied to 3667 sequences per sample otherwise the relative otu abundance was calculated for each sample.to detect changes in the composition of the gut microbiota at fine scale we first defined co-abundance groups of microbes cags that is otus that are found more frequently together hence exhibit positive abundance correlations and that reflect the underlying microbial structure.cags were defined by calculating the spearman's correlation coefficients between all otus that had median abundance 0.01 across all samples and by applying the hierarchical clustering with ward's linkage.

we controlled for potential confounding age sex city of origin calorie intake and physical activity in all models.for the gut microbiota we computed a-diversity using the shannon index and species richness and tested for differences among bmi chs and bsp using anova.

furthermore a significant chs x bmi interaction was found when a linear model using bmi as a continuous variable and species richness was constructed anova f2438  6.16 p  0.002 b. differences in the shannon index were not significant but showed the same trend d. most interestingly the observed pattern is reminiscent of that obtained with the anthropometric and biochemical variables changes in a- diversity are mainly explained by differences in bmi categories nevertheless it is possible to further differentiate individuals within a given category by their cardiometabolic health status being the loss in a-diversity exacerbated in cardiometabolically abnormal individuals supplementary table s4.next we evaluated the proportion of the variance in the gut microbiota composition explained by the body size phenotypes.figure 3. association between bmi and a-diversity metrics with and without adjusting for chs.

for both metrics body size phenotypes better explained shifts in the gut microbiota than either bmi or cardiometabolic health status alone.

the proportion of the variance explained by bsp weighted r2  0.017 p  0.015 unweighted r2  0.014 p  0.007 was almost twice that of bmi weighted r2  0.010 p  0.001 unweighted r2  0.007 p  0.002 and more than twice that of chs weighted r2  0.007 p  0.002 unweighted r2  0.004 p  0.003. sensitivity analyses on a and b diversities using the subset of participants that did not smoke or consume medicaments showed similar results as the complete dataset supplementary figure s1 supplementary tables s4 and s5.analyses of b diversity indicate that the gut microbiota of individuals categorized by different methods is as a whole somewhat different.

we found no significant differences in phylum-level microbial markers between cardiometabolic status or body size phenotypes.next we looked into changes in specific networks of co- abundant microbes.the gut microbiota of our cohort forms the following five cags supplementary figure s2.
