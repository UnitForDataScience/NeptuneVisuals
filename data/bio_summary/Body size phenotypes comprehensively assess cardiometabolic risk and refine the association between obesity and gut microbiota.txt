Overall we observed that the measured variables deteriorate with increased BMI and that there are further discrepancies within a given BMI category when distinguishingThe gut microbiota associates with disease riskTo determine whether the used categorizations improve the assessment of differences in the gut microbiota we contrasted several ecological indices.

The gut microbiota has been associated with obesity and cardiovascular healthalbeit with small effect sizes.While our results show that the proportion ofthe variance in the gut microbiota explained by any of the explored categorizations is low the use of BSP allows better distinguishing dissimilarities in the microbial community confirm- ing our first hypothesis.

Akkermansia muciniphila has become one of the main targets of research and intervention in the human gutas it has been consistently linked with metabolic health and leanness.Similarly other members of this CAG such as Alistipes and Bacteroides from lean mice quickly invade the microbiota of co-housed obese micemembers of the Ruminococcaceae-CAG such as Methanobrevibacter Oscillospira and Dialister are associated with lower BMI and weight reduction.Analyses by OTUs showed strong agreement with those obtained with CAGs corroborating that CAGs are valuable tools that thoroughly capture the complex and multivariate nature of the gut microbiota.A key parameter linking health and the gut microbiota is a- diversity.

Regarding obesity early research showed that the gut microbiota of obese mice is enriched in Firmicutes and reduced in Bacteroidetes relative to lean animals.

i The incorporation of cardiometabolic data to subdivide three categories of BMI allows a better identification of dissimilarities in the gut microbiota.

ii Within a given BMI category marker taxa associated with obesity and cardiometabolic disease are more abundant in cardiometabolically abnormal than healthy individuals marker taxa are groups of microbes that can be quantified to inform about a clinical condition.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy populationSample size was calculated following a previous study performed by the same team.Accordingly 28 subjects per BMI category were necessary to observe significant differences in the gut microbiota at the phylum levelCaloric intake physical activity smoking and medicament use These variables were self-reported using specific questionnaires.

Analyses that required absolute OTU frequencies were performed on sequence counts rarefied to 3667 sequences per sample otherwise the relative OTU abundance was calculated for each sample.To detect changes in the composition of the gut microbiota at fine scale we first defined co-abundance groups of microbes CAGs that is OTUs that are found more frequently together hence exhibit positive abundance correlations and that reflect the underlying microbial structure.CAGs were defined by calculating the Spearman's correlation coefficients between all OTUs that had median abundance 0.01 across all samples and by applying the hierarchical clustering with Ward's linkage.

We controlled for potential confounding age sex city of origin calorie intake and physical activity in all models.For the gut microbiota we computed a-diversity using the Shannon index and species richness and tested for differences among BMI CHS and BSP using ANOVA.

Differences in the Shannon index were not significant but showed the same trend d. Most interestingly the observed pattern is reminiscent of that obtained with the anthropometric and biochemical variables changes in a- diversity are mainly explained by differences in BMI categories nevertheless it is possible to further differentiate individuals within a given category by their cardiometabolic health status being the loss in a-diversity exacerbated in cardiometabolically abnormal individuals Supplementary Table S4.Next we evaluated the proportion of the variance in the gut microbiota composition explained by the body size phenotypes.Figure 3.
