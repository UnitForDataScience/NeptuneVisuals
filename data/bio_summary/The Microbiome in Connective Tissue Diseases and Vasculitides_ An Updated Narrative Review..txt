we found some evidence that dysbiosis participates in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus systemic sclerosis sjogren's syndrome and behcet's disease but there are still few data concerning the role of dysbiosis in other ctds or vasculitides.

on the contrary the presence ruminococcus blautia faecalibacterium and roseburia bacteria increased during disease remission.there are no published data concerning dysbiosis in small vessel vasculitides although it has been demonstrated that gut dysbiosis in glomerulonephritis mice models with a prevalence of escherichia coli or citrobacter rodentium may locally expand th17 lymphocytes which could then migrate to the kidney through a chemokine pathway involv- ing c-c motif chemokine ligand 20 ccl20 and c-c motif chemokine receptor 6 ccr6 accordingly patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody- anca- associ- ated vasculitis develop a form of necrotising glomerulone- phritis sustained by the infiltration of th17 cells that may be preactivated in the gut by a change in microbial composi- tion.

with clinical manifestations and the production of some proinflammatory cytokines in sle patients.alterations in the mycobiome may underlie fibrotic skin and lung diseases as the fibrotic skin areas of ssc patients may be colonised by rhodotorula glutinis which is known to be involved in fibrosing diseases.intestinal dysbiosis has also been demonstrated in ss patients and interestingly gingival colonisation by capno- cytphaga ochracea in genetically predisposed subjects may lead to the activation of the adaptive immune system through the cross-reactivity against a von willebrand factor type a domain protein vwfa that is produced by the microorgan- ism and ro-ssa self-antigens.the evidence that dysbiosis may be involved in the path- ogenesis of myositides and vasculitides is weaker but some studies of bd patients have found taxonomic variations in the microbial composition of the gut that were not affected by concurrent immunosuppressive therapies.

no studies addressed the role of dysbiosis in the onset of small vessel vasculitides although some experiments on ani- mal models could support the role of intestinal microbiome in the activation of autoreactive th17 cells in anca- associated vasculitides.overall the contribution of dysbiosis in tuning the immune response has a rationale in ctds and vasculitides although there are currently less evidences than in chronic autoimmune arthritides.

only a few studies have explored the involvement of dysbiosis in other ctds or vasculitides and further research is needed.introductionthe human microbiota harboured by each person consists of 10-100 trillion symbiotic microbial cells mainly bacteria in the gut but also viruses yeasts protozoa and even hel- minths.

the sum of human microbes and their genes existing within and on the human body collectively known as the microbiome has been found to be a principal factor in human health and disease humans and microbes have coevolved to establish a symbiotic relationship over time but perturbations known also as dysbiosis may occur and drive several diseases including autoimmune disorders.

over the last few decades new insights provided by dna sequence-based analyses of human microbial communities have renewed interest in mucosal immunology and suggest that alterations in the human microbiome can also affect the development of rheumatic diseases.the concept that human microbiota may modulate systemic autoimmunity is not new but the underlyingmechanisms of autoimmune regulation by the microbiome are just beginning to emerge studies of animal models published 30 years ago demonstrated a relationship between the development of inflammatory arthritis and the pres- enceabsence of some intestinal bacteria and more recently many studies have drawn attention to the potential role of the oral microrganism porphyromonas gingivalis in the development of rheumatoid arthritis ra a recent study of the lung microbiome in a cohort of patients with early ra has found distal airway dysbiosis similar to that detected in sarcoidol lung inflammation but although various studies have investigated the different composition of gut microbiota in patients affected by ra and spondyloar- thritis spa the complex mechanisms by which microbes influence the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases are still unknown.connective tissue diseases ctds encompass a wide group of immune-mediated diseases characterized by the inflammation of the connective tissues of the body sustainedby the activation of the immune system against self-epitopes expressed on cells and matrix.

similarly vasculitides have a wide range of clinical manifestations according to the vascular district involved by the inflammatory process.like in inflammatory arthritides it is presumable that in genetic predisposed individuals dysbiosis activates several immune pathways favouring in turn the development of ctds or vasculitides.as there are currently only limited animal and human data available concerning the potential link between the microbiome and systemic autoimmune diseases other than spa and ra the aim of this narrative review is to provide an updated view of the involvement of microbiome in the pathogenesis of ctds and vasculitides.materials and methodssources and selection criteria.

neutralising c3 by adding the compstatin analogue cp40 may prevent local inflammation and the subsequent release of il-17 or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand rankl perhaps by restoring dysbiosis immune complexes formed by ribonucleoproteins autolo- gous nucleic acids and immunoglobulin g igg bind to fragment cristallizable receptors fcgriia and trigger intra- cellular responses by binding endosomal tlrs thus inducing complement activation and ifn production.

gut dysbiosis could be at the basis of local or systemic inflammation by modulating the immune response engagement of tlr9 by com- mensal flora may modulate the t-effectorregulator ratio in nonautoimmune animal models and lead ifn signature in sle.

sle patients had reduced levels of homoserine lactone and n-acetylmuramic acid and increased level of ribose-15-bisphosphate which in contrast to healthy subjects were not influenced by body mass index bmi furthermore studies on gut dysbiosis in sle demonstrated a reduced ratio of firmicutesbacteroidetes that may be at the basis of an altered differentiation of th effectors selecting th17 clones to the detriment of tregulator ones with the subsequent production of proinflam- matory cytokines.

the most representative characteristic of gi involvement is fibrosis of the muscular tunic which is associated with reduced peristalsis however there is some evidence that there are mucosal alterations associated with altered intesti- nal permeability and possibly dysbiosis.
