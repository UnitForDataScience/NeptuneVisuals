It is suf- ficient to remind here a couple of the discoveries that made it to newspaper headlines such as the demonstrated impact of antibiotic treatment on newborn metabolism and health downstream of microbiota alterations  the link between gut microbiota and autism  the study of skin microbiota said to have caused the ban of nineteen soaps in the USA  or for a more exotic touch the dependence of light organ development and camouflage capacity of the squid on the colonization by the luminous bacteria Vibrio fischeri -.Particular attention has been paid to the microbiota asso-ciated with the gut and how host physiology can be deranged by modifications of this intestinal microbiota  .

On the other hand in state of dysbiosis the microbiota drains on the host resources which results in growth depressionDespite the undisputable advantages of invertebrate mod- els the simplicity of the microbiota difference in physi- ological processes and the lack of adaptive immune system is also a limiting factor for testing hypothesis relevant to humans where the microbiota comprise both aerobes and anaerobes.

Manipulations of the human gut microbiota as those obtained by fecal transplantations or following antibiotic treatments provide functional data on potential cause-consequence relationships between changes in microbiota and alterations in host physiology .

One can then ask what the contribu- tion of the microbiota is to a given phenotypic trait of inter- est in the host and can test whether the trait is transferable by the microbiota.

The main findings are i an overall small number of different bacterial species isolated from fly guts ranging in the order of tens therefore much less than the hundreds of different species isolated in a given human gut microbiotaii the exact gut microbiota makeup varies according to the life stage at which specimens were gathered and primarily to the food substrate on which flies lived pointing at a close link between gut microbiota and diet iii a handful of recur- rent and dominating species can be named including species from the Acetobacteraceae and Lactobacillaceae families such as Acetobacter pomorum Acetobacter tropicalis Lac- tobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus plantarum -.

A crucial finding in those studies   was the identification of single bacterial species from the microbiota pool that can recapitulate the beneficial effects of the whole gut microbiota when mono-associated with axenic embryos.

Would this explain why B-vitamins supplementation compensates microbiota elimination in Drosophila larvae  The fast pace at which research in C. elegans can proceed promises many more exciting discoveries in the near future.Results of research on the microbiota of crustaceans do not deviate from these main lines.

Interestingly when mice receiving microbiota from healthy or severely stunted infants were co-housed together the growth discriminatory taxa from the microbiota of the former were able to invade that of the latter and prevent the growth impairments in the recipient animals.

This would suggest that also gnotobiotic dysbiotic microbiota especially under poor nutritional condition is responsible for growth depression a phenomenon which we discussed earlier in the part related to growth and intestinal microbiota in the chicken.A major contributor to childhood malnutrition is envi- ronmental enteropathy a poorly understood inflammatory disorder of the small intestine.

Remov- ing pathogens and modifying the diversity of intestinal microbiota with improved hygiene and widespread antibi- otic therapeutic use might lead to the same growth-increasephenomenon as observed for the SPF or antibiotic-treated mice.Taken together we have seen that in vertebrates the intestinal microbiota represents key partner in the juvenile growth.
