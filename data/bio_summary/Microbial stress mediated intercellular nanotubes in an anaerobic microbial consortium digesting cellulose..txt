While the initial inhibition in methane production was expected due to IONp cytotoxicity within the test reactors biomass stress had also been observed with the control reactors this observation implied that the use of insoluble microcrystalline cellulose as the substrate for anaerobic digestion within both the control as well as test reactors could have been also one of the contributing factors to biomass stress.Analysis of the biomass stress on day zero indicated relatively high BSI values at 31.8 in the control and 30.9 in the test reactors which further increased by 72.2 shortly after IONp addition to a final value of 53.2 on day zero in the test reactors.

Briefly 2 mL of test sludge was mixed with 8 mL of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid taken in a capped test tube 2 glass beads were added into the mixture to enhance mixing.

Assay Using a clean pipette tip 100 mL of the LumiSolve Stabilizer Tube mixture containing the test sample was added to 300 uL of Luminase taken in a clean12 x 55 mm assay test tube.

Two tailed Student t-test with equal variance was used to determine statistical sig- nificance in the bioprocess results between the control and test systems as well as differences in the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers in the microbial populations between the control and iron oxide nanoparticles- augmented test reactors.

Supplementation of the anaerobic batch reactors digesting cellulose with iron oxide nanoparticles IONp resulted in a slight lag in methane production from the test reactors in comparison to the control.

This event was likely due to the increased biomass stress exerted on the anaerobic sludge microbiota by the iron oxide nanoparticles which resulted in loss of microbial cell numbers within the test reactors Fig.

However on day five a drop in pH from 8.1 to 7.1 indicative of increased hydrolytic and acidogenic activity was noted within the test reactors whereas within the control reactors the change in pH was not significant Table .

and hydrogen gas detected within the test reactors.

The methane and carbon dioxide compositions of the biogas produced during anaerobic digestion has been presented in Table .Enhanced microbial syntrophy within the test reactors was followed by an improvement in methane produc- tion together with a significant increase p  0.05 in soluble COD from 124.9 mgL on day zero to 837.5 mgL Fig.

The acetate concentration was determined to be 487.25 mgL within the test reactors and 23.65 mgL in the control reactors Fig.
