The neonatal brain is more vulnerable to cir- culating molecules which may be directly or indirectly attributed to the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota MacFabe 2012 and it is during the postnatal period of gut microbiota development that the microbiota exerts significant influence over the developing brain Clarke et al.

Potential strate- gies include restoring intestinal permeability via the gut microbiota promoting gut microbiota diversity duringold age to improve health outcomes and modulating microbiota through diet Kelly et al.

Although early information regarding the intes- tinal microbiota was derived from culture-dependent techniques which revealed only the minority of species amenable to cultivation the advent of DNA-based anal- yses has provided information on the composition and function of previously uncultured microbiota Power et al.

The composition of the microbiota changes fur- ther with the introduction of solid foods and a stable community similar to the adult microbiota becomes established postweaning Power et al.

2010 examined the ef- fect of diet on gut microbiota by comparing the fecal microbiota of European children consuming a Western diet with children in Burkina Faso who consume a plant- rich diet high in fiber.

Host genotype also influences microbiota as monozygotic twins show the greatest similarity in their microbiota Murphy et al.

Therefore modulating the microbiota with dietary interventions may be a potential strategy for pro- moting healthier aging O'Toole and Jeffery 2015.WHAT IS THE MICROBIOME- GUT-BRAIN AXISComponents and Signaling along the Microbiome- Gut-Brain AxisThere is extensive communication between the brain and the microbiota in the gut via the brain-gut-mi- crobiome axis.

2004.The role of microbiota in stress is being increas- ingly recognized because key findings have shown that stress influences the composition of the gut microbiota and that bidirectional communication between micro- biota and the CNS influences stress reactivity Foster and McVey Neufeld 2013.

2006.THE GUT MICROBIOME AND BEHAVIORSeveral models of microbiota manipulation in- cluding GF mice antibiotic administration FMT probiotics and prebiotics have demonstrated the im- portant role that the gut microbiota plays in behavior.

Further evidence of the role of microbiota in anxiety-like behavior was provided when GF male Swiss Webster mice were colonized with microbiota from specific pathogen-free BALBC mice.
