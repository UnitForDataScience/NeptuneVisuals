Thus the use of this enzyme inevitably results in high numbers of free amino acids.Table 1Total and free amino acids g100 g protein of the four BWSPH A  Alcalase P  Protamex S  Savinase F  Flavourzyme and recommended amino acid require- ments of adults WHO 2002.

Protein and fat analyses were performed in duplicate.Total and free amino acidsFree amino acid content was determined for the BWSPH according to .

For total amino acid content of BWSPH proteins were hydrolyzed in 6N HCl at 110 degC for 23 h and the resulting hydrolysates analyzed as per free amino acid method.Molecular weight distribution profilecalibrated with standard proteins dissolved at 1 mgmL in distilled water and elutes were monitored at 214 nm.

These results suggest that hydrolysis with Flavourzyme yielded a high proportion of shorter di- and tri- peptides and free amino acids.The key characteristics of protein quality for health are digestibility and amino acid composition.

From the molecular weight distribution of peptides in the four BWSPH it is expected they would all have a fast digestion and ab- sorption rate.Total and free amino acidsAs outlined above for protein quality a key characteristic to con- sider is amino acid composition.

WHO  World Health Organisation.Of the 20 standard proteinogenic amino acids nine of them are es- sential amino acids EAA which the body cannot produce and therefore need to be acquired in the diet.

The amino acids alanine aspartic acid serine methionine and glutamic acid have been associated with umami flavors   while threonine glycine serine proline and alanine are important sweet tasting amino acids  .

When considering the total amino acid composition of the BWSPH umami is likely to be the strongest sensory flavor experienced .Functional properties of BWSPHProtein hydrolysate functionality is influenced by the amino acid composition and sequence as well as the size of peptides and the charge and distribution of charges of the molecules.

Furthermore fish proteins are highly digestible and have excellent es- sential amino acid EAA profiles that closely approximate human dietary requirements as set by the World Health Organisation WHO.
