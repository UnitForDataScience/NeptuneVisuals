Email change expression of different genes participating in cell death and apoptosis 3 invasion and metastasis 4 cancer stem cell maintenance 5 as well as cell cycle control 6.

The progenitor cell initiating cellcancer stem cell or metastatic cell are now considered as the seed whereas host factors stroma or the organ microenvironment are regarded as the soil 70.

The results of these studies have been summarized in the following sections.Evidence acquisitionWe performed a computerized search of the MEDLINEPUBMED Web of Knowledge Scopus ProQuest and Google Scholar databases with key words cancer probiotics lactobacilli metastasis and invasion within the maximal date range until 2017.Cell-cell adhesionTight junction between epithelial and endothelial cells has a critical role in preserving cell to cell integrity.

Considering the constitutive activation of STAT3 in many cancers and its fundamental roles in different steps of metastasis cascade such as cell transformation and migration angiogenesis as well as modulation of tumor microenvironment 62 its down-regulation by lactobacilli might affect metastasis potential of cancer cells.

Considerably cell- free supernatants CFS from L. casei and L. rhamnosus GG have been shown to prevent colon cancer cell invasion suggesting that probiotic CFS has anti-metastatic bioactive substances that may participate in cell in vation decrease in vitro 18.

Notably L. acidophilus and L. casei supernatants and cell extracts have decreased cell invasion capacity.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition EMTEMT is a biological process that permits a polarized epithelial cell which typically interacts with basement membrane through its basal surface to undertake numerous biochemical alterationswhich result in acquisition of a mesenchymal cell phenotype.

Considering the role of MMPs in the maintenance of EMT 17 the observed role of lactobacilli in down-regulation of MMPs 4 implies a putative role for them in suppression of EMT.Live L. casei has been demonstrated to induce apoptotic cell death in both murine CT26 and human HT29 colon carcinoma cell lines as well as an experimental tumor model.

Special attention has been given to the effects of probiotics in reduction of invasion and metastasis in cancer cells in cell line studies as well as animal models and human studies.

Several studies have assessed the effects of probiotics on critical steps of invasion and metastasis such as interruption of cell-cell adhesion epithelial- mesenchymal transition tumor microenvironment and cancer stem cell maintenance.
