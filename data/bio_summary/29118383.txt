Of the infants colonized by L. reuteri 93 1314 were also colonized by E. coli whereas 69 3551 of infants not colonized by L. reuteri were colonized by E. coli however this difference was not statis- tically significant Chi-squared test P  0.07.

Differences within groups colonized or not colonized by L. reuteri colonized or not colonized by E. coli were assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.

We found no differences in microbial diversity in infants colonized or not colonized by E. coli and no association between density of E. coli colonization and number of peaks by AluI digestion Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r  -0.12 P  0.49.

Infants were categorized as colonized or not colonized by E. coli at both time points by E. coli colonization status at day 28.

bChi-Squared test c Mann-Whitney U test dCalculated using probiotic n 75 placebo n 65 colonized by L. reuteri n 13 and not colonized by L. reuteri n 47 due to missing data.The use of quantitative real-time PCR qPCR for detection of L. reuteri and E. coli enabled density-based analysis of bacterial loads.

We hypothesized that infants colonized with L. reuteri would have lower E. coli colonization greater microbial diver- sity lower intestinal inflammation calprotectin levels and lower crying time when compared to infants not colonized with L. reuteri.ResultsSixty-five infants 31 probiotic 34 placebo were included in this study.

Infants colonized with L. reuteri had a median colonization den- sity of 3.6 x 105 genome equivalentsml Interquartile range IQR 5.0 x 104 8.7 x 105 genome equivalentsml while infants colonized with E. coli had a median colonization density of 1.5 x 107 genome equivalentsml IQR5.0 x 106 3.5 x 107 genome equivalentsml Fig.

There was no difference in E. coli density in infants colonized or not colonized by L. reuteri Table .

There was no statistically significant difference between median change in crying time from day 0 to day 28 between infants colonized 81.3 minday IQR 15.5 263.6 or not colonized 193.8 minday IQR 125.7 295.6 by E. coli Mann-Whitney U test P  0.07.

However in infants colonized by E. coli there was a negative association between E. coli colonization density and number of peaks in profiles generated by Sau96I digestion Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r  -0.33 P  0.03.
