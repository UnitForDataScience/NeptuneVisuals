differences within groups colonized or not colonized by l. reuteri colonized or not colonized by e. coli were assessed using the wilcoxon signed-rank test and between groups using the mann-whitney u test.

we hypothesized that infants colonized with l. reuteri would have lower e. coli colonization greater microbial diver- sity lower intestinal inflammation calprotectin levels and lower crying time when compared to infants not colonized with l. reuteri.resultssixty-five infants 31 probiotic 34 placebo were included in this study.

a crying time in infants colonized n 12 and not colonized n 44 by l. reuteri.

we found no difference in calprotectin levels in infants colonized or not colonized by l. reuteri and no association between calprotectin levels and crying time at day28.

there were two infants in the l. reuteri colonized group with lower crying times at day 0 than were observed in the not colonized group approximately 60 minday versus minimum of 150 minday.

we found no difference in crying time at day 28 between infants colonized or not colonized by l. reuteri.

there was moderate evidence that infants colonized with e. coli had a smaller reduction in crying from baseline to day 28 however there was no difference between crying time at day 28 when assessed by e. coli colonization status.

employing one of these methods may provide further information on differences in the gi microbiota and greater insight into potential impacts of l. reuteri treatment on the gut microbiome.we found no reduction in crying time in infants colonized with l. reuteri and identified an unexpected positive association between l. reuteri density and crying time.
