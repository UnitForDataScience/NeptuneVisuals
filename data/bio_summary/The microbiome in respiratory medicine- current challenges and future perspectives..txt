reproduced from 102 with permission.in patients with clinically stable copd several studies have now reported a rich lung microbiome that is clearly different from that seen in healthy controls -common phyla in these patients are proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes with pseudomonas streptococcus prevotella and haemophilus being common genera in these patients most data available from copd come from samples obtained from biopsies lung tissue explants bal or psb and sputum -different sampling procedures target different regions of the respiratory system however and results have shown that sputum harbours microbial communities that are different from those in bronchoalveolar samples and have confirmed that in fact bronchi and alveoli of patients with copd contain a distinct microbiome see in dickson et al.
