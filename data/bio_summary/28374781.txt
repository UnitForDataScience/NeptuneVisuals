Therefore an investigation into the radial microbiota diversity and composition along the length of the rat digestive tract was carried out in the present study using a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach.The sequencing results showed that the microbial community diversity increased along the longitudinal axis of the rat digestive tract which was in conflict with the tendency previously found in mice where gastric and duodenal samples had similar levels of diversity with large-intestinal samples.

The topologically distinct co-occurrence networks of core microbiota for these intimate regions may fulfill different roles within this spatially defined ecosystem.In conclusion we have generated the first comprehensive characterization of the normal rat microbiota land- scape which will improve our understanding of the mechanism within various GI niches of this long-standing murine model as well as the development of dysbiotic microbiota associated with diseases.

Amongst these the mucus layer forms a distinct habitat with intimacy to host intestinal tissues and the mucosal microbial metabolites are known to determine the differentiation and function of epithelial and immune cells.For these reasons we have determined the baseline radial composition of taxa and microbial metabolites along the longitudinal axis of the rat digestive tract analyzed the difference in community membership and struc- ture and their relationship unveiled the core microbiota and their co-occurrence relationships within different GI niches and compared the internal biogeographic maps of rats other rodents as well as human beings.

Our study aimed to answer the following questions i How do microbial communities and metabolites change along the length of rat digestive tract ii Which microbial assemblages inhabit each GI niche Is there a core microbiota for a given GI region iii Does the taxonomic profile in feces reflect that of other GI segments iv Do similar physicochemical conditions in identical anatomical sites across host genotype backgrounds shape similar GI microbiotaResultsSamples and Illumina sequencing.

Our study also confirms that fecal samples cannot represent the whole microbiota in thedigestive tract and attention should therefore be paid to ensure that the proper GI samples are selected and used for gut-related disease research.MethodsChemicals and Reagents.

The differences in microbial communities between samples with respect to community membership and structure were measured by unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances taking the microbial phylogenetic information into consideration.

Reads identified as host genome were exclude by blast against the rat reference genomeEnsembl assembly Rnor 6.0 e-value 1e-10  alignment 0.97.Raw reads of 42 samples from 6 C57BL6 mice 2 samples from 3 C57BL6 miceand 30 samples from 5woodrats Neotoma albigulawere downloaded from the NCBI Short Read Archive SRA under accession number SRA061180 ERP000288 and SRP022360 respectively.

On the other hand because of ethical restrictions microbiota profiling for given GI regions could only be found in a short list of studies mainly through hospital-based endoscopic biopsies.Due to limitations in human research murine models have become crucial in studies of the gut microbiota designed to obtain mechanism insights into different anatomical regions through radical and sometimes even destructive means.

On the other hand four facultative anaerobic genera with relatively low abundance Globicatella Lactococcus Staphylococcus and Streptococcus composed a small module which might perform a unique function in this region.Notably the large-intestinal lumen 43 genera and mucus layer 42 genera had the largest core microbiota k. Despite community memberships overlapping to some extent the co-occurrence networks for these two adjacent compartments showed distinct topological properties l. In the large-intestinal lumen core microbiota formed a relatively sparse network diameter 8 centralization 0.18 density 0.17 where 28 anaer- obic organisms belonging to 3 different phyla connected on average to 4.571 neighbors.

When comparing the GI microbiota from different hosts we found that the rat microbial biogeography might represent a new reference distinct from other murine animals.
