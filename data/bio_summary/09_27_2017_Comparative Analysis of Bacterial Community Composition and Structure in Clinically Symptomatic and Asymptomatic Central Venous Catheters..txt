We found that when analyzed as a group asymptomatic samples showed similar total evenness as symptomatic samples but that in both hospitals the asymptomatic samples showed a rank abundance curve slope that was only half as steep as that for symptomatic samples.

acidovorans whereas in asymptomatic samples all five most frequently encountered species were of environmental origin D. acidovorans V. paradoxus C. leidyi Brevundi- monas nasdae and Mesorhizobium amorphae .These results therefore show that while species richnesses were similar between asymptomatic samples from the hospitals species composition varied significantly and no bacterial species assemblage specific to asymptomatic samples could be identified for both sample cohorts.Correlation between clinical and microbiological data.

Asymptomatic samples showed species evenness E0.63 similar to that of symptomatic samples E0.64 but the mean slope for symptomatic samples was two times steeper Curie m0.149 Limoges m 0.203 than for asymptomatic samples Curie m0.077 Limoges m0.105.

The majority of Limoges asymptomatic samples clustered more tightly than Curie asymptomatic samples due to the relatively high abundance of P. aquatica and R. pickettii in these samples.These results therefore show no significant difference in species diversity but reveal a distinct community composition pattern distinguishing symptomatic and asymptom- atic TIVAP samples at the phylum level.

Moreover mean species richness in the overall sample set was significantly higher P 0.0002 in asymptomatic 5.4 - 2.3 speciessample range of 2 to 10 than in symptomatic 2.45 - 2.2 speciessample range of 1 to 8 samples.Based on the concentration of total DNA extracted from asymptomatic TIVAPs for 16S rRNA culture-independent analysis purposes bacterial content appeared much lower in asymptomatic samples than in symptomatic samples.

However the slopes of individual asymptomatic and symptomatic samples in Limoges Hospital P0.02 as well as asymptomatic samples in the two hospitals differed significantly P0.03.These results therefore indicate that symptomatic and asymptomatic sample com- munities were similarly even.

Comparison ofphylum distributions of the detected species showed that symptomatic TIVAP samples contained markedly more species belonging to the Firmicutes whereas asymptomatic samples contained many more species belonging to the Betaproteobacteria .Hierarchical cluster analysis using the Bray-Curtis similarity index was carried out to determine how similar symptomatic and asymptomatic chambers were in terms of bacterial presence and abundance Fig.

The species occurring in both hospitals' asymptomatic TIVAP samples were also all found in symptomatic samples.

Both diversity index values indicated a slightly higher relative diversity for asymptomatic samples Simpson0.83 Shannon2.32 than for symptomatic samples Simpson 0.77 Shannon1.92 Table S5.
