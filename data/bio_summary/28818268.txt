I propose that some beneficial microorgan- isms that produce folic acid and are resistant to metformin's folic acid synthesis inhibitory effect can be used as probiotics in the pre- vention of metformin's gastrointestinal adverse effects .

''Metformin-resistant folic acid producing probiotics or folic acid against metformin's adverse effects like diarrheaAbdullah OlgunIstanbul Kemerburgaz University Faculty of Pharmacy Department of Biochemistry Kartaltepe Mah.

The mechanisms of theseadverse effects are unknown .HypothesisFolic acid producing probiotics that are resistant to metformin can be considered as a strategy against gastrointestinal adverse effects of metformin.

Generation of metformin-resistant folic acid producing bacteria to prevent metformin's adverse effects.

Metformin-sensitive folic acid producing gut bacteria can be detected a made resistant and more folic acid producer b and used as a probiotic to prevent metformin-associated GI adverse effects c.Folic acid is required in the nutrition of bacteria.

The ones that are unable to produce folic acid can get it from folic acid producing neighbouring microorganisms.Metformin can be affecting some types of intestinal bacteria that produce folic acid.

This can disturb normal microbiome bal- ance in a similar manner to antibiotics-associated gastrointestinal side effects.Published information was searched by using the following key- words with different combinations metformin folic acid folate diarrhea probiotics Intestinibacter C. elegans microbiota micro- biome  and database sources NCBI Pubmed and Google Scholar.Consequences of the hypothesis and discussionThese proposed strategies can help medication adherence in patients who will gain huge benefits by continuing metformin.

Diarrhea vomiting nausea flatulence abdominal pain with cramps abdominal swelling dysgeusia constipation and dyspep- sia represent the most common adverse effects of metformin and observed in approximately 30 of patients.

Folic acid can also be supplemented as a chemical drug to prevent adverse effects of metformin.Evaluation of the hypothesisFrom worms to humansMetformin's role in a simple model organism can provide an insight into management of metformin treatment in diabetes patients.

Their folic acid synthesis ability and resistance to metformin can be ameliorated by artificial evolutionselection or convenient genetic techniques if needed.
