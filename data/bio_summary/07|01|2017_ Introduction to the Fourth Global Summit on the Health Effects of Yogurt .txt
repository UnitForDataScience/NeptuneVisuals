Therefore the goal of the Fourth Global Summit on the Health Effects of Yogurt held at the 2016 Experimental Biology meeting was to review the scientific evidence linking yogurt consumption and symptoms of T2D with the goal of translating science into practice.In the first presentation 11 Jordi Salas-Salvado' reviewed the epidemiologic evidence associating dairy consumption and diabetes.

The Fourth Global Summit on the Health Effects of Yogurt is part of the international partnership ''Yogurt in Nutrition Initiative for a Balanced Diet'' YINI.

Although the epidemiologic evidence suggests that yogurt consumption particularly in the context of a healthy overall dietary pattern may reduce the risk of T2D further large-scale intervention studies and randomized clinical trials are warranted to provide the highest-quality evidence linking yogurt consumption to insulin sensitivity and T2D risk.Next Thomas Wolever reviewed the concepts of glycemic index GI and glycemic load GL and the effect of yogurt on glycemic and insulinemic responses 12.
