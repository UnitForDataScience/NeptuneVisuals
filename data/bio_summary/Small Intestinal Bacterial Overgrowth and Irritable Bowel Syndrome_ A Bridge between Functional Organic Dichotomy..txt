a recent proof-of-concept study showing the high frequency of symptom improvement in patients with ibs with sibo further supports this hypothesis.gut liver 201711196-208key words bacterial overgrowth dysbiosis breath tests gastrointestinal microbiota probiotics rifaximinintroductionirritable bowel syndrome ibs is one of the commonest dis- orders encountered in gastroenterology practice.1 ibs is mani- fested by abdominal pain andor discomfort irregular stoolform and passage.2 bloating is another common symptom of ibs.23 patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo in which there is increase in bacteria equal to or greater than 105 colony forming unit per ml of upper gut aspirate2 also ex- perience abdominal pain or discomfort bloating flatulence and loose motion.45 in contrast to the earlier belief sibo is known to occur in absence of anatomical factors predisposing to it.6 a proportion of patients with ibs are known to have sibo.7 re- cent realization that sibo may be associated with symptoms of ibs led to a paradigm shift in understanding the pathogenesis of this condition hitherto thought to be related largely to psy- chological factors8 to more organic nature.7 such realization is well known in other conditions as well for example peptic ulcer once thought to be related to psychological stress9 is now known to be related to infection with helicobacter pylori.1011 hence it is worthwhile reviewing the existing literature on sibo and ibs.gut flora and sibohuman gut harbor 1014 bacterial cells which are 10 times higher than the number of cells in the human body.12 gastro- intestinal gi tract is considered as the most heavily colonized organ and more than 70 of microbes reside in colon.13 the human gi tract is inhabited by a vast number of microbial population including bacteria fungi and viruses.14 bacteria contribute to the largest population of gut microbiota consist- ing of 500 using culture approaches to 1000 by 16s rrna gene sequencing different bacterial species.15 the number of bacteria increases from stomach 101 to 103 bacteriag to the colon 1011 to 1012 bacteriag.13 the small intestine comprises mainly of gram positive and aerobic bacteria and the large in- testine contains predominantly gram negative and anaerobic bacteria.16 majority of bacteria residing in the colon are strictlycorrespondence to uday c. ghoshaldepartment of gastroenterology sanjay gandhi postgraduate institute of medical sciences raebareli road lucknow 226014 india tel 91-522-249-4405 fax 91-522-266-8017 e-mail received on march 14 2016. revised on july 7 2016. accepted on july 11 2016.pissn 1976-2283 eissn 2005-1212 httpsdoi.org10.5009gnl16126this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution non-commercial license which permits unrestricted non-commercial use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited.anaerobes 95 of total followed by facultative anaerobes and aerobes.15 more than 50 bacterial phyla have been identified in human gut.17 major phyla residing in the gut are bacteroidetes and firmicutes whilst proteobacteria verrucomicrobia actino- bacteria fusobacteria and cyanobacteria are present in minor proportion.1318normal gut flora may provide several beneficial effects to the host.

these include female gender older age pre- dominant symptom of bloating and flatulence and diarrheal subtype of ibs.471 in fact in a recent study we found that num- ber of bacterial colonies in the small bowel influenced bristol stool type with higher number being associated with looser stools.39 similar observation has been reproduced in another re- cent study.72 since many patients with ibs might be taking ppis due to overlapping dyspepsia and ppi intake may influence development of sibo this may be one factor predicting occur- rence of sibo among patients with ibs.473 narcotic intake might be another factor causing sibo among patients with ibs due to slowing of gut motility.74 in one study we found that lower value hemoglobin was associated with sibo on ghbt.51 sub- jects with older age are more susceptible to sibo most likely as a result of reduced gi motility intestinal surgery small bowel diverticulosis and use of medications.75 one previous study re- ported that patients older than 55 years with symptoms of ibs particularly abdominal bloating and flatulence were more likely to be positive by ghbt.4 abdominal bloating among patients with ibs might be due to excess gas production by bacterial fer- mentation of undigested carbohydrates in addition to sibo.76microbiological aspects of sibo in ibssibo can be classified into two categories based on difference in bacterial flora 1 gram positive flora might be due to failure of gastric acid barrier and 2 coliform bacteria might be due to failure of intestinal clearance and small bowel anatomical alterations.5277 recently one study based on culture of jejunal aspirates showed that pseudomonas aeruginosa escherichia coli acenetobacter lwoffii staphylococcus species klebsiella pneumoniae streptococcus species acinetobacter baumannii enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were dominant bacteria among patients with sibo.39 pyleris et al.54 reported that of 42112 patients with ibs having sibo e. coli enterococcus species and k. pneumoniae were the predominant species.

in these studies frequency of sibo among patients with ibs ranged between 19 and 37 and that among healthy controls between 0 and 12.2739546264676870 it is worthwhileevaluating the reasons for such wide variation in frequency of sibo in these studies.explanation for difference in prevalence of sibo in ibsvariations in prevalence of sibo in patients with ibs and controls in several studies might be attributed to difference in geographical origin of studied population different criteria for diagnosis of ibs such as manning rome i ii and iii and methods for diagnosis of sibo using different breath tests suchas nature of substrates gases analyzed instrument.51 early peak criteria of lhbt give higher frequency of sibo among patients with ibs and controls than other diagnostic methods which might be attributed to false positive results.740575960 whilst double peak criteria on lhbt and ghbt give low frequency of sibo in ibs patients and controls which might be due to low sensitivity.7 advanced noninvasive diagnostic techniques must be standardized for therapeutic management of sibo in patients with ibs.factors associated with sibo among patients with ibsthere are several factors that are associated with sibo among patients with ibs.

this percent- age was significantly higher than the control population 315 20. these data might suggest that somatic hypersensitivity is also influenced by altered gut flora.treatment of sibo in patients with ibsthere are several approaches to treat sibo among patients with ibs that include antibiotics probiotics and prokinetics.106 dietary manipulation has potential influence on the gut mi- crobiota that may relieve some of the symptoms of sibo.222107 recently utility of therapeutic manipulation of gut flora using antibiotic and probiotic2 to treat ibs is being increasingly rec- ognized and hence worth reviewing.antibioticswhile choosing antibiotics one should consider whether its antibacterial spectrum is broad including aerobes and anaerobes and absorption is poor reducing systemic side effects.108 though in the past tetracycline doxycycline co-trimoxazole fluoro- quinolones have all been used in the treatment of sibo109110 in most of the recent studies among patients with ibs rifaximin has been the preferred antibiotic table 2.52108111-114rifaximin is a semi-synthetic nonabsorbable antimicrobial agent that acts against gram positive and gram negative aero- bic and anaerobic bacteria.108 pimentel et al.115 reported two identically designed large multicenter double blind placebo- controlled trials target 1 and target 2 among patientswith nonconstipating ibs n1260 diagnosed by rome ii cri- teria.

likewise formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylala- nine may affect the enteric nervous system.91-94bacteria utilize intraluminal proteins leading to production ofammonia.95 bacterial overgrowth produces a number of toxic compounds peptidoglycans d-lactate and serum amyloid a which promote inflammation may damage the brush border of the enterocytes and increases small intestinal permeability.2295 host response to sibo also depends on its genetic make-up as evidenced by a recent case-control study on 209 patients with ibs and 273 healthy subjects.96 under-producer genotypes of interleukin 1 il-1 receptor antagonist gene anti-inflammatory were associated with ibs.96 moreover ibs patients had higher levels of il-1 a and b than those without sibo.96 another study showed higher level of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-6and tumor necrosis factor a among patients with ibs-d than controls.97 in addition sibo is associated with increased level of serum endotoxins inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and endogenous production of ethanol.239598increased number of enterochromaffin cells was found in the mucosa of colon and rectum among patients with ibs than healthy controls.99 immune activation in response to sibo re- cruits increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes mast cells and enterochromaffin cells.100 moreover mediators of host immune response trigger the enteric nervous system altering gi motility and visceral hypersensitivity which are the major pathophysiological mechanisms of ibs.101overgrowth of sulfate reducing bacteria may play an im- portant role in patients with ibs.102 an association was found between bacterial derived hydrogen sulfide h2s and visceral hypersensitivity.103 h2s is known to act as gaseous neurotrans- mitters inducing the contraction of detrusor muscle in the uri- nary bladder.103 recently a study has shown that h2s produced by sulphate reducing bacteria may play role in pathogenesis of sibo.

ibs subjects receiving rifaximin at a dose of 550 mg three times daily for 14 days reported adequate relief in global ibs symptoms as compared to identical placebo target 1 40.8 vs 31.2 p0.01 and target 2 40.6 vs 32.2 p0.03.115moreover rifaximin was more effective in relieving abdominal bloating than placebo target 1 39.5 vs 28.7 p0.005and target 2 41.0 vs 31.9 p0.02.115 the improvement in symptoms of ibs like abdominal pain loose or watery stool persisted for a duration of 10 weeks after the end of 2-week treatment.115recently target 3 study has been completed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retreatment with rifaximin among 636 patients with ibs-d who had responded to rifaximin previ- ously but developed recurrent ibs symptoms over a duration of 18 weeks follow-up.116117 the end-point of target 3 study was different from the target 1 and target 2 studies according to the guidelines proposed by food and drug administration fda.

the same group of authors showed that tegaserod a serotonin receptor agonist prevents the recurrence of ibs symptoms after antibiotic treatment compared to another prokinetic erythro-mycin a motilin agonist.131dietary manipulation of gut microbiotadietary manipulation may help patients with ibs in general and those with sibo in particular.132133 in patients with sibo bacteria in the small bowel may ferment carbohydrates such as lactose fructose and also the dietary fermentable oligo- di- monosaccharides and polyols fodmaps which forms gas re- sulting in flatulence abdominal bloating and pain.134135 hence restriction of these dietary components may improve these symptoms.136 moreover some preliminary data suggest that manipulation of the diet may alter gut microbiota.136 in a study human fecal microbiota was transplanted into germ free mice that were fed low fat diet and plant polysaccharides.137 subse- quently feeding western diet resulted in change in composition of gut microbiota leading to increased number of firmicutes clostridium species eubacterium enterococcus and decreased number of bacteroides.137 moreover diet rich in complex carbo- hydrates favors growth of less pathogenic bacteria mycobacte- rium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and enterobacteriaceae than diet rich in fat or protein.138 vegetarian diets rich in fiber lead to higher production of short chain fatty acids which in- hibit potentially invasive bacteria like e. coli and other members of enterobacteriaceae.138139 in a recent study we found that vegetarianism was a risk factor for ibs on univariate and multi- variate analysis.140 more studies are needed to evaluate effect of dietary manipulation on gut microbiota including sibo.conclusionsrecent realization that sibo play an important role in patho- genesis of symptoms in a subset of patients with ibs led to a paradigm shift in understanding this disorder hitherto thought to be predominantly psychogenic in nature.
