A recent proof-of-concept study showing the high frequency of symptom improvement in patients with IBS with SIBO further supports this hypothesis.Gut Liver 201711196-208Key Words Bacterial overgrowth Dysbiosis Breath tests Gastrointestinal microbiota Probiotics RifaximinINTRODUCTIONIrritable bowel syndrome IBS is one of the commonest dis- orders encountered in Gastroenterology practice.1 IBS is mani- fested by abdominal pain andor discomfort irregular stoolform and passage.2 Bloating is another common symptom of IBS.23 Patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO in which there is increase in bacteria equal to or greater than 105 colony forming unit per mL of upper gut aspirate2 also ex- perience abdominal pain or discomfort bloating flatulence and loose motion.45 In contrast to the earlier belief SIBO is known to occur in absence of anatomical factors predisposing to it.6 A proportion of patients with IBS are known to have SIBO.7 Re- cent realization that SIBO may be associated with symptoms of IBS led to a paradigm shift in understanding the pathogenesis of this condition hitherto thought to be related largely to psy- chological factors8 to more organic nature.7 Such realization is well known in other conditions as well for example peptic ulcer once thought to be related to psychological stress9 is now known to be related to infection with Helicobacter pylori.1011 Hence it is worthwhile reviewing the existing literature on SIBO and IBS.GUT FLORA AND SIBOHuman gut harbor 1014 bacterial cells which are 10 times higher than the number of cells in the human body.12 Gastro- intestinal GI tract is considered as the most heavily colonized organ and more than 70 of microbes reside in colon.13 The human GI tract is inhabited by a vast number of microbial population including bacteria fungi and viruses.14 Bacteria contribute to the largest population of gut microbiota consist- ing of 500 using culture approaches to 1000 by 16S rRNA gene sequencing different bacterial species.15 The number of bacteria increases from stomach 101 to 103 bacteriag to the colon 1011 to 1012 bacteriag.13 The small intestine comprises mainly of Gram positive and aerobic bacteria and the large in- testine contains predominantly Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria.16 Majority of bacteria residing in the colon are strictlyCorrespondence to Uday C.

These include female gender older age pre- dominant symptom of bloating and flatulence and diarrheal subtype of IBS.471 In fact in a recent study we found that num- ber of bacterial colonies in the small bowel influenced Bristol stool type with higher number being associated with looser stools.39 Similar observation has been reproduced in another re- cent study.72 Since many patients with IBS might be taking PPIs due to overlapping dyspepsia and PPI intake may influence development of SIBO this may be one factor predicting occur- rence of SIBO among patients with IBS.473 Narcotic intake might be another factor causing SIBO among patients with IBS due to slowing of gut motility.74 In one study we found that lower value hemoglobin was associated with SIBO on GHBT.51 Sub- jects with older age are more susceptible to SIBO most likely as a result of reduced GI motility intestinal surgery small bowel diverticulosis and use of medications.75 One previous study re- ported that patients older than 55 years with symptoms of IBS particularly abdominal bloating and flatulence were more likely to be positive by GHBT.4 Abdominal bloating among patients with IBS might be due to excess gas production by bacterial fer- mentation of undigested carbohydrates in addition to SIBO.76MICROBIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF SIBO IN IBSSIBO can be classified into two categories based on difference in bacterial flora 1 Gram positive flora might be due to failure of gastric acid barrier and 2 coliform bacteria might be due to failure of intestinal clearance and small bowel anatomical alterations.5277 Recently one study based on culture of jejunal aspirates showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa Escherichia coli Acenetobacter lwoffii Staphylococcus species Klebsiella pneumoniae Streptococcus species Acinetobacter baumannii Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were dominant bacteria among patients with SIBO.39 Pyleris et al.54 reported that of 42112 patients with IBS having SIBO E. coli Enterococcus species and K. pneumoniae were the predominant species.
