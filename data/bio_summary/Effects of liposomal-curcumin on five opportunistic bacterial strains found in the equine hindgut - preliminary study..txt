Calcula- tion of coefficients for linear orthogonal polynomials with unequal spacing was done using IML of SAS  Significance was set at P  0.05 and tendency was set at P  0.10.ResultsIn vitroThe bacteria concentrations for the in vitro study are summarized in Table Every flask had a pH within the normal equine cecum pH range of 6.5-7.1 Concen- trations of SBEC were significantly lower P  0.0001 at the recommended dose 15 when compared to the 20 25 and 30 dose treatments.

SBEC bacterial concentrations increased linearly P  0.008 as LIPC dose increased Table However as the dose of LIPC increased the concentration of C. perfringens decreased linearly P  0.03.Cecal fluid pH and ammonia concentration were not significant among treatments P  0.82 and P  0.21 respectively Table .
