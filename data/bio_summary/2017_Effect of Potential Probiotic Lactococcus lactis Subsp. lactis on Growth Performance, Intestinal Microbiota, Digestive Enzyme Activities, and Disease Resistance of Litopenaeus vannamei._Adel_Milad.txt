the highest p  0.05 post-challenge survival rate 79.2 was recorded in 108 cfu g-1 of l. lactis supplementation group followed by 107 cfu g-1 of l. lactis 73  and 106 cfu g-1 of l. lactis62  supplementation.discussionthe results of the present study showed that supplementation of l. lactis subsp.

the elevated intestinal microbial balance digestive enzyme activities and thc in l. vannamei fed with 108 cfu g-1 of l. lactis-supplemented diet might be associated with the improved resistance of l. vannamei against v. anguillarum and resulted in higher post-challenge survival rate.

during the experimental period the highest survivability 93.3 - 1.1  was observed in 107 and108 cfu g-1 supplementation groups followed by107 cfu g-1 fed group 88.6 - 2.2 .the result of the shrimp's body composition analysis is presented in table .

however supplementation of l. lactis had no sig- nificant effect on the intestinal micrococcus count table .the supplementation of l. lactis at 107 cfu g-1 as well as 108 cfu g-1 significantly increased the thc in juvenilel.

lactis at 108 cfu g-1 for 8 weeks can modulate the growth perfor- mance digestive enzyme activities and beneficial intestinal microbiota of l. vannamei.

higher growth performances have also been reported in fenneropenaeus indicus  p. vannamei  and l. vannamei  fed diets supplemented with lab probiotics.

at the end of the feeding trial shrimps were immersed in caspian seawater 10.8 ppt contaminated with 106 cfu ml-1 pathogenic v. anguillarum for 2 h. results revealed that growth rate survival and body protein level were increased with dietary supplementation ofl.

the activities of digestive enzymes cellulose lipase amylase and protease were significantly higher in the groups fed with diets containing 107 or 108 cfu g-1 l. lactis than those in the control.

lactis at 108 cfu g-1 can promote growth performance digestive enzyme activity and disease resistance of l. vannamei.keywords lactococcus lactis subsp.
