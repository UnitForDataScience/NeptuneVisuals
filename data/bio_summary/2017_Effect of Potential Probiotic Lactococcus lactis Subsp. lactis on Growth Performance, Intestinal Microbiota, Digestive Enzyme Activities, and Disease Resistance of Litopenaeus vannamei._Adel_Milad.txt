Diets containing four different con- centrations of L. lactis 0 basal diet 106 107 and 108 CFU g-1 were fed to white shrimps L. vannamei average weight 5.89 - 0.36 g for 8 weeks.

The highest P  0.05 post-challenge survival rate 79.2 was recorded in 108 CFU g-1 of L. lactis supplementation group followed by 107 CFU g-1 of L. lactis 73  and 106 CFU g-1 of L. lactis62  supplementation.DiscussionThe results of the present study showed that supplementation of L. lactis subsp.

The elevated intestinal microbial balance digestive enzyme activities and THC in L. vannamei fed with 108 CFU g-1 of L. lactis-supplemented diet might be associated with the improved resistance of L. vannamei against V. anguillarum and resulted in higher post-challenge survival rate.

The produc- tion of white shrimps has increased from 154515 metric ton mt in 2000 representing 13.6  of total production of shrimps and prawns 1137048 mt to 3314447 mt in 2013 representing 74.4  of total shrimp and prawn produc- tion 4454602 mt .

During the acclimation period shrimps were fed with basal diet Table  thrice a day.Potential ProbioticsThe potential probiotics used in the study were previously isolated from the intestine of healthy white shrimps which was prepared as a lyophilized stock.

Each group consists of 180 shrimps 60 shrimps x 3 tanks.

Growth performances and sur- vival rate of shrimps were calculated using the following formulaPercent weight gain PWG  Wf - WiWi x 100 Specific growth rate SGR  100 ln Wf - ln Wit Feed conversion ratio FCR  dry feed intake glive weight gain g.Survival rate   100 final number of shrimpsinitial number of shrimps.Where Wi and Wf are the initial and final weight g andBt is the time of experiment days.Digestive Enzyme ActivityAt the end 10 shrimps from each tank i.e.

At the end of the feeding trial 45 shrimps 15 x 3  45 shrimps from each group were chal- lenged with Vibrio anguillarum.

Moreover lower FCR P  0.05 in the experimental groups suggested that shrimps utilized dietary nutrients more efficiently when sup- plemented with L. lactis.The higher growth performance and lower FCR of white shrimps fed with L. lactis-supplemented diets may be related to the ability of this bacteria to stimulate digestive enzymes which increase feed digestibility and in turn the energetic benefits improved the growth rate.
