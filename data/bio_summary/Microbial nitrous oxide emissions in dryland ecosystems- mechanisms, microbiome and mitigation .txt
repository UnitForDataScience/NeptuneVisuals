This integration is critical to bridging2-knowledge gaps for a more confident simulation of future dryland N2O emission and may accelerate the development of novel mitigation strategies for reducing N2O emission in situ.Key biological pathways of N2O emissions in drylandsThe conventional N2O emission is thought to be largely the result of bacterial pathways however novel molecu- lar techniques like metagenomics and transcriptomics combined with nitrification inhibitors and stable isotope probing techniques have enabled the identification of unexpectedly diverse N2O-relevant metabolic pathways within other microbial domains e.g.

Therefore future plant breeding programmes should con- sider the impacts on associated soil microbiota to ensure sustainable N2O mitigation without losing beneficial micro- biota and other ecosystem functions.The potential of emerging microbiome-based technologies for N2O mitigationDespite the principal role in all the processes of N2O emissions the soil microbiome is still rarely considered in designing practical mitigation approaches to control N2O emissions.

The abundance diversity and structure of AOA and AOB amoA genes together with their specific N2O production rates could be promising attributes to improve the estimation of N2O emitted from the nitrification pathway while dynamics of the key denitrification genes such as nirK nirS and nosZ together with their specific N2O productionconsumption rates could be used to improve the simulation of N2O emitted from the denitrifi- cation pathway.

These pre- dicted changes would have unknown consequences for the future atmospheric N2O concentrations and mitiga- tion strategies if microbial processes and biological pathways mediating dryland N2O emissions are not properly accounted for in experimental and modelling efforts.The past two decades have seen an increasing effort devoted to understanding the microbial N2O pathways from diverse ecosystems at multiple spatial scales Singh et al.

This wetting-pulse pattern of N2O fluxes during brief periods can account for the majority of annual N2O emissions making dryland N2O patterns rather unique compared with other terrestrial ecosys- tems.

Future manipulative research should simultaneously evaluate the relative importance of biotic and abiotic var- iables and their interactions as drivers of N-cycling microorganisms and associated N2O emissions.Effects of emerging global changes on the biological pathways of dryland N2O emissionsClimate changes including climate warming increased aridity and climatic extremesImpacts of climate changes on N cycling and N2O emis- sions are assumed to be particularly relevant within dry- lands Reynolds et al.

For example in laboratory soil microcosms with or without nitrification inhibitors acetylene andor 1-octyne kinetics of nitrification and N2O production were directly linked with activities of AOA and AOB suggesting that AOB dominate N2O production under conditions of high inorganic ammonia inputs while AOA produce N2O resulting from mineral- ized ammonia Hink et al.

Despite of the pivotal influences of microbial communities on the production and consumption of N2O we have limited knowledge of the biological pathways and mechanisms underpinning N2O emissions from drylands which are estimated to account for 30 of total gaseous nitrogen emissions on Earth.

A mecha- nistic understanding of these microbial modulators and their direct linkage to N2O fluxes therefore is a prerequisite for improved estimation of global N2O emissions and develop- ment of innovative mitigation strategies.Drylands including hyper-arid arid semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems are water-limited and drought- prone regions with an aridity index defined as the ratio of the mean annual precipitation to potential evapotrans- piration less than 0.65 Safriel and Adeel 2005.Fig.
