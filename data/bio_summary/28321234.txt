Here we review a collection of tools for the analysis of metagenomic microbiome sequence data with a focus on the prediction of novel genes and proteins.SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES FOR WHOLE GENOME SHOTGUN METAGENOMICSMany microbiomes are incredibly complex - for example  estimated that a single cow rumen contains approximately 1000 OTUs - and therefore any sequencing technology applied to microbiome samples needs to be sufficiently deep and comprehensive to capture representative sequences from all species within a microbiome many of which exist at varying abundances.Second and third generation sequencing technologies collectively called next-generation sequencing NGS have enabled much deeper and more comprehensive studies of microbiomes.
