Development of gene carriers or vectors that can protect the gene of interest against harsh environmental factors in the body pH nucleases efficiently transport the gene across all barriers external and internal to the cell nucleus and do so in a selective and targeted man- ner is the most important challenge of gene therapy.Most applications of gene therapy to date have involved the introduction of a therapeutic genetic payload into mam- malian cells.

Although promising phage- mediated gene therapy faces several outstanding challenges the most notable being lower gene deliv- ery efficiency compared to animal viruses vector stability and nondesirable immune stimulation.Result This review presents a critical review of promises and challenges of employing phage as gene delivery vehicles as well as an introduction to the concept of phage-based microbiome therapy as the new frontier and perhaps the most promising application of phage-based for gene therapy.Keywords Microbiome therapy DNA vaccines Phage therapy Bionanoparticles Lysogeny.INTRODUCTION ADD MORE CITATIONSGene therapy the use of genetic material DNA or RNA for treating or prevention of disease holds great promise for treating genetic disorders 1 cardiovascular disease 2 and cancer 3.

Similar to other viral vectors the phage coat proteins have evolved over millions of years to protect the viral genome from degradation post injection offering protection for the valu- able therapeutic sequence.Material and Methods However what sets phage apart from other viral gene delivery vectors is their safety for human use and the relative ease by which foreign molecules can be expressed on the phageReceived April 04 2017Revised May 02 2017Accepted May 02 2017DOI 10.21741566523217666170510151940outer surface enabling highly targeted gene delivery.

our microbiota gene therapy is the center of attention for a new therapeutic approach that targets dysbiosis in human microbiota namely microbiome therapy 5.The efficacy of gene therapy depends to a large extent on the efficiency of the vehicle used to introduce the desired genetic materials into cells.

However the efficiency of such systems is limited in vivo compared to viral vectors which have been designed by nature to deliver genes into eukary- otic cells and thus large quantities of DNA are required to achieve high efficiencies.Bacteriophage-based gene delivery offers the best of both worlds harmless vectors that offer gene protection and are customizable to enable targeted delivery.

In the following the advantages and challenges of using phage for gene delivery are outlined.EXPLOITABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF PHAGE FOR GENE THERAPYHistory of Safe Human UseThe chief advantage of bacteriophages in the context of gene delivery is their safety for human use.

Reports also exist of gene delivery using T phages T7 and T4 both tailed dsDNA genome 46.The marked advantage of phage compared to other non- viral gene delivery vectors is its inherent ability to effec- tively protect RNA.

Overlaps of key genetic elements directly couple the coding sequence of one gene to the coding or regulatory sequence of another making it difficult to alter one gene without disrupting the other.

The latter property also makes phage a popular choice for gene therapy target discovery through directed evolution.
