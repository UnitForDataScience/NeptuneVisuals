in analogy with repositories for large international projects the human microbiome project hmp  the earth microbiome project emp  qiita  the availability of a curated repository of 16s rrna gene profiling studies of food bacterial communities obtained with a stan- dardized pipeline would be extremely useful in order to consistently compare results of different studies and understand microbial dynamics in food fermentations or spoilage processes.however comparisons of data from different sources in meta-stu-dies may suffer from biases due to the different protocols used in bothwet- and dry-lab.

we investigated the impact of different procedures on results of ordination nmds or classification heat maps enhanced with dendrograms methods using samples from two studies salami2015 which yielded the most dis- similar results when different pipelines were used and nwccurd2014 which yielded the most similar results.

2016 including data from 26 recent studies on food bacterial communities together with r scripts allowing both the extraction of data in formats which can be used in several analysis tools including the r package phyloseq and the cytoscape app conet and the statistical and graphical analysis using common alpha- and beta-diversity analysis methods.introductionan exponentially increasing number of studies investigating the composition of microbiota in diverse and complex environments have been published since 2004 when the first high-throughput sequencing platform was released.

food bacterial communities are significantly less diverse than en- vironmental communities and human or animal microbiomes  but they are still more complex than the most commonly used mock communities which include  25 taxa  b. available wet laboratory methods and bioinformatics pipelines rarely result in a faithful representation of mock communities  c. our main objective was to evaluate if the results ob- tained with these four procedures were comparable rather than eval- uating their accuracy or precision.the otu picking strategy closed reference vs. de novo had the largest impact on the results and this is in agreement with previous findings  in fact procedure a resulted in the lowest alpha diversity and in the lowest number of taxa detected.

although differ- ences in wet-lab procedures across published studies may also distort the results the possibility of using taxa abundance tables of published studies for meta-studies is intriguing.

our results suggest that otu abundance tables of different studies can be compared at the species level only if very similar pipelines are used.comparison at the genus level although insufficient in some cases for a detailed description of food bacterial communities where species belonging to the same genus may have a different ecological and technological relevance  is on the other hand feasible at least with bioinformatic procedures using the same otu picking de novo strategy even if minor differences may still be observed due to differences in the taxonomic assignment methods.

before its recent demise the roche 454 were often the sequencing platforms of choice and most studies have targeted the v1-v3 region of the 16s rrna gene data not shown.metagenome sequencing data in public databases can be easilydownloaded and used in comparative studies but bioinformatics skillsand computational power are both necessary in order to process raw sequencing data.

for two of the panes a and d axis reversal was used to highlight the similarity in ordination.feasible in most cases although this may facilitate comparisons among different studies identification at the species level is likely to be more important for foods compared to other environments for example different species or species groups of the genus lactobacillus play a completely different role in cheese and appear at different times during the succession which occurs during cheese ripening .part of the variability of the results may be due to sample to sample variation within the same group of foods  and this may partly obscure differences between foods belonging to dif- ferent groups.

although for most food groups procedures b and c provided equivalent results differences were evident for some food groups.

surprisingly although differences in taxa com- position due to the use of different procedures were still detectable ordination and classification procedures produced very similar results with all procedures thus showing that at least at this aggregation level data obtained with different procedures can be safely compared and would still allow to detect differences related to food nature spoilage or fermentation.this study confirms that the bioinformatics pipelines used for theanalysis of data from rrna gene profiling have a large impact on both alpha and beta diversity.

among the factors that most affect the results the strategy used for otu picking closed reference vs. de novo the taxonomy assignment method and the level of simi- larity used are of paramount importance  .
