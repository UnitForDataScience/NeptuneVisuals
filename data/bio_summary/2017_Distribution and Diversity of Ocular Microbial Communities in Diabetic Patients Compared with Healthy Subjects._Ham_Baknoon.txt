thus the demand for detailed information regarding the distribution of ocular microorganisms in humans continues to rise and ample effort has been devoted to the isolation and identification of ocular microorganisms in numerous clinical situations.although there is still much debate on the correct defini- tions and composition of the ocular microbial communities data exist that show the characteristic distribution of ocular microbial communities in healthy or diseased human eyes.for example staphylococcus was the most frequently detected isolated microorganism in both normal and dry eyes- whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species were abundantly found in the eyes of patients in intensive care units.in these investigations differences in the distri- bution of ocular microorganisms among numerous human subjects were observed however little is known regarding the consequences of these differences.

samples from different swab locations were predominantly clustered separately whereas samples from different genders showed a more dispersed scattered plotting pattern implying that there is no clear relationship between microbial community com- position and gender.hierarchical cluster analysis of human ocular surface microorganismsfor the analysis of the hierarchical clustering of os bacterial communities we compared the swab samples with one another using the jackknifed weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean wpgmaclustering based on the unifrac distances between samples.a wpgma tree showed that the bacterial communities of all samples were grouped distinctly libraries from samples of diabetic patients formed one cluster excepting only one sample while bacterial communities in the healthy controls were separated into two different clusters .figure 2. three-dimensional principle coordinate analysis pcoa plots based on unweighted left and weighted right data according to the presence or absence of diabetes a sampling location b and sex c.figure 3. weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean wpgma distance tree of the bacterial community structure indicating phylogenetic relationships between healthy control black and diabetic patients red.taxonomic composition of the human ocular surface microbial communityto identify the taxonomic composition of each os micro- bial community 16s rrna gene sequences were classified at the phylum and genus levels.

although acinetobacter has been reported to be one of the core microbiota of the ossight- threatening endophthalmitis caused by this bacteria genus has been reported.-thus whether there is a specific bacterial genus that should be regarded as an ocular pathogen remains inconclusive and further study is warranted.interestingly our study data showed that in the diabetic patients there is a difference in microbial community com- position between swab locations upper vs lower conjunc- tiva.

however as this study was performed in a tertiary referral hospital diabetic patients with various systemic diseases may have been selectively included and this may have contributed to the significant difference in the os microorganisms between the diabetic and non-diabetic patients.although there is still little consensus regarding the composi- tion of normal microbial communities in the os and the major factors responsible for the change in these flora our study clearly showed that there is indeed a significant difference in the ocular flora between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

for instance a recent study using culture-independent methods found that contact lenses alter the microbial structure of the ocular surface resulting in a more skin-like bacterial community composed of methylobacterium lactobacillus acinetobacter and pseudomonas.worldwide more than 415 million people worldwide have diabetes according to the international diabetes federation.

because no study has compared the difference in the distribution of micro- biota in the upper versus lower conjunctiva direct compar- ison of the microbial profile of these sites should be performed in future studies.in our study among the five major phyla proteobacteria were more abundant in the diabetic patients versus controls .

to over- come these shortcomings of traditional culture methods molecular microbial identification techniques such as poly- merase chain reaction pcr-based detection or dna sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens is now starting to be applied in ophthalmology.

the mean number of operational taxonomic units otus was 285 the minimum number of otus was 71 and the maximum number of otus was 746 table s4.analysis of diversity in the human ocular microbial communityusing alpha diversity analysis we constructed rarefaction curves plots of the number of species as a function of the number of sequences per sample to assess the species richness in a single sample .

a similar tendency was observed in the calculated rarefaction curve of phylogenetic diversity pd  which is considered to be a more quan- titative analysis.beta diversity analysis was performed to measure the differences between two or more assemblages and the unifrac distances were visualized using 3d principalfigure 1. rarefaction plots of the microbial communities on the human ocular surface for all samples.

core microbes at the genus level are defined as relative abundances in both diabetic and control groups of  1.discussionthe primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference in the os microbial community between healthy and diseased individuals.

any change in the levels of commensal ocular microorganisms which are generally more abundant may allow pathogenic bacteria to grow leading to devastating ocular infections such as bacterial keratitis or endophthalmitis.

long-term studies providing sufficient data regarding the distribution and antibiotic resistance characteristics of os microorganisms in various situations may help clarify the importance of preoperative antibiotic eye drop use.the limitation of this study is that as the controls and the diabetes were not age-matched it is difficult to exclude the effect of age on ocular microbiome.

the purpose of this study was to evaluate the diversity of the conjunctival bacter- ial flora in diabetic patients and to assess how it differs from that in healthy subjects.materials and methodssample collection and dna extractionthis study was approved by the institutional review board of the catholic university school of medicine irb no.
