Although Acinetobacter has been reported to be one of the core microbiota of the OSsight- threatening endophthalmitis caused by this bacteria genus has been reported.-Thus whether there is a specific bacterial genus that should be regarded as an ocular pathogen remains inconclusive and further study is warranted.Interestingly our study data showed that in the diabetic patients there is a difference in microbial community com- position between swab locations upper vs lower conjunc- tiva.

Samples from different swab locations were predominantly clustered separately whereas samples from different genders showed a more dispersed scattered plotting pattern implying that there is no clear relationship between microbial community com- position and gender.Hierarchical cluster analysis of human ocular surface microorganismsFor the analysis of the hierarchical clustering of OS bacterial communities we compared the swab samples with one another using the jackknifed weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean WPGMAclustering based on the UniFrac distances between samples.A WPGMA tree showed that the bacterial communities of all samples were grouped distinctly libraries from samples of diabetic patients formed one cluster excepting only one sample while bacterial communities in the healthy controls were separated into two different clusters .Figure 2.

However as this study was performed in a tertiary referral hospital diabetic patients with various systemic diseases may have been selectively included and this may have contributed to the significant difference in the OS microorganisms between the diabetic and non-diabetic patients.Although there is still little consensus regarding the composi- tion of normal microbial communities in the OS and the major factors responsible for the change in these flora our study clearly showed that there is indeed a significant difference in the ocular flora between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Because no study has compared the difference in the distribution of micro- biota in the upper versus lower conjunctiva direct compar- ison of the microbial profile of these sites should be performed in future studies.In our study among the five major phyla Proteobacteria were more abundant in the diabetic patients versus controls .

For instance a recent study using culture-independent methods found that contact lenses alter the microbial structure of the ocular surface resulting in a more skin-like bacterial community composed of Methylobacterium Lactobacillus Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas.Worldwide more than 415 million people worldwide have diabetes according to the International Diabetes Federation.

Thus the demand for detailed information regarding the distribution of ocular microorganisms in humans continues to rise and ample effort has been devoted to the isolation and identification of ocular microorganisms in numerous clinical situations.Although there is still much debate on the correct defini- tions and composition of the ocular microbial communities data exist that show the characteristic distribution of ocular microbial communities in healthy or diseased human eyes.For example Staphylococcus was the most frequently detected isolated microorganism in both normal and dry eyes- whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species were abundantly found in the eyes of patients in intensive care units.In these investigations differences in the distri- bution of ocular microorganisms among numerous human subjects were observed however little is known regarding the consequences of these differences.

To over- come these shortcomings of traditional culture methods molecular microbial identification techniques such as poly- merase chain reaction PCR-based detection or DNA sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens is now starting to be applied in ophthalmology.

Core microbes at the genus level are defined as relative abundances in both diabetic and control groups of  1.DiscussionThe primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference in the OS microbial community between healthy and diseased individuals.
