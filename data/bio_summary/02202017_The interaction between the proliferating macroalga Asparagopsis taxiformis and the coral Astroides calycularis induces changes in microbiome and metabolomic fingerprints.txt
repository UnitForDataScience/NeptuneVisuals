reference macroalgae without interaction with corals exhibited a higher mean bioactivity of 3.7 - 0.9 mean-se than those interacting with corals 2.4 - 0.4 but this difference was not supported by statistics mann-whitney test p 0.635.discussionthe overall decline of coral reefs in tropical seas facing global change and their replacement by macroalgae in many reefs have been a source of motivation to study biotic interactions between corals and macroalgae see refs and for a general review on coral-macroalgal competition.

temporal variation in polyp activity seems to be mostly associated to the day of feeding end of day 5 and 10 3. at day 4 corals in contactless interaction with mimic macroalgae and contact interaction with macroalgae differed from the control with few active polyps kruskal-wallis k  23.2 p 0.001 sdcf post hoc test.

at this date corals in contactless interaction with macroalgae showed the highest activity while coral in contact interaction with macroalgae showed the lowest one with intermediate values for coral controls.associated microbial communities.

the main features of the group 3 metab- olomic phenotypes consisted of two major metabolites that likely belong to the same chemical class according to their mass spectra their isotopic and fragmentation patterns class 7.after 10 days of treatment the control macroalgae did not show any change in their metabolomic fingerprints 6b nor in their bioactivities kruskal-wallis p 0.05 8. all control samples mainly belong to group 1 in the pca.macroalgae placed in contactless interaction exhibited a change in their fingerprints at days 5 and 10 from group 1 to 2  without any change of bioactivity gamma  0.4 - 0.1 and 1.2 - 0.6 at day 5 and 10 respec- tively sdcf post-hoc test p 0.91 and 0.94 respectively 8.macroalgae in contact interaction with corals 6d exhibited at day 5 a change in their fingerprints equiv-alent to macroalgae in contactless interaction with corals and in the same way without any change of bioactivity gamma  0.7 - 0.1 sdcf post-hoc test p  0.99 8. on the other hand macroalgal metabolomic finger- prints were deeply modified at day 10 to group 3 on pca and a significant increase of bioactivity was observed gamma  2.3 - 0.5 sdcf post-hoc test p 0.005 8.effect of the lipophilic extraction of the macroalgal surfaces.

physical effects have been confirmed with the use of mimic plastic macroalgae that exhibited the same adverse effects as natural macroalgae.
