in australia approximately 25 of pregnant women are gbs-colonized.it is routine practice for gbs-colonized women who have a vaginal de- livery to receive intrapartum antibiotics to minimize trans- mission of gbs to their infant.antibiotics given in the perinatal and neonatal periods may permanently alter infant microbiota in particular decreasing the abundance of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species animal models suggest these species may protect against later obesity.- maternal gbs colonization may therefore influence infant microbial colonization either through exposure to a specific maternal vagino-enteric microbiome or alternatively through the effect of intrapartum antibiotics on maternal-in- fant microbial transfer.measurement of aortic intima-media thickness aimthas become established as an early marker of cardiovascu- lar risk.in the early stages of atherosclerosis there is dif- fuse thickening of the intima-media layers of the vessel wall and formation of 'fatty streaks'that may be evident in the infant aorta from early infancy.aortic imt is an ultrasonic measurement of this diffuse thickening and a widely used putative marker of early cardiovascular risk.in previous small exposure-specific studies ma- ternal and infant variables such as maternal obesity smoking and infant intrauterine growth restriction are associated with increased aimt.-furthermore there is evidence that carotid imt is increased in early childhood following acute infection and by other inflammatory conditions of childhood such as inflammatory bowel dis- ease and kawasaki disease.although the association be- tween aimt in infancy and cardiovascular disease in adulthood has yet to be established increased aimt is apromising marker that may reflect sub-acute inflammation associated with early atherosclerotic change.to date no study has investigated the association between perinatal exposures and aimt in early life.the aim of this study was to characterize the associ- ation between environmental exposures affecting infant microbial colonization particularly maternal gbs colon- ization intrapartum antibiotics pet and livestock exposure and mode of delivery with infant aimt.methodsthe barwon infant study bis is a population-derived pre- birth cohort n 14 1074 of mother-infant pairs in south- eastern australia.women were recruited at their first antenatal hospital visit and were subsequently excluded if their infants were delivered before 32 weeks developed a serious illness in the first week of life or had major con- genital abnormalities.

australian guidelines rec- ommend all women undergoing caesarean section receive prophylactic antibiotics before first incision and that gbs-colonized women having a vaginal delivery should also receive antibiotics before delivery.

the most significant effect is within days of administration but it may be months be- fore the microbiome returns to its pre-treatment state.- in keeping with this women in our cohort whoreceived antibiotics during their second and third trimes- ter had a lower incidence of gbs colonization than those receiving antibiotics in the first trimester.

however the magnitude of association between maternal gbs and aimt was essentially unchanged fol- lowing adjustment for intrapartum antibiotics whereas the association between intrapartum antibiotics and aimt was no longer evident following adjustment for maternal gbs status.

of these 574 69 women de- livered vaginally of those 129 22 were gbs-colonized and of these women 111 86 received prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics.

published by oxford university press on behalf of the international epidemiological association 209conclusion maternal gbs colonization and intrapartum antibiotics were associated with increased infant aimt in those delivered vaginally whereas antenatal pet exposure was associated with decreased aimt.

all women who delivered by caesarean section received intra- partum antibiotics predominantly as surgical prophylaxis.

similarly intrapartum antibiotics were associated with increased aimt whereas both pet ownership and livestock exposure were associated with reduced aimt.
