That cryo-EM's pioneers were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry is therefore both timely and exciting says Sriram Subramaniam PhD of the NCI.The three winners--Jacques Dubo- chet PhD Joachim Frank PhD andRichard Henderson PhD--laid the foundation back in the 1980s for what's become modern cryo-EM he says.

Digging into possible reasons they showed that long-term survivors displayed lasting circulating T-cell reactivity to high-quality neoan- tigens as defined by the fitness model.Because this approach workedfor three different tumor types two flavors of checkpoint inhibitor and two different clinical settings--with or without immunotherapy--ourdata may be identifying some com- mon principles on how the immune system recognizes mutations says Balachandran.Elizabeth Jaffee MD of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University in Bal- timore MD isn't yet convinced.

Using a chemical mutagen and a colitis-inducing compound to trigger6  CANCER DISCOVERY January 2018 nEws In BRIEFcolorectal cancer the researchers found that mice with wild microbiomes devel- oped fewer and smaller tumors than those with lab-derived microbiomes.The wild microbiomes also appeared to be protective against influenza--an intranasal injection of the virus killed 83 of the lab microbe-bearing ani- mals but only 8 of those with wild bacteria on board.Although the study did not inves- tigate the exact immunologic mecha- nism behind these differences that this extremely diverse microbiota had pro- tective effects against tumorigenesis was actually extremely interesting and calls for further in-depth analysis says Mathias Heikenwalder PhD of the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg who was not involved in the study.The findings do not imply that all researchers should add wild micro- biomes to their mouse models says Stephan Rosshart MD first author of the study.

Initially the team foundthat tumors with the highest neoan- tigen number and the most abundant cytotoxic T-cell infiltrates--but neither alone--stratified patients with the longest survival.

The therapeutic potential of blocking p97 a regulator of protein homeostasis--on which cancer cells can become overly dependent--isbeing investigated.

We recognized the need for an extramu- ral resource so researchers across the country--with or without NCI fund- ing--could easily use cryo-EM for their work without cost being a barrier.

-Jordan Calmes-Miller nneoantigen Quality Predicts Immune Response survivalIt's the quality not quantity of tumor neoantigens that may best pre- dict response to immunotherapy and the likelihood of long-term survival among patients with cancer.A team led by Marta Luksza PhD of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton NJ and Benjamin Green- baum PhD of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York NY combined concepts from immunology evolutionary biology physics and computer science to study how the immune system recognizes tumors and how tumors mutate and evolve in response especially in the face of checkpoint inhibition.The researchers developed a math- ematical model and tested it on three data sets--two cohorts of patients with melanoma given anti-CTLA4 therapy and a group with non-small celllung cancer given anti-PD-1 therapy Nature 2017551517-20.

When they compared their model against one that simply tallied up the number of mutated peptides present on the surface of tumor cells they showed that the fitness-based analysis by capturing both neoantigen and tumor heterogeneity better predicted survival outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy.Our approach has consistent predic- tive value across the patient cohorts we studied but we think its strength comes from its universality Luksza says.
