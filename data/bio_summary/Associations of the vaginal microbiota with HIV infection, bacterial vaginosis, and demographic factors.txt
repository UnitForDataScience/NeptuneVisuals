A 2008 meta-analysis showed that bacterial vaginosis was associated with a 1.6 times increased risk of HIV acquisition A study of 174 Rwandan sex workers showed a strong association between the structure of the vaginal microbiome and HIV status In a study of at-risk women in Kenya bacterial vaginosis and herpes simplex virus 2 infection were the two strongest risk factors associated with HIV acquisition over a 20-year period Bacterial vaginosis is known to be more common in African-American women motivating studies of associations with HIV infection In contrast a study of the vaginal microbiome in 64 women in Chicago showed no differences associated with HIV infection Another study comparing vaginal micro- biota in women from Rwanda and the United States together with HIV status found modest differences forboth geographic site and infection status Thus reported associations between HIV status and structure of the vaginal microbiota have varied with cohort and geographical location.Here we study the vaginal microbiome in women sampled at two hospitals in Chicago - Stroger Hospital of Cook County and Northwestern Memorial Hospital NMH that serve quite different socioeconomic groups one relatively affluent NMH and the other less advantaged Stroger Hospital of Cook County 1a.

Self-identified African-Amer- ican women were diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis more frequently Fisher's exact test P 0.00112 odds ratio OR 3.48 consistent with previous literature African-American women were also more likely to be HIVth Fisher's exact test P 14 0.00014 OR 14 3.77.We then asked whether there was a positive association between bacterial vaginosis and HIVth.

Although bacterial vaginosis has previously been associated with HIV transmission most of the women studied here became HIVth many years before our test for bacterial vaginosis thus implicating additional mechanisms linking HIV infection and bacterial vaginosis.Copyright c 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health Inc.

Analysis of the vaginal microbiome showed notable associations between high diversity states high pH and bacterial vaginosis as inferred from Nugent scores paralleling previous studies Previous studies have differed on associations between HIV status and bacterial vaginosis here we found that HIV status was correlated with bacterial vaginosis status.Our most unexpected finding came from the longitudinal analysis in which switching of bacterial vaginosis status turned out to be associated with self-identified African- American race though this was not detectably linked to HIV status.

The median income of patients at Stroger Hospital of Cook County hospital was inferred to be between 1 and 25 000 whereas that of those from NMH was between 75 000 and 100 000.The HIV status of the women in these two cohorts is shown in 1a-c. A total of 71 of 128 55 women included in this study from Stroger Hospital of Cook County were HIVth whereas 19 of 50 38 of the NMH women were HIVth.Several clinical measures differed between the two hospital cohorts  1.

Rates of bacterial vaginosis were higher among African-American women and HIVth women.

Unexpectedly African-American women were more likely to switch bacterial vaginosis status between sampling times switching was not associated with HIVth status.Conclusion The influence of HIV infection on the vaginal microbiome was modest for this cohort of well suppressed urban American women consistent with effective antiretroviral therapy.

In both cohorts Shannon diversity was higher for the HIV women but the range was quite wide so the P value only trended toward significance P 14 0.186.Associations of bacterial vaginosis HIV and race These data showed an association between bacterial vaginosis HIV and race.

Eighty-two women provided at least two samples with a known bacterial vaginosis status for several samples excluding instances when the examining physician categorized the bacterial vaginosis state as 'indeterminate'.
