pathogenesis and immunityepigenetic metabolite acetate inhibits class iii histone deacetylases promotes histone acetylation and increases hiv-1 integration in cd4 t cellsjean-francois bolduca laurent hanya corinne barata michel ouelleta abaxe des maladies infectieuses et immunitaires centre de recherche du centre hospitalier universitaire de quebec-universite laval pavillon chul quebec qc canadaa departement de microbiologie-infectiologie et immunologie faculte de medecine universite laval quebec qc canadababstract in this study we investigated the effect of acetate the most concen- trated short-chain fatty acid scfa in the gut and bloodstream on the susceptibility of primary human cd4 t cells to hiv-1 infection.

in line with previous studies showing reactivation of latent hiv-1 by scfas we provide evidence that acetate can also increase the susceptibil- ity of primary human cd4 t cells to productive hiv-1 infection.importance alterations in the fecal microbiota and intestinal epithelial damage in- volved in the gastrointestinal disorder associated with hiv-1 infection result in mi- crobial translocation that leads to disease progression and virus-related comorbidi- ties.

interestingly it has been reported that butyrate-producing bacteria residing in the mouth vaginal and gut mucous membranes are implicated in aids progression by inducing reactivation of hiv-1 proviral dna in latently infected cell lines and mononuclear cells via inhibition of hdac activity        .given the inherent ability of scfas to affect diverse biological cell functions and as hiv-1 infection leads to profound and early alterations of the permeability of the gut epithelium we assessed the overall impact of acetate on the susceptibility of primary human cd4 t cells to productive hiv-1 infection.

as cell surface expression of ccr5 is correlated with the susceptibility of target cells to r5-tropic hiv-1 infection  our observations indicating that the process of virus entry is reduced by acetate are not unexpected .the mechanism by which acetate mediates a positive effect on hiv-1 replication in activated cd4 t cells despite its capacity to decrease virus entry appears to be a paradox.

as an enhanced activation state suggests greater susceptibility of cd4 t cells to hiv-1 infection acetate treatment could possibly promote hiv-1 infection via this mechanism.furthermore it is now well established that cellular activation leads to a variety of responses in cd4 t cells such as their proliferation .

therefore it can be postulated that bacterial me- tabolites such as acetate modulate hiv-1-mediated disease progression.keywords cd4 t cells hiv-1 histone acetylation histone deacetylases integration provirushort-chain fatty acids scfas have been reported to play key roles in the devel- opment of many conditions and diseases including hiv-1 infection .

here to characterize the potential modulatory effect of acetate on hiv-1 replication quiescent primary human cd4 t cells were purified by magnetic separation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs from different healthy donors and were subjected to anti-cd3cd28 costimulation in the absence or presence of acetate.

together these results suggest that acetate promotes productive hiv-1 infection in cd3cd28- costimulated primary human cd4 t cells.cell proliferation and activation profiles are affected differently by acetate treatment.

the results depicted in demonstrate that hiv-1 entry was slightly lower in acetate-treated target cells.fig 1 hiv-1 replication in cd3cd28-costimulated cd4 t cells is augmented by acetate.

in contrast to previous studies which focused on the effect of butyrate on reactivation of hiv-1 in latently infected cells  the present results underscore the impact of acetate exposure on the permissiveness of primary human cd4 t cells to productive hiv-1 infection.

following multiple lines of studies demonstrating that hdac inhibitors can drive hiv-1 gene expression in various experimental model systems of hiv-1 latency we assessed the capacity of acetate to abrogate hdac activity in cd3cd28-costimulated primary human cd4 t cells.

enhanced proliferation of virus-infected cd4 t cells therefore cannot explain the effect of acetate on the greater permissiveness of cd3cd28-costimulated cd4 t cells to hiv-1 infection.hiv-1 interacts with different constituents at the surfaces of its host cells.

the results from our studies reveal that acetate causes acetylation of both histones h3 k9 and h4 k581216 in primary human cd4 t cells .acetate enhances integration of hiv-1 dna in cd3cd28-costimulated cd4 t cells.

the results from hiv-1 integration assays which combine an alu-hiv-1 pcr and a quantitative real-time pcr test  showed that acetate can potently increase inte- gration of hiv-1 dna into the host's genome .
