In line with previous studies showing reactivation of latent HIV-1 by SCFAs we provide evidence that acetate can also increase the susceptibil- ity of primary human CD4 T cells to productive HIV-1 infection.IMPORTANCE Alterations in the fecal microbiota and intestinal epithelial damage in- volved in the gastrointestinal disorder associated with HIV-1 infection result in mi- crobial translocation that leads to disease progression and virus-related comorbidi- ties.

Interestingly it has been reported that butyrate-producing bacteria residing in the mouth vaginal and gut mucous membranes are implicated in AIDS progression by inducing reactivation of HIV-1 proviral DNA in latently infected cell lines and mononuclear cells via inhibition of HDAC activity        .Given the inherent ability of SCFAs to affect diverse biological cell functions and as HIV-1 infection leads to profound and early alterations of the permeability of the gut epithelium we assessed the overall impact of acetate on the susceptibility of primary human CD4 T cells to productive HIV-1 infection.

As cell surface expression of CCR5 is correlated with the susceptibility of target cells to R5-tropic HIV-1 infection  our observations indicating that the process of virus entry is reduced by acetate are not unexpected .The mechanism by which acetate mediates a positive effect on HIV-1 replication in activated CD4 T cells despite its capacity to decrease virus entry appears to be a paradox.

PATHOGENESIS AND IMMUNITYEpigenetic Metabolite Acetate Inhibits Class III Histone Deacetylases Promotes Histone Acetylation and Increases HIV-1 Integration in CD4 T CellsJean-Francois Bolduca Laurent Hanya Corinne Barata Michel Ouelleta abAxe des Maladies Infectieuses et Immunitaires Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec-Universite Laval Pavillon CHUL Quebec QC Canadaa Departement de Microbiologie-Infectiologie et Immunologie Faculte de Medecine Universite Laval Quebec QC CanadabABSTRACT In this study we investigated the effect of acetate the most concen- trated short-chain fatty acid SCFA in the gut and bloodstream on the susceptibility of primary human CD4 T cells to HIV-1 infection.

As an enhanced activation state suggests greater susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV-1 infection acetate treatment could possibly promote HIV-1 infection via this mechanism.Furthermore it is now well established that cellular activation leads to a variety of responses in CD4 T cells such as their proliferation .

Therefore it can be postulated that bacterial me- tabolites such as acetate modulate HIV-1-mediated disease progression.KEYWORDS CD4 T cells HIV-1 histone acetylation histone deacetylases integration provirushort-chain fatty acids SCFAs have been reported to play key roles in the devel- opment of many conditions and diseases including HIV-1 infection .

In contrast to previous studies which focused on the effect of butyrate on reactivation of HIV-1 in latently infected cells  the present results underscore the impact of acetate exposure on the permissiveness of primary human CD4 T cells to productive HIV-1 infection.

Following multiple lines of studies demonstrating that HDAC inhibitors can drive HIV-1 gene expression in various experimental model systems of HIV-1 latency we assessed the capacity of acetate to abrogate HDAC activity in CD3CD28-costimulated primary human CD4 T cells.

The results depicted in demonstrate that HIV-1 entry was slightly lower in acetate-treated target cells.FIG 1 HIV-1 replication in CD3CD28-costimulated CD4 T cells is augmented by acetate.

Here to characterize the potential modulatory effect of acetate on HIV-1 replication quiescent primary human CD4 T cells were purified by magnetic separation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs from different healthy donors and were subjected to anti-CD3CD28 costimulation in the absence or presence of acetate.
