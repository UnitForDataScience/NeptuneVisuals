No significant differences were ob- served between the parameter values estimated for these partial datasets implying that both subpopulations show similar excess risks at close proximity from poultry farms see Additional file Oropharyngeal microbiota analysisThe oropharyngeal microbiota composition of 100 adult hospitalized CAP patients living 1 km and 26 patients living 1 km to one or more poultry farms was studied to explore the hypothesis that the association between CAP and living near poultry farms is mediated through a direct effect on microbial community composition in- cluding pathogen colonization within the respiratory tract Fig.

The method is de- scribed previously and more details are pro- vided in Additional file Oropharyngeal microbiota compositionThe microbiota composition of 126 patients hospitalized with CAP in the same region was analyzed in relation to residential distance to poultry farms Fig.

Fur- thermore the oropharyngeal microbiota composition in CAP patients is analyzed in relation to residential proximity to poultry farms.MethodsStudy designThe study was carried out in the province of Noord- Brabant The Netherlands a region with a high density of intensive livestock farms.

1 Geographic distribution of 126 adult CAP patients and poultry farms around Tilburg The Netherlandsfor C. burnetii were excluded from microbiota com- position analysis.

Theadvantage of the kernel analysis compared to earlier ana- lyses is that instead of regressing CAP occurrence to distance-to-the-nearest-farm it models the distance- dependent per-farm contribution to the risk of CAP.

Although there is some evidence that trans- mission of farm-related bacteria may take place throughair--for example in pig and veal calf farmers and their family members nasal colonization by livestock- associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus LA-MRSA occurs frequently --we did not find evi- dence of zoonotic infections explaining the increased risk of CAP around poultry farms Around 40 of the CAP patients also had COPD.

The excess CAP risk is approximately equal to 0.001 per person year per poultry farm within 1.15 km which compares to a total background risk of 0.009 per person year 0.0010.009  11 increase in risk.

The abundance of S. pneumoniae in relation to living in the vicinity of poultrylivestock farms needs to be reassessed in future studies.Kernel analysis confirmed the excess risk of CAP in the vicinity of poultry farms as identified earlier using regression analysis In addition it indicated that the excess risk has a sharp bound at around 1.15 km.
