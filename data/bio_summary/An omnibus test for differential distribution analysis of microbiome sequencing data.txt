To address the variable li- brary sizes traditional methods involve either normalizing the count data into proportion data divided by the total sum or rarefying the data into equal library sizes.

recently showed the inadmissibility of methods based on rarefied or propor- tion data and suggested directly applying the negative-binomial NB based methods such as DESeq  and edgeR  for RNA-seq data to the taxa count data.

Compared to RNA-seq data the microbiome data contain a large number of zeros typically  50.

The first set of simulation data consisted of count data from a single taxon at various levels of prevalence abundance and dispersion and a wide range of change models were investigated.

We note that LEfSe which also used Wilcoxon test did not perform multiple testing correction while MaAsLin worked with proportion data which could be sensi- tive to compositional effects especially in datasets such as the IBD dataset with large numbers of differential taxa.DiscussionDifferential abundance analysis of microbiome data is instrumental in identifying potential microbiome biomarkers for further biolo- gical validation.

To account for differential library sizes in nonparametric methods normalizing the count data into proportions or rarefying the data to the same library size has been suggested.

Another possible approach for addressing outliers is through data reweighting assign a weight to each data point based on its 'outly- ingness' .
