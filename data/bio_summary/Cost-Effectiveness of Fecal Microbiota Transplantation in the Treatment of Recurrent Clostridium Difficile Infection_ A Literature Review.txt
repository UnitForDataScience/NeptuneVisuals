Better and more cost effective management is of paramount concern for the healthcare industry as a whole in depth studies of both outcomes and cost effectiveness of new treatment options for establishing diagnoses like the case of FMT for recurrent CDI must be performed in order to more effectively manage patients and reduce the healthcare burden.In our analysis of different studies of the cost effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent CDI FMT has been associated with both better outcomes and as a more cost effective treatment.While examining outcomes for recurrent CDI treatment using vancomycin and FMT 24-25 two studies have shown that both FMT by colonoscopy and FMT by duodenal infusion have resulted in significantly higher cure rates for patients with recurrent infection.

Implementation of a more economical treatment strategy which delivers better health outcomes for affectedpatients would be optimal as it would simultaneously address the mounting burden of the disease and the staggering medical costs associated with CDIs.Currently there are a number of different treatment options available and their use varies by level of CDI severity 8.

We applied the followingThe following criteria were used to further narrow down papers publishedPublished between January 2010 to January 2017Studies with human participantspatientsPapers that assessed the cost effectiveness of FMT for CDI compared to preferred options for CDI oral vancomycin metronidazole fidaxomicinWritten in EnglishSearch topic pertains to cost effectiveness and fecal microbiota transplantation or fecal microbiota transplant or FMT or fecal transplant.In order to properly assess the cost-effectiveness of the FMT treatment modality the studies included in our review investigated both the benefits and the costs of FMT in the treatment of rCDI.

Furthermore to provide context for meaningful interpretation incorporated analyses compared the same factors for FMT as for competing for treatment strategies which consisted predominantly of regimens containing oral metronidazole andor oral vancomycin that represent the current standards of treatment for rCDI.

Studies comparing different treatment options which are not necessarily mutually exclusive often express results in costQALY 27-29.In accordance with this convention a comparison of the costs QALY and costQALY ratios for FMTs vs currently preferred treatment strategies was performed using the results from each of the studies incorporated in our review.

Accordingly their conclusions endorse FMT as the dominant treatment strategy for the treatment of CDI 32.Incremental cost effectiveness ratio ICER is another index of cost-effectiveness that is commonly calculated in economic evaluations of health care decisions.

Three separate studies involving the cost effectiveness of FMT demonstrated its advantages over traditional vancomycin treatment 31-32 34.The first study represented in Table 3 analyzed costs quality adjusted life years QALY and costQALY all of which favored FMT vs. traditional vancomycin treatment costQALY6896.69 vs. 16119.15 31.

This study concluded that FMT is associated with lower costs and the authors endorsed FMT as the dominant treatment strategy for treating recurrent CDI.Lastly we examined a study that used an incremental cost effectiveness ratio ICER to evaluate the cost effectiveness of multiple different treatment modalities for rCDI.

This underscores the need for more multisite adequately powered high-quality studies comparing the costs and benefits of viable treatment modalities for recurrent C. difficile 39.ConclusionsAt present FMT is not a first line option in the treatment of adults with CDI.

With this review given the apparent readiness of patients to accept this as a treatment there is evidently favorable cost effectiveness profile against a backdrop of rising healthcare costs and the increasing incidence and morbidity associated with this disease it would be rational to expect a more widespread adoption of FMT in the treatment of rCDI than that which is currently observed.
