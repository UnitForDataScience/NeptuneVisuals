The potential of using the microbiome as diagnostic biomarkers has been recognized before as several recent studies report on an altered salivar microbial composition in cancer patients when compared to healthy counterparts.Previously Guerrero-Preston et al.

Thus they suggested that oral lesions may be associated with shifts in the oral microbiome that contribute to cancer development .

However in contrast to our investigation both groups profiled the microbiome of cancer tissue and anatomically matched contralateral normal tissue but did not perform a case-control study that included healthy subjects.Nagy et al.
