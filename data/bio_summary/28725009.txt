the potential of using the microbiome as diagnostic biomarkers has been recognized before as several recent studies report on an altered salivar microbial composition in cancer patients when compared to healthy counterparts.previously guerrero-preston et al.

however in contrast to our investigation both groups profiled the microbiome of cancer tissue and anatomically matched contralateral normal tissue but did not perform a case-control study that included healthy subjects.nagy et al.

further longitudinal analyses revealed a reduction in the alpha-diversity measure following surgery which then increased in patients with recurrent disease.wang et al.

it was suggested that potential unknown mecha- nisms relevant to carcinogenesis were associated with the altered oral microbiome.mager et al.
