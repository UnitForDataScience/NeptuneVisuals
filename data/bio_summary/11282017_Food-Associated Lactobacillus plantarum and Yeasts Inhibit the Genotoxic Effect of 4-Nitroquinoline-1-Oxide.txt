A similar behavior was observed for yeasts only three strains LG2 TO10 and RIB3 that had lower effect against genotoxin as shown in .Moreover the results obtained with reference probiotic strains L. plantarum IMC 510QR  L. plantarum IMC 513QR and S. boulardii CodexQR  were similar to those obtained with the majority of food- borne lactobacilli and yeasts.Genotoxin ModificationEvident modifications of spectroscopic properties of 4-NQO were observed in the co-incubation supernatants after the exposureof the genotoxin to live cells of L. plantarum and yeasts with antigenotoxic activity .

L. plantarum WCSF1 and ATCCQR 14917TM and two strains with documented probiotic activities L. plantarum IMC 510QR and IMC 513QR Synbiotec Camerino Italy were used as reference strains for lactobacilli and a probiotic S. boulardii CodexQR  Zambon-Italia as a reference strains for yeasts.All the food-borne microorganisms were isolated from different foods including various samples with different features brands food origin time of ripening etc..

Cresci Synbiotec Camerino Italy for giving us L. plantarum probiotic strains.REFERENCESAhrne S. Nobaek S. Jeppsson B. Adlerberth I. Wold A. E. and Molin G. 1998.

The results obtained showed a significant correlation p  0.01 between acid tolerance and combined acid bile tolerance in both L. plantarum  and yeast  strains.Antigenotoxic PropertiesThe genotoxic effect of 4-NQO in the SOS-Chromotest was strongly reduced under in vitro co-incubation with L. plantarum and yeasts.

fermented milks and yogurt may constitute a good reservoir of microorganisms for the production of functional foods with probiotic activity but nowadays the necessity for novel and non-dairy probiotics products is increasing as reported for table olives    .In this work the ability of 36 microorganisms 22 lactobacilli belonging to the L. plantarum species and 14 yeasts from different species mainly isolated from table olives cheeses sourdoughs and fruits were studied for their antigenotoxic effects.

Despite the importance of this species in fermented foods as a starter culture recently the potential use of L. plantarum as a probiotic is also increasingly gaining attention.

We confirmed that all the strains possessed high inhibitory activity against 4-NQO as previously reported for LAB species isolated from milk-based fermented foods yogurt and fermented milk    .In particular L. plantarum is considered a flexible and versatile species and has been found as dominant in several environmental niches and it is frequently encountered as a natural inhabitant of the human GIT  .
