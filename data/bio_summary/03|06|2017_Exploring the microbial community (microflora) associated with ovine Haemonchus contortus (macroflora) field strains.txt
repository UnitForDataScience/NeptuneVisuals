however the highly dominant ruminal otus belonged to bacteroidetes 79.82 firmicutes 14.33 proteobacteria 1.43 and spirochaetae 1.3 for control uninfected group bacteroidetes 61.26 firmicutes 31.25 proteobacteria 2.23 lentisphaerae1.36 and spirochaetae 1.28 for 7-dpi group bacteroidetes 76.16 firmicutes 5.99 proteobacteria 15.75and spirochaetae 1.44 for 50- dpi group.similarly for all stages the parasite microbiome is highly dominated by microbes of the following bacterial phyla proteobacteria and firmicutes for egg-stage microbiome proteobacteria for adult-stage microbiome and proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes for larval-stage microbiome using v3-v4 tags.

moreover h. contortus egg-stage microbiome compared to h. contortus larval-stage microbiome and the later compared to h. contortus adult-stage microbiome displayed significant differences employing genus evenness simpson and shannon-wiener species diversity indices at the genus-level.

dna sequencing of 16s rrna genes or gene fragments has played a key role in large ongoing microbial community studies such as the national institutes of health nih funded human microbiome project human and animal microbiome studies during parasitic infectionto index1state key laboratory for agrobiotechnology  college of veterinary medicine china agricultural university beijing 100193 china.

similarly there was a consequential difference between h. contortus egg-stage microbiome in com- parison with h. contortus adult-stage microbiome at the genus-level targeting v3-v4 and v5-v7 regarding simpson and shannon-wiener species diversity indices however genus evenness did not show any significant differences table .beta diversity.

additionally kruskal-wallis test of all microbial taxa are presented in tables and .four phyla for egg-stage microbiome proteobacteria 97.39 firmicutes 1.64 actinobacteria 0.323 and bacteroidetes 0.31 and four phyla for adult stage microbiome proteobacteria 99.02 firmicutes 0.37 tenericutes 0.131 and actinobacteria0.

from each sheep of eggslarvaeadults male and female come from three different sheep natural infection.99.02 for adult-stage microbiome and proteobacteria 59.24 firmicutes 20.29 and bacteroidetes 5.4 for larval-stage microbiome.

the predominant phyla observed in the three stages of h. contortus life-cycle were proteobacteria for egg- and adult- stage microbiome with relative abundances 99.66 and 99.49 respectively proteobacteria 96.29 and bacteroidetes 1.53 for larval-stage microbiome.

the dominant genera of larval-stage microbiome are achromobacter 26.67 lentibacillus 8.45 pseudomonas 4.69 ochrobactrum 4.212 kroppenstedtia4.105 dokdonella 2.97 bacillus 2.52 delftia 2.04 oceanobacillus 1.51 azotobacter 1.17 pseudaminobacter 1.17 and candidatusaccumulibacter 1.09. additionally the three most-abundant genera identified in the adult-stage microbiome are escherichia-shigella 87.5 pseudomonas 5.91 and ochrobactrum 5.06. the representative members of genera pseudomonas and ochrobactrum were prevalently shared in all the stages of the parasite life-cycle.

as can be seen from the heat map analysis below the larval-stage microbiome using v3-v4 region did not cluster together indicating that the bacterial diversity of the larval-stage is varied and distinct is distinct from thefigure 7. venn graph a and alpha diversity analysis b-f of h. contortus eggs larvae and adults based on 16s rrna gene sequence v3-v4 region of parasite microbiome and 97 identity.

however the pre- dominant phyla observed in the three stages of the h. contortus life-cycle were proteobacteria for egg- and adult- stage microbiome and proteobacteria 96.29 and bacteroidetes 1.53 for larval stage microbiome employing v5-v7 tags.

results showed 48 v3- v4 tags and 28 v5-v7 tags bacterial genera comprised the microbial flora of h. contortus microbiome.

the dominant bacterial genera belonged to escherichia-shigella pseudomonas and ochrobactrum which were shared in all the stages of the parasite life-cycle using v3-v4 and v5-v7 amplicons.moreover the parasite microbiome could reflect the external micro-organisms i.e.

there is abundant room for further progress in comparing microbiome of different helminths which has and will continue to offer considerable potential for better understanding a wide-variety of devastating animal and human diseases.among the gastrointestinal parasites that cause losses to the farming industry for example haemonchus ostertagia trichostrongylus nematodirus and cooperia the barber's pole worm haemonchus contortus is the predominant blood- sucking highly pathogenic and economically important nematode that infects small rumi- nants.

more recent attention has focused on the alteration of nematode entomopatho- genicity by rhabditis regina microbiome.
