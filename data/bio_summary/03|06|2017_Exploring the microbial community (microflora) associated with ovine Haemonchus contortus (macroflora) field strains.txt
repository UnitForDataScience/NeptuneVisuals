However the highly dominant ruminal OTUs belonged to Bacteroidetes 79.82 Firmicutes 14.33 Proteobacteria 1.43 and Spirochaetae 1.3 for control uninfected group Bacteroidetes 61.26 Firmicutes 31.25 Proteobacteria 2.23 Lentisphaerae1.36 and Spirochaetae 1.28 for 7-dpi group Bacteroidetes 76.16 Firmicutes 5.99 Proteobacteria 15.75and Spirochaetae 1.44 for 50- dpi group.Similarly for all stages the parasite microbiome is highly dominated by microbes of the following bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes for egg-stage microbiome Proteobacteria for adult-stage microbiome and Proteobacteria Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes for larval-stage microbiome using V3-V4 tags.

The predominant phyla observed in the three stages of H. contortus life-cycle were Proteobacteria for egg- and adult- stage microbiome with relative abundances 99.66 and 99.49 respectively Proteobacteria 96.29 and Bacteroidetes 1.53 for larval-stage microbiome.

Moreover H. contortus egg-stage microbiome compared to H. contortus larval-stage microbiome and the later compared to H. contortus adult-stage microbiome displayed significant differences employing genus evenness Simpson and Shannon-Wiener species diversity indices at the genus-level.

The dominant bacterial genera belonged to Escherichia-Shigella Pseudomonas and Ochrobactrum which were shared in all the stages of the parasite life-cycle using V3-V4 and V5-V7 amplicons.Moreover the parasite microbiome could reflect the external micro-organisms i.e.

The dominant genera of larval-stage microbiome are Achromobacter 26.67 Lentibacillus 8.45 Pseudomonas 4.69 Ochrobactrum 4.212 Kroppenstedtia4.105 Dokdonella 2.97 Bacillus 2.52 Delftia 2.04 Oceanobacillus 1.51 Azotobacter 1.17 Pseudaminobacter 1.17 and CandidatusAccumulibacter 1.09.

The next few years will likely witness an immense number of studies uncovering the exact nature of this microbiome-H. contortus interaction and finally reveal the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the nematode microbiome as an achilles' heel of the gastrointestinal parasites.

There is abundant room for further progress in comparing microbiome of different helminths which has and will continue to offer an important parallel goal for the removal of a wide-variety of devastating animal and human diseases.ReferencesRahman W.

Similarly there was a consequential difference between H. contortus egg-stage microbiome in com- parison with H. contortus adult-stage microbiome at the genus-level targeting V3-V4 and V5-V7 regarding Simpson and Shannon-Wiener species diversity indices however genus evenness did not show any significant differences Table .Beta diversity.
