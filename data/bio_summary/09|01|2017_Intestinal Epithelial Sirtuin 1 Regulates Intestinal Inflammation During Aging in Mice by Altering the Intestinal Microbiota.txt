SIRT1 deficiency in the intestinal epithelium results in increased fecal bile acid concentrations which in turn lead to an altered gut microbial composition enhanced intestinal inflammation and increased susceptibility to colitis.Materials and MethodsAnimal ExperimentsIntestinal epithelium-specific SIRT1 knockout mice SIRT1 iKO Villin-Creth Sirt1floxflox and their age- and gender-matched littermate Flox controls Villin-Cre- Sirt1floxflox on a C57BL6 background were generated as described.SIRT1 FloxLgr5- EGFP and iKOLgr5-EGFP mice were generated by breeding SIRT1 Flox and iKO mice with Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-creERT2 mice Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME 008875.

Heatmap analyses of these total 8548 gene probes confirmed that the ileum of young SIRT1 iKO mice did not significantly differ from that of Flox controlmice whereas aged Flox and SIRT1 iKO mice displayed markedly distinct gene expression profiles E. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis further showed that in response to aging ilea from Flox mice were enriched in genes involved in mitochondrial function cell death DNA damage and cell cycle whereas ilea from SIRT1 iKO mice were primarily impaired in mitochondrial functions NF- kB-induced inflammatory signaling and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response pathways F. Disrup- tion in mitochondrial functions activation of NF-kB- signaling and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress could all contribute to the symptoms of enhanced inflammation and secretory cell hyperactivation in aged SIRT1 iKO ileum.Intestinal Epithelial SIRT1 Deficiency Induces Spontaneous Inflammation in the Colon of Aged MiceSIRT1 deficiency-induced activation of Paneth cells and goblet cells increase in NF-kB activity and elevation of pro-inflammatory genes and antimicrobial proteins in the small intestine  and  suggest that SIRT1- deficient colons may also display symptoms of sponta- neous inflammation and other impairments.

Further time course analyses revealed that the abundance of fecal Lactobacillus was increased with age in control mice but this age-dependent increase was blunted in SIRT1 iKO mice D and the significant inhibition of fecal Lactoba- cillus in SIRT1 iKO mice was detectable as early as 4-month- old D. Lactobacillus is an important genus of bacteria that is reduced in IBD patientsand administra- tion of probiotic Lactobacillus strains can protect against intestinal inflammation in humans and mice.Therefore our observations suggest that SIRT1 may regulate intestinal inflammation and susceptibility to IBD through modulation of gut microbiota.The homeostasis of intestinal microbiota is regulated by a number of genetic and environmental factors.- For instance Paneth cells have been shown to be crucial in regu- lating the gut microbiota and its associated pathophysiol- ogies through antimicrobial peptides.-The observation that SIRT1 deficiency leads to hyperactivation of Paneth cells  suggests that Paneth cell dysfunction may contribute to the observed gut dysbiosis in aged SIRT1 iKO mice.

Specifically the intestinal microbiota in patients with IBD is characterized by a reduced bacterial diversity a decrease of Firmicutes including Lactobacillus and an increase of Proteobacteria and therapeutic strategies aimed to correct dysbiosis have been shown to be prom- ising in IBD.To dissect the primary defects caused by intestinal epithelial SIRT1 deletion and to further understand the cause-effect relationship among hyperactivated Paneth cells increased inflammation and altered gut microbiota observed in aged SIRT1 iKO mice we generated gut microbiota-depleted mice by treating 22-month-old aged Flox and SIRT1 iKO mice with drinking water containing an antibiotic cocktail for 4 weeks A-C. Interestingly antibiotic-treated aged SIRT1 iKO mice still exhibited hyperactivation of Paneth cells in the small intestine A although the number and morphology of their goblet cells appeared to be normal Supplementary Figure 7A.

Moreover SIRT1 iKO mice that did not display alteration in their gut microbiota including the 1.5- to 2-month-old young SIRT1 iKO mice Supplementary Figure 8 and the 10- to 12-month-old SIRT1 iKO mice after feeding with 2 cholestyramine diet Supplementary Figure 9 had a comparable sensitivity to DSS-colitis as control mice highlighting the importance of gut dysbiosis in SIRT1 deficiency induced colitis.

METHODS We performed studies of mice with disruption of Sirt1 specifically in the intestinal epithelium SIRT1 iKO villin- Cre  Sirt1floxflox mice and control mice villin-Cre- Sirt1floxflox on a C57BL6 background.

While minimal changes in relative abundance of bacterial taxa were observed be- tween 2-month-old young Flox and SIRT1 iKO mice 24-month-old aged SIRT1 iKO mice showed a trend of reduction in the total number of observed bacterial species richness and phylogenetic diversity values compared with aged Flox mice Supplementary Figure 6A.

Therefore treatment with cholestyramine-containing diet has been shown to increase fecal bile acids and lower plasma cholesterol levels as a result of increased hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids.As shown in F 7-day feeding of the chole- styramine diet significantly increased fecal bile acid con- tents in Flox mice but not further in SIRT1 iKO mice F Fecal bile acids although the serum cholesterol levels were reduced in both Flox and SIRT1 iKO mice F Serum cholesterol.

They required prolonged DSS administration to induce rectal bleeding and colon shortening D and were able to preserve relatively intact crypt structures even after 9 days of DSS treatment E. Additionally the expression levels of several proinflammatory cytokines were also reduced in antibiotic-treated DSS-colitis mice compared with conventional DSS-colitis mice F. Importantly the hypersensitive phenotypes of SIRT1 iKO mice to DSS- colitis observed in the conventional condition  were almost completely eliminated in the gut microbiota- depleted condition D-F.

Notably aged SIRT1 iKO mice in our facility were specif- ically depleted of the Bacilli class including Lactobacillus  whereas a completely different set of microbes was altered in the intestinal epithelium-specific SIRT1 KO mice in Lo Sasso et al's study.The differential alterations of these gut microorganisms in these two studies may directly lead to distinct responses of SIRT1 iKO mice to DSS- induced colitis.
