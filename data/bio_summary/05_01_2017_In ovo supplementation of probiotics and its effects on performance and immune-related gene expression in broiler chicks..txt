expression of muc-2 on d 6 was downregulated in the sham p1 and p2 groups when compared to the negative controls but upregulated in p3 when compared to the sham and p1 birds p  0.01. birds in p2 had increased ex- pression of muc-2 on d 22 in relation to the negative controls while p3 birds had decreased expression in comparison to the sham p1 and p2 groups p  0.02. on d 6 ifn-g expression in the ileum was lower in p3 birds than both the negative control and sham in- jected groups figure .

on d 6 the p1 group had lower il-4 expression than both the negative con- trol and sham groups while expression in p2 and p3 were only found to be less than the negative control p  0.0003. furthermore expression of il-4 on d 15 was lower in p3 than in the negative control sham and p1 groups.

bars lacking a common letter within each day differ significantly.all probiotic supplemented groups had lower expression than the sham inoculated group p  0.01. when look- ing at inos expression in the cecal tonsils levels were decreased in all injected groups on d 8 p  0.006 and in p3 on d 22 p  0.0001 figure .relative to the negative control tff-2 expression in the ileum was decreased on d 6 in all injected groups p  0.004 figure .

on d 4 all injected groups had lower tlr-2 expression than the negative control p  0.02. levels of tlr-2 were decreased in p2 chicks on d 6 p  0.001 as well as in p3 chicks on d 8 p  0.01.on doh tlr-4 expression was lower in the ileum of sham injected and p2 birds when compared to the negative controls p  0.01 figure .

on d 6 expression levels of inos were decreased in p1 when compared to the negative control sham and p2 groups and in p2 and p3 when compared to the neg- ative control only p  0.0004. expression of inos was also reduced on d 8 in p3 birds when compared to the negative control and sham injected groups whilefigure 2b.

on d 22 tlr-4 expression was downregulated in p3 when compared to the negative control sham and p1groups p  0.03.expression of inos was augmented in the ileum of p3 birds on doh when compared to the negative control and sham groups and in p1 and p2 when compared to the negative control only p  0.01 figure .

significant differences were not observed for litaf expression in the cecal tonsils.interleukin-4 expression in the ileum was decreased on d 4 in all groups when compared to the negative control p  0.002 figure .

body weight of p2 was signif- icantly greater than that of the negative control shamand p1 on d 4 and that of the negative control and p1 on d 6. a similar pattern was observed for bw gain bwg from doh to d 4. real-time pcr was used to investigate the expression of immune-related genes in the ileum and cecal tonsils.

expression of tlr-4 was also downregulated on d 6 in the ileum of p3 birds when compared to the negative control and sham birds p  0.03. in the cecal tonsil tlr-4 expres- sion on doh was upregulated in p3 chicks when com- pared to sham p1 and p2 but not the negative control1056pender et al.figure 1a.

bars lacking a common letter within each day differ significantly.compared to the negative control and sham birds p  0.03 figure .ileal expression of litaf on d 6 was downregulated in p1 and p2 birds when compared to the sham injected birds but not the negative control birds p  0.04 figure .

expression levels of il-13 were decreased in the cecal tonsils on doh in p3 chicks relative to the negative control sham and p1 groups and in p2 chicks relative to the negative controls and p1 p  0.0002 figure .

both il-4 and il-13 function by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory modula- tors.on doh all probiotic treatment levels resultedin increased expression of inos in the ileum when compared to the negative control while the highestprobiotic dosage resulted in levels higher than that of both the negative control and sham injected groups.

other than an ini- tial upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase on doh in ovo probiotic supplementation was associated with downregulated expression of toll-like receptors-2 and -4 inducible nitric oxide synthase trefoil factor- 2 mucin-2 interferon-g and interleukins-4 and -13 in both the ileum and cecal tonsils though expression pat- terns differed based on treatment tissue and time point evaluated.

expression of il-4 was also reduced in p2 birds on d 15 but only when compared to the sham and p1 groups p  0.01. in the cecal tonsils il-41058pender et al.figure 5. effect of in ovo probiotic supplementation on relative muc-2 expression in the cecal tonsils of cobb 500 chicks.

these data suggest that probiotics may promote an- timicrobial activity in the host by increasing intestinal inos gene expression and thus provide a means of pro- tection against pathogens soon after hatch when the chick is immunologically most vulnerable.other than inos on doh our results suggest the primary effect of probiotics is to downregulate immune- related gene expression within the intestine.
