On d 22 TLR-4 expression was downregulated in P3 when compared to the negative control sham and P1groups P  0.03.Expression of iNOS was augmented in the ileum of P3 birds on DOH when compared to the negative control and sham groups and in P1 and P2 when compared to the negative control only P  0.01 Figure .

On d 6 the P1 group had lower IL-4 expression than both the negative con- trol and sham groups while expression in P2 and P3 were only found to be less than the negative control P  0.0003.

Bars lacking a common letter within each day differ significantly.compared to the negative control and sham birds P  0.03 Figure .Ileal expression of LITAF on d 6 was downregulated in P1 and P2 birds when compared to the sham injected birds but not the negative control birds P  0.04 Figure .

Both IL-4 and IL-13 function by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory modula- tors.On DOH all probiotic treatment levels resultedin increased expression of iNOS in the ileum when compared to the negative control while the highestprobiotic dosage resulted in levels higher than that of both the negative control and sham injected groups.

When look- ing at iNOS expression in the cecal tonsils levels were decreased in all injected groups on d 8 P  0.006 and in P3 on d 22 P  0.0001 Figure .Relative to the negative control TFF-2 expression in the ileum was decreased on d 6 in all injected groups P  0.004 Figure .

Significant differences were not observed for LITAF expression in the cecal tonsils.Interleukin-4 expression in the ileum was decreased on d 4 in all groups when compared to the negative control P  0.002 Figure .

Body weight of P2 was signif- icantly greater than that of the negative control shamand P1 on d 4 and that of the negative control and P1 on d 6.

Expression levels of IL-13 were decreased in the cecal tonsils on DOH in P3 chicks relative to the negative control sham and P1 groups and in P2 chicks relative to the negative controls and P1 P  0.0002 Figure .

In ovo sup- plementation of Primalac did not significantly alter FI FCR Table  or mortality ranging from 1.5 to 5.Intestinal Gene ExpressionIleal TLR-2 expression was downregulated on d 4 in the P2 and P3 groups P  0.045 and on d 6 in thesham P1 and P3 groups when compared to the negative control P  0.02 Figure .

On d 4 all injected groups had lower TLR-2 expression than the negative control P  0.02.
