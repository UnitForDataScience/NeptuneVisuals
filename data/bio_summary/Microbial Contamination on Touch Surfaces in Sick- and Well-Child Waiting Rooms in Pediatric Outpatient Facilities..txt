Sample sizes are as follows seats n  9 tables n  6 children's tables n  5 well-child waiting rooms and n  9 sick-child waiting rooms children's seats n  6 magazines n  8 well-child waiting rooms and n  6 sick-child waiting rooms and books n  7.area include Enterococcus faecium on a magazine Pseudomonas aeruginosa on a children's book S. paucimobilis on a children's book and Cronobacter sakazakii on a children's seat.

Overall seats children's seats and children's books had the highest microbial burdens.Microorganisms IsolatedFrom the sick-child area S. pyogenes was isolated from a children's book and Sphingomonas paucimobilis was isolated from a seat table children's book and magazine.

Surfaces sampled included seats tables children's tables chil- dren's seats magazines and books.Results We found seats children's seats and children's books to have the highest microbial burden.

SampleThe Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal  Volume 36 Number 12 December 2017  e303sizes were as follows 9 seats in well- and sick-child waiting rooms 6 tables in well- and sick-child waiting rooms 5 children's tables in well-side waiting rooms 9 children's tables in sick-child waiting rooms 6 children's seats in sick- and well-child waiting rooms 8 magazines in well-child waiting rooms 6 magazines in sick-child waiting rooms and 7 books in well- and sick-child waiting rooms.Sample ProcessingTo prepare samples for assessment 5 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline was added to each conical tube containing a wipe and vortexed for 1 minute to allow microbes to transfer from the wipe to solution.

To reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in the waiting area of a doctor's office the AAP suggests limiting waiting times avoiding crowding encouraging proper cough etiquette and separating sick children from others as soon as possible.1213 While the current AAP guidelines suggest separating sick children from others they do not suggest the need for separate waiting rooms for sick and well children.

A 4'' by 4'' template was placed on the surfaces of seats children's seats tables and children's tables to provide a measured area for swabbing.

Sample sizes are as follows seats n  9 tables n  6 children's tables n  5 well- child waiting rooms and n  9 sick-child waiting rooms children's seats n  6 magazines n  8 well-child waiting rooms and n  6 sick-child waiting rooms and books n  7.the well-child waiting area with counts of 145 colony-forming unit CFU100 cm2 in the well-child waiting room and 678 CFU100 cm2 in the sick-child waiting room.

From the sick-child waiting areas there were 83.8 more enteric bacteria on the seat samples.Microbial Burden on Various Touch SurfacesThe surfaces with the highest levels of microbial contami- nation were seats children's seats and children's books.

Seats and children's books contained the highest levels of staphylo- cocci and children's books had the highest levels of Gram-negative enteric bacteria.
