In conclusion our study suggests wheat cultivars are involved in shaping the rhizosphere by differentially altering the bacterial OTUs consistently across different sites and these altered bacterial communities may provide beneficial services to the host.Keywords rhizosphere microbiome OTU wheat microbial communityINTRODUCTIONThe roots of land plants are surrounded by complex communities of microorganisms      .

Relative abundance did not serve a role in the number of co-occurrences and their connectivity Spearman R  0.228P  0.453.Predicted Gene Functions for Bacterial Communities by Wheat CultivarsTo characterize members of the rhizosphere community with sequenced metagenomics data PICRUSt was used to infer 16S rDNA rhizosphere sequences to available sequenced bacterial genomes.

These numbers are higher than reported in previous wheat rhizosphere studies using pyrosequencing and TRFLP     and are consistent with other rhizosphere sequencing studies      .
