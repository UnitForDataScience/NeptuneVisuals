However the influence of the intestinal microbiota by dietary nucleotides in fish has to our knowledge never been studied by high-resolution pyrosequencing methods and the role played by the microbiota in the growth-promotion effect of dietary nucleotides has never been addressed.In this study we first tested the effect of dietary nucleotides on the growth of zebrafish and a growth-promotion effect was observed.

Consistently nucleotide feeding decreased the expression of genes encoding key enzymes involved in FA oxidation in muscle as follows mcad 30.43 P  0.162 and cpt1a 30.46 P  0.05 Figure 4B C. Theexpression of mcad and cpt1a was also reduced in the liver of the NT fish compared with controls 30.54 P  0.05 and30.44 P  0.05 respectively Figure 4D E.FIGURE 2 Energy gain A standard metabolic rate B feeding metabolism energy C and excretion energy D of zebrafish fed control or 0.1 NT diets for 2 wk Expt.

The intestinal microbiota from the nucleotide-fed fish NT fish or control fish was transferred to 3-d postfertilization germ-free zebrafish in which oxygen consumption and expression of cytokines and fiaf were evaluated.Results Compared with controls nucleotide supplementation at 0.1 increased the weight and energy gains of zebrafish by 10 and 25 respectively P  0.01.

The relative expression of il10 was 224 higher in zebrafish colonized with nucleotide microbiota than in control microbiota-colonized fish P  0.001 Figure 6A B. Intrigu- ingly germ-free zebrafish colonized with nucleotide microbiota had 33 lower expression of fiaf than did their control microbiota-colonized counterparts indicating an increased sup- pression of fiaf by nucleotide microbiota P  0.001 Figure 6C.FIGURE 3 Relative mRNA expressions of proinflammatory A and anti-inflammatory B cytokines in the head kidney tissue of zebrafish fed control or 0.1 NT diets for 2 wk Expt.

The results showed that the microvilli length and density of fish fed nucleotides were both improved compared with control fish 31.39 39 greater and 31.18 respectively P  0.001 Figure 2E F.Effects of dietary nucleotides on energy budget.

Interestingly we observed that the standard metabolic rate of zebrafish fed a diet with 0.1 nucleotides was significantly lower than in control fish indicat- ing that the growth-promotion effect of dietary nucleotides is associated with reduced energy expenditure of the host.A growing number of studies have shown that the gut microbiota has a tight and coordinated connection with host metabolism energy utilization and storage 37.

In this regard growth can be regarded as the difference between gross energy intake and other components of the energy budget that is G  C 2 F 2 U 2 Rs 2 Rf 18 where G is energy for growth C is energy consumed in diet F represents energy of feces produced U is energy lost in ammonia excretion Rs is standard metabolic rate standard metabolic energy and Rf is feeding metabolic rate.

According to the existing literature the mechanisms underlying the growth- promotion effect of dietary nucleotides in fish include the following 1 chemoattractive effect which increases the feed intake of fish 11 2 improvement in intestinal morphology 16 and 3 reduction in the high energy demand for nucleotide synthesis 17.Studies of animal bioenergetics attempt to describe the energy flow in individual organisms through a balanced energy budget.

Germ-free zebrafish colonized with microbiota from NT fish had a 25 lower standard metabolic rate than did those colonized by control microbiota P  0.01 whereas direct nucleotide feeding of germ-free zebrafish did not affect standard metabolic rate relative to germ-free controls that were not fed nucleotides.
