But currently we do not have evidence that the microbiome of patients who respond to immunotherapy differs from the microbiome of those who do not or that the microbiome has any effect on the development of melanoma or on how well patients respond to treatment.

We still have a lot to learn about biomarkers for all these immunotherapy agents.HO Does the microbiome in the skin or gut of patients with melanoma differ from that in persons without the diseaseHZ We do not know yet but we are learning a lot about the subject.

Zarour MDProfessor of Medicine Immunology and Dermatology University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Pittsburgh PennsylvaniaHO Why does immunotherapy work better in some patients with melanoma than in othersHZ We are still unsure about that but we are working to find a reliable way to predict which patients are most likely to respond to the various immunotherapies.Regarding programmed death 1 PD-1 antibodies which are among the most successful immunotherapies to date a previous spontaneous immune response--in particular the presence of T-cell infiltrates in the tumor-- appears to predict a response to the agent.

We hope to begin treating our first patient by this summer.HO What other studies of the microbiome are being conducted in melanoma and other solidtumorsHZ Multiple studies have embarked on collecting stool from patients undergoing immunotherapy.

I expect however that there will be some significant differences between humans and mice so it is far too soon to begin administering probiotics to patients outside clinical trials.To evaluate the role of the gut microbiome in mod- ulating clinical response to PD-1 blockade we have designed a novel clinical trial in which fecal microbiota obtained from patients who are long-term responders to PD-1 blockade are transplanted to patients with disease refractory to PD-1 blockade pembrolizumab Keytruda Merck will then be administered.

We need to determine whether the relationship is like that in mice in which we have found a correlation between the presence of certain commensals and tumor response.

We must be very careful in the interpretation of these data because the complexity in humans is going to be significant.HO Could you discuss some of the ongoing studies in humansHZ It may be too soon to develop clinical trials of pro- biotics and anti-PD-1 antibodies because we do not know precisely whether the gut microbiome in humans modulates immune and clinical responses to cancers.

Humans have far more genetic variables than mice do and factors such as age sex and environmental factors-- including diet--are all known to play a critical role in modulating the gut microbiome.

Fine-tuning cancer immunotherapy optimizing the gut microbiome.

In particular 2 landmark studies conducted in animals and published in Science in 2015 have shed light on the relationship between immunotherapy and the microbi- ome in mouse models of melanoma.In the first study from France Dr Marie Vetizou and colleagues found that therapeutic antibodies targeting CTLA-4 effectively shrank tumors in mice that were popu- lated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron or Bacteroides fragilis.
