Similarly the result showed that the intestinal mucosal folds and microvilli density compared with the control diet treatment were much extensive and abundanter in stur- geon fed raffinose supplemented diet e g i  k. In ad- dition the residual bait of sturgeon fed the control diet  f h j  l was more than that of sturgeon fed the diet supplemented with raffinose.Intestinal microbiologyA total of 1104044 sequence reads from the sturgeon digesta were retained after trimming after removing low quality reads 162192.5 - 59565.5 and 284412.5 - 171215.5 sequences for con- trol and raffinose treatments respectively were used for downstream analyses.

Shannon's diversity index of sturgeon fed the diet supplemented with raffinose was significantly higher than sturgeon fed the control diet P  0.05.DiscussionIndeed recent trials have emphasized prebiotics have great poten- tial as agents to improve or maintain a balanced intestinal microflora to enhance health and wellbeing.

In the current study sturgeon fed the diet supplemented with raffinose presented the extensive intestinal mucosal folds and abundanter microvilli density which translated to increased enterocyte absorptive area and subsequently resulted in the improved growth performance when compared with sturgeon fed the control diet.

Hybrid sturgeon fed diet supplemented with raffinose had significantly higher final body weight FBW specific growth rate SGR and weight gain ratio WGR than fish fed the control diet P  0.05.

2-h.the smooth and tidy intestinal walls few bait residual in sturgeon fed raffinose supplemented diet  a  c. On the contrary the in- testinal walls presented damage and some feed existed in the front intestine when sturgeon fed with the control diets  b  d. The structures of mid-intestine and terminal intestine were also displayed in and  respectively.

The increasing of in- testinal villi area and mucosal folds were observed in intestinal tract of sturgeon when they fed the raffinose supplemented diet.

The SEM images were analyzed to assess the re- lative abundance of microvilli count and mucosal fold and to observe the residual diets in intestinal tract.The whole intestinal tract with faecal matter was removed from the other three sedated fish in each tank.

In conclusion supplementation of the diet with raffinose is capable of improving hybrid sturgeon growth performances and intestinal morphology modifying the intestinal microbial composition.IntroductionAs the living fossil sturgeons are ancient and have relatively low rates of evolution compared with other vertebrates.

Compared with the control diet the myeloperoxidase MPO and respiratory burst NBT activitives were significantly higher in sturgeon fed the raffinose supplemented diet P  0.05.

All sampling operations were conducted on the ice and the whole intestinal tract samples were stored in -80 degC immediately for the following intestinal microbiology ana- lysis.After all sampling all rest fish in each tank were weighted and counted.
