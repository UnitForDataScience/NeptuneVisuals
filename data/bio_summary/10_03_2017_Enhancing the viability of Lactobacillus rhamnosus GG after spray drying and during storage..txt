The spray drying media with a statistically significant log-reduction in viability are indicated with a star  One-way ANOVA Tukey's multiple comparisons test.Results and discussionMedium optimization for spray dryingThe effects of sodium chloride and sodium phosphates on the sur- vival rate of L. rhamnosus GG were assessed by using different spray drying media namely demineralized water PB saline and PBS.

when rehydrating the bacterial cells.Effect of saccharides on the bacterial viability after spray dryingDifferent saccharides including trehalose lactose mannitol dex- tran and maltodextrin were tested in different concentrations in PBS for their protective effect on the survival rate of L. rhamnosus GG after spray drying.

Even though this led to the highest survival rate after spray drying from all the tested conditions the powder obtained after spray drying showed very low yields.

The bacterial pellet was resuspended by vortexing to its original volume in the respective spray drying medium.

The spray drying media examined were demineralized water PB saline 0.9 mV NaCl or phosphate buffered saline PBS.

The spray drying parameters were held constant during the experimentsinlet temperature of 135 degC and feed rate of 25 7.5 mlmin re-sulting in an outlet temperature of approximately 55-60 degC.

The spray-dried powder was collected from a single cyclone separator.Water activityImmediately after spray drying the water activity of the powders was measured using a LabSwift water activity instrument Novasina AG Lachen Switzerland.

The instrument was calibrated using Novasina humidity standards with a known relative humidity RH varying between Sal-T 11 with a RH of 11.0 - 0.3 to Sal-T 84 with a RH of 84.3 - 0.3 at 25 degC.Enumeration of viable bacteriaThe spray-dried powder was resuspended in the used spray drying medium in a 1 mV concentration i.e.

The initial survival rate immediately after spray drying was compared to the viability after 2 4 8 12 and 28 weeks.

The obtained data were analyzed using Universal Analysis 2000 TA Instruments.OsmolalityTo measure the osmolality of the researched spray drying and re- hydration media a Micro Osmometer Model 3300 Advanced Instruments Norwood MA USA was used.
