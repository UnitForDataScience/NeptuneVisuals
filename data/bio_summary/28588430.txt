Abundance of major phyla in healthy subjects Veg vegetarian Non Veg non-vegetarian a patient with inflam- matory bowel disease IBD and a patient with colon cancer Ca Colon.the genera Clostridium Ruminococcus Eubacterium and Roseburia .DiscussionThe present study aimed to assess gut microbial diversity in healthy Indian adults and patients with colon carci- noma and IBD using a metagenomic approach.

This study is designed to understand the gut microbiota and their metabolic end-products in healthy vegetar- ian and non-vegetarian adults and diseased IBD and colon cancer patients and to understand the micro- bial diversity in the Indian population.Materials and methodsThe study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS New Delhi India in collaboration with The Energy Research Institute TERI New Delhi India.Ethics and consentEthical clearance for the study was obtained by the Institutional Ethics Committee of AIIMS New Delhi India ethical clearance reference numbers IECNP- 3652011 and RP-022012.

were found in 25 28 patients with colon cancer while no other group was positive for Clostridium spp.Microbial community structureConstruction of clonal librariesTo characterize the microbial community in human stool 16S rDNA gene clonal libraries of gut bacteria were constructed using the sequences amplified by the universal primer sets 27F and 1492R for 16S rDNA.One sample from each group was randomly selected for sequencing a healthy adult on a vegetarian diet a 44-year-old female sample code B1-10 a healthy adult on a non-vegetarian diet a 25-year-old male B2-02 an IBD patient a 57-year-old male D1-09 and a colon carcinoma patient a 42-year-old male D2-03.Sequencing of clonal librariesThe sequenced clones from the four stool samples from each group of participants belonged to the following phyla of the domain Bacteria ProteobacteriaBacteroidetesFirmicutes Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobiota.The dominant phylum from the clones of the sample from the healthy vegetarian B1-10 was Firmicutes 38 followed by Bacteroidetes 17.

However 16S rDNA sequencing of all clonal libraries is highly time consuming and costly in a resource-limited setting .Colon carcinoma patient versus healthy adultComparison of the microbiota between the healthy non-vegetarian adult male and the colon carcinoma patient who was also on a non-vegetarian diet showed that the stool sample from the colon cancer patient had a higher percentage of Bacteroidetes than Firmicutes but a lower Bacteroidetes Firmicutes ratio than that in healthy adults.

A p value  0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsIn this study we have recruited a total of 32 subjects eight subjects from different population subsets groups including healthy adults on a vegetarian diet healthy adults on a non-vegetarian diet patients with IBD and patients with colon carcinoma.

Imbalance in the composition of gut microbial communities isassociated with the development of a number of gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease IBD and colon carcinoma .Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of both intestinal disorders includ- ing IBD irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer and extraintestinal disorders including allergy asthma metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular dis- ease .

The mean age of the IBD patients was 31.5 - 12.6 years range 22-44 years and the mean age of the patients with colon carcinoma was 50.5 - 12.2 years range 42-70 years.Stool culture for gut microbiotaDifferent bacterial species were isolated using conven- tional culture methods.

A higher per- centage of individuals from both healthy control groups harbored lactobacilli in their stool compared to the colon carcinoma and IBD groups as detected by con- ventional culture.
