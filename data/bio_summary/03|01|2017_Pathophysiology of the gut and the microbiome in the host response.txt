Coopersmith MD11Department of Surgery and Emory Critical Care Center Emory University School of Medicine Atlanta GAAbstractObjective--To describe and summarize the data supporting the gut as the motor driving critical illness and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome MODS presented at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development MODS Workshop March 26- 27 2015.Data Sources--Summary of workshop keynote presentation.Study Selection--Not applicable.Data Extraction--Presented by an expert in the field the data assessing the role of gastrointestinal dysfunction driving critical illness were described with a focus on identifying knowledge gaps and research priorities.Data Synthesis--Summary of presentation and discussion supported and supplemented by relevant literature.Conclusions--The understanding of gut dysfunction in critical illness has evolved greatly over time and the gut is now often considered as the motor of critical illness.

The highly dynamic gut epithelium serves as a barrier between a large population of gut immune cells and the greater than 100 trillion microorganisms living within the intestinal lumen far more bacteria than there are cells in the entire host body 2.Our understanding of gut dysfunction in critical illness has evolved greatly in the past 30 years and the gut is now frequently referred to as the motor of critical illness 3.Critically ill patients may demonstrate a number of clinical findings suggestive of intestinal dysfunction including abdominal distension loss of bowel sounds diarrhea emesis bleeding and intra-abdominal hypertension.

The association of the gut with critical illness is supported by both animal models and clinical studies.

Initially the association between gut dysfunction and critical illness focused primarily on bacterial translocation into the bloodstream.

Additionally alterations in the gut epithelium may be associated with critical illness and influence outcomes.

Gut epithelial apoptosis intestinal hyperpermeability and perturbations in the intestinal mucus layer have all been associated with critical illness.

Finally there is growing evidence that the intestinal microbiome plays a crucial role in mediating pathology in critical illness.

On ICU admission increased plasma concentrations of intestinal fatty-acid binding protein a gut-specific protein whose presence in plasma suggests gut injury and decreased levels of citrulline a marker of gut cellular mass have both been associated with increased ICU morbidity and higher mortality at 28 days 5.Translocation and gut-derived products causing distal injuryInitial interpretations of the gut as the motor of critical illness focused on the idea of bacterial translocation.

It was hypothesized that critical illness caused intestinal hyperpermeability resulting in the translocation of intact bacteria into the bloodstream causing systemic disease.

Numerous animal models of critical illness have revealed that mesenteric lymph duct ligation attenuates lung injury and neutrophil activation and importantly improves survival.
