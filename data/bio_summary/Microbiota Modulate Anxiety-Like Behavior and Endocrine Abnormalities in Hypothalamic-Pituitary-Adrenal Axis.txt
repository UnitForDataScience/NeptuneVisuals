In addition the results revealed that GF control mice spent more time exploring than SPF control animals p  0.001 and GF restraint-stressed mice explored more time than SPF restraint-stressed mice p  0.001 in the center of the OFT Figure 2C.Hormonal Dysfunction of the HPA AxisWe examined hormone and receptor levels in hypothalamic tissue.

However Nr3c1 mRNA expression in SPF control mice was decreased compared with SPF CRS mice p  0.05 Figure 4D and Nr3c2 mRNA expression was decreased in GF CRS micecompared with SPF CRS mice p  0.01 Figure 4E.

A decrease was also found in SPF CRS mice p  0.01 Figure 4F.DISCUSSIONIn our study behavioral tests showed that GF control mice exhibited an increase in the distance traveled and time spent in the center of the OFT compared with SPF control mice consistent with previous reports Zeng et al.

We tested germ-free GF mice and specific pathogen-free SPF mice divided into four groups.

After CRS Initially GF restraint-stressed mice explored more time than SPF restraint-stressed mice in the center and total distance of the OFT.

Moreover the CRH ACTH CORT and ALD levels in HPA axis of GF restraint-stressed mice exhibited a significantly greater increase than those of SPF restraint-stressed mice.

Finally the Crhr1 mRNA levels of GF CRS mice were increased compared with SPF CRS mice.

However the Nr3c2 mRNA levels of GF CRS mice were decreased compared with SPF CRS mice.

All results revealed that SPF mice exhibited more anxiety-like behavior than GF mice under the same external stress.

Moreover we also found that GF mice exhibited significant differences in hormones and hormone receptors compared with SPF mice.
