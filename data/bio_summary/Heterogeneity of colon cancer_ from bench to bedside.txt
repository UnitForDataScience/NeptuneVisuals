Thus the activation of b-catenin can exclude the antitumour immune response.b-Catenin is significantly more expressed in LCRC compared with RCC.Up to 48 of the non-T-cell-in- flamed tumours show activation of the Wntb-catenin pathway.Cathelicidin a peptide with antimicrobial function produced by host defence cells including macrophages neutrophils and endothelial cells of the gut is upregu- lated by many factors including IL-6 retinoic acid and bacterial infections.Cathelicidin in turn activates b-cat- enin.Therefore b-catenin its immune effects and its regula- tion links geneticepigenetic structure immune system and microbiota.Human colon contains approximately 1013-1014 bacteria and their density increases with a positive gradient from the proximal tract to the distal.Not only bacterial quan- tity but also quality is different in RCC and LCRC.Commensal bacteria play a fundamental role in the body homeostasis the symbiotic equilibrium with the host allows a tolerant immune environment in return for example of acquired defences against threatening aggressors.

Indeed on the contrary of the number of commensal bacteria there is a negative gradient of various immune cells from the prox- imal to the distal colorectum.Step 3 the architecture and the functions of the immune system in the colorectumThe gastrointestinal tract hosts the highest concentration of immune cells in the body probably due to its contin- uous exposition to a high antigenic burden made up by nutrients and by commensal intestinal flora.There- fore a highly specialised defensive system is required.

These DCs induce Th17 response but similar to macrophages they cannot migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes.Among the innate immune cells natural killer T cells NKTs and gdT cells seem of particular importance for the bowel integrity.

The invariant NKTs iNKTs are the most relevant NKT subset.iNKT cells are involved in early-stage immune response including response to pathogens and tumour cells.Their activation requires the recognition of CD1d by T cell receptor TCR.Resident DCs macrophages and B cells in the gut largely express CD1d thus facilitate iNKT activation.gdT cells are CD27 or CD27- and the functional difference between these two subpopulations is of major importance.

Therefore it has recently been suggested to consider them innate immune cells.The most abundant non-lymphoid immune cells in the bowel are macrophages that act as antigen-presenting cells within the lamina propria.

The microbiota is a commensal pool of bacteria fungi viruses bacteriophages and archaea.The population of commensal bacteria is different in RCC and LCRC both quantitatively and qualitatively and this difference induces changes in the intestinal epithelial cells as well as in the composition of the immune cell population.Therefore it is clear that there exists a close interaction among mutational load immune cells and microbiota.An example of this 'three-factor interaction' is the history of b-catenin.

Therefore one of the causes of the immunological difference betweenRCC and LCRC is the different mutational load.Indeed RCC harbours more active immune cells which can promote an efficient immune response while LCRC hosts predominantly immunosuppressive cells.In addition to these aspects the gut microbiota contributes to the modulation of immune response.

The activation of CD8 cells requires a specific subpopulation of DCs the Batf3-lineage.Activation of Batf3 DCs in turn requires type I IFNs produced by the host cells.The lack of type I IFNs is associated with the absence of T cells in the tumour microenvironment TME.From a mechanistic point of view the type I IFNs activate STING on DCs and stimulate the production of many chemokines including CXCL9 and CXCL10 which attract effector T cells including CD8.If this is the main mechanism lack of Batf3 DCs results in a CD8 not infiltrated tumour and consequently lack of response to ICIs.There are many oncogenic pathways that can abro- gate the CD8 infiltration interfering with the axis DCs-CD8.

Innate lymphoid cells and natural killer T cells in the gastrointestinal tract immune system.

High protein expression is associated with the lack of expression of the CCL4 chemokine that may explainthe ineffective recruitment of dendritic cells DCs in the tumour bed and consequently the lack of infiltrating CD8 cells.
