Fast forward to modern times the use of stool samples for gut microbiota studies remains unchanged and the quest to understand more about the small animals with new analysis methods has unveiled many more questions that need to be answered.The microbiome also known as the microflora or microbiota is usually assumed to be the bacterial microbiota.

Moving forward more studies need to be done to determine the cause-effect relationship between the mycobiota and colorectal cancer.From such dysbiosis studies we can see that the microbiome and commensal fungi interaction is a balancing act when the microbiome is disrupted the normally commensal elements in the mycobiome might be unchecked and turn pathogenic.Dietary Influences and ObesityThere have been few studies on the influence of diet on the fungal mycobiota.

found altered bacterial and fungal microbiota--less operational taxonomic units OTUs less Firmicutes more Proteobacteria and larger fungal load in CD patients compared to healthy subjects.

We review here the recent knowledge gained from study of the interaction between the mycobiome and microbiome in health and disease susceptibility immunity and consequences from antimicrobial treatment.Keywords fungus mycobiome gut microbiome gastrointestinal microflora pathobiontIntroductionHumans have been interested in the microbial flora found on and in our bodies since the advent of microbiology.

A large proportion consists of fungal infections in immunocompromised patients with an estimated mortality between 35 to 45 reviewed in .Currently the gut microbiome has been linked to many gut-linked conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease IBD and obesity as well as many seemingly unrelated conditions such as maturation of the immune system and even cardiac size .

The multifaceted factors influencing gut microbiome and mycobiome interaction.Fungi That Are Found in the GI TractReports using next generation sequencing have found diverse fungal communities in all sections of the human gut consisting mainly of the phyla Ascomycota Basidiomycota and Zygomycota -.

The impact of antibiotics on the commensal fungal mycobiome is much less known.Fungi are able to establish a niche in a perturbed gut bacterial microbiome.

It is clear that dysbiosis of the fungal mycobiome can cause as much havoc in our body as dysbiosis of the bacteria microbiome.

The emerging world of the fungal microbiome.

b-glucan a major component of the fungal cell wall decreased fecal E. coli counts in animals  suggesting the metabolism of the fungal cell wall in the gut might influence the growth of E. coli and other bacteria.
