Third high levels of TMAO correlated with different factors and comorbidities namely age BMI diabetes mellitus and impaired kidney function.Long-term all-cause mortality rate in patients with COPD is substantial.Pneumonicandnonpneumonicexacerbations are the most likely causes of death in patients with severe COPD but cardiovascular diseases are the most likely causes of death in patients with mild to moderate COPD .

Whether TMAO levels can be influenced additionally by nutritional interventions and whether this would possibly benefit patients with COPD should be addressed in future studies.AcknowledgmentThe authors are thankful to all patients patients' relatives and all local general practitioners who participated in this study.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is a prevalent disease worldwide with a high associated risk for cardiovascular disease and death due to an infectious cause.Aims To study whether TMAO is predictive for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with exacerbated COPD.Methods A total of 189 patients with COPD exacerbation were prospectively followed for a median of 6.1 y. TMAO plasma levels at the time of emergency department admission were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.

Importantly patients who suffer from COPD are at a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases  which are the most likely cause of death in patients with mild to moderate COPD .

Herein our objective was to investigate the associa- tion of the proinflammatory metabolite TMAO with all-cause mortality in patients who suffer from a pneumonic or non- pneumonic COPD exacerbation from a previous trial.MethodsStudy designA total of 189 patients with a medical history of COPD and available blood samples from a previous Swiss multicenter study were included in this analysis.

In patients with nonpneumonic ECOPD we solely found an asso- ciation between TMAO levels and CKD.DiscussionThe principal findings of this first study to evaluate the pre- dictive value of TMAO in patients with ECOPD were threefold.

The gut microbiota-dependent TMAO was found to be associated with mortality in patients with stable coronary artery disease  CKD  CHF  and community-acquired pneumonia .The present study extends these findings to patients with COPD where an association of elevated TMAO levels and all- cause mortality was observed.

Also it would be important to understand how changes in comorbidities and metabolic characteristics influence TMA levels and its predictive value for cardiovascular disease and mortality.The strengths of our study were the high accuracy of the laboratory measurement methods and the well-characterized cohort of patients with ECOPD of different severities that are representative for patients who are usually treated in EDs and hospitals.

Applied nutritional investigationGut microbiota-dependent trimethylamine-N-oxide is associated with long-term all-cause mortality in patients with exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseManuel Ottiger M.D.

The deceased patients showed significantly higher median admission TMAO mmolL levels compared with survivors 3.9 interquartile range 2.3-7.1 versus 2.9 interquartile range 1.8-4.7 P 14 0.01 which resulted in an unadjusted hazard ratio of 1.8 95 confidence interval 1.2-3.0 P 14 0.01.
