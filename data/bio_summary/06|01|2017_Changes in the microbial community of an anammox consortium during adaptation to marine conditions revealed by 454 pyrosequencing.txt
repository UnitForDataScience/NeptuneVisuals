According to some current esti- mates about 50 of all nitrogen gas released into the atmosphere is produced by these bacteria Kartal et al.

The anammox process may be advantageous com- pared to the traditional nitrification-denitrification pro- cesses for nitrogen removal as it uses up to 60 less oxygen addition of external organic carbon is not re- quired and sludge production is less Costa et al.

Strous et al.

Additionally it is an important osmotic solute to ensure maintenance of turgor and regulation of the intracellular pH and of stress responses caused by in- creased sodium levels at high salinity Heermann and JungAs shown the anammox process should be combinedwith a partial nitrification process where half of the am- monium is oxidized to nitrite Van Hulle et al.

The combination of partial nitrification and anammox processes is an attractive alternative to remove nitrogenous com- pounds from high nitrogen loaded wastewaters with low organic matter content Dapena-Mora et al.

However many industrial wastewaters rich in ammonium also contain high salt concentrations Kartal et al.

Examples are established effluents produced in the fish canning industry Dapena-Mora et al.

land-fill leach- ate Jin et al.

leather industry Kartal et al.
