several studies have reported successful adaption of freshwater anammox consortia to high salt concentrations by gradually increasing the salinity from 0 to 15 g l-1 or from 0 to 30 g l-1 during 77-170 days dapena-mora et al.

for experiment e1 samples were collected at days 0 96 115 and 153 and were named as e1-0  0 g na cl l- 1  e 1 - 96  1 g na cl l-1 e1-115 3 g nacl l-1 and e1-153 3 g nacl l-1 respectively.

however published studies are partly contradictory because the presence of this genus was reported in an anammox culture which treated wastewater with a sa-linity of 10 g nacl l-1 zhang et al.

brocadia was the dominating group of anammox bacteria slowly adapted to salinity of 10-15 g nacl l-1 malovanyy et al.

and from 4 to 5 to 30 g l-1 during an adaptation period of 60-90 days kartal et al.

moreover reported that the presence of nacl in the media causes a stimulatory effect on the saa for both adapted and non-adapted biomass at concentration between 3 and 15 g na cl l-1 while higher concentration 20 g nacl l-1 caused a decrease in the activity.the bacterial response to osmotic stress represents a mul- tiphase adjustment comprising ion transport processes and.
