a top if it was significantly associated q  0.05 in at least one data set of at least two different diseases in the same direction.When we defined these non-specific genera we did not include data sets which used non-healthy controls Papa et al.and Gevers et al.

Three recent meta-analyses found no reproducible obesity-associated microbiome shifts- which is consistent with our classification results where we were only able to accurately classify obese and control patients in two out of five studies Zhu et al.

Finallymeta-analysis could be used to identify subsets of patients who exhibit distinct microbiome shifts within heterogenous diseases like IBD or in conditions which exhibit stochastic microbial responses allowing for further stratification of disease subtypesand microbiome disruptions  .

On the other hand bacteria that are asso-ciated with healthy patients across multiple diseases could be developed into a general probiotic which may be suited for many different conditions.Additionally characterizing dysbioses by their directionality and extent is a useful framework to generate hypotheses for future research on complex heterogenous diseases with links to the microbiome.

Are different diseases characterized by distinct shifts in the gut microbiome Are some diseases marked by an invasion of pathogens whereas others show a depletion of beneficial bacteria Can we identify microbial biomarkers for certain conditions which are consistently enriched or depleted in a disease across many patient cohorts Finally are some bacteria part of a non-specific healthy or diseased microbiome and consistently associated with health or disease in generalOne approach to synthesize existing knowledge is to identify consistencies across studies through a meta-analysis which allows researchers to find and remove false positives and negatives that may obscure underlying biological patterns.

all data sets except Papa et al.and Gevers et al.

We also analyzed the NASH and obese patients from the Zhu et al.

Fusobacterium isassociated with a broad spectrum of human diseases andPorphyromonas is a known oral pathogen .By contrast other disease-associated microbiome shifts are characterized by a depletion of health-associated bacteria in patients relative to controls.

The majority of the the non-specific responders in the order Clostridiales were associated with health comprising the majority of all of the microbes which were non-specifically associated with healthy patients 17 genera out of 24 total health- associated genera.
