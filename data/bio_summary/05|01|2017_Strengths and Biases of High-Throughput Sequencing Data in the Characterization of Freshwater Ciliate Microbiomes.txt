b. nMDS calculated on morphological presence absence data failed to cluster samples according to their origin Online Resource 7 as did morphology-based statistical anal- yses performed previously on more samples from the investi- gated area .DiscussionProtocolSequencing depth seems not to be an important factor affect- ing our results and the molecular diversity contained in se- quenced libraries is fully covered.

One way to better evaluate the significance of HTS data is to directly compare them with sur- veys performed on the same samples using traditional morpho- logical methods this has been rarely done because the time and taxonomic skills required are considerable  -.In this paper we compare Illumina sequencing data on ciliate communities with a morphological analysis performed on the same samples .

About 15 ml of the same samples used for morphological analyses were fixed in 70 ethanol immediately after collec- tion and stored at -20 degC.DNA Extraction and Illumina Library PreparationFixed samples were centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min in order to collect sediment and organic material at the bottom of Falcon tubes and discard the ethanol.

observed similar problems in a comparative study on diatoms but the incongruence did not extend to the BDiatom Index which was consistent when calculated from morphological and molecular data.Final Remarks on BiogeographyIn the morphological survey on these and other samples from the same geographic area  we concluded that no clear biogeographic pattern could be inferred citing as a possible explanation that microhabitat rather than the entire ecosys- tem has a larger influence on ciliate communities.

Karyorelicteans are represented by only one genus Loxodes in freshwaters HTS data did not report the corresponding OTU in one of the three samples where its presence was assessed during the morphological survey.

2015 Molecular diversity and distribution of marine fungi across 130 European environmen- tal samples.

Here we directly compare morphological and Illumina data obtained from the same samples in an effort to characterize ciliate faunas from sediments in freshwater envi- ronments.

The classification and terminology of Lynn  was employed.Comparison Between Morphological and Molecular OTUsIn the previously performed morphological survey on the same samples  OTUs were defined within each sample as morphotypes distinguishable in vivo and abundances were only qualitatively expressed.

The difference is not only due to the ability of HTS data to distinguish among similarmorphospecies in most samples the molecular datasets contain entire classes that were not detected in the morphological sur- vey.

Peritrichs reported relatively often in the morphological survey exhibited a huge diversity in the HTS analysis with 88 OTUs 256observations and the highest abundances of any group avg.
