b. nMDS calculated on morphological presence absence data failed to cluster samples according to their origin Online Resource 7 as did morphology-based statistical anal- yses performed previously on more samples from the investi- gated area .DiscussionProtocolSequencing depth seems not to be an important factor affect- ing our results and the molecular diversity contained in se- quenced libraries is fully covered.

One way to better evaluate the significance of HTS data is to directly compare them with sur- veys performed on the same samples using traditional morpho- logical methods this has been rarely done because the time and taxonomic skills required are considerable  -.In this paper we compare Illumina sequencing data on ciliate communities with a morphological analysis performed on the same samples .

About 15 ml of the same samples used for morphological analyses were fixed in 70 ethanol immediately after collec- tion and stored at -20 degC.DNA Extraction and Illumina Library PreparationFixed samples were centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min in order to collect sediment and organic material at the bottom of Falcon tubes and discard the ethanol.

observed similar problems in a comparative study on diatoms but the incongruence did not extend to the BDiatom Index which was consistent when calculated from morphological and molecular data.Final Remarks on BiogeographyIn the morphological survey on these and other samples from the same geographic area  we concluded that no clear biogeographic pattern could be inferred citing as a possible explanation that microhabitat rather than the entire ecosys- tem has a larger influence on ciliate communities.
