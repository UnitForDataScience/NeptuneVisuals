this result is in contrary to most previous studies on rygb patientsand to two small studies that have been published on lsg patients.similar to previous studies we demonstrated an increase in the proteobacteria phylum mostly in the gammapro- teobacteria class in both arms.two new phyla appeared at m6 in this study verrucomicrobia as described previously and actinobacteria mainly bifidobacterium genus which decreased in previous studies.additionally our results showed an increase in gut microbiota richness at m6 similar to previous studies on rygb patientsand in contrary to another study onlsg patients.despite the dramatic changes that appeared at m6 and contrary to previous study on rygb patientsat m12 these changes were almost abolished both in terms of composition andfigure 2. change from baseline in the primary outcome hri a and complete remission of nafld on us b. n  40 at m0 and at m6 for both arms and n  38 for the probiotics arm and n  39 for the placebo arm at m12.figure 3. change from baseline in main secondary outcomes alanine aminotransferase alt a cytokeratin-18 ck-18 b leptin c bile acids d and ewl e. n  40 at m0 and at m6 for both arms and n  38 for the probiotics arm and n  39 for the placebo arm at m12.probiotics after lsg a rct s sherf-dagan et al153figure 4. gut microbiota changes at 6 and 12 months postsurgery composition differences between study arms at the phyla level a alpha diversity b ss and beta diversity c. a-c n  37 for the probiotics arm and n  36 for the placebo arm at m0 and at m6 n  35 for the probiotics arm and n  30 for the placebo arm at m12.

thus its impact on our microbiota resultswas expected to be minor.there were no significant differences between arms in the number of follow-up meetings with a dietitian hours invested in physical activity macronutrients intake and supplement use.primary outcomeliver fat content measured by hri scores was decreased at m6 as compared with m0 in both study-arms without a significant difference between arms -0.9 - 0.5 vs - 0.7 - 0.4 score for the probiotics and placebo groups respectively p  0.059. significant steatosis remission rate according to standard us criteria at m6 was achieved in both arms without a significant difference between arms 52.5 vs 40 for the probiotics and placebo groups respectively p  0.262. similarly no differences between arms were noted in the primary outcome at m12 2. hri score changes and steatosis remission rates along the yearly follow-up are depicted in b respectively.149figure 1. flow chart of the study population.

the hri score an objective operator- independent examination has been validated against liver biopsy as previously described with cutoff of 1.5 for the prediction of steatosis 45.at m6 there was an excellent agreement between the diagnosis of fatty liver by abdominal us using the standardized criteria and diagnosis by the hri score cutoff of 1.5 as reflected by a kappa of 0.75.furthermore liver fat percentage measured by magnetic resonance imaging with the 'in-phase and out-of-phase' method at m0 in a subsample of 18 patients was significantly correlated by pearson correlation with liver fat content measured by hri score r  0.584 p  0.011. in addition us images of gallbladder stones were recorded.

overall no significant difference was found for the microbiota composition between the study arms except at m6 for proteobacteria mainly the gammaproteobacteria class actinobac- teria mainly the coriobacteriia class and collinsella genus which were higher in the probiotics group compared with the placebo group p  0.034 p  0.019 and p  0.003 respectively and supplementary appendix table 2. the within-sample diversity alpha-diversity increased at m6 compared with m0 in both study arms p 0.008 and decreased again at m12 compared with m6 p 0.004 however not returning to the baseline values 4b.

fatty liver and fatty liver remission was diagnosed by abdominal us using standardized criteria.in all participants us was performed with the same equipment preirius scanner hitachi medical corporation tokyo japan and by the same experienced radiologist as previously described.the ratio between the median brightness level of the liver and the right kidney cortex was calculated to determine the hepato-renal index hri score.

to the best of our knowledge only three studies have been published to date on the impact of supplementation with probiotics following bs all152probiotics after lsg a rct s sherf-dagan et alamong roux-en-y gastric bypass rygb patients with a relatively small sample size a short-term follow-up and without hepatic outcomes or evaluation of microbiota composition.in a randomized controlled trial of 6-month treatment with probiotics among 40 rygb patients a greater ewl reduction in bacterial overgrowth and an increase in vitamin b12 levels were achieved in the probiotics group.similarly in a randomized controlled trial of 14 days intervention with probiotics among 60 rygb patients was shown to improve postoperative gastrointestinal tract episodes such as abdominal pain bloating belching and qol.

in a pilot randomized controlled trial of 15 days comparing prebiotics fructo-oligosaccharide vs symbiotic fructo-oligosac- charideprobiotics vs placebo among 9 rygb patients only supplementation with prebiotics increased weight loss whereas both prebiotics and synbiotics were not able to promote significant changes in inflammatory markers.only a few studies included an assessment of gut microbiota alterations following bs mostly performed in rygb patients demonstrating a reduction in the firmicutesbacteroides ratio and an increase in proteobacteria phylum.9overall at m6 the microbiota composition analysis indicated a clear significant changes consisting of a great reduction is the variability between samples and an increase in variability within samples.

patients were randomized into two arms probiotics vs placebo using the sequentially numbered opaque-sealed envelope method with stratifica- tion by gender and permuted blocks for every four patients according to doig and simpson.
