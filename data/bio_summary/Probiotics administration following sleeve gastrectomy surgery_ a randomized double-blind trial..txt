To the best of our knowledge only three studies have been published to date on the impact of supplementation with probiotics following BS all152Probiotics after LSG a RCT S Sherf-Dagan et alamong Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB patients with a relatively small sample size a short-term follow-up and without hepatic outcomes or evaluation of microbiota composition.In a randomized controlled trial of 6-month treatment with probiotics among 40 RYGB patients a greater EWL reduction in bacterial overgrowth and an increase in vitamin B12 levels were achieved in the probiotics group.Similarly in a randomized controlled trial of 14 days intervention with probiotics among 60 RYGB patients was shown to improve postoperative gastrointestinal tract episodes such as abdominal pain bloating belching and QOL.

The HRI score an objective operator- independent examination has been validated against liver biopsy as previously described with cutoff of 1.5 for the prediction of steatosis 45.At M6 there was an excellent agreement between the diagnosis of fatty liver by abdominal US using the standardized criteria and diagnosis by the HRI score cutoff of 1.5 as reflected by a kappa of 0.75.Furthermore liver fat percentage measured by magnetic resonance imaging with the 'in-phase and out-of-phase' method at M0 in a subsample of 18 patients was significantly correlated by Pearson correlation with liver fat content measured by HRI score r  0.584 P  0.011.

Gut microbiota changes at 6 and 12 months postsurgery composition differences between study arms at the phyla level a alpha diversity b SS and beta diversity c. a-c n  37 for the probiotics arm and n  36 for the placebo arm at M0 and at M6 n  35 for the probiotics arm and n  30 for the placebo arm at M12.

Thus its impact on our microbiota resultswas expected to be minor.There were no significant differences between arms in the number of follow-up meetings with a dietitian hours invested in physical activity macronutrients intake and supplement use.Primary outcomeLiver fat content measured by HRI scores was decreased at M6 as compared with M0 in both study-arms without a significant difference between arms -0.9 - 0.5 vs - 0.7 - 0.4 score for the probiotics and placebo groups respectively P  0.059.

Significant steatosis remission rate according to standard US criteria at M6 was achieved in both arms without a significant difference between arms 52.5 vs 40 for the probiotics and placebo groups respectively P  0.262.

BMI and waist circumference were significantly improved at M6 in both study arms but not between arms -10.2 - 2.6 vs - 10.7 - 2.5 kg m- 2 P  0.469 and - 24.1 - 6.4vs - 24.5 - 6.7 cm P  0.821 for the probiotics and placebo groups respectively.

The most widely used antidiabetic medication Metformin was previously associated with microbiome alterations.In our study only 6 patients reported taking Metformin presurgery three patients in each study arm however no patients reported on taking it at M6 or M12.
