there was comparable a-diversity in the plaque samples from the references m  2.70 and the low- sugar intake group m  2.72 p  0.83. furthermore principal component analysis and the correspondence analysis of all species in the plaque samples did not separate the microbial profiles of the two groups and supplemental data.qpcr datathe concentrations of dna in the plaque and saliva samples are shown in .

subjects were thereafter divided into a low- sugar group with 5 sugar intake in the diet and a reference group with daily sugar intake 5 of the total energy.the study was granted exemption from requiring ethics approval by the national danish ethics committee h-1-2013-079.

the reference group had 40 participants with an intake of free sugars between 5.0 and 21.0. the groups were balanced with respect to age sex and oral hygiene but the 5 group dis- played a significantly higher caries experience p  0.05. insufficient dna was obtained from 18 plaque samples which reduced the groups as shown in .homings analysis sequencingin the 52 plaque samples analyzed by homings posi- tive reads for 550 probe sequences were found which corresponded to 75 coverage of the 768 probes avail- able in the database.

fisher's exact test showed a statistically significant association between the diet group and the concentration of s. wiggsiae p  0.009. no other differences in taxa detected by qpcr were observed between the two sugar consumption groups.discussionin this study investigating the relation between contrast- ing sugar intake and microbial profiles with dna-based technologies interesting findings were observed insugar content of total energy e 3.1 1.69.0 3.7microbial profiles between sugar groups at the speciesbut not the genus level.

although not statistically significant a threefold higher prevalence of actinomyces was however noted in samples from the reference than from the low-sugar groups 2.4 vs. 0.7. lactobacillus was more abundant in the reference group than in the low-sugar group 0.052 vs. 0.009. the predominant bacterial species are displayed in .

samples were placed on ice before 117 ul of mpc protein precipitation reagent was added and the samples were vortexed and centrifuged.

the samples were diluted toobtain concentrations of 10 ngul and 50 ngul for the plaque and saliva samples respectively.

demographics of subjects with and without sufficient dna in plaque samples were compared by student's t-test age sex dmft and mann-whitney u-test oral hygiene.sample size was based on results from a previous study analyzed with the same assays 21. it was estimated that approximately 30 subjects in each sugar category would be sufficient in order to avoid type i and type ii errors.resultsstudy groupsthe characteristics of the participants in the two groups are shown in .
