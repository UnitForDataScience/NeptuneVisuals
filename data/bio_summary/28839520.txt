A recent comparison of the genomes of several strains of S. mutans and S. sobrinus found S. sobrinus strains to contain more genes for possible aciduric and acidogenic properties than the S. mutans strains .

Clinical studies have linked S. mutans and S. sobrinus to both caries progression  and early childhood caries  and the concurrent appearance of S. mutans and S. sobrinus seem to be strongly associated with caries status .

The concentration of DNA pg DNAuL for Scardovia wiggsiae Streptococcus mutans total Lactobacillus and total bacteria in plaque and saliva samples from subjects with different levels of sugar intakecaries they have been observed more frequently in chil- dren with early childhood caries  and were found to be associated with white-spot lesions in children with low levels of S. mutans .

Recently it has been suggested that limiting the intake of free sugars to either 10 or even 5 of the total energy intake would lower the risk of dental caries .

Subjects were thereafter divided into a low- sugar group with 5 sugar intake in the diet and a reference group with daily sugar intake 5 of the total energy.The study was granted exemption from requiring ethics approval by the National Danish Ethics Committee H-1-2013-079.

The aim of this study was therefore to compare the oral microbial profiles in young healthy subjects with a habi- tual intake of free sugars below and above the recent World Health Organization WHO guidelines of either5 or 10 of the total energy consumption .Material and methodsStudy groupIn total 90 young adults of both sexes volunteered to participate after written and verbal information about the study.
