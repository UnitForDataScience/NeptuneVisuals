G. vaginalis was seen in 74 61.7 and A. vaginae in 37 30.8 of the biomass samples mounted onto slides .The presence of A. vaginae in the ring biomass eluate was associated mixed effects model- ling with the biomass density OD 0.18 95 CI 0.05-0.32 p  0.008 and showed a signifi- cant linear increase OD 0.03 95 CI 0.01-0.05 p  0.002 for each log10 increase in A. vaginae concentration.

Association of the vaginal microbial status with contraceptive vaginal ring biomass.Mixed effect regression analysis corrected for participant multiple observations random intercept.Visualisation of biomass on intravaginal ring surface by scanning electron microscopy at 23x magnification.Association of the vaginal microbiota compositions and the ring biomass densityMean ring biomass densities were compared among the three Gram stain Nugent score cate- gories for rings and Gram stain slides that were collected together from the same participant at the same study visit.

Of 415 rings worn by 120 Rwandese women for three weeks the biomass density was assessed with crystal violet and the bacterial composition of biomass eluates was assessed with quantitative polymer- ase chain reaction qPCR.

The potential development of bacterial biofilm on vaginal rings in vivo has yet to be explored in humans.We hypothesised that a biomass would develop on vaginal rings and that rings worn by women with BV-associated dysbiosis would have higher biomass density than rings worn by women with dysbiosis.

To investigate this hypothesis we studied the presence density and bacterial composition of the biomass on contraceptive vaginal rings and investigated the asso- ciation between ring biomass density and the vaginal microbiota.Methods and materialsThis is a laboratory sub-study of the Ring Plus contraceptive vaginal ring study performed at the Rinda Ubuzima RU research clinic in Kigali Rwanda ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01796613 .

This technique was performed as described previously using three probes the broad- range BacUni-1 probe detecting all bacteria and probes detecting two bacterial species strongly associated with BV AtoITM1 for A. vaginae and Gard162 for G. vaginalis  .The biomass on worn contraceptive rings was stained with crystal violet to determine the optical density OD as a proxy for the biomass quantity.

We used simple linear mixed effects regression analysis with a random intercept for participant due to repeated observations to evaluate associations between ring biomass density and ring biomass species presence and concentrations Nugent score categories and fluorescence microscopy results presence of G. vaginalis vaginal biofilm A. vaginae biofilm G. vaginalis in a dispersed form and A. vaginae in a dispersed form.ResultsThe mean age of the 120 randomised participants was 28.4 years 95 CI 25-32 with 61 of women being married and 57.5 having attained more than just primary school education.

The presence of G. vaginalis was not significantly associated with the ring biomass density OD 0.10 95 CI -0.03-0.23 p  0.132 but the mean ring biomass density increased for each log10 increase in G. vaginalis concentration OD 0.03 95 CI 0.01-0.05 p  0.013.

Mixed effect regression analysis showed that vaginal ring biomass in the BV Nugent score category OD 0.26 95 CI 0.11-0.31 and intermediate score category mean OD 0.09 95 CI -0.12-0.31 had a statistically significantly higher mean density Visualisation of biomass on intravaginal ring surface by scanning electron microscopy at A.

No signifi- cant associations between the presence of planktonicdispersed vaginal G. vaginalis and A. vaginae and ring biomass density were found.DiscussionThis laboratory sub-study of a vaginal contraceptive ring trial in African women showed that the formation of biomass on the vaginal rings that had been worn for three weeks was com- mon and present in varying densities.
