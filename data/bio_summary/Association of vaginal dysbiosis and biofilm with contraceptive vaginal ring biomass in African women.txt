all vaginal rings were covered with biomass mean optical density od of 3.36 standard deviation sd 0.64. lactobacilli were present on 93 of the rings gardnerella vaginalis on 57 and atopobium vaginae on 37. the ring biomass density was associated with the con- centration of a. vaginae od 0.03 95 confidence interval ci 0.01-0.05 for one log increase p  0.002 and of g. vaginalis od 0.03 95 ci 0.01-0.05 p  0.013. the den- sity also correlated with nugent score rings worn by women with a bv nugent score mean od 0.26 and intermediate score mean od 0.09 had a denser biomass compared to rings worn by participants with a normal score p  0.002. furthermore presence of vaginal biofilm containing g. vaginalis p  0.001 and a. vaginae p  0.005 correlated with a denser ring biomass mean od 0.24 and 0.22 respectively.

g. vaginalis was seen in 74 61.7 and a. vaginae in 37 30.8 of the biomass samples mounted onto slides .the presence of a. vaginae in the ring biomass eluate was associated mixed effects model- ling with the biomass density od 0.18 95 ci 0.05-0.32 p  0.008 and showed a signifi- cant linear increase od 0.03 95 ci 0.01-0.05 p  0.002 for each log10 increase in a. vaginae concentration.

the presence of g. vaginalis was not significantly associated with the ring biomass density od 0.10 95 ci -0.03-0.23 p  0.132 but the mean ring biomass density increased for each log10 increase in g. vaginalis concentration od 0.03 95 ci 0.01-0.05 p  0.013. for the lactobacillus genus neither the presence od -0.03 95 ci-0.28-0.22 p  0.816 nor the concentration od -0.00 95 ci -0.04-0.03 p  0.991 was sig- nificantly correlated with the ring biomass density .sem on a subset of 11 rings showed that all rings were covered with layers of vaginal epithe- lial cells and bacteria with diverse shapes and sizes adhered to these epithelial cells .

all seven rings categorised in the first phenotype had matching vaginal samples that were scored as nugent 0-3 n  6 or 4-6 n  1 while the three rings with phenotype 2 had matching vaginal samples scored as nugent 8-10. association of the vaginal microbial status with contraceptive vaginal ring biomass.mixed effect regression analysis corrected for participant multiple observations random intercept.visualisation of biomass on intravaginal ring surface by scanning electron microscopy at 23x magnification.association of the vaginal microbiota compositions and the ring biomass densitymean ring biomass densities were compared among the three gram stain nugent score cate- gories for rings and gram stain slides that were collected together from the same participant at the same study visit.

of 415 rings worn by 120 rwandese women for three weeks the biomass density was assessed with crystal violet and the bacterial composition of biomass eluates was assessed with quantitative polymer- ase chain reaction qpcr.

the potential development of bacterial biofilm on vaginal rings in vivo has yet to be explored in humans.we hypothesised that a biomass would develop on vaginal rings and that rings worn by women with bv-associated dysbiosis would have higher biomass density than rings worn by women with dysbiosis.

to investigate this hypothesis we studied the presence density and bacterial composition of the biomass on contraceptive vaginal rings and investigated the asso- ciation between ring biomass density and the vaginal microbiota.methods and materialsthis is a laboratory sub-study of the ring plus contraceptive vaginal ring study performed at the rinda ubuzima ru research clinic in kigali rwanda clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01796613 .

this technique was performed as described previously using three probes the broad- range bacuni-1 probe detecting all bacteria and probes detecting two bacterial species strongly associated with bv atoitm1 for a. vaginae and gard162 for g. vaginalis  .the biomass on worn contraceptive rings was stained with crystal violet to determine the optical density od as a proxy for the biomass quantity.

we used simple linear mixed effects regression analysis with a random intercept for participant due to repeated observations to evaluate associations between ring biomass density and ring biomass species presence and concentrations nugent score categories and fluorescence microscopy results presence of g. vaginalis vaginal biofilm a. vaginae biofilm g. vaginalis in a dispersed form and a. vaginae in a dispersed form.resultsthe mean age of the 120 randomised participants was 28.4 years 95 ci 25-32 with 61 of women being married and 57.5 having attained more than just primary school education.

mixed effect regression analysis showed that vaginal ring biomass in the bv nugent score category od 0.26 95 ci 0.11-0.31 and intermediate score category mean od 0.09 95 ci -0.12-0.31 had a statistically significantly higher mean density visualisation of biomass on intravaginal ring surface by scanning electron microscopy at a.

no signifi- cant associations between the presence of planktonicdispersed vaginal g. vaginalis and a. vaginae and ring biomass density were found.discussionthis laboratory sub-study of a vaginal contraceptive ring trial in african women showed that the formation of biomass on the vaginal rings that had been worn for three weeks was com- mon and present in varying densities.

the concentrations of these two bacteria in ring eluates were positively associated with ring biomass density indicating that a denser biomass likely consists of higher numbers of the bac- teria.

the nuvaring is composed of a thermoplastic ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer material but it is unclear if bv-associated bacteria would behave similarly to gonococci in vitro and if in vitro data accu- rately predict what would happen in vivo.in summary our study showed that biomass easily forms on the contraceptive vaginal ring within three weeks and that bv-associated bacteria are commonly present in this biomass.our study also showed associations between the presence of vaginal dysbiosis and vaginal bio- film and the ring biomass density.
