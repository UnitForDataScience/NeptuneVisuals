Specifically prior to low-dose DSS exposure we colonized germ-free mice with either i H. bilis plus all eight ASF members ii H. bilis plus the ASF with- out 356 the major immune-dominant member iii H. bilis plus the ASF without 356 and 361 the two most immune-dominant members and iv H. bilis plus the ASF without 457 an ASF member that is not immune targeted.

EF IL-17A secretion from CD4 T cells isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of either H. bilis mono-associated mice E or ASF-bearing mice colonized with H. bilis F and stimulated with whole-cell sonicate antigens from each of the individual ASF members or H. bilis n  4-5 pools of 2-3 animals per pool per treatment.Pairwise comparisons in E and F were performed with respect to unstimulated cells.

Experiments were performed usingmale and female C3HHeN mice at 8-10 wks of age mice were colonized with H. bilis for 3 wks.Production of TNF-a and IL-22 was elevated in H. bilis-ASF versus H. bilis mono-associated mice but DSS treatment did not further increase the secretion of either cytokine Fig.

E Histopathological disease scores for cecal tissues from germ-free GF ASF-bearing H. bilis mono-associated and H. bilis colonized ASF-bearing mice either treated with 1.5 DSS or left untreated.

Thus even though H. bilis by itself induces moderate disease following a low-dose of DSS the pres- ence of the ASF community is necessary for severe disease indicating that the resident microbiota exacerbates pathobiont-mediated inflammation.The pathobiont and resident microbiota synergistically induce a pro-inflammatory response associated with disease.

By using the defined ASF community in both wild-type and Rag1-- mice we systematically identified i the relative contribution of the pathobiont and the microbiota to disease severity ii to what degree disease was associated with changes in the microbial commu- nity composition iii the role of the adaptive immune system in disease iv the specific microbes towards which immune responses were directed and v the contributions of immune-targeted taxa to the disease process.ResultsPathobiont colonization can induce an equivalent degree of disease in mice with a conven- tional or defined microbiota.

Cytokine production was considered specific to a certain ASF member if there were significant increases over i unstimulated T cells isolated from the same mice ii antigen-stimulated T cells harvested from equivalently-treated mice not harboring the ASF community and iii antigen-stimulated T cells from ASF-bearing mice treated with DSS but not colonized with H. bilis.CD4 T cells isolated from severely diseased H. bilis-ASF-DSS mice produced significantly elevated lev-els of IL-17A when stimulated with antigens from either ASF 356 ASF 361 and to a lesser extent ASF 502 as compared to H. bilis mono-associated-DSS mice Fig.

AB IL-17A secretion from CD4 T cells isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of germ-free GF ASF-bearing H. bilis mono-associated and H. bilis colonized ASF bearing mice treated with 1.5 DSS or left untreated.

These features differentiate the pathobiont characteristics of H. bilis from other pathobionts such as the Adherent and Invasive Escherichia coli strain LF82 AIEC LF82 which elicits chronic colitis and brings about changes in microbiota composition after disruption of innate immune signaling.Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the severe intestinal inflammation observed in ASF mice colo-nized with H. bilis and exposed to low-dose DSS is the requirement for a microbiota.
