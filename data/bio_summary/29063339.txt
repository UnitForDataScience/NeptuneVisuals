Quantitative analysis for the content of P. gingivalis T. forsythia A. ctinomycetem- comitans T. denticola P. intermedia F. nucleatumperiodonticum and P. endodontalis in the dental plaque was performed with a Dentoscreen kit.

p0.05 in comparison with periodontitis patients.incidence of these periodontal pathogens was highest during periodontitis complicated by DM2.Detailed comparative quantitative analysis of peri- odontopathogenic microorganisms as differentiated from the partial method in clinical dental practice allowed us to evaluate a wide range of differences between patients and healthy volunteers.For example the development of periodontitis in DM2 patients was accompanied by a significant increase in the content of P. gingivalis T. forsythia and T. denticola in gingival sulcus fluid.

The introduction of new molecu- lar biological technologies with PCR diagnostics and high-performance sequencing in laboratory practice allowed us to identify other microorganisms which are not cultured and cannot be revealed in bacterio- logical studies 4.Our results indicate that the most pathogenic spe- cies of P. gingivalis which belongs to the first-order periodontal pathogens plays an important role in the etiology of periodontitis in DM2 patients 2.

682-686 June 2017 Original article submitted April 20 2017Biofilm of the gingival sulcus from 22 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and periodontitis 30 patients with periodontitis not complicated by diabetes mellitus reference group and 22 healthy volunteers without signs of gingival disease control group was studied by quantita- tive PCR.

The duration of DM2 was 3-23 years less than 10 years in 44 patients more than 20 years in 17 patients.
