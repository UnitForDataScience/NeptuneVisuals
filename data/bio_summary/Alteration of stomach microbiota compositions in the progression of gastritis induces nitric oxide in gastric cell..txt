Atrophic gastritis is considered to be an antecedent to intestinal meta- plasia and gastric cancer 1011 thus exploring the bacterialfactors that propel the progress of atrophic gastritis may be helpful for elucidating the mechanisms underlying gastric cancer development.In previous studies infection with H. pylori was reported to closely correlate with the other bacteria present in stomach 12 and clinical observations have found that atro- phic gastritis without H. pylori is more likely to develop into gastric cancer than cases with H. pylori an observation that has been supported by animal studies.

To explore the role of the bacteria absence of H. pylori in gastric carci- nogenesis in the current study we compared the microbiota of clinically collected H. pylori-free gastric fluids from 30 patients with non-atrophic gastritis N and 22 patients with severe atrophic gastritis S. We estimated the bacterial loads in the N and S groups by colony counting in culture agar as well as by measuring the concentration of the extracted DNA.

The results showed a significant increase in bacterial load in patients with atrophic gastritis in comparison to non-atrophic gastritis.

Gastric cancer develops from a multifactorial multistep inflammatory process progressing through the stages of superficial gastritis atrophic gastritis intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia before the development of gastric cancer 7.

Thus the absence of H. pylori in atrophic gastritis may play a crucial role in gastric carcinogenesis thus the alterations in the composition of gastric microbiota and its interaction with host cells require further studies.However there has been little study on the characterization of the absence of H. pylori in the progress of gastritis.

In the current study we investigated the variation in gastric micro- biota using gastric fluids from 30 patients with non-atrophic gastritis N and 22 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis S. Our results suggest that the microbiota in gastric fluids might influence gastric epithelial cell physiology and gastric carcinogenesis.Materials and methodsPatient samples collection and cell culture.

Gastric fluids newly extracted from 30 non-atrophic gastritis and 22 atro- phic gastritis patients by endoscopy were obtained from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Jinan China.

Compared with non-chronic gastritis the bacterial load in chronic atrophic gastritis was significantly increased suggesting that there was an association between the amount of bacteria and the severity of the gastritis.Diversity of gastric microbiota.
