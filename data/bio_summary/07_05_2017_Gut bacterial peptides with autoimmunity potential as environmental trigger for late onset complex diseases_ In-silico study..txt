Peptides having homologous regions of  enrichment9 aa were included in the study.All the gut bacterial proteins as well as human proteins corresponding to homologous pep- tides were subjected to various characterization in order to further understand their biological relevance to disease etiology.Bacterial characterizationBacterial proteins were studied for their antigenic potential and for location of peptides in bacte- rial cell.

15576 candidate peptides unique candidate pep-tides  2295 from 396 unique bacterial species were found to have peptide homology with 689 unique human proteins candidate human proteins.

The most common gene binding to common HLA-II alleles is aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member B1 produced by many E. coli strains.This gene encodes isozyme of aldehyde dehydrogenases and may detoxify aldehydes generated Human candidate proteins and their significant association with different KEGG pathways.Human candidate proteins are human proteins having peptide homology to respective bacterial peptides.by alcohol metabolism and lipid peroxidation.

P-value and 95 CI for a significant difference was calculated using pearson's correlation using SISA statistical tool .Human protein characterizationThe human proteins corresponding to candidate peptides candidate human proteins were characterized using systems biology approach to know which biological process KEGG path- way and tissue may be affected and the type of diseases associated with raising of antibody to the candidate peptide.Disease association.

Total 670 and 470 candidate human proteins were annotated by biological processes and KEGG pathways respectively.Clustered heatmap of human candidate proteins associated with late onset complex diseases and their binding affinity threshold with common HLA class II alleles.

Of the 14 extracellular peptides 6 peptides have binding affinity with HLA class II alleles and Tables.Human candidate protein characterizationCandidate human proteins are human proteins having peptide homology to respective bacte- rial peptides.Human disease targets.

24 gut bacterial pep- tides with homology to four human peptides from proteins like Low molecular weight phospho- tyrosine protein phosphatase Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 3 member B1 Maleylacetoacetate isomerase and Uracil-DNA glycosylase were found to have binding affinity with either of the ten common HLA-II alleles  namely HLA-DRB10101 HLA-DRB10301 HLA-DRB10401 HLA-DRB10405 HLA-DRB10701 HLA-DRB10802 HLA-DRB11101 HLA-DRB11302 HLA-DRB11501 and HLA-DRB50101 .Bacterial candidates characterizationPredominant gut bacterial phyla.

The candidate human proteins were found to be significantly associated with common complex human diseases.

Out of 689 unique candidate human proteins a total of 667 pro- teins were classified for specific expression in human tissues.

Some interesting observations on correlation of human proteins corre- sponding to candidate peptides with human diseases and tissues are observed and presented here.
