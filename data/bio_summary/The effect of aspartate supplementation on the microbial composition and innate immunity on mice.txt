Mice in controlgroup received basal diet while mice in 0.5 Asp group received basal diet  0.5 Asp mice in 1.0 Asp group received basal diet  1.0 Asp mice in 2.0 Asp group received basal diet  2.0 Asp.

Mice in control group received basal diet while mice in 0.5 Asp group received basal diet  0.5 Asp mice in 1.0 Asp group received basal diet  1.0 Asp mice in 2.0 Asp group received basal diet  2.0 Aspcryptdins-1 Crp1 cryptdins-4 Crp4 cryptdins-5 Crp5 and lysozyme 2 Lzy2 in the ileum in this study.

Mice in the control group were fed with a basal diet mice of 0.5 Asp-supplemented group werefed with a basal diet supplemented with 0.5 aspartate 0.5 Asp  basal diet mice of 1.0 Asp-supplemented group were fed with a basal diet supplemented with 1.0 aspartate 1.0 Asp  basal diet mice of 2.0 Asp-sup- plemented group were fed with a basal diet supplemented with 2.0 aspartate 2.0 Asp  basal diet.

Dietary 0.5 Asp and 1.0 Asp supplementation lowers the ratio of FirmicutesBacteroidetes whereas the dietary 2.0 Asp increased the ratio of Firmicutes Bacteroidetes.Fig.

2 Asp supplementation affects intestinal innate immunity may through intestinal microbiota.

The interaction of intestinal microbiota and immune system keeps intestinal homeostasis when the intestinal dysbio- sis occurs the abnormal changes affect multiple signaling pathways and thus result in the secretion of pro-inflamma- tory cytokines Ren et al.

In addition dietary supplementation with 1.0 Asp and 2.0 Asp lowered the mRNA level ofFig.
