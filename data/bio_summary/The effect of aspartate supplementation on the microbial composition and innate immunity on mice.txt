in addition dietary with 2.0 aspartate supplementation increases the expres- sion of pigr and crp 1. this study is the first to investigate the effect of different doses of supplemental aspartate to the intestinal microbiota and intestinal immunity.

the results indicated that dietary 1.0 asp sup- plementation lowers the ratio of firmicutesbacteroidetes which affects the innate immunity by decreasing the gene expression of il-17 ifn-g and muc2 in ileum.keywords aspartate  intestinal microbiota  innate immunityabbreviationsinosinducible nitric oxide synthasetlrtoll-like receptor aspaspartateil-17interleukin-17ifn-ginterferon-gammapigrpolymeric immunoglobulin receptor muc2mucin-2muc4mucin-4 muc6mucin-6 crp1cryptdins-1 crp4cryptdins-4handling editors c.-a.a. hu y. yin y. hou g. wu y. teng.

although there is no significant difference between control group and 0.5 asp-supplemented group a tendency shows that 0.5 aspartate supplementation decreases the gene expression ifn-g. our result suggests that dietary with 0.5 and 1.0 supplementation of aspartate inhibits the expression of muc2 and thus keeps the balance of mucus barriers.iga is the predominant immunoglobulin class in mucosal secretions and pigr plays crucial role in the trans- portation of iga peters et al.

the interaction of intestinal microbiota and immune system keeps intestinal homeostasis when the intestinal dysbio- sis occurs the abnormal changes affect multiple signaling pathways and thus result in the secretion of pro-inflamma- tory cytokines ren et al.
