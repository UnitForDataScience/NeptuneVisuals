incubation of two human leukaemic cell lines hl-60 and u937 in the presence of trichostatin a and doxorubicin revealed a similar association between cell prolifera- tion and induction of ffar2 expression supplementary figure s3 allowing to extend the relevance of our finding beyond one mouse cell line.we then sought to explore the impact of a modulation of ffar2 expression on cancer cell proliferation in vivo.

a relationship between cancer cell proliferation and expression of ffar2 has been recently reported loss of ffar2 expression fosters colon carcinogenesis whereas overexpression of ffar2 decreases cell proliferation however the mechanism of action offfar2 on cell growth remains unclear.

this study aims to test whether ffar2 expression per se also influences leukaemia cell growth in vivo.methods bcr-abl-expressing baf cells were used as a leukaemia model and the role of ffar2 was evaluated in balbc mice after lentiviral shrna transduction.results our data formally establish that reduced leukaemic cell proliferation is associated with increased ffar2 expression in vivoand in vitro.

going beyond association we point out that decreasing ffar2 expression fosters cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.conclusions our data demonstrate the role of ffar2 in the control of leukaemic cell proliferation in vivo and indicate that a modulation of ffar2 expression through nutritional tools or pharmacological agents may constitute an attractive therapeutic approach to tackle leukaemia progression in humans.short-chain fatty acids scfa such as acetate propionate and butyrate are microbial byproducts of fermentation that are involved in the gut microbiota-host crosstalk through several pathways free fatty acid receptor 2 ffar2 also known as gpr43 or ffa2 is a g-protein coupled receptor that binds propionate.

its activation reduces leukaemic cell proliferation in vitro  in a mouse model of leukaemia consisting in the transplantation of bcr- abl-transfected baf cells feeding inulin-type fructans itf a non-digestible fermentable fiber changing the gut microbiota leads to increased portal propionate levels and reduced hepatic leukaemic cell proliferation we and others have documented that beside the canonical histone deacetylase pathway the ffar2 pathway could also mediate theanti-proliferative effect of scfa such as propionate while overexpression of ffar2 induces apoptosis our data reveal that its knocking down increases the growth of leukaemic cells in vivo.

cell maintenance mtt thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide cell growth assays and counting of intact baf cells are described in u937 and hl-60 cells were maintained in rpmi medium 1640 or iscove's modified dulbecco's medium respectively each medium being supplemen- ted with 10 foetal bovine serum paa clone paa pasching austria and streptomycin 100 mg ml - 1 and penicillin 100 iu ml- 1 gibco inchinnan scotland.

indeed we found that ffar2 is 70-fold more expressed in baf cells than in the mouse liver baf cells 1.000-0.059 liver 0.015-0.003 n 3 and the administration of itf to healthy mice for 4 weeks did not influence hepatic ffar2 expression 1c.we further analysed this phenomenon in vitro in baf cells where propionate simultaneously reduced cell proliferation and increased ffar2 expression in a dose-dependent manner b. reduced cell proliferation and increased ffar2 expression were also observed when mimicking the action of propionate on ffar2 and histone deacetylases using cmtb a ffar2 synthetic agonist and trichostatin a an inhibitor of histone deacetylases thus both pathways could be involved in the modulation of ffar2 expression by propionate.

imatinib a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting bcr-abl  also reduced cell growth and increased ffar2 expression h expanding the concept of an association between cell proliferation and ffar2 expression beyond propionate-dependent pathways.

our data highlight that reduced cell proliferation is associated with increased ffar2 expression in vitro and in vivo and that modulation of ffar2 expression regulates leukaemic cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
