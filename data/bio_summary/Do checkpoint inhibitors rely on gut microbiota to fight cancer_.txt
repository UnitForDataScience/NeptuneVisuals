These checkpoints namely the cyto- toxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 CTLA-4 and the programmed T-cell death 1 receptor PD-1 possess an inhibitory effect on the T-cell function.12 Pharmacologic inhibition of CTLA-4 with ipilimumab and PD-1 with either pembrolizumab or nivolumab resulted in long-term sustained tumor responses.3-5 There is growing evidence of the role of gut microbiota in enhancing the immune T-cell responses and the effi- cacy of checkpoint inhibitors.67 Recent evidence showed that immune checkpoint inhibition is usually more effective in patients who have better endogenouspopulated with a microbial load of up to 1012 cells per gram in the colon which is usually acquired at birth and mature into an adult-like ecosystem by the age of 2-3.10 It mainly constitutes of Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes forming close to 90 of that ecosystem followed by other phylum members of Cyanobacteria Fusobacteria Actinobacteria Verrumicrobioa and Proteobacteria.1011 A delicate balance exists between the gut microbiota and the host immune responses which can be disrupted if commensal flora is altered.12 Restoring this balance by modifying the gut microbiota has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach in several immune-related conditions such as inflamma- tory bowel diseases and asthma.13 Recent animal data showed that restoring a healthy gut microbiota mayanti-tumor immunity prior to therapy which in turn promotes pre-existing immunity rather than inducing de novo responses.89 However only a fraction of patients respond to this therapy and yet a tool to pre- dict response is needed.

Iida et al.22 found that in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to CpG-oligonucleotide immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy resulting in lower cytokine production reduced production of reactive oxygen spe- cies ROS cytotoxicity and lower DNA damage and apoptosis.22 These data confirm the importance of gut microbiota in enhancing the efficacy of anti-cancer ther- apy.2223 There is a growing interest in the role of gut microbiota in influencing the responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors.Microbiota and immune checkpoint inhibitorsSivan et al.7 and Vetizou et al.6 revealed that the gut microbiota may enhance the antitumor immune responses to checkpoints inhibitors resulting in tumor regressions and in patients who were treated with anti- biotics or germ-free immune checkpoint inhibitors lost their therapeutic efficacy.67Sivan et al.

Metagenomic ana- lysis and microbial 16S rDNA gene-sequencing showed that patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a significantly different gut microbiota compared to healthy individuals that results in a dysregulated effec- tor T lymphocyte-responses.14 A dysbiotic intestinal microbiota was also seen in and believed to promote colorectal cancer in experimental models.15Gut microbiota has an immunostimulatory effects by recruiting immune cells to the mucosa promoting maturation of organized gut-associated lymphoid tis- sues and stimulating protective epithelial cell func- tions.1617 It is hypothesized that each individual member of the gut microbiota may have different con- tributions to immune response and modulation via sev- eral mechanisms.1218 They affect the function of various immune cells including IgA plasma cells macrophages T-helper Th 17 cells regulatory T cells natural killer NK cells gdT cells dendritic cells DCs and innate lymphoid cells ILCs.19Microbiota and anticancer therapyGut microbiota has an established role in activating immune responses to anti-cancer treatments.

Among mice gut microbiota Bifidobacterium spe- cies was associated with antitumor T-cell responses which was hypothesized to represent the majority of beneficial antitumor interactions of the host immune system.2425 Oral administration of JAX fecal material or Bifidobacterium to TAC mice with established tumors enhanced spontaneous antitumor immunity and response to aPD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy.7 Vetizou et al.6 revealed that the gut microbiotais crucial for the antitumor effects of CTLA-4 inhibi- tor in Ret melanoma and MC38 colon cancer models.

Mice trans- planted with feces from specific cluster of patients cluster c with abundance of Bacteroides species specif- ically B. thetaiotaomicron and B. fragilis had a marked response to the CTLA-4 inhibitor with a decrease in tumor size.6 Of particular interest ipilimumab used in patients with metastatic melanoma was found to modify the gut microbiota with abundance of immuno- genic Bacteroides species improving its anticancer efficacy.From those two available studies collectively it seems that gut microbiota plays some role in enhancing immune response to both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1 inhibitor.

Therefore the widespread use of antibiotic amongst cancer patients will have a detrimental effect on the gut microbiota as antibiotics have a potent effect on gut bacterial composition and its functional cap- acity.29 In experimental studies germ-free mice and mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics had increased progression of tumor and decreased che- motherapy-related response in contrast to their counterparts.672022Response prediction to immune checkpoint inhibitorsGiven the knowledge we gained at bedside from the serious adverse events that may result from immune checkpoint inhibitors developing a tool to predict response and better select patients is an emerging man- date.

One area that may intersect with checkpoint blockade which is modifiable and could predict immune response is the gut microbiome.Gut microbiota is the collection of bacteria residing in the human gastrointestinal tract.

It exhibits a mutualistic relationship as both the microbes and their host depend on each other for optimal survival and to sustain many basic physiologic and metabolic functions and proper immune functions and protec- tion.12 Microbiota is also known to direct the develop- ment of host immune cells affecting both innate and adaptive immunity.Moreover gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis where its disruption has bad consequences on the host.
