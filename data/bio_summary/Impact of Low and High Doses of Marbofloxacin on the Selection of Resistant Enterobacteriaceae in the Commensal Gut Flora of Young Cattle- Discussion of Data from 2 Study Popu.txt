A fivefold decrease of marbofloxacin regimen did not affect the selection of resistances among commensal bacteria.Keywords fluoroquinolone cattle antimicrobial resistance Enterobacteriaceae decreased doseIntroductionelection of resistant pathogenic and commensal bacteria secondary to veterinary antimicrobial use and transfer via the food chain or the environment of resistance genes between animals exposed to antibiotics and humans represent a potential hazard for human health Singer et al.

Total count of Ciprofloxacin- resistant Enterobacteriaceae slightly increased by one log10 between D0 and D5 in both treatment groups.One study reported that a threefold increase in fluoro- quinolone dose did not lead to measurable differences in the probability of selection of resistant bacteria in the human gut flora Fantin et al.

Three control strains were used to check media reliability a susceptible E. coli-ATCC-25922 a DS E. coli-K12 resistant to nalidixic acid but susceptible to ciprofloxacin and an E. coli-4S1F4 ciprofloxacin resistant.Statistical analysisAnalyses of counts of total and resistant Enterobacteriaceae were performed after log10 transformation by using the mixed procedure with repeated measures of SAS with group time time by group as fixed effects and subject and herd as randomeffect.

As an example the annual monitoring of resistance to antimicrobials in veteri- nary medicine conducted in France by the National Food Safety Agency highlights that for third-generation cephalo- sporins the resistance level of Escherichia coli from diges- tive tract is fivefold higher in young compared with adult cattle Anses 2014.The aim of our study was to assess the impact of two doses of marbofloxacin administered on young bulls YBs and veal calves VCs on the total population of Enterobacteriaceae in gut flora and on the emergence of resistant Enterobac- teriaceae.Materials and MethodsExperiment 1 on YBsAnimals and antimicrobial treatments.

To select strains with decreased susceptibility DS-Enterobacteriaceae to marbo- floxacin with an minimum inhibitory concentration MIC comprising between 0.12 and 4 lgmL or resistant R- Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC 4 lgmL fecal sam- ples were also plated on MacConkey agar containing 0.12 or 4 lgmL of marbofloxacin respectively based on the marbo- floxacin MIC distribution already reported Meunier et al.

Several studies have already reported that pre-weaned calves harbored multiple resistant E. coli in gut flora Hoyle et al.

Several factors such as housing weaning and use of dis- carded milk containing antimicrobial residues for calves' feeding influence the presence of resistant gut flora bacteria Langford et al.

Indeed previous studies reported the coselection of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes with b- Lactams use leading to a decrease in susceptibility of E. coli but not clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones Nordmann and Poirel 2005 Vien et al.

In the next few hours calves from the group LOW n  16 were administered a single intramuscular injection of 2 mgkg marbofloxacin and calves from the group HIGH n  12 were administered a single intramuscular injection of 10 mgkg marbofloxacin.
