This implies a reduction of the number of strains possessing multiple virulence genes or virulence genes in general rather than correlation to the total number of enterococci as in milk samples the lowest CFU count and the highest number of virulence determinants was noticed.Although enterococci can induce haemolytic reac- tion none of the 35 tested strains in this study were found to cause haemolysis.Food that is not heat treated before consumption e.g.

The tetM gene is the most frequently detected in tetracycline--resistant enterococci worldwide and it is known to be mainly based on the transfer of Tn916-type transposons 55.ConclusionOur study confirmed the presence of enterococci as a major part of the indigenous core microbiota of Istrian cheese during fermentation and ripening with Enterococ- cus faecalis and E. faecium being the predominant species.

Despite the low and variable presence of enterococci in milk 3.65-2.93 log CFUmL highly comparable enterococcal populations were established after 30 days of cheese ripening 7.96-0.80 log CFUg confirming Enterococcus spp.

As indigenous members of the GI tract enterococci can have beneficial effect on human health by balancing gut microbiota therefore they may also act as probiotic bacteria 1.Enterococcus spp.

Over the last three decades epidemiological data have noted the emergence of partic- ular ecotypes of enterococci as leading nosocomial patho- gens and they have arisen to become a major cause of hu- man diseases especially in immunocompromised patients 6.

Their plasmid and transposon-mediated resistance to tetracycline erythromycin chloramphenicol and glyco- peptides is considered particularly problematic since it leads to the increased number of infections related to the acquired antimicrobial resistance of enterococci 6.

As enterococci are usually present at fairly high levels in ready-to-eat cheese products 89 they may have significant influence on consumers' health and as such their safety aspect should be carefully evaluated.Istrian cheese is a hard type of artisan raw milk cheese that is manufactured at home on small scale on the whole Istrian peninsula without the addition of start- er cultures 10.

During the ripening of Istrian cheese the number of enterococci reached up to 108 per g when assessed by real-time PCR 11.

Due to the bivalent effect of enterococci on food and hu- man health there is a need for their detailed characteriza- tion not only at the species but also at the strain level.

Post hoc Tukey's honestly significant difference HSD test was used to as- certain whether there were significant differences between the results of samples from different stages of cheese ma- nufacturing and ripening.Results and DiscussionEnumeration and identification of enterococciDespite the available data in other countries studies on prevalence and safety issue of enterococci in spontane- ously fermented cheese in Croatia are limited.
