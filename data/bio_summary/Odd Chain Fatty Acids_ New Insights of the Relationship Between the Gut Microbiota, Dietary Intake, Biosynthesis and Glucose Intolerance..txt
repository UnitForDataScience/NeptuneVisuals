The experimental diets varied from the baseline diet by 82 to 152 for C150 78 to 123 for C170 increased in phytol by 42 in both diets and phytanic acid varied by 102 to 226 from the baseline diet.The participants had plasma collected after the baseline diet and again after the experimental diets the plasma fatty acid changes due to the experimental diet are shown below see 2.In the high dairy fat diet there was a 52 increase in C150 which caused a 22 increase in the plasma C150.

A homoscedastic t-test was used between two unrelated equal variance groups to identify any significanceinsignificance between them two groups a homosce- dastic t-test was used in the following studies phytol supplementation study controlled diet study stearic acid C180 infusion study and the 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 Hacl1 study.

The dietary combination of phytanic acid and the phytol had a direct inverse correlation with the changes in the plasma C170 as dietary phytanic acid and phytol increases the plasma C170 decreases proportionately which is reinforced by the results in the mouse phytol supplementation study and explains why the smallest difference between C170 in each diet is between diet groups one and two where there is actually the largest difference in C170 levels in plasma.

The correlations between circulating C170 and the dietary phytolphytanic acid in the diet are stronger than with the dietary contributions of C170 which suggests that C170 is not a direct ruminant-fat biomarker but actually a product of biosynthesis regulated by dietary substrate intake.In the human dairy fat supplementation study the plasma C150 level increased by 10 p 0031 as a result of a dietary 30 increase this directly concurs with the expected increase according to the ruminant-fat dose response study see 1.

The changes in pentadecanoic acid C150 and heptadecanoic acid C170 levels Mol from the end of the baseline diet to the end of the experimental diet represented as change in Mol.

As shown in Supplementary appendix 19 we investigated the diet composition of phytol and phytanic acid comparing these for each diet in the ruminant-fat dose response study in rats.

The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of LyonSud-Est according to the French 'Huriet-Serusclat' law and the Second Declaration of Helsinki study registration number NCT00905892 20th May 2009 v.Controlled diet study.

Comparison between the diet composition and the serum composition Mol of pentadecanoic acid C150 and heptadecanoic acid C170 in a dose response study in rats where five groups were subjected to isocaloric high-fat diets with increasing ruminant fat content from 0 to 117.

The pentadecanoic acid C150 and heptadecanoic acid C170 fatty acid levels Mol of the human plasma samples from the start of the intervention day  0 to the end of the intervention day  56 where the participants received a dairy fat supplementation of 760 kcalday for 56 days.

Investigations included an intestinal germ-free study and a C150C170 diet dose response study.
