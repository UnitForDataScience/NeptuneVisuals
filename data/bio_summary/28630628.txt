the 30 isolates identified as s. saprophyticus on the five beaches were obtained in both periods 11 37 in december 2013 and 19 63 in march 2014. in recent years s. sapro- phyticus has been described in aquatic environments taken as polluted such as the marine environment in lebanon a high number vaginal 3anal 16woman27 41.5 1-4 perwomanand river flood in porto alegre brazil here we observed of s. saprophyticus isolates inleblon beach known to receive waters periodically from two fluvial channels carrying untreated domestic sewage.

these may indicate that nonhuman sources of s. saprophyticus colonization may include in addition to food contact with the marine environment an unexplored phenomenon.in a previous report we described the distribution of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pfge types in a population of 32 s. saprophyticus isolates from community-acquired uti in rio de janeiro from 2005 to 2006 clusters of isolates with indistinguishable pfge patterns were observed among unrelated individuals indicating possible point sources of this uropathogen.

mannitol salt agar inhibited gram-negative bacteria and novobiocin improved the chances to obtain s. saprophyticus from cheese and the genital-anal microbiota moreover the addition of sodium azide 2 in this medium was essential to isolate s. saprophyticus from beach waters.

the mphc gene had 99epidermidis gq900458.1.-positive s. saprophyticus with these criteria all 89 s. saprophyticus isolates would be classified as susceptible.

our strategy to type more than one colony per women to study the microbiota may be helpful for future epidemiological studies as we demonstrated that s. saprophyticus isolates from the same person are usually clonal.comparison of pfge profiles from different women figure showed that four of them shared profiles 90 similar and comparison with the previously detected clones revealed that each of two women had isolates 100 similar with uti type a and others with uti type e. this result indicates that s. saprophyticus clones can stay successfully established in the environment and among people uti and pregnant women's microbiota pfge typeswere obtained almost a decade apart.

the aim of this study was to characterize s. saprophyticus isolates from genitoanal microbiota of 621 pregnant women 10 minas cheese packs and five beaches in rio de janeiro city and compare pfge profiles of these isolates with five uti pfge clusters described in this city.

we investigated 65 s. saprophyticus isolates from microbiota 13 from minas cheese and 30 from beaches and 32 uti isolates.

isolates from pregnant women shared 100 similarity with uti pfge clustertypes a and e obtained almost 10 years previously suggesting temporal persistence of s. saprophyticus.
