These may indicate that nonhuman sources of S. saprophyticus colonization may include in addition to food contact with the marine environment an unexplored phenomenon.In a previous report we described the distribution of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis PFGE types in a population of 32 S. saprophyticus isolates from community-acquired UTI in Rio de Janeiro from 2005 to 2006 Clusters of isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns were observed among unrelated individuals indicating possible point sources of this uropathogen.

Mannitol Salt agar inhibited Gram-negative bacteria and novobiocin improved the chances to obtain S. saprophyticus from cheese and the genital-anal microbiota moreover the addition of sodium azide 2 in this medium was essential to isolate S. saprophyticus from beach waters.

The mphC gene had 99epidermidis GQ900458.1.-positive S. saprophyticus With these criteria all 89 S. saprophyticus isolates would be classified as susceptible.

Our strategy to type more than one colony per women to study the microbiota may be helpful for future epidemiological studies as we demonstrated that S. saprophyticus isolates from the same person are usually clonal.Comparison of PFGE profiles from different women Figure showed that four of them shared profiles 90 similar and comparison with the previously detected clones revealed that each of two women had isolates 100 similar with UTI type A and others with UTI type E. This result indicates that S. saprophyticus clones can stay successfully established in the environment and among people UTI and pregnant women's microbiota PFGE typeswere obtained almost a decade apart.

In recent years S. sapro- phyticus has been described in aquatic environments taken as polluted such as the marine environment in Lebanon a high number Vaginal 3Anal 16woman27 41.5 1-4 perwomanand river flood in Porto Alegre Brazil Here we observed of S. saprophyticus isolates inLeblon beach known to receive waters periodically from two fluvial channels carrying untreated domestic sewage.

Differences between categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square or Fisher'sTable 2 Distribution of Staphylococcus saprophyticus isolates obtained from pregnant women's microbiota beaches and minas cheese in Rio de Janeiro city.Number and  of S. saprophyticus isolates Microbiota 23 positive women11 17 1-5 perthose isolates and reflects the presence of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance circulating in the human microbiota.

It has been suggested that thedescribed in S. aureus NC007792.1 and S. haemolyticus NC007170.1.

Both msrA and msrB genes shared 99 of nucleotide identity with S. aureus CP002141.1 and S. xylosus M81802.1 respectively.

The linA gene shared 100 and 99 identity with the genes already described in S. aureus EU350088.1 and S. haemolyticus M14039.1 respectively.-Lactam resistance was rarely supported by molecular mechanism Table Oxacillin resistance was confirmedgml confirmed in triplicate.On the other hand the suggested cefoxitin inhibition zone19 mm would fit since this mecA-positive isolate had a12 mm halo.Penicillin resistance by MIC correlated with the pres- ence of mecA gene in only three isolates Table .
