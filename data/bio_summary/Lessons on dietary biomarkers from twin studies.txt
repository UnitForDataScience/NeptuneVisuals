long-term dietary habits however tend to de- termine the composition of the gut microbiota with stud- ies showing that long-term dietary habits associated with the individual microbiome signature.

a recent study from our group identified four major food-liking patterns fruit and vegetables distinctive tastes sweet and high carbohydrate and meat accounting for 26  of the total variance with heritability estimates ranging from 36 to 58  indicating genetic factors influence food liking-disliking.besides estimating heritability of dietary assessmentusing mz twins discordant for dietary factornutrition status provides a naturally unique case-controlled experi- ment of assessing the links between diet and human biol- ogy.

dietary intakes in epidemiological settings are generally measured via self-reported dietary assessment methods that are subject to recall bias and measurement error.

dietary interventional studies however have shown that the effects of meat-based diets on the gut microbiome could be rapidly reversed by adopting a plant-based minimally processed diet.

also changes in diet are dependent on the individual gut microbiota com- position suggesting that not everyone reacts the same to the same dietary change.moreover the way in which individuals respond todietary interventions may be complicated by host genet- ics and so the twin model could be a valuable tool to study the association of the gut microbiome with nutri- tional phenotypes.

this brief review discusses the value of twin studies in nutrition research with a particular focus on metabolomics and the gut microbiome.

these in- clude i mz and dz twin pairs share 100  of their common environment ii twins are representative of the general population iii gene-environment interac- tions are minimal for the trait under study iv there is random assortment.twin studies have shown that the genetic make-up of individuals plays a significant role in a multitude of diet- ary phenotypes including energy macronutrient intakes dietary patterns and specific food groups as extensively reviewed.

due to their shared upbringing including shared fetal exposure matched genes and sex mz twins allow one to isolate the non-genetic contribution.diet is partially responsible for the dramatic rise in obesity and obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes however studies do not consistently support associations between dietary intakes and disease end- points.

metabolites have been proven to be of use in nutritional research and novel dietary biomarkers within the metabolome have been identified-.

studies from twinsuk have successfully iden- tified potential biomarkers of alcohol intake including lysophosphatidylcholines diethyl ether lipids diaclylpho- sphatidycholines and sphingolipids as well as biomarkers of self-reported dietary patterns food preference pat- terns and self-reported food intakes.taking advantage of the twin nature of the twinsuk data we first looked for association in the larger twin population excluding mz twins discordant for a nutrition- al intake.

then for each significant metabolite-dietary variable we run the same analysis on the discordant mz twin pairs to replicate results in this set.using a targeted metabolomics approach bioacrates platform 163 metabolites we identified forty-two diet- ary pattern-metabolite significant associations in 1003 female twins and successfully replicated eleven associa- tions in a subcohort of mz twin discordant for dietary intake between twenty-eight and forty discordant twins independent from the first analysis.
