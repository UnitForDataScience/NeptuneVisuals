Moreover since the individual's diet has a strong influence on the microbiome composition and the gut microbiome is modifiable 60  of microbiome diver- sity is due to the environment future studies should target the microbiome via dietary interventions.Metabolomics Gut microbiome Dietary biomarkers Twins'Twins history affords means of distinguishing between the effects of tendencies received at birth and those that were imposed by the circumstances of their after lives in other words between the effects of nature and of nurture'Galton 1875More than a century after Galton's observation twin studies remain an invaluable tool to determine the role of genes and environment on human development and behaviour.

Finally because the gut microbiome is modifiable 60  of microbiome diversity is due to the environment and since an individual's diet has a strong influence on the microbiome composition future studies should targetthe microbiome via dietary interventions.Financial SupportTwinsUK was funded by the Wellcome Trust European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 2007-2013.

Also changes in diet are dependent on the individual gut microbiota com- position suggesting that not everyone reacts the same to the same dietary change.Moreover the way in which individuals respond todietary interventions may be complicated by host genet- ics and so the twin model could be a valuable tool to study the association of the gut microbiome with nutri- tional phenotypes.

Long-term dietary habits however tend to de- termine the composition of the gut microbiota with stud- ies showing that long-term dietary habits associated with the individual microbiome signature.

This brief review discusses the value of twin studies in nutrition research with a particular focus on metabolomics and the gut microbiome.

In general therefore a more diverse gut microbiome signals a healthier state and this is modified by age diet and use of medication.ConclusionsIn conclusion twin research is an invaluable tool to un- tangle gene-environment effects on complex phenotypesscore.

Studies from TwinsUK have successfully iden- tified potential biomarkers of alcohol intake including lysophosphatidylcholines diethyl ether lipids diaclylpho- sphatidycholines and sphingolipids as well as biomarkers of self-reported dietary patterns food preference pat- terns and self-reported food intakes.Taking advantage of the twin nature of the TwinsUK data we first looked for association in the larger twin population excluding MZ twins discordant for a nutrition- al intake.

Then for each significant metabolite-dietary variable we run the same analysis on the discordant MZ twin pairs to replicate results in this set.Using a targeted metabolomics approach Bioacrates platform 163 metabolites we identified forty-two diet- ary pattern-metabolite significant associations in 1003 female twins and successfully replicated eleven associa- tions in a subcohort of MZ twin discordant for dietary intake between twenty-eight and forty discordant twins independent from the first analysis.

The a diversity refers to the number of different species at a particular site while b diversity considers how many taxa are shared between populations acting as a similarityleanness in human subjects and prevents weight gain under high-fat diet in mice.Using discordant twins we have also successfully iden- tified a striking negative association between frailty due to ageing and gut microbiota diversity as well as a significant alteration in the gut microbiota in proton pump inhibitors users.
