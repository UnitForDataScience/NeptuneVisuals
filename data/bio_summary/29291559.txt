the bacterial diversi- ty of the water samples collected during the dry season was higher than that in those collected during the wet season.for water samples the highest bacterial species richness was ob- served in the raw-water samples from both seasons.

the bac biofilm samples mainly comprised proteobacteria firmicutes and planctomycetes  b. proteobacteria was the largest bacterial group in gac samples wf0 wf30 df0 and df30 whereas phylum planctomycetes showed the highest relative abundance in sand samples collected during both sea- sons.

the largest change observed in the water samples was in the proportion of firmicutes which showed lower levels in raw-water samples from the wet and dry seasons 1.7 and 2.5 respectively but was highly abundant in finished-water samples from the wet and dry seasons 44.9 and 44.0 respectively.

in the biofilm samples citrobacter rhodoplanes pseudomonas and acinetobacter were the major genus groups in all gac samples which was consistent with the dominant bacterial groups observed in finished water.

3. relative abundances of bacterial community composition phylum level detected in a dwtp bulk water samples b bac biofilm samples.

the relative abun- dance of nitrospirae and planctomycetes in sand samples was higher than that in gac samples which was supported by variations in nutrient and do levels associated with the bacterial composition in the drinking water biofilters .

furthermore we observed that the structure of bacterial communi- ties in surface gac biofilms and sand samples was relatively insensitive to seasonal variation at the phylum level however the bacterial community structure in the lower layer of gac showed significant variations with the seasons.

therefore additional studies are necessary to validate the effect of disin- fection including disinfectant and dosage on firmicutes content in dwtp bacterial communities.our analysis also revealed distinct differences in bacterial composi-tion between biofilm and water samples although both were dominated by proteobacteria .

the im- portant findings were as follows 1 bacterial diversity and activity in drinking water during the dry season was higher as compared with that during the wet season 2 the treatment process specifically chlori- nation had a profound influence on microbial community composition3 the microbial communities present in finished water exhibited high levels of stability and the microbial communities present in finished water were likely determined by the bacterial communities present in the biofilter 4 the concentration of ammonia and codmn were impor- tant factors resulting in differences in bacterial communities 5 a sub- stantial core microbiome persisted throughout the treatment process and 6 opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas acinetobacter citrobacter mycobacterium salmonella staphylococcus legionella strep- tococcus and enterococcus were all recovered in finished water by illumina sequencing analysis.
