Previous studies investigating the effect of host genetics have tended to focus on varieties of a single given host species such as barley  maize or agave  or on a few distinct species el In these studies species effects tended to be nonsignificant  or small By comparison we found that host species was highly significant and explained  19.4 and 23.4 of variance within the rhizosphere and root endosphere.

The specieseffect size observed in our study as compared with the relatively low values observed in previous studies suggests that the influence of host species on the root microbiome should be considered in the context of the working phylogenetic framework and a broader array of considered species will accord- ingly produce a greater host effect.

As these root phenotypes are under genetic control of their hosts genetically similar hosts might be expected to harbor comparable microbiome profiles  Indeed host phylogenetic relationships were recently shown to be correlated with microbiome dissimilarity in the rhizosphere and among accessions of a single species similar hosts had more comparable microbiota in rhizosphere and roots  3 However the relative strength of this correlation within roots and rhizo- spheres have yet to be compared within a phylo- genetically diverse host framework.

Taken together the above analyses suggest that neither decreases in the abundances of other taxa nor sporulation are likely to be the only factors responsible for enrichment of Actinobacteria under drought in roots observed here although further experimental evidence is needed to test how universal these patterns are.Phylogenetic distance between host species is correlated with root endosphere community distance We next used the data set to test our hypotheses that host phylogenetic distance is positively correlated with microbiome community distance inside the plant root and that drought strengthens this correla- tion.

First the taxa commonly observed in each individual host species was determined by retaining only those OTUs that were present in at least 30 of samples and which represent at least 0.01 of read count abundancefor root samples for that host.

To account for this factor plant roots were harvested to a consistent rooting depth 25 cm for all species athough it is possible that root morphology or other species-specific root character- istics that do not necessarily correlate with host phylogenetic relatedness may represent compound- ing factors in our analysis of the host effect.Actinobacteria enrichment under droughtTo our knowledge this represents the first major investigation of the role of drought in determining root endosphere microbiome composition.

We hypothesize that a positive correlation between host phylogenetic and microbiome dis- tance exists and will be strongest inside the root where plants have greater influence over bacterial interactions and recruitment furthermore we hypothesize that drought will strengthen this correlation because the metabolic and phenotypic factors driving host-specific differences in bacterial recruitment are at least in part adaptive traits to differing water availability in each host's native environment.To test these hypotheses we analyzed bacterial community composition in root endosphere and rhizosphere for 18 grass species in the Poaceae clade grown in the field under drought conditions.

To do so we first determined plant host distances through sequencing three chloroplast genes matKtrnK rbcL and ndhF for each host species and performing phylogenetic analysis on the concatenated sequences 4a.
