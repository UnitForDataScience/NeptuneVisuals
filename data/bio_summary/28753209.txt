previous studies investigating the effect of host genetics have tended to focus on varieties of a single given host species such as barley  maize or agave  or on a few distinct species el in these studies species effects tended to be nonsignificant  or small by comparison we found that host species was highly significant and explained  19.4 and 23.4 of variance within the rhizosphere and root endosphere.

we hypothesize that the plant root microbiome will exhibit significant shifts during drought including an increase in actinobacteria and that these changes will be at least in part host specific as a result of differing drought response mechanisms.while the effect of drought on the root micro- biome remains largely unexplored more effort has been made to understand the role of plant host genotype in shaping root-associated bacterial com- munities  5 5. different host species not only have unique exudation patterns but also root architecture lifespan and rooting depth all of which have been shown to influence microbiome structure     .

the specieseffect size observed in our study as compared with the relatively low values observed in previous studies suggests that the influence of host species on the root microbiome should be considered in the context of the working phylogenetic framework and a broader array of considered species will accord- ingly produce a greater host effect.

as these root phenotypes are under genetic control of their hosts genetically similar hosts might be expected to harbor comparable microbiome profiles  indeed host phylogenetic relationships were recently shown to be correlated with microbiome dissimilarity in the rhizosphere and among accessions of a single species similar hosts had more comparable microbiota in rhizosphere and roots  3 however the relative strength of this correlation within roots and rhizo- spheres have yet to be compared within a phylo- genetically diverse host framework.

furthermore we show that this observed enrichment is the result of an absolute increase in actinobacterial abundance and that previously hypothesized mechanisms for observed enrichments in actinobacteria in drought-treated soils are unlikely to fully account for the phenomena observed here within the plant root.the isme journal 2017 11 2691-2704 published online 28 july 2017introductionfew environmental stresses are as omnipresent and devastating to agriculture as drought which annually results in billions of dollars in losses worldwide  while some crop responses to drought are conserved across most species including increased aba production and stomatal closure other adaptations are host-speci- fic such as special carbon uptake pathways increased cuticle thickness and altered root mor- phology as plants are intimately intertwined with the communities of microbes living in and around them perturbations in plant physiology and metabolism such as those resulting from drought response mechanisms can be expected to alter the composi- tion of the plant microbiome with potential con- sequences for host fitness  however little information is available on how drought influences the plant root microbiome andcorrespondence d coleman-derr plant gene expression center uc berkeley usda-ars 800 buchanan street albany ca 94710 usa.e-mail received 3 february 2017 revised 20 april 2017 accepted 7 june2017 published online 28 july 2017the degree to which such changes are conserved across different plant hosts.recent studies have noted enrichment of the bacterial taxa actinobacteria in drought-treated soils across a range of environments  and in drought-treated rhizo- spheres soils adhering to the root surface for several plant species  016. it has been suggested that this observed relative enrichment is due to differing life strategies of soil microorganisms specifically the spore-forming ability of actino- bacteria which allows them to enter a stable and quiescent state during periods of environmental stress would lead them to persist under drought conditions while less fit bacterial lineages decrease in abundance 16. whether actinobac- teria are also enriched within the plant root under drought and the degree to which such enrichment patterns are generalizable across a broad range of hosts and actinobacterial taxa remains unknown.

we hypothesize that a positive correlation between host phylogenetic and microbiome dis- tance exists and will be strongest inside the root where plants have greater influence over bacterial interactions and recruitment furthermore we hypothesize that drought will strengthen this correlation because the metabolic and phenotypic factors driving host-specific differences in bacterial recruitment are at least in part adaptive traits to differing water availability in each host's native environment.to test these hypotheses we analyzed bacterial community composition in root endosphere and rhizosphere for 18 grass species in the poaceae clade grown in the field under drought conditions.

taken together the above analyses suggest that neither decreases in the abundances of other taxa nor sporulation are likely to be the only factors responsible for enrichment of actinobacteria under drought in roots observed here although further experimental evidence is needed to test how universal these patterns are.phylogenetic distance between host species is correlated with root endosphere community distance we next used the data set to test our hypotheses that host phylogenetic distance is positively correlated with microbiome community distance inside the plant root and that drought strengthens this correla- tion.

to account for this factor plant roots were harvested to a consistent rooting depth 25 cm for all species athough it is possible that root morphology or other species-specific root character- istics that do not necessarily correlate with host phylogenetic relatedness may represent compound- ing factors in our analysis of the host effect.actinobacteria enrichment under droughtto our knowledge this represents the first major investigation of the role of drought in determining root endosphere microbiome composition.

the grasses we chose included agronomically valuable c3 crops with moderate to poor drought tolerance such as wheat and barley and also highly drought-tolerant c4 species such as sorghum our experimental design allowed us to investigate the effect of drought on the grass microbiome to observe whether such effects are unique or conserved across a broad range of hosts with differing drought tolerances and assess the degree of correlation between host phylogeny and the root microbiome under normal and drought conditions.materials and methodsexperimental designthe primary experimental field used in our study is an agricultural field site located in albany califor- nia 37.8864degn 122.2982degw characterized by a silty loam soil with low ph 5.2 supplementary table s1.

to do so we first determined plant host distances through sequencing three chloroplast genes matktrnk rbcl and ndhf for each host species and performing phylogenetic analysis on the concatenated sequences 4a.

first the taxa commonly observed in each individual host species was determined by retaining only those otus that were present in at least 30 of samples and which represent at least 0.01 of read count abundancefor root samples for that host.

however as field site and soil type can have a large effect on overallfigure 5 a heatmap displaying the percent of overlap between the taxa common to the root microbiome of each host with every other host lighter shades of blue represent less overlap while darker shades represent more.

we also observed that drought generally decreased the effect size and significance of the mantel's statistic most notably at the early time point contradicting our hypothesis that drought strengthens the correlation between host phylogeny and microbiome distance due to host species-specific drought response mechanisms.
