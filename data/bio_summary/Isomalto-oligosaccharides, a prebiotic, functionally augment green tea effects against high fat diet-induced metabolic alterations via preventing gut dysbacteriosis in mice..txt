Further expression of hepatic FASN ACC and ACOX-1 P  0.06 was down-regulated whereas PPAR- y and HSL P  0.09 was up-regulated upon HFD feeding Suppl.

P values which may approach to significant level are also presented in parenthesis.orally and blood glucose mgdL was determined at 15 30 60 120 min.After 12 weeks blood was collected retro-orbitally from fasted mice and mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation except the animals kept for histological examinations.
