statistical analysis using nonparamet- ric 't test' for all the analyzed samples or replicates with p  0.05 of the normalized metabolites intensity detected showed that out of 550 monoisotopic peaks 390 were affected by hfd feed- ing or supplementation of gte imos or their combination.

out of these 59 compounds were sorted out on the basis of their mass error 15 mda or intensity 1000 cps and a normal- ized z-score was plotted in form of heat map red high green low j. the extraction and found mass with peaks retention time msms fragmentation and p values are presented in sup- plementary table s5.
