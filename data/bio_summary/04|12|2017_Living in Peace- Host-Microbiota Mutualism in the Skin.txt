Indeed in mice tolerance to cutaneous microbes is enforced in part by the development and func- tion of commensal-specific Foxp3 Treg cells that migrate to the skin during the neonatal period when commensal colonizationmutualism is established .In the current issue of Cell Host  Microbe further explore the signals driving this influx of Treg cells to the skin in neonatal mice.

Importantly CCR6-deficient Treg cells failed to migrate efficiently to neonatal skin upon adoptive transferdemonstrating that induction of CCL20 linked to both hair follicle development and microbial colonization drives Treg cell influx into neonatal skin and helps establish hostmicrobe mutualism in this tissue.The association between tissue devel- opment microbial colonization and estab- lishment of hostmicrobiota mutualism in the skin raises a number of important ques- tions regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these processes.

However although essential for preventing development of inflammatory disease in the skin the role of this Treg migration axis in maintaining hostcommensal mutu- alism has not been addressed.It is also interesting to compare and contrast how tolerance to commensal or- ganisms is established during neonatal colonization of the skin versus gastroin- testinal tract where microbiota-specific Treg cells also help maintain immune homeostasis .

In this context anti-inflam- matory regulatory T cells Treg cells that express the transcription factor Foxp3 are abundant in the skin  .

The importance of Treg cells in modulating skin immunity is well established and dramatically exemplified by the severe inflammatory dermatitis that occurs in Foxp3-deficient mice and humans.

They find that Treg cell migration to the skin during the neonatal period is associated not only with colonization by microbes but also with the develop- mental process of hair follicle morpho- genesis.

Hair follicles themselves are a major site of commensal colonization and are prominent sites of Treg cell accu- mulation in the skin.

Accordingly inhibit- ing hair follicle development diminished Treg influx into the skin.

Mechanistically Treg cell influx was temporally associated with induction of a number of chemokines in the skin.
