Nevertheless since base- line levels of acetic acid in serum were not conse- quently reduced Additional file  Figure S14B this may also reflect a switch from production to utilisa- tion of acetic acid by the gut microbiota.Compared to wild-type mice statins did not result in large changes to the primary BA pool in the gut of Pxr-- mice and accordingly no differences in the relative levels of Cyp7a1 or Cyp27a1 transcripts were observed Fig.

Atorvastatin treatment also triggered a subtle increase in the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid and more remarkably its taurine derivative taurodeoxycholic acid suggesting a higher 7a-dehydroxylase activity in the statin-associated in- testinal microbiota.

By contrast no differ- ences were observed in the levels of b-muricholic acid o-muricholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid Fig.

Accordingly butyric acid was only de- tected in the serum of control mice whereas acetic acid concentration did not significantly differ in all tested groups Fig.

Since acetic acid stimulates the release of the hormone that regulates appetite  diminished production of acetic acid by the gut microbiota of atorvastatin-treated mice may explain the low food intake profile of this group.

Although T2DM has multifactorial aetiology recent association studies have highlighted the importance of perturbations in the gut microbiota as a T2DM- contributing factor 1- Thus T2DM patients present a characteristic gut microbial profile depleted in butyric acid-producing bacteria that may contribute to developing this condition  Butyric acid is a short-chain fatty acid SCFA that is derived from the fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates by sac- charolytic gut microbes.

Taxonomic profiles were normalised by the 16S rRNA gene copy number and the functional metagenome predicted using KEGG pathway reference profiles precomputed using UProC To study the effect of the statins on KEGG pathway composition the relative abundance of each KEGG family gene was normalised to a total number of 25000 genes.Statistical comparisons of the mean between groups were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference TukeyHSD or Dunnett's post hoc test considering a P value 0.05 as statistically significant.Bile acid and short-chain fatty acid profilingFor BA analysis samples 40 mg of caecal content were homogenised with acetonitrile using zirconiasilica beads 0.1 mm diameter.

HPLC was carried out with mobile phase A 0.1 formic acid in aqueous solu- tion and mobile phase B 0.1 formic acid in aceto- nitrile at a total flow rate of 0.5 mL min-1.
