recently experimental evidence as well as initial data in patients have shown that the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy including adoptive t cell transfer after total body irradiation immunostimulating oligonucleotides chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and platinum compounds as well as immune check- point inhibitors requires the presence of the intestinal microbiome and is affected by the microbial compos- ition 6 -the anti-cancer mechanisms of these therapies rely on the ability of the gut micro- biome to educate infiltrating immune cells that produce inflammatory mediators required for the direct antitu- mor effects of therapy and promote the generation of an anti-tumor adaptive immune response several microbial genera or species that promote or antagonize the effect of different types of cancer therapy or the anti-tumor host immune response have been identified.

flow cytometry and elemental mass spec- trometry and was initially developed to increase the number of cellular parameters that could be quantified simultaneously rather than coupling probes often antibodies to fluorophores mass cytometry ex- periments utilize probes chelated to unique stable heavy-metal isotopes such as the lanthanide series metal ions which bind targets of interest on andor within the cell enabling the attached metal ions to serve as re- porters for the expression level of up to 40 targets  efforts are currently ongoing to harmonize individual mass cytometers' performance to a common standard of signal intensities and detection limits mass cytom- etry has been recently used to dissect the human muco- sal immune system in health and disease allowing the identification of 142 immune subsets with tissue and disease specificity this technology is expected to impact immune monitoring strategies and to accelerate the development of individualized therapeutics.high-throughput proteome-based technologies antibodies detected in the serum of tumor patients can help to identify tumor-associated antigens taa as po- tential markers for early diagnosis of cancer for progno- sis for prediction of therapy response as well as for identification of therapeutic targets 0. to facilitate autoantibody discovery several different strategies have been developed to simultaneously identify multiple anti- bodies.

it has been proposed that hla-dr-cd33 cells be defined as 'early-stage' mdsc a study analyz- ing the efficacy of multi-peptide vaccination in patients with renal cell carcinoma rcc showed that two out of six phenotypically-defined mdsc populations were of prognos- tic value for overall patients' survival monocytes and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity intriguingly in a study of 29 patients with advanced cuta- neous melanoma treated with ipilimumab it was shown that ipilimumab can engage ex vivo cd16-expressing non-classical monocytes cd14cd16 resulting in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediated lysis oftreg .

patients responding to ipilimumab display sig- nificantly higher frequencies of non-classical monocytes at baseline compared with non-responder patients.the diagnostic potential of intermediate cd14cd16 monocytes has also been shown in patients with crc intermediate monocytes were significantly elevated in these patients with the highest frequencies detected in those with localized disease.

increases in both intra-tumoral and circulating cd14hla-drlowneg monocytes have been correlated with poor prognosis in rcc patients 0.tissue analysiswhile less invasive for patients in comparison to tissue biopsies the degree to which peripheral immune moni- toring is appropriate and useful in a given therapeutic context depends upon the treatment modality in ques- tion.

decalcification with edta results in better preservation of nucleic acids but is slower than other acid reagents the combination of neutral buffered saline fixation followed by edta decalcification is the current format preferred by most investigators as it provides adequate morph- ology preserves nucleic acids for molecular studies and antigens for ihc.microbiomethe analysis of the microbiome is not yet routinely part of the evaluation of immunity in cancer patients and in immunotherapy trials however emerging evi- dence of the important role of the microbiome in modulating anti-cancer immunity and the effectiveness of different types of cancer therapy suggests that this analysis could provide important information regarding the immune status of the patients and their ability to respond to therapy.

the study of the composition of the microbial com- munities in the stool or at other anatomical sites of cancer patients before and after therapy could provide information about the immune status of the patients and contribute to the identification of future bio- markers for prediction of disease progression and re- sponse to therapy.

of any grade these ae were reported in 3.8 5131 of patients treated with ipilimumab monotherapy at 3 mgkg in a phase iii trial kleiner and berman studied 5 patients in which a liver biopsy was taken to rule out drug-induced auto- immune hepatitis.the histologic changes observed with ipilimumab- related hepatitis were similar to those with acute viral and autoimmune hepatitis and it was not possible to make a definite diagnosis of a drug-induced hepatitis.

hepatic inflammation in the five patients reported re- solved with appropriate immuno-suppressive therapy and the authors suggest that patients who receive im- mune checkpoint inhibitor therapy should be monitored at regular intervals for biochemical and pathological evi- dence of hepatitis so that appropriate treatment can be promptly administered endoscopypatients undergoing immune checkpoint therapy could develop enterocolitis as an adverse event a com- mon side effect in such instances is diarrhea which war- rants endoscopic procedures such as upper endoscopy and colonoscopy.

increases in alc and eosinophil count after treat- ment with ipilimumab 3 mgkg both correlated with im- proved survival additionally among 27 patients treated with ipilimumab 10 mgkg changes in the num- ber of circulating t cells that expressed icos during the early treatment stages and a low ratio between absolute neutrophil count and alc were also associated with bet- ter survival this is consistent with other analyses of patients treated in the expanded access program where a high alc after two doses of ipilimumab or at 6 weeks was significantly associated with survival  the association of changes in alc with survival was also recently assessed among approximately 2000 pa- tients who had received ipilimumab at various doses as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen.

other activation markers such as cd39 ctla-4 lap garp pd-1 and pd-l1should be included in the monitoring of treg for can-cer patients as surrogate markers for treg function and potentially eliminating the need for treg isolation and in vitro suppression assays during the expansion phase that follows administration of blinatumomab a bispecific cd3 and cd19 antibody to patients with b cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia bone marrow-infiltrating t cells express a skewed t cell receptor tcr repertoire compared with peripheral blood t cells suggesting that clonal expansion occurred within the tme and might affect clinical out- come .

the frequency of cd14cd16 mono- cytes was negatively associated with tumor size and patho- logical stage in patients with breast cancer the expansion of intermediate monocytes could be driven by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mcp-1 which may be inhibited by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against mcp-1 to the monocyte cultures  finally vaccination of patients with stage iv melanoma using melan-amart-126-3527 l and gp100209-217210 mpeptides might augment the frequency of cd14cd16 monocytes as well as their expression of cd40cd86 co- stimulatory molecules and antigen-presenting function .

identifying appropriate controls for oncology patients may be challenging alternatively repeat samplings of the same patients can provide in- ternal controls particularly if specimens are collected both prior to and after a clinical intervention.sequencing and analysisgiven the potential sources of variation in microbiome studies standardization is crucial for study quality and reproducibility after collection and processing of specimens regions of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna geneare amplified and sequenced.
