Recently experimental evidence as well as initial data in patients have shown that the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy including adoptive T cell transfer after total body irradiation immunostimulating oligonucleotides chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and platinum compounds as well as immune check- point inhibitors requires the presence of the intestinal microbiome and is affected by the microbial compos- ition 6 -The anti-cancer mechanisms of these therapies rely on the ability of the gut micro- biome to educate infiltrating immune cells that produce inflammatory mediators required for the direct antitu- mor effects of therapy and promote the generation of an anti-tumor adaptive immune response Several microbial genera or species that promote or antagonize the effect of different types of cancer therapy or the anti-tumor host immune response have been identified.

Decalcification with EDTA results in better preservation of nucleic acids but is slower than other acid reagents The combination of neutral buffered saline fixation followed by EDTA decalcification is the current format preferred by most investigators as it provides adequate morph- ology preserves nucleic acids for molecular studies and antigens for IHC.MicrobiomeThe analysis of the microbiome is not yet routinely part of the evaluation of immunity in cancer patients and in immunotherapy trials however emerging evi- dence of the important role of the microbiome in modulating anti-cancer immunity and the effectiveness of different types of cancer therapy suggests that this analysis could provide important information regarding the immune status of the patients and their ability to respond to therapy.

Regulatory T cells Treg express CD4 and reportedly constitute 5-15 of infiltrating CD4 T cells in tumor samples The ra- tio of CD8 T cells to Treg in TIL has been correlated with aggressive growth and poor response to chemother- apy in several tumor types including urothelial carcin- oma of the bladder  serous ovarian cancer squamous cell carcinoma pancreatic cancer breast cancer and colorectal cancer and can separate cancer survivors from non-survivors In some tumor types Treg accumulation correlates with a better prognosis.

flow cytometry and elemental mass spec- trometry and was initially developed to increase the number of cellular parameters that could be quantified simultaneously Rather than coupling probes often antibodies to fluorophores mass cytometry ex- periments utilize probes chelated to unique stable heavy-metal isotopes such as the lanthanide series metal ions which bind targets of interest on andor within the cell enabling the attached metal ions to serve as re- porters for the expression level of up to 40 targets  Efforts are currently ongoing to harmonize individual mass cytometers' performance to a common standard of signal intensities and detection limits Mass cytom- etry has been recently used to dissect the human muco- sal immune system in health and disease allowing the identification of 142 immune subsets with tissue and disease specificity This technology is expected to impact immune monitoring strategies and to accelerate the development of individualized therapeutics.High-throughput proteome-based technologies Antibodies detected in the serum of tumor patients can help to identify tumor-associated antigens TAA as po- tential markers for early diagnosis of cancer for progno- sis for prediction of therapy response as well as for identification of therapeutic targets 0.

The study of the composition of the microbial com- munities in the stool or at other anatomical sites of cancer patients before and after therapy could provide information about the immune status of the patients and contribute to the identification of future bio- markers for prediction of disease progression and re- sponse to therapy.

It has been proposed that HLA-DR-CD33 cells be defined as 'early-stage' MDSC A study analyz- ing the efficacy of multi-peptide vaccination in patients with renal cell carcinoma RCC showed that two out of six phenotypically-defined MDSC populations were of prognos- tic value for overall patients' survival Monocytes and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity Intriguingly in a study of 29 patients with advanced cuta- neous melanoma treated with ipilimumab it was shown that ipilimumab can engage ex vivo CD16-expressing non-classical monocytes CD14CD16 resulting in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediated lysis ofTreg .

The frequency of CD14CD16 mono- cytes was negatively associated with tumor size and patho- logical stage in patients with breast cancer The expansion of intermediate monocytes could be driven by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 MCP-1 which may be inhibited by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against MCP-1 to the monocyte cultures  Finally vaccination of patients with stage IV melanoma using Melan-AMART-126-3527 L and gp100209-217210 Mpeptides might augment the frequency of CD14CD16 monocytes as well as their expression of CD40CD86 co- stimulatory molecules and antigen-presenting function .

Increases in both intra-tumoral and circulating CD14HLA-DRlowneg monocytes have been correlated with poor prognosis in RCC patients 0.Tissue analysisWhile less invasive for patients in comparison to tissue biopsies the degree to which peripheral immune moni- toring is appropriate and useful in a given therapeutic context depends upon the treatment modality in ques- tion.

Of any grade these AE were reported in 3.8 5131 of patients treated with ipilimumab monotherapy at 3 mgkg in a phase III trial Kleiner and Berman studied 5 patients in which a liver biopsy was taken to rule out drug-induced auto- immune hepatitis.The histologic changes observed with ipilimumab- related hepatitis were similar to those with acute viral and autoimmune hepatitis and it was not possible to make a definite diagnosis of a drug-induced hepatitis.
