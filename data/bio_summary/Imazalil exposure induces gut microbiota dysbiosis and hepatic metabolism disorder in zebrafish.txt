Based on principal analysis it was observed that the com- ponents of the gut microbiota in zebrafish were shifted by high con- centration of IMZ exposure C. In addition the Shannon diversity indexes also suggested that the bacterial diversity of the gut microbiota was affected by IMZ D.In addition at genus level the composition of gut microbiota of zebrafish also changed significantly after 1000 mgL IMZ exposure E. The abundances of 29 types of microorganisms including Rhodobacter Alistipes Bacteroides Shewanella Stenotrophomonas Bra- dyrhizobium Brevundimonas Bosea Aeromonas Acinetobacter and My- coplasma were changed significantly in the gut after IMZ exposure for 21 days.Effects of IMZ exposure on metabolism in the liver as detected by GC MSAfter exposure to 1000 mgL IMZ for 21 days hepatic metabolomics was analyzed by GCMS based technology.

Globular and mucous cells exert an important protective effect on the barrier function of microbes.In this study it was observed that exposure to 1000 mgL IMZ for 21 days not only influenced gut mucin secretion but also induced gut microbiota dysbiosis in adult zebrafish indicating that the gut and gut microbiota were also the potential targets of IMZ.

However the results of AB-PAS staining of the gut indicated that the secretion of mucin in the gut decreased when the zebrafish was exposed to 1000 mg L IMZ for 21 days C D.Effects of IMZ exposure on the structure of gut microbiota detected by quantitative real-time PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencingAt the phylum level the abundance of Bacteroidetes was sig- nificantly reduced after exposure to 1000 mgL IMZ A. Ad- ditionally the relative abundance of Proteobacteria also tended to de- crease A.

These results indicated that IMZ can influence both the gut function and composition of gut microbiota in adult zebrafish.The gut and liver have a common embryonic origin - the foregutintestinal lymphocytes originate from the developing liver and these two organs are associated with anatomical and biological functions .

In zebrafish the gut microbiota plays some critical roles in the nutrition development metabolism and immunity of the host  Corresponding author at College of Biotechnology and Bioengineering Zhejiang University of Technology 18 Chaowang Road Hangzhou China.E-mail address Y.

Generally the composition of gut microbiota is relative stable but it could be influenced by diet medicineantibiotics age and even pesticide and other environmental pollutants  .

In all experi- ments the fish were anesthetized on ice before dissection.Histopathological observationAfter 21 days of exposure with 1000 mgL IMZ a portion of the middle gut was fixed in 10 formalin at 4 degC for 24 h. Subsequently the fixed gut tissues were dehydrated in gradient ethanol hyalinized in xylene and embedded in paraffin wax at 56 degC.

Some previous studies reported that the gut microbiota could interfere with the host energy metabolism   indicated that gut microbiota was tightly related to the metabolism of the host.

Imazalil exposure induces gut microbiota dysbiosis and hepatic metabolism disorder in zebrafishCuiyuan Jin Ting Luo Zhihong Zhu Zihong Pan Jiajing Yang Wenchao Wang Zhengwei Fu Yuanxiang JinCollege of Biotechnology and Bioengineering Zhejiang University of Technology Hangzhou 310032 ChinaA R T I C L E I N F O KeywordsImazalilGut microbiota Metabolism ZebrafishA B S T R A C T The fungicide imazalil IMZ is used extensively to preserve freshness prevent decay and control fungal infec- tions in fruits vegetables or other plants.

Here male adult zebrafish were exposed to 100 and 1000 mgL IMZ for 1 7 21 days and the gut microbiota and hepatic metabolism were evaluated.
