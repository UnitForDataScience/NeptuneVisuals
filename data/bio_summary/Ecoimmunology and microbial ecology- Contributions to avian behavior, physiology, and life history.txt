moreover new culture methods are now available  to allow us for the first time to culture commensal gut microflora making it feasible to do manipulative experimental microbial biology in vertebrates.how has co-evolution with microbes shaped immune defense andhow readily can the immune system adjust to rapidly modified microbe communities whilst germ free models have greatly helped shape our proximate understanding of immune function it is now important to consider ecologically relevant settings in order to understand how evolution has shaped the immune system of birds.

these proteins are constitutively secreted by the liver and the epithelia and their nutritional costs relative to their protective ben- efits are low in healthy birds  but increase markedly during the acute phase of the immune response to an invasive pathogen .the acute phase of the immune response is a key immune defence mechanism in vertebrates.

we will consider microbial risk focusing on the risk of acquiring a pathogenic microbe or microbial infection at different life stages and for different life histories of birds.immune defensein adult birds an integrated immune defence is used to control microbes although age-related immune development is largely unquantified outside of the chicken .passive antimicrobial molecules such as lysozyme complement and antimicrobial peptides act on features of microbes to lyse their cell walls .

found eggshell bacteria load was inversely related to innate immune function of adults and suggested that innate immune function evolves to alter the probability of vertical transmission of bacteria.much of the research assessing the vulnerability of eggs to bacterial infection is focused on commercial production within the poultry indus- try .

males with many mating opportunities to lose due to sickness may utilize a combination of tolerance and rapid innate immune strategies  while those employing monogamous mating strategies may utilize immune strategies best suited to the local disease environment or other life history considerations.

we hypothesize that the usual immune strategies may be modified to reduce protein expenditures such as an acute phase re- sponse employing febrile response without as much dependency on acute phase proteins or phagocytosis of pathogens but with lower carryover into the specific antibody production phase of immune response.

here we focus on birds as an example system for understanding the fundamental impact bacteria have had on the evo- lution of avian immune defenses behavior physiology reproduction and life histories.

bacteria not only play an important role in shaping the immune sys- tem as well as trade-offs with other physiological systems but also for determining digestive efficiency and nu- trient uptake.

the relevance of avian microbiomes for avian ecology physiology and behavior is highly topical and will likely impact on our understanding of avian welfare conservation captive breeding as well as for our understanding of the nature of host-microbe coevolution.c 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.introduction microbial ecology immune defense and co-evolution113microbial ecology -- evolution and communities113immune defense113eggs and embryos113nestlings and juveniles115adult phases115wintering116migration and migratory fuelling116reproduction117molt117ecological considerations117microbial biogeography117foraging118conclusion key questions and techniques118what is the structure of microbial communities associated with birds and what are the functional roles of those microbes118how has co-evolution with microbes shaped metabolism and nutritional niches of birds118how have interactions with environmental and enteric microbes shaped life history evolution of birds118author contributions statement118acknowledgements118references118 corresponding author.e-mail address b. addison.

it involves increased production of pro- inflammatory proteins eicosanoids and other mediators that initiate a variety of physiological changes which divert resources to immune defense sequester resources away from pathogens and increase basal body temperature beyond optimal conditions for pathogens  .

concurrent with the febrile response is the deployment of acute phase proteins such as mannan-binding protein lysozyme and haptaglobin which play various roles in the activation of other aspects of innate immune function or in direct killing of microbes  .phagocytic cells include thrombocytes heterophils and macrophages  .

antigen responding b- and t-cells differentiate into memory cells enabling a faster and less inflammatory clearance of pathogens upon repeated exposure  .the relative costs of different modes of immune function can poten- tially be quantified in terms of energy expenditure nutritionalprotein resources and the opportunity cost of mounting this defense  .

measuring the costs of immune defense in wild birds is difficult studies measuring immediate costs have focused on trade-offs with reproductive effort  or growth .

no studies of wild birds have attempted to measure lifetime costs or immunopathology costs nor have they disentangled the mechanistic explanations of immune response costs.eggs and embryoseggs and embryos are associated with microbe communities present in nests as well as on the skin feathers and feces of parents.
