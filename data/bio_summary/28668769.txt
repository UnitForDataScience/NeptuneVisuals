The functional and evolutionary implications of such gene expression coordination by the gut microbiota re- main to be explored.It is well established that the effect of bacterial impact on Drosophila physiology is highly dependent on microbial load and composition  and that Drosophila's microbiotaFigure 1Integrative view of the functional outcome of the relationships between Drosophila melanogaster its microbiota and nutrition.

Drosophila melanogaster has been broadly used to study microbiota effects on invertebrates whose findings are frequently applicable to translational studies.

This review discusses the latest advances in understanding the molecular bases of microbiota impact on Drosophila physiology and behaviour emphasizing its broad influence and the intricate interdependence of the two partners in shaping their biology.AddressUniversite' de Lyon Institut de Ge' nomique Fonctionnelle de Lyon IGFL Ecole Normale Supe' rieure de Lyon CNRS UMR 5242 Universite' Claude Bernard Lyon 1 F-69364 Lyon Cedex 07 FranceCorresponding author Leulier F IntroductionMicroorganisms can be found virtually everywhere.

These microbes called microbiota provide the hosts with essential services.

Many members of the microbiota are symbionts or stable partners that contribute to improve and optimize many aspects of the host physiol- ogy .

Our current understanding of the role of microbiota in animals has largely benefitted from studies on Dro- sophila melanogaster.

However the mechanisms behind the mutual interplay between Drosophila and its microbiota are still not fully understood.

To elucidate the basis of Drosophila response to microbes a few studies have focused on the effect of microbiota on host's gene expression.

The presence of microbiota upre- gulates gene expression associated with Drosophila gut physiology tissue homeostasis immune response at least partly through the IMD pathway .
