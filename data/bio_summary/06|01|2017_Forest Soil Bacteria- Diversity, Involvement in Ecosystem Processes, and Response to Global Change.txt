Although both processes appear globally the extent of the rise in temperature is predicted to be pronounced inTABLE 1 Effects of carbon dioxide temperature and nitrogen increases on bacterial communities and biogeochemistry in northern forests in manipulative experimentsaTempBoreal forestAbies balsanea Pinus sylvestrisPicea abies1 soil respiration 1 enzyme activities on labile C  SOM decomposition microbial biomass - Zha Yong ity microbial community composition Temperate forestPicea asperata1 root exudation rates 1 CN ratio for exudates 1 SOM decompositionTemperate forestPicea rubens Abies balsameaFagus grandifolia Acer saccharum Acer rubrum Betula lenta Prunus serotine Quercus rubraTemperate forestBetula papyrifera Betula lentaAcer rubrum Quercus velutina Quercus rubra Fagus grandifolia Picea abies Fagus sylvatica Abies alba1 soil respiration 1 SOM decomposition 1 Vmax of enzymessoil respiration 1 extracellular enzyme activity  C  N bacterial biomass - Zha Yong ity bacterial community composition2 Gram-negative bacteria1 Acidobacteria1 Alphaproteobacteria   Temperate forestAcer rubrum Betula papyriferaQuercus velutina Acer pensylvanicum1 oxidative activity1 bacterial diversity1 Acidobacteria 1 ActinobacteriaContinued on following pageTABLE 1 ContinuedTemperate forestPinus resinosa Quercus velutinaQuercus rubra Betula lenta Acer rubrum Fagus grandifoliasoil respiration 2 SOM decomposition 1 C stocks except at Pinus site 1 tree biomass 2 extracellular enzyme activity 1 lignin recalcitrant C 1 NO31 nitrification  litter fall except 1 at Pinus site root biomass except 2 atPinus site  root productivity2 microbial biomass 1 bacterial richness 1 specific operational taxonomic units1 Proteobacteria  Acidobacteria  Temperate and boreal forests1 aboveground NPP1 belowground C 1 tree growth 1 litter fall  litter decomposition  soil respiration 1 C sink2 microbial biomassaArrows indicate increases and decreases of the listed parameters.

Considering the frequency of cellulolytic genes in bacterial genomes  bacterial involvement in decomposition seems to be a relatively common trait.FIG 2 Drivers of bacterial community composition in forest soils and features of bacterial ecology in the rhizosphere litterdeadwood and soil compartments of the forest floor.While the acidic soils of coniferous forests harbor mainly Proteobacteria Acidobac- teria and Actinobacteria   in temperate deciduous forests litter bacterial com- munities seem to be especially enriched with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes   .

Also in other cases the deposition of N significantly affected relative abundances of core bacterial phyla but it reduced bacterial diversity and altered the bacterial composition at lower taxonomic levels  .A decrease in oligotrophic bacteria is often found concomitantly with a decrease in the activity of enzymes related to cellulose breakdown again supporting the hypoth- esis that the addition of N negatively affects microbial SOM decomposition  .

It is clear that the degree to which rising CO2 levels will be offset by C sequestration in forest ecosystems will strongly depend on the adaptation of both trees and soil microorganisms to the altered environmental conditions.Thus how do CO2 levels affect bacterial populations in forest topsoils And is it possible to generalize the observations obtained across ecosystems for different soils with various vegetations The effects of elevated CO2 levels do not directly affect soil bacterial populations CO2 concentrations in soil pores are normally higher than those in the atmosphere and the response of bacteria to small CO2 changes is thus negligible .

Studies combining the assessment of metabolites present in the rhizosphere at different times their turnovers and transformations and the effects and implications of bacterial taxa in terms of fluxes are the next step toward elucidating the effects of forest trees on the rhizospheres and how they relate to the cycling of C and other nutrients.The large number of studies examining the bacterial communities in forest ecosys- tems that were published in recent years are shedding light on the high diversity and complex structure of these communities.

Our ability to define and identify activity hot spots and to analyze their properties as well as the abundance composition and function of their bacterial inhabitants will be critical in future analyses to increase our mechanistic understanding of the roles of bacteria in biogeochemical processes.Rhizosphere Bacterial CommunitiesIn temperate and boreal forests most C enters the soil food web via the roots in the form of labile C compounds such as sugars amino acids and organic acids   with approximately one-third of the plant net primary production NPP allocated to roots and soil .

In addition to pH which seems to be the most important driver of the bacterial community composition in soils organic matter content nutrient availability climate conditions and biotic interactions especially the effect of vegetation affect the composition of bacterial communities .

The assembly of the bacterial community appears to be a stochastic process during the initial stage of wood decay and the bacterial abundance in fresh wood is very low with 0.2 X 109 16S rRNA copies g-1.

These three phyla also dominated the active fraction of a P. abies soil comprising 80 to 90 of rRNA molecules and were responsible for the bulk of bacterial transcription  .The soil bacterial community composition has been shown to display biogeograph- ical patterns on a continental scale that are predictable but differ from the well-studied plant and animal community patterns .
