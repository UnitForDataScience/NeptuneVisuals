Because the 16S rRNA gene sequence was in the range of 98.7 to define a new species  strain Marseille P2948 was considered as a new species within the Corynebacterium genus in the Coriobacter- iaceae family.Strain Marseille P2948 presents a 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence of around 1.3 with its phylogenetically closest species  and we propose that strain Marseille P2948 may beNew Microbe and New Infect 2017 18 6-7c 2017 The Authors.
