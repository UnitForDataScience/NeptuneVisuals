The relative abundance of Z. tritici and the yeasts was relatively constant between individual samples suggesting that fast growing fungi rapidly occupy empty space in the phyllosphere.Keywords mycobiome wheat Zymoseptoria tritici Cryptococcus Sporobolomyces cultivar pathogen microbiomeINTRODUCTIONWheat Triticum aestivum is essential for global food production and is among the most commonly grown crops.

tritici in wheat whereas  did not observe any significant effects of Cryptococcus on spore germination in Z. tritici.

The present study focuses on wheat and the effect of wheat cultivarplant age and leaf position on the phyllosphere communities and the co-existence networks formed within these communities among individual species including pathogens.Overall 212 OTUs were identified in the dataset.

The present study not only describes the key fungal species in the wheat phyllosphere but also describes the local within-plant variation in communities over time and the co-occurrence of fungal groups across locations leaf position and cultivars.Our study demonstrates the complexity of fungal communities in the phyllosphere and provides valuable insights into the interactions among plant inhabiting organisms including pathogens.CONCLUSIONThis report describes the wheat mycobiome and spatiotemporal variation.

In a recent study it was shown that leaf position and age had significant effects on the susceptibility of wheat to a biotrophic pathogen wheat rust the upper leaves being more susceptible and it was suggested that the life strategy of the pathogen was a determining factor as for instance necrotrophic pathogens prefer older tissues   .

Z. tritici was generally more abundant in the later growth stages and on older leaves leaf position 3.DISCUSSIONThis study is a follow-up of a previous study the first study focused on community differences at species level winter- and spring barley winter wheat rye triticale and oat and found that there is a constant 'sea' of fungi across cereal phyllospheres with a few host specific pathogens and that host genotype is a major driver of microbial communities  .

A network analysis visualized fungal co-occurrences in the wheat phyllosphere and demonstrated important negative and positive interactions particularly with Z. tritici.

The potential of using yeasts as antagonists against wheat pathogens have been investigated previously.

The three yeasts Cryptococcus Sporobolomyces and Dioszegia shown in were more equally distributed between cultivars but showed the highest abundance in Jensen and Mariboss.Fungal Co-occurrenceZymoseptoria tritici showed a highly significant negative co-occurrence with Sporobolomyces Cystofilobasidiaceae and Dioszegia whereas Cryptococcus showed negative co-occurrencewith Pleosporales Dioszegia and Tilletiopsis.

The relative abundance of Z. tritici and the yeasts was strikingly constant particularly across the samples from the three leaf positions but also across cultivars and between GS 69-71 and 75-78.
