Microbiome comparisons between the 2 groups of CR asthma patients treated or not treated with acid suppression medications were performed individually for each taxa using the 2-part test in Explicet 2.8.4 software  Boulder Colo.By subgrouping CR asthmatics into patients treated with acid suppression medications or not on acid suppression medications we found that CR asthmatics treated with acid suppression medications had unique alterations in their airway microbiome with an increase in percentage of sequences for phylum Firmicutes P 5.0134 .

Therefore the expansions of Streptococci may occur due to various factors that is aerodigestive exchanges due to GERD the direct response to acid suppression medications andor due to the changes in bacterial environment that provide favorable conditions for Streptococci growth in the airways.862 LETTERS TO THE EDITORJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOLSEPTEMBER 2017In conclusion our study demonstrates expansion of Streptococci in the airways of CR asthmatics taking acid suppression medica- tions.

In large population studies the use of acid suppression drugs has been asso- ciated with the development of community-acquired pneumonia often of Streptococcal etiology.Importantly Streptococcus spp had been reported to be able to tolerate an acidic environment better than other microorganisms.To date there are a lack of studies about the contribution of GERD and acid suppressor medications on airway microbiome composition in asthma disease severity and response to corticosteroid treatment.Our group recently evaluated airway microbiome in bronchoalveolar lavage samples BAL of asthmatic patients identified clinically as corticosteroid resistant CR or corticoste- roid sensitive based on responses to oral prednisone treatment.

Changes in the airway microbiome composition of CR asthmatics treated with acid suppression medications.

Distribution of major bacterial phyla based on 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA sequencing data of BAL samples of CR asthmatics on and not on acid suppression medications is provided.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 140 NUMBER 3LETTERS TO THE EDITOR 861FIG 2.

Analysis of Streptococcus sequences revealed that the predominant species of genus Streptococcus in CR patients on acid suppression medications were S mitis present in 6 of 6 patients and S pseudopneumoniae present in 2 of 6 CR patients.
