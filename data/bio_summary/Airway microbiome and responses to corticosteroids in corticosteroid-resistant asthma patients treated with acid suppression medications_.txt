Among those are patients with autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 CTLA-4 CTLA4 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man OMIM616100.2CTLA-4 is an inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T cells and FOXP31 regulatory T lymphocytes Tregs which inhibits proliferation of activated T cells on binding to CTLA-4 ligands.3 CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency results in an immune dysregulation syndrome characterized by lymphoproliferation characteristic lymphocytic infiltration in nonlymphoid organs autoimmune cytopenias hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections.24Murine studies demonstrated a regulatory role of FOXP31 chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 5-positive CXCR51 B-cell lymphoma 6 BCL61 follicular regulatory T cells TFR in the germinal center response.5 Further studies revealed that deletion of CTLA-4 causes increased numbers of follicular helper T cells TFH and TFR cells.6 On antigenic stimulation loss of CTLA-4 in TFH cells resulted in increased antigen-specific B-cell responses whereas loss of CTLA-4 in TFR cells resulted in defective suppression of antigen-specific and auto antigen- specific antibody responses.6A recent study in human monogenic primary immune disorders PIDs investigated the signaling pathways and cellular interactions required for the development and function of TFH cells and demonstrated the impact of PID-associated mutations on the quantity and quality of TFH cells.7 While this study highlighted the importance of assessing TFH cells in PIDs CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency was not among the PIDs studied.Here we describe a patient with autoimmune lymphoprolifer- ative disorder who was found to have CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency.

Analysis of Streptococcus sequences revealed that the predominant species of genus Streptococcus in CR patients on acid suppression medications were S mitis present in 6 of 6 patients and S pseudopneumoniae present in 2 of 6 CR patients.

This latter group of disorders includes patients with defects in caspase 8 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog and neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog as well as a group of patients with unknown molecular defects.1The use of next-generation sequencing methodology including exome sequencing has uncovered new genetic defects in patients previously considered to have ALPS-like disease.

The details of the cell culture conditions are provided in this article's Online Repository at .Incubation of primary bronchial epithelial cells with S mitis andS pseudopneumoniae S pseudo resulted in dose-dependent p38mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK activation  A and B in the cells as detected by Western blot.

The bacterial factors responsible for differential activation of bronchial epithelial cells by S mitis and S pseudo in comparison to S oralis need to be defined but likely they are related to the viru- lence factors produced by these bacteria.The reason for the expansion of Streptococci in patients on acid suppression medications requires further investigation.

To determine other factors that contribute to the development of corticosteroid resistance in the remaining patients we performed post hoc assessments of these patients' medication history.

These patients were categorized post hoc as patients treated with acid suppression medications.

Microbiome comparisons between the 2 groups of CR asthma patients treated or not treated with acid suppression medications were performed individually for each taxa using the 2-part test in Explicet 2.8.4 software  Boulder Colo.By subgrouping CR asthmatics into patients treated with acid suppression medications or not on acid suppression medications we found that CR asthmatics treated with acid suppression medications had unique alterations in their airway microbiome with an increase in percentage of sequences for phylum Firmicutes P 5.0134 .
