indeed a combination of several novel probiotic bacterial strains has been shown to successfully treat patients with cdi suggesting that this may be the way to go.to this end it will be important to move away from small cross-sectional studies toward larger prospective studies.in this regard falony et al estimated that a sample size of 1700 subjects per study is probably needed to adequately asses the relationship be- tween obesity and microbiota composition in a cohort study when one corrects for age gender and other variables.in conclusion the intestinal microbiota has great thera- peutic potential in the treatment of obesity and t2dm given the fact that multiple studies have shown correlations be- tween the microbiota composition and these conditions.

the main objective of this review is to critically assess the driving role of intestinal microbe composition in the etiology prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-related metabolic dysfunction including type 2 diabetes.keywords gut microbiota obesity diabetes fecal transplantation.fungi archaea phages and protozoa residing in the human intestineequal the amount of all human cellsand they have the capability to interact with the host in several ways.

however with a few exceptions such causal relation is lacking for humans and most publications merely report associations between intestinal microbial composition and metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

both food emulsifiers like carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80 often found in processed foodsand artifi- cial sweetenershave been associated with altered micro- bial composition and the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome.

in addition various mecha- nisms have been proposed to explain how gut microbiota drive obesity and its metabolic complications including interaction with metabolic processes and the immune sys- tem of the host.

multiple studies have indicated that composition of the microbiota varies in breast-fed infants compared with formula-fed infantsand that the introduction of solid food is another important determinant of microbial composition.

interestingly the intestinal microbiota composition is only to a limited extent heritable as was observed in monozygotic twin studies.only in the last stage of life does the composition change again.

when pooling 4 studies differences in phylum-level taxonomic composition were confirmed in lean and obese subjects however authors conclude that no association be- tween bmi and taxonomic composition of fecal microbes was found in the largest cohorts human microbiome project and metahit.

moreover red meat intake via carni- tine and choline has been linked to altered gut microbiota composition and an adverse cardiometabolic state.the dietary compounds associated with weight reduction in the above-mentioned paper including vegetablesfibersand yogurtare all reported to alter fecal microbial composition.

nevertheless intestinal bacterial composition during life canmechanisms by which obesity results in t2dm have been partly clarified and include the development of insulin resistance at the level of adipose tissue skeletal muscle and liver with concurrent impaired insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cell.

paradoxically a membrane protein of akkermansia muciniphilia was recently shown to improve obesity and t2dm in mice.changes in the firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio have been reported to be associated with obesity and insulin resistance.these al- terations were related to measures of glycemic control including fasting glucose and hemoglobin a1c concentra- tions.

however risk of exogenous contamination might be a limiting factor to translate these results.how could the gut microbiome be exploited in preventing or treating obesity and t2dmas reported convincing evidence for a potential causal role of microbiota in diverse diseases including obesity andt2dm comes from studies in rodent models .

this group elegantly demonstrated in over 800 subjects that it is indeed possible to use microbiota composition of individual subjects to predict their metabolic glycemic response to a diet.
