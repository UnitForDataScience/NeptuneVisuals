The gut microbiota referring to bacteria as well as virusesAbbreviations used in this paper BMI body mass index CDI Clostridium difficile infection FMT fecal microbiota transplantation FXR farnesoid X receptor GF germ-free RYGB roux-en-Y gastric SCFA short chain fatty acids T2DM type 2 diabetes TMAO trimethylamineoxide.Most current articlec 2017 by the AGA Institute 0016-508536.00be altered by changes in the diet as well as factors like medication use which will be discussed below.As previously indicated alterations in the gut microbiota composition and diversity have been linked to obesity and T2DM in association studies.

In addition various mecha- nisms have been proposed to explain how gut microbiota drive obesity and its metabolic complications including interaction with metabolic processes and the immune sys- tem of the host.

Moreover we will also discuss the potential role of gut microbiota in the prevention and treatment of this adverse metabolic state.Shaping Factors of the Intestinal Microbial Community Diet and the Innate Immune SystemThe human gut lumen contains a broad variety of micro- organisms most notably bacteria.

Unfortunately contrasting data are frequently reported and many studies have been carried out in rodents that have a markedly different gut microbiota and innate immune system underscoring that murine causation studies may but do not necessarily equate to human causation regarding metabolic microbiota in metabolism.Clearly we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms by which gut microbiota or their metab- olites drive host-metabolism and immunological function in humans.

Thus larger studies with more power to investigate the association of the microbiome and obesity and T2DM are eagerly awaited.It has recently become clear that gut microbiota as well as their endogenous metabolic function enabling the digestion of food components is related to dietary intake.

FMT as a treatment modality is currently being tested in a range of other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome obesity and metabolic syndrome as well as in neurological and psychological disorders although most reports of the latter category are merely anecdotal.

Ridaura et alshowed in a very interesting experiment that FMT of feces derived from twin pairs discordant for obesity to GF mice induced more weight gain after FMT of feces from the obese co-twin compared with feces from the lean co-twin.

CDI patients who have been treated multiple times with an- tibiotics have most of their bacterial diversity wiped out FMT effectively repopulates this vacated space with a stable and healthy bacterial community.In contrast FMT recipients with metabolic syndrome were obese but were otherwise healthy individuals with a stable and diverse fecal microbiota.Figure 1.

It was not until the late 1950s that FMT garnered interest again when the first re- ports about its use to treat fulminant enterocolitis appeared in the scientific literature.However FMT's breakthrough as the method of choice for the treatment of persistent Clos- tridium difficile infection CDI came only after a double blind randomized trialthat demonstrated 94 efficacy of FMT compared with 31 after treatment with antibiotics.

These include but are not limited to functions like nutrient metabolism upon dietary intake xenobiotic metabolism maintenance of gut barrier function and the gastrointes- tinal immune system as well as protection against trans- location of intestinal pathogens.The composition of the gut microbiota is considered to be influenced by many factors starting from early life.
