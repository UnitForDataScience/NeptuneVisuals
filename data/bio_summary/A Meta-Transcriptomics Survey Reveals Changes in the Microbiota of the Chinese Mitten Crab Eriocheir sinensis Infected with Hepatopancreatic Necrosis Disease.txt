In June 2016 more than 100 crabs exhibiting clinical symptoms typical of HPND were obtained from several aquatic breeding ponds in Jiangdu District Yangzhou City and Yandu District Yancheng City Jiangsu Province China.cDNA Library Construction and Illumina SequencingTotal RNA from the hepatopancreata of two crabs infected with HPND as well as two healthy crabs was isolated using thedetected in the hepatopancreata of crabs infected with HPNDRNeasyQRPlus Mini Kit Qiagen Valencia CA USA accordingDing et al.

Further studies are needed to determine whether Acholeplasma and Spiroplasma associate with HPND infection in crabs.Microsporidia can also associate with HPND Ding et al.

Specifically the prevalence of bacteria belonging to Tenericutes and Actinobacteria phyla increased whereas the prevalence of bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum decreased in crabs with HPND clearly pointing to an association with HPND.Keywords Eriocheir sinensis hepatopancreatic necrosis disease tenericutes bacteroidetes meta-transcriptomicsINTRODUCTIONThe freshwater Chinese mitten crab E. sinensis is an economically important crustacean cultured in the Chinese provinces of Jiangsu Anhui Hubei and Liaoning Shen et al.

Crabs with HPND exhibit multiple clinical symptoms including hepatopancreata that are lighter in color turning from golden yellow and light yellow to gray-white and soft shells that are darker in color than usual as well as muscle atrophy and edema Ding et al.

However the etiology of HPND is unknown.The hepatopancreas of crustaceans functions in both digestion and absorption Wang et al.

2015 and microsporidia were found in crabs infected with HPND Ding et al.

With the rapid increase of the E. sinensis aquacultural industry numerous diseases have recently evolved thus resulting in huge economic losses Shen et al.

A dense microbial colonization has been observed in the hepatopancreas of several isopods Wood and Griffiths 1988 Zimmer et al.
