The thermal cycling conditions for the 16S rRNA primer pair targeting the conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene were 95 degC initial denaturation for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 degC for 30 s and at 60 degC for 30 s Primers flanking the int1 gene of the integron repA gene of the conjugative plasmid and the yigB gene of the hemolysin expression-modulating protein hha gene family were used at thermal cycling conditions of 95 degC for 15 min and for 40 cycles at 95 degC for 30 s specified annealing temperatures for the genes  and at 72 degC for 30 s.Microbial Community AnalysisThe structure of the microbial community of the samples was assessed using Illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.

These properties can transform the characteristics of the host cell.Integrons are accessory components of conjugative plas- mids They are genetic elements capable of integration and expression of genetic cassettes by an overall common promoter The integron consists of three main parts an integrase int1 gene that helps in the integration of specific gene cassettes an attachment att1 site into which the gene cassettes are integrated and the common promoter Pc for expression of the gene cassettes In this study we investigated the intestinal microbiome of very low birth weight preterm infants from three neonatal intensive care units.

As preterm infants spend many months in the hospital their health is dependent on different factors to which they are exposed such as chemicals parenteral feeding and exposure toneonatal intensive care unit NICU microbial flora In addition to this very low birth weight o1500 g preterm infants are affected by feeding intolerance and minimal intestinal growth These factors threaten the development of the commensal gut microbiota and are responsible for delay in the succession of the adult gut microbiota which may enhance the risk for sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis NEC Approximately 7 of very low birth weight infants develop NEC with a mortality rate of 20-30 This multifactorial condition is based on premature birth aberrant intestinal microbiota development and enteral feeding Although differences in the bacterial taxa of the gastrointestinal tract during preterm development have been extensively studied the gene pool linked to mobile genetic elements MGEs has not been investigated.

The hha gene family plays a role in regulating the expression of virulence genes such as the a-hemolysin gene family in response to virulence factor expression The a-hemolysin toxin has been previously shown to play a role in the development of enterocolitis in humans and animals In addition a correlation between the hha gene family and other conjugative plasmids has been previously reported In addition to this an integron that contained trimethoprim and streptomycin resistance gene cassettes was also assembled within the conjugative plasmid.

Replication machinery replication regulatory gene repA virulence hha gene family yigB and carrier of multidrug resistance genes class I integron integrase gene int1 were targeted and screened in our data set using quantitative PCR.

No significant correlations were found between int1 and repA or between int1 and yigB r2o0.5.With respect to the association of OTUs and signature genes the genes showed a significant microbiota association with an accuracy of classification calibratedvalidated of 0.800.67 for int1 gene 0.850.74 for repA gene and 0.80.66 for yigB gene on using PLS-DA.

Abundance levels of OTU2 and signature genes in longitudinal data sets of NEC-positive and -negative infantst day of life where t0 is the day of NEC diagnosis while the other numbers indi- cate days prior to NEC diagnosis No do not have the taxonomy information.The gene abundances relative to the 16S rRNA gene were calculated for RepA YigB and Int1 columns  - 4 to - 5  - 2 to - 3.99 and  0 to - 1.99 are relative gene abundance values.

Potential virulence factors were also found within the conjugative plasmid as the repA gene the replication regulatory gene of the conjugative plasmid and yigB the gene from the hha family showed a significant correlation.

The purified products were sequenced with the Miseq platform Illumina San Diego CA using V3 chemistry with 300-bp paired-end reads.Sequences from the 16S rRNA amplicon data were analyzed using the QIIME pipeline Sequences were quality-filtered splitli- braries.py sequence length 200-600 bp minimum average qualityrRNAR GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTTscore 25 and no more than six ambiguous bases but with no primer mismatches and then clustered at 97 homology level usingUsearch version 8 against the Greengenes database supernatant was mixed with paramagnetic beads and eluted using a 96 super Magnet plate AlpaquaBeverly MA.

MG-RAST metagenome analyzer Argonne National Laboratory Lemont IL was used to analyze the functional classification in the samples using the SEED subsystem database that houses collections of functionally related protein families The ResFinder program DTU Copenhagen Denmark an online tool was used to find antimicrobial resistance genes in the sequences based on the NCBI database The RAST Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology server using SEED-based annotation was used to identify genes within the contigs built by Geneious Reference genomes for assembly and annotation were downloaded from the NCBI database.Validation and Statistical AnalysesTechnical variation was detetermined by Pearson regression analyses between the technical duplicates.
