ilumatobacter were also reported .the runoff from rivers in this region account for nearly 15 of the world's runoff from rivers.

this study employed metagenomic sequencing to survey prokaryotic microbiota in the solimoes purus and urucu rivers of the amazon basin in brazil.

previous studies   described the initial microbial landscape of freshwater amazon rivers being rich in actinobacteria alpha- proteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and crenarchaeota.

therefore this study aimed to form a landscape of the most frequent species in this environment.we sequenced total dna extracted from freshwater samples collected from different rivers in the upper amazon basin.

these samples were collected in september 2008 dry season from the solimoes 03deg1703.86s 60deg0123.04w purus 03deg4107.4s 61deg2813.91w and urucu 04deg0808.03s 63deg2954.69w rivers.
