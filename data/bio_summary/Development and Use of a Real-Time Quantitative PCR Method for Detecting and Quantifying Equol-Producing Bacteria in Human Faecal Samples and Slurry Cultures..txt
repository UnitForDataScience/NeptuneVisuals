it was also surprising to find amplicons of both tdr and ddr when examining the samples of two non-equol-producing women w7 and w15 table 3. to confirm that the phenotypic results of equol production whether positive and negative had been maintained and to gain further insights into the metabolism of soy isoflavones faecal slurries from selected faecal samples provided by equol-producing and non-equol-producing women including those in which tdr and ddr were detected were inoculated into gam-arg medium with no isoflavones control or with either daidzein dzen or genistein gten equol producersw3025.95 - 0.01 3.57 - 0.54 25.45 - 0.05 4.17 - 0.58123.75 - 0.70 4.23 - 0.53 25.00 - 0.40 4.30 - 0.58324.98 - 0.18 3.86 - 0.54 24.90 - 0.04 4.32 - 0.58626.24 - 0.04 3.48 - 0.54 25.91 - 0.01 4.05 - 0.58w8022.53 - 0.14 4.60 - 0.52 22.25 - 0.03 5.06 - 0.55122.86 - 0.22 4.50 - 0.52 22.53 - 0.19 4.98 - 0.55322.53 - 0.22 4.60 - 0.52 21.67 - 0.04 5.22 - 0.55622.53 - 0.44 4.60 - 0.52 21.43 - 0.18 5.28 - 0.55w18028.17 - 0.57 2.90 - 0.56-2124.80 - 0.22 3.92 - 0.54326.02 - 0.25 3.55 - 0.54626.11 - 0.22 3.52 - 0.54 equol non-producersw10-2-2136w20-2-2136w40-2-2136w50-2-2136w60-2-2136w7022.49 - 0.08 4.61 - 0.52 23.42 - 0.05 4.73 - 0.56123.40 - 0.02 4.34 - 0.53 24.30 - 0.13 4.49 - 0.57323.57 - 0.13 4.29 - 0.53 24.60 - 0.01 4.41 - 0.57628.01 - 0.51 2.95 - 0.56 27.56 - 0.08 3.59 - 0.57w90-2-2136w100-2-2136continuedtable 3  continuedwomen sampletimeaqpcr amplification of total microbial dna from faecesdihydrodaidzein were recovered from these cultures.

however the added daidzein completely disappeared converted into equol when the medium containing this isoflavone was inoculated with s. isoflavoniconvertens dsm 22006. equol in the faecal cultures was only present in those provided by the equol-producing women.

faecal cultures were then incubated in open tubes under anaerobic conditions at 37c for 24 h. they were then centrifuged at 13500 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants and pellets independently collected for isoflavone metabolite analysis and dna extraction respectively.detection and quantification of isoflavone metabolitesdaidzein and genistein and their metabolites dihydrodaidzein dihydrogenistein and equol were measured in faecal cultures by a uhplc procedure based on the method for determining isoflavones in urine redruello et al.

quantification was performed against calibration curves prepared using commercially available standards.dna extraction from bacteria faecal samples and faecal culturestotal dna from both control bacteria and microorganisms from faeces and faecal cultures was extracted following the procedure of zoetendal et al.

further whether equol-production is a phylogeny-related trait species-specific or an acquired property strain-specific has yet to be determined clavel and mapesa 2013. thus primers targeting functional single-copy genes such as those involved in equol biosynthesis are preferable.the present work reports a qpcr assay involving oligonucleotide primers based on conserved sequences of reductase-encoding genes implicated in the synthesis of equol plus the use of sybr green as a dye for the detection and quantification of equol-producing bacteria.

unfortunately since only limited information on the microbial types involved in the synthesis of equol is available the identification and quantification of equol producers by qpcr technique developed in this work might be compromised.

in contrast the ddr gene was only amplified in the faecal samples of two of these three women suggesting the presence in the non-amplified sample of reductase genes unrelated to those known to be involved in equol formation and used for primer design in this study.

monitoring equol-producing bacteria in the human gut could provide a means of evaluating strategies aimed at increasing the endogenous formation of this bioactive compound.keywords real time quantitative pcr qpcr soy isoflavones equol intestinal microbiology faecal microbiotaintroductionepidemiological evidence suggests high intakes of soy foods or purified soy isoflavones to be associated with less intense menopause symptoms and a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular diseases neurodegenerative diseases and cancer he and chen 2013 wada et al.

however the ddr gene was identified in the faeces of only two w3 and w8 of the three equol producers while no amplification was obtained for this gene when used as template dna for examining the faeces and faecal slurry cultures of subject w18.

in addition isoflavones and their metabolites including daidzein genistein dihydrodaidzein dihydrogenistein and equol were measured in the faecal cultures by uhplc.

however the transformation of daidzein into equol was never complete and variable amounts of daidzein and usuallythe qpcr results obtained for the faecal cultures matched those obtained with dna isolated from faeces.

however the addition of equol to faecal cultures from subjects w7 and w15 excluded the possibility of any further metabolism of this compound data not shown.
