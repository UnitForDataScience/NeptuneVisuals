Irrigation solution was a 14 strength Hoagland saline nutrient solution with a salinity of 10 average salinity in Lima River estuary.After an acclimation period of two weeks vessels with P. australis 6 vessels and with non-vegetated sediment 6 vessels were spiked with a Cu saline solution resulting in a sediment Cu concentration of 270 mg g-1 a concentration corresponding to the ERM effects range- median value which is the sediment quality guideline that indicates the pollutant concentration above which it is frequent to occur adverse biological effects in marine and estuarine sediments   To half of these vessels the respective microbial consortium see section .

Non-vegetated sediment cubes similardimensions were simultaneously collected.Estuarine water and rhizosediment and non-vegetated sediment were also collected into plastic sterile containers for the development of the microbial consortia and for initial microbial communities' char- acterization.Vessels were kept for 2 months in a greenhouse placed outdoors exposed to natural light and temperature conditions being watered through an automatic irrigation system regulated to mimic the natural floods that occur in salt marshes.

Control consortia without Cu addition were prepared in parallel to understand the effect of the enrichment process on the bacterial community.For each type of sediment P. australis rhizosediment and non-ve- getated sediment six slurries were prepared each with 60 mL of se- diment 120 mL of estuarine water and 3.5 mL of a 4 mol L-1 glucose solution.

At the end four different mi- crobial consortia were obtained rhizosediment with Cu addition rhi- zosediment control sediment with addition of Cu and sediment control.Vessels dismantlingAfter 2 months vessels were dismantled.

In this work 4 types of microbial consortia were developed two from rhizosediment and non-vegetated sediment exposed to Cu and two from rhizosediment and non-vegetated sediment without exposure to Cu.

It should be noted that the sediment used was doped with Cu because Cu natural levels in selected sediment were low.

For instance in authors works   the microbial consortia were obtained through sediment slurries exposer to a high amount of a metal to select microorganisms resistant to that metal the sediment being from the rhizosphere of different salt marsh plants J. maritimus and P. australis.

All works showed promising results but more studies should be carried out to help choosing the most suitable approach.In the present work since the microbial consortium was obtainedfrom a slurry of a sediment not previously exposed to high levels of Cu the sediment was doped with Cu for the experiment this auto- chthonous bioaugmentation process might be used to remediate newly contaminated estuarine sediments for instance after a contamination event and not only for long term impacted areas.ConclusionsResults clearly showed that after two months of experiment Cu caused a shift in the bacterial community structure of sediments an effect that was observed either with or without addition of the metal resistant microbial consortium.
