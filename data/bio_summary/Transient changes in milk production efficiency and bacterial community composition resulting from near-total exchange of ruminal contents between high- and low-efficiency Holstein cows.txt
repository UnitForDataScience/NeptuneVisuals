key words milk production efficiency ruminal contents exchange ruminal microbiomeintroductionbreeding of ruminants for improved production com- bined with improvements in feeding and management have resulted in tremendous gains in livestock produc- tivity and efficiency.

we examined changes in ruminal microbial composition and mpe following near-total exchange of ruminal contents between pairs of third-lactation cows that had displayed differences in feed intake at the same within-pair level of milk pro- duction over their first 2 lactations.

finally we did not examine changes in the archaeal protozoal or fungal components of the ruminal microbiome resulting from contents exchange and the known contributions of these groups to ruminal metabolism would be expected to have some effect on mpe ushida et al.
