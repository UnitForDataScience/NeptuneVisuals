It has been estimated that up to 22 of HCC cases in western countries are now attributed to NAFLD27.Much progress has been made in recent years on the mechanisms of how NAFLD promotes HCC.

It needs to be pointed out that the CD-HFD model recapitulates the natural disease progression of NAFLD to HCC and spontaneous HCC occurs in  30 of treated mice which helps understand the NAFLD-to-HCC transition under a clinical relevant pathological condi- tion.

Excessive food intake especially fat consumption breaks the balance of lipid metabolism and leads to obesity and NAFLD which are well demonstrated in leptin-deficient obob mice or dietary NAFLD model such as mice kept on a high-fat diet HFD 11.Hepatocyte ballooning caused by accumulation of lipid droplets is the hallmark of NAFLD.

This review explores recent findings of both 'intrinsic' effects on hepatocytes and the role of the local environment in NAFLD-promoted HCC development.IntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma HCC is the most common form of primary liver malignancy and one of the lead- ing causes of cancer-related death 1-3.

In addition increased ROS has been observed along with disease progression from NASH to HCC such as in the mice harboring liver-specific deletion of augmenter of liver regeneration ALR which develop spontaneous NASH and HCC 18.

The contribution of IL-6 to NAFLD- promoted HCC was supported by another study that chronic inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1mTORC1 was found to enhance DEN- induced HCC in mice fed HFD 23.

Our group discovered that peripheral blood Th17 cells from HCC patients sup- press CD8 T-cell responses indicating that Th17 cells promote HCC 80.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD a common disorder in obese people has been identified as an important risk factor for HCC.

Following the increasing prevalence of obesity it is expected that the contribution of NAFLD to HCC's incidence worldwide will grow.
