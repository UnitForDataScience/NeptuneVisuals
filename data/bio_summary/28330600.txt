this observation leads to key questions of its clinical significance does it represent a means for facilitation of mucositis and is it specific enough to predict the course of mucositis or do changing bacteria simply reflect the mi- croflora's response to other non-mucositis but parallel factorsdoi of original article .e-mail address .the mucositis puzzle is complicated and consists of multiple pieces which not only fit together but actively interact.

noted that increases in streptococcus mitus were associ- ated with the development of severe mucositis de ryck et al.
