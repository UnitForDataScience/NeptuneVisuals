This observation leads to key questions of its clinical significance does it represent a means for facilitation of mucositis and is it specific enough to predict the course of mucositis or do changing bacteria simply reflect the mi- croflora's response to other non-mucositis but parallel factorsDOI of original article .E-mail address .The mucositis puzzle is complicated and consists of multiple pieces which not only fit together but actively interact.

noted that increases in Streptococcus mitus were associ- ated with the development of severe mucositis De Ryck et al.

Since the oral microbiome represents only one element of the puzzle other pieces re- quire consideration as in the context of the Zhu et al.

On the other hand if as Zhu et al.

It is possible that the changes in the oral flora noted by Zhu et al.

For example while Zhu et al.

And while not noted by Zhu et al.
