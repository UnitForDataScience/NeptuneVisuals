for better readability we refer to mild copd subtypes in the following for patients without qct detectable changes in lungs and to severe copd subtypes for patients with qct detectable changes in lungs deviating from the gold nomenclature of copd patients.

thus we hypothesized that differences in the lung bacterial community composition are observable i between copd patients and controls or ii between copd patients with and without ct abnormalities.

in total 25 samples 9 samples from healthy subjects and 16 from cases were used for further analysis.bacterial community composition of the lung in healthy subjects and copd patients with and without ct detectable abnormalitiesour copd patients group comprised cases with and without ct detectable lung changes.

moreover bacterial com- munities derived from lungs of mild subtype copd patients closely resembled those of con- trols p  0.60. furthermore communities derived from severe subtype copd patients could be separated from controls padj  0.0048 .

thus above described findings should be considered as trends which have to be confirmed in further studies.influence of medication on microbial community composition in the lung of copd patients58 of the severe subtype copd patients and 50 of the mild subtype copd patients received glucocorticoidlaba gc medication by inhalation .

for patients with severe lung indispositions partly accompanied by exacerbations differences in microbial community com- position have been described before in a study including 5 copd patients and 11 cases with asthma bacterial communities clustered together but differed in composition from communi- ties of healthy controls .

it could already be shown in a study concerning the impact of combined corticosteroid and laba treatment in patients suffering from different copd subtypes that treatment differen- tially exerts effects in sub-types of copd patients.

only few bacterial genera were affected by glucocorticoid laba medication throughout all these subtypes in our study.however we cannot exclude that weak differences were masked due to small group sizes of 9 patients compared to 7 patients without gc treatment resulting in a low power of resolution.network structurein our study co-occurrence analysis revealed the presence of clusters of co-occurring bacteria in the lungs of study participants strongly influenced by differences in microbial abundances between severe versus mild subtype cases and controls.

moreover resolution to strain level is not possible thus requiring validation ofour findings based on studies applying meta- and single-cell genomic approaches as well as on determination of host derived effectors of the innate humoral immune system.conclusionthis study revealed changes in lung microbial community composition in gold stage 1 and 2 copd cases with abnormalities in ct. we could show that lung community composition in copd patients without abnormalities in ct resembles that of the control group whereas communities of patients with abnormalities in ct were significantly different.

abstractbackgroundchanges in microbial community composition in the lung of patients suffering from moderate to severe copd have been well documented.

however knowledge about specific micro- biome structures in the human lung associated with ct defined abnormalities is limited.methodsbacterial community composition derived from brush samples from lungs of 16 patients suf- fering from different ct defined subtypes of copd and 9 healthy subjects was analyzedcompeting interests hh is an employee of synlab mvz gauting  iml red gmbh and received salaries from synlab mvz gauting  iml red gmbh.

the microbial communities can clearly be distinguished by their associations with the ct defined disease phenotype.conclusionour findings indicate that ct detectable structural changes in the lung of copd patients which we termed severe subtypes are associated with alterations in bacterial communities which may induce further changes in the interaction between microbes and host cells.

for some years now high resolution computed tomography ct has been used to evaluate struc- tural changes in lungs of copd patients enabling the identification of copd subtypes  .
