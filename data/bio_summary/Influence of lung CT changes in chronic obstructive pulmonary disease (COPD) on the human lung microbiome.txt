However comparisons among different studies have to be dealt with caution since different regions of the 16S rRNA gene as well as different sequencing platforms applied were shown to lead to slight differences in detected community composition  .Bacterial community structure and abnormalities in lung as detected by CTData from our study revealed differences in the composition of the lung microbiome of patients suffering from subtypes of COPD that appear to correspond to CT-detectable changes like percentage airway wall area or development of emphysema in the diseased lung.

In total 25 samples 9 samples from healthy subjects and 16 from cases were used for further analysis.Bacterial community composition of the lung in healthy subjects and COPD patients with and without CT detectable abnormalitiesOur COPD patients group comprised cases with and without CT detectable lung changes.

Moreover resolution to strain level is not possible thus requiring validation ofour findings based on studies applying meta- and single-cell genomic approaches as well as on determination of host derived effectors of the innate humoral immune system.ConclusionThis study revealed changes in lung microbial community composition in GOLD stage 1 and 2 COPD cases with abnormalities in CT. We could show that lung community composition in COPD patients without abnormalities in CT resembles that of the control group whereas communities of patients with abnormalities in CT were significantly different.

To test our hypothesis we compared lung microbial commu- nity composition in COPD patients with or without structural lung changes detectable by quantitative CT and a healthy control group.

Changes in bacterial community composition in lung samples obtained from our study participants were assessed both on the level of individual taxa as well as on the level of network structures.Material and methodsStudy populationSixteen male and female Caucasian patients between the age of 48 and 74 with COPD mainly stages 1 and 2 according to GOLD classification  and nine controls were selected from partic- ipants from 4 European countries of the EvA study according to following criteria 2 mg of total DNA in combination with high percentage airway wall area or low lung density in CT for cases .

We were interested in early changes in bacterial communities during disease development in COPD with special emphasis on interrelation of COPD subtypes with and without abnormali- ties in CT and changes in microbial community composition.Microbial community composition in the lung of COPD patientsDifferences in bacterial community composition of the lung were observed between patients with severe subtypes of COPD compared to that of controls.

Thus we hypothesized that differences in the lung bacterial community composition are observable I between COPD patients and controls or II between COPD patients with and without CT abnormalities.

Thus above described findings should be considered as trends which have to be confirmed in further studies.Influence of medication on microbial community composition in the lung of COPD patients58 of the severe subtype COPD patients and 50 of the mild subtype COPD patients received GlucocorticoidLABA GC medication by inhalation .

For patients with severe lung indispositions partly accompanied by exacerbations differences in microbial community com- position have been described before in a study including 5 COPD patients and 11 cases with asthma bacterial communities clustered together but differed in composition from communi- ties of healthy controls .

For better readability we refer to mild COPD subtypes in the following for patients without QCT detectable changes in lungs and to severe COPD subtypes for patients with QCT detectable changes in lungs deviating from the GOLD nomenclature of COPD patients.
