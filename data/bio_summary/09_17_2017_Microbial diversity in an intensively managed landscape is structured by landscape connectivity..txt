B and C sourced higher proportions of OTUs from upstream soil and sediment soil--22.3 - 23.3 from up- stream soil 44.7 - 26.6 from upstream sediment sediment--38.49 - 26.30 from upstream soil 29.7 - 30.7 from upstreamsediment than from upstream water to soil--0.5 - 11.2 and to sediment--0.1 - 3.5.Notably the proportion of sequences in sediment sourced from upstream samples decreased with distance from the source Mantel R  0.30 P  0.007 for soil R  0.21 P  0.038 for sediment.

Networks in soil and sediment had degree dis- tributions significantly different from those in water Wilcoxon rank-sum test P  2.6 x 10-3 and P  1.6 x 10-24 respectively.Despite their similar power law exponents soil and sediment communities also had significantly different degree distribu- tions Wilcoxon rank-sum test P  5.7 x 10-10 due in part to fewer overall edges in the sediment network.DISCUSSIONConnectivity influences fluvial microbial community structureThe diversity and activity of microbial communities in lotic and soil environments have each received considerable research at- tention Fierer et al.

Most of the identified relationships had correlation strengths 0.5 including 1596 re- lationships in soil communities 405 in sediment communities and 1939 in water communities.

Similar to water and sediment communities water and soil communities were distinct from each other ANOSIM R  0.

Bayesian estimation indicated very little connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial soil and sediment sources.To identify whether ground and tile water could serve as dispersal pathways we compared ground and tile water com- munity composition with the soil sediment and river water samples.

all water vs water and sediment vs sediment and intergroup e.g.

Interestingly the soil and sediment communities were more spatially homogenous than the water communities whichFigure 4.

The consistent pairwise co-occurrence relationships with r values greater than 0.5 were deter- mined A between water and soil B between soil and sediment and C between water and sediment.

Soil pore water collected in the lysimeters was not analyzed for water chemistry due to the lim- ited volume available.DNA extraction 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencingGenomic DNA was isolated from soil sediment and water filter membrane samples using a modified protocol of the PowerSoilQR -htp 96-well Soil DNA Isolation Kit MO BIO Labora- tories Inc..

However there was significantly less contribution from upstream soil and sediment to downstream water samples 0.2 - 0.8 and 0.02 - 0.08 for sediment sources.
