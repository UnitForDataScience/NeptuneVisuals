The parameters recorded in this and past PlanHab substudies are now part of the new in-house PlanHab database - .DiscussionThe extent of experimental control within the PlanHab study reveals imminent shifts in food preference and human physiologyPlanHab experimental setup was tuned to control the effects of factors that have been identi- fied to contribute to changes in microbial community structure host lifestyle and diet  diurnal oscillations  exercise  and development .

Hence it is plausible that most relevant changes for the host physiological status took place at the level of molecular and chemical cross-talk between microbes and between microbes and the host.Resilience in microbial intestinal system towards short-term inactivityThe lack of directed changes in intestinal microbiome over the course of the PlanHab experi- ment points to a lag in response of microbial communities or possibly to an evolutionaryresilience in microbial intestinal system towards short-term inactivity  despite accompa- nying significant changes in intestinal environmental parameters.

We hypothesized that the cessation of exercise and hypoxia would result in quantitative and qualitative differences in microbial community structure that would enable elucidation of the first responding taxa linked to the inflammation of the host.Secondly based on observation that significant changes in a number of intestinal parameters developed over time we hypothesized that correlation of changes in microbial community structure and environment would enable identification of the key structuring environmentalCONSORT flowchart of participants recruitment and the cross-over designed PlanHab study trial flow.Interventions normoxic bed rest NBR hypoxic bed rest HBR and hypoxic ambulation HAmb.parameters.

Consequently for the development of the observed pathologies in host physiology other conditions than the sole presence or abundance of particular microbial type are necessary making the microbial metabolites the key effectors and mediators of signal for the real-time modification of host physiology.Changes in environmental parameters shape microbial activitiesNumerous characteristics of intestinal environment  that were measured in this and our past study  revealed that many of these variables were either correlated and also covar- ied over the course of experiment indicating a substantial and potentially hierarchical code- pendence between parameters within intestinal environment.

The detailed outline of the PlanHab project is given elsewhere - and Texts and is briefly summarized below.The PlanHab study experiments were performed between June 2012 when recruitment started and January 2014 when the last follow-up periods ended .

Bed rest period induced system wide negative modifications in host physiology - in addition to constipation and increased intestinal inflammation whereas a number of parameters such as gut permeability metabolic markers abundance diversity and community structure of butyrate producing microbial communities remained unaffected .Here we examine the structure composition and diversity of microbiome and additional parameters describing intestinal environment in the same PlanHab participants to elucidate the outcomes of physical inactivity in healthy male test participants during the run-in and con- secutive experimental phases.
