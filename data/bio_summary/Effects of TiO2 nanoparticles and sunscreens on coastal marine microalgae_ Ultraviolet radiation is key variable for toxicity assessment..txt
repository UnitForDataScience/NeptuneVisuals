this paper describes an experiment performed outdoors in natural sunlight conditions in- cluding ultraviolet radiation uvr and with uvr blocked on mixed microalgae populations four species from different key marine taxonomic groups nannochloropsis gaditana chaetoceros gracilis pleurochrysis roscoffensis and amphidinium carterae for three days exposed to a range of concentrations of three commercial sunscreens with variable tio2 concentrations highest concentration for sunscreen c followed by sunscreen a and sun- screen b did not contain tio2 in its composition.with regard to uvr effect in the absence of sunscreens the most sensitive species is the centric diatom chaetoceros gracilis and the least is nannochloropsis gaditana this last species presented the same behavior in the absence of uvr and with high sunscreen concentrations.

the toxicity gradient obtained for sunscreens and nanoparticles under uvr is tio2 nps n sunscreen c n sunscreen a n sunscreen b. the differential sensitivity of microalgae to sunscreens and tio2 nps can produce a change in the dynamics of phytoplankton populations and provoke undesirable ecological effects such as giving dinoflagellates more prominence.

there were four fixed factors uvr treatments with sunscreen type a b and c and tio2 nps concentrations of sunscreen and tio2 nps and species of phy- toplankton and two random factors day and hour of experiment.to assess the loss of cell density of each species a general linear model glm   was developed for each condition with uvr or uvr blocked with fixed and covariate factors.

further toxicity studies are needed to clarify the ef- fect on marine phytoplankton of the organic compounds contained in sunscreen formulations.conclusionsunscreens produce more h2o2 than tio2 nps alone the difference in terms of h2o2 production must be related to the presence of organiccompounds in a sunscreen formulation.

corresponding author.e-mail address m. sendra.recent studies have shown that sunscreen components are able to reach the marine environment after being released from human skin during swimming or washing via wastewater treatment plants .

on the other hand sun- screens may release high concentrations of inorganic nutrients capable of being used by phytoplankton and thus of enhancing microalgae growth .due to the complexity and variety of sunscreen formulations existing studies on the toxicity of these contaminants for phytoplankton have considered specific compounds such as benzophenone-3 bz-3 0160-4120c 2016 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.octyl methoxycinnamate omc 3-benzylidene camphor 3-bc 4- methylbenzylidene camphor 4-mbc isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate imc or p-aminobenzoic acid paba and mostly in freshwater species .

however studies on the ef- fect of sunscreen components in marine phytoplankton are still scarce .regarding inorganic uv-filters some authors have suggested that the toxicity of tio2 nps in freshwater organisms could be due to their photochemical properties  .

sunscreen formulations generally mix the anatase and rutile forms of tio2 which are the most frequent and photoreactive .

treatments with sun- screen showed significantly p b 0.001 higher concentrations of h2o2 than the treatment with tio2 nps .after 24 h of experiment and under direct exposure to sunlight the concentration of h2o2 decreased by 77.23 - 3.96 77.95 - 0.9862.47 - 11.43 and 66.3 - 8.4 with respect to the concentration at the start of the experiment for sunscreen a b c and tio2 nps respec- tively.

this could be explained by the photocatalytic nature of tio2 which would imply a limit value of ros production .in conditions with uvr blocked the maximum concentration of h2o2 was again obtained after 6 h of experiment 445.3 - 153.6 222.2 - 99.7 206.8 - 27.6 and 220.7 - 52.9 nm for sunscreen a b c and tio2 nps respectively while the concentration of the control was 154.9 - 16.5 nm.
