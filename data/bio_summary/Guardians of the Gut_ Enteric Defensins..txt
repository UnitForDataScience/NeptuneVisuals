This suggests that defensins have certain conditions in which they function optimally as such environmental factors may play a role in the regulation of the activity of enteric defensins.Because most defensins exert their effect on the membranes of cells scientists are interested in why defensins are essentially harmless to host cells at concentrations that kill microbial cells Wu et al.

Within this review we will explore current understanding and hypotheses regarding the structure regulation and physiological function of enteric defensins and close with a discussion of potential clinical interventions using defensins.OVERVIEW a- AND b-DEFENSINS AND THEIR LOCALIZATIONIn humans there are 17 described defensins found at various sites of the body Jarczak et al.

For our purposes it is important to note all known enteric defensins in humans are alpha defensins specifically Human Defensin 5 HD5 and Human Defensin 6 HD6.There are six a-defensins described in humans designated as DEFA 1-6.

2010 Vega and Caparon 2012.While much effort is devoted to understanding the function of defensins in relation to bacteria and other living organisms defensins have also been shown to exhibit direct antiviral activity and may play a key role in protecting hosts from enteric viral infections Wilson et al.

Therefore it isimportant to examine the large-scale effects of defensins on the host's microbiome and overall gut physiology.New evidence is beginning to uncover the effects of defensins on host microbiomes.

It remains to be seen if enteric defensins have a non-specific and generalized response to viral pathogens in the gut.Is there a recognition pattern like PRR's that can directly activate defensinsA wide variety of TLR agonists and MAMPs have been shown to be associated with the release of enteric defensins.

However the study of defensins is open with many important questions the answers to which could have valuable clinical applications Table 1.CONCLUDING REMARKSRecently developed advances in the field of antimicrobial peptides have fueled new interest into properties of the human enteric defensins HD5 and HD6 Stange 2017.
