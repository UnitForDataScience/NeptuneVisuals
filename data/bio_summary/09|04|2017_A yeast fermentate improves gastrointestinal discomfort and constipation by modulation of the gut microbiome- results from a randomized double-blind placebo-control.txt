The findings that the gut microbiome of constipated patients is dys- biotic and the reported in vitro positive effects of EpiCor on gut luminal environment and microbial compositionsuggest that EpiCor could have a favorable effect on constipation through modulation of the gut microbial community by increasing the numbers of beneficial bacterial groups.

The subjects allocated to either subgroup were not only report- ing different degrees of GI symptoms Table  but were also found to differ in their microbial community compos- ition at baseline clearly indicating a higher degree of gut microbial dysbiosis for the severe subgroup results not shown.

In this manner EpiCor intake by increasing bowel movements by for example increasing butyrate levels or other metabolites would result in changes in the composition of the gut microbial commu- nity in an indirect manner.ConclusionsDespite its low daily dose 500 mgday this study sug- gests that EpiCor fermentate has a positive effect on GI symptoms and stool parameters in individuals with symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel movements.

.Changes in gut microbial compositionGastrointestinal motility and gut microbiota are clearly associated Experiments performed in humanizedgerm-free mice suggest that on the one hand gut microbes modulate bowel movements and on the other hand changes in GI motility modify the resident micro- bial population  The ecological principles of rK selection have been proposed to explain this as GI tran- sit time decreases e.g.

The existence of subgroups of patients exhibiting different microbial signatures has been hypothe- sized 5 gut microbiome composition is largely individual- dependent and so if only minor changes in particular species are to be expected in constipation these may be masked by a high interindividual variability 6 gut micro- biome composition and constipation are largely affected by diet and so regional differences are also to be expected which may hamper direct comparison between studies 7 studies have been done in a limited number of individuals which under-powers statistical tests and 8 a general lack of attention has been given to the role of the gut micro- biome in constipation.

This allowed us to recruit individuals that actually suffered from constipation and to stratify the study population into two subgroups one larger group with marked symptoms of GI discomfort severe subgroup n  55 and a second group having milder symptoms moderate subgroup n  25.

This also ensured that there were no substantial differences in GI symptoms daily total scores DTS at baseline between EpiCor fermentate and placebo within each subgroup severe and moderate Table Primary objectiveTwo-week-interval averages obtained from the daily reported GI symptoms were calculated average of weeks 1 and 2 of run-in T1 baseline average of weeks 1 and2 of intervention T2 average of weeks 3 and 4 of intervention T3 and average of weeks 5 and 6 of inter- vention T4 Additional file .

Notably however within the moderate subgroup there is a significant relative increase of Akkermansia muciniphila p  0.0001 and p  0.036 at V2 and V3 respectively and a significant relative decrease in Blautia p  0.023 and p  0.001 at V2 and V3 respectively and Roseburia p  0.002 at V2 effects that were not observed within the severe subgroup Additional files and .DiscussionThe aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of EpiCor fermentate on GI discomfort by treating a population with symptoms of constipation and compare it to placebo in a parallel study.

Despite a clear placebo effect within the severe subgroup in the moderate subgroup EpiCor fermentate had a positive effect over time on five out of six GI symptoms domains.

Furthermore a recent study using in vitro gut models has shown that EpiCor fermentate is selectivelyfermented by the intestinal microbiota in the colon resulting in beneficial modulation of the intestinal microbiota and luminal environment The combin- ation of these findings suggests that repeated intake of EpiCor fermentate can positively affect the intestinal environment in humans thereby enhancing digestive comfort and ultimately contribute to improved immunity.
