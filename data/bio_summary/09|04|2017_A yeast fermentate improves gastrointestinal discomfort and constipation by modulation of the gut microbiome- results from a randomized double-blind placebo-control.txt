notably however within the moderate subgroup there is a significant relative increase of akkermansia muciniphila p  0.0001 and p  0.036 at v2 and v3 respectively and a significant relative decrease in blautia p  0.023 and p  0.001 at v2 and v3 respectively and roseburia p  0.002 at v2 effects that were not observed within the severe subgroup additional files and .discussionthe aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of epicor fermentate on gi discomfort by treating a population with symptoms of constipation and compare it to placebo in a parallel study.

however 'between groups' analysis clearly showed that epicor fermentate had significant positive effects on bloatingdistension p  0.033 and p  0.024 after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment respectively feeling of fullness p  0.004 and p  0.023 after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment respectively and general gi discomfort as evaluated from the daily total scores p  0.046 after 2 weeks of treatment on those subjects reporting milder symptoms moderate subgroup fig.

the averages calculated for all time points and the statistical significant differences 'within groups' over time can be seen in additional file here it is also evident that a significantimprovement of stool consistency is observed over time in the epicor-treated total cohort p  0.037 as opposed to placebo p  0.535. this is also observed within the severe epicor p  0.044 placebo p  0.424 and moder- ate epicor p  0.031 placebo p  0.425 subgroups.finally the impact of constipation on quality of life and general perceived stress have been assessed additional file and fig.

however again the moderate subgroup was less affected by this placebo effect and a significant improvement of items such as physical discomfort p  0.017 psychosocial discomfort p  0.027 and satisfaction p  0.013 was reported within the epicor-treated group as opposed to the placebo group p  0.435 p  0.129 and p  0.166 for physical discomfort psychosocial discomfort and satisfac- tion respectively additional file .

regarding general stress levels pss instrument a significant decrease in stress levels over time was reported within the epicor-treated group p  0.016 and p  0.044 for the total cohort and severe subgroup respectively in contrast to the placebo-treated group p  0.846 and p  0.555 for the total cohort and severe subgroup respectively additional file .

the findings that the gut microbiome of constipated patients is dys- biotic and the reported in vitro positive effects of epicor on gut luminal environment and microbial compositionsuggest that epicor could have a favorable effect on constipation through modulation of the gut microbial community by increasing the numbers of beneficial bacterial groups.

b. here a nearly significant reduction in stress levels was observed for epicor-treated total cohort p  0.094 and moderate subgroup p  0.070.secondary objectivefrom literature it is clear that constipation is associated with a dysbiotic gut microbial community - thus in order to investigate whether epicorconsumption altered the gut microbial composition fecal samples were collected at visits 1 baseline 2 and3.

in this manner epicor intake by increasing bowel movements by for example increasing butyrate levels or other metabolites would result in changes in the composition of the gut microbial commu- nity in an indirect manner.conclusionsdespite its low daily dose 500 mgday this study sug- gests that epicor fermentate has a positive effect on gi symptoms and stool parameters in individuals with symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel movements.

this allowed us to recruit individuals that actually suffered from constipation and to stratify the study population into two subgroups one larger group with marked symptoms of gi discomfort severe subgroup n  55 and a second group having milder symptoms moderate subgroup n  25. this also allowed us to investigate treatment efficacy on two sub- groups of patients suffering from different degrees of gi discomfort as it is possible that efficacy differs according to symptom severity the two subgroups of patients were shown to differ in terms of symptom severity stool frequency and consistency and quality of life parameters at baseline with the severe subgroup reporting more severe symp- toms of gi discomfort table fewer bowel move- ments and poorer quality of life as expected results not shown.

the subjects allocated to either subgroup were not only report- ing different degrees of gi symptoms table  but were also found to differ in their microbial community compos- ition at baseline clearly indicating a higher degree of gut microbial dysbiosis for the severe subgroup results not shown.

this also ensured that there were no substantial differences in gi symptoms daily total scores dts at baseline between epicor fermentate and placebo within each subgroup severe and moderate table primary objectivetwo-week-interval averages obtained from the daily reported gi symptoms were calculated average of weeks 1 and 2 of run-in t1 baseline average of weeks 1 and2 of intervention t2 average of weeks 3 and 4 of intervention t3 and average of weeks 5 and 6 of inter- vention t4 additional file .

despite a clear placebo effect within the severe subgroup in the moderate subgroup epicor fermentate had a positive effect over time on five out of six gi symptoms domains.

therefore this pilot study was intended to assess the effect of 6-week administration of epicor fermentate on gi symptoms and stool frequencyconsistency in a population with moderate to severe symptoms of intes- tinal discomfort and to determine if epicor treatment could lead to an improvement in quality of life.

despite the placebo effect noticed on gi symptoms a nearly signifi- cant improvement on stool frequency p  0.083 and p  0.090 after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment respectively and a significant improvement on stool consistency p  0.023 after 2 weeks of treatment was observed for the epicor-treated total cohort fig.
