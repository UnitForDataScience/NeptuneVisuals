for example young adults with type 1 diabetes are 10-fold more prone to the onset of cardiovascular diseases as compared with their healthy coun- terparts10 and the most prevalent cause of fatality among type 2 diabetes patients is cardiovascular-related11.in the present review we describe the relationships between the gut microbial environment in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients and hope that with increased understanding of these relationships novel therapeutic interventions can be developed.gut microbiota the resident microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract arereceived 16 october 2016 revised 23 february 2017 accepted 5 april 2017collectively referred to as the gut microbiota.

in a clinical study carried out by bosi et al.63 where intestinal abnormalities were observed in 81 type 1 diabetes patients and 40 healthy subjects it was shown that intestinal permeability was significantly increased in the type 1 diabetes patients as compared with healthy individuals indicating that poor intestinal barrier func- tion could contribute to type 1 diabetes pathogenesis.

additionally it was reported that wild-type non-obese diabetic nod mice presented with type 1 diabetes whereas nod mice lacking myd88 did not yet germ-free myd88- negative nod mice developed type 1 diabetes and this was attenuated when the mice were colonized with normal gut microbes27.type 1 diabetes in animal modelsdiabetes-prone biobreeding ratthe role of gut microbiota in mechanisms of type 1 diabetes autoimmunity have been reported in studies involving animal models.

metagenome-wide-association-study eval- uation of the gut microbial metagenome data of 345 type 2 diabetes patients and non-type 2 diabetes chinese individuals by qin et al.28 showed that genes enriched in the type 2 dia- betes group mainly comprised of opportunistic pathogens such as bacteroides caccae clostridium hathewayi clostridium ramo- sum clostridium symbiosum eggerthella lenta and e. coli which have been documented to result in human infections.

in the present report we review the labyrinth encom- passing the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.

type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common representing approximately 10 and 90 of cases respectively1.

although the exact causes of type 2 diabetes have yet to be completely eluci- dated various previous reports have associated type 2 diabetes with excessive visceral obesity5 inactive lifestyle lack of exercise and poor dietary habits6 along with genetic factors.

ascompared with type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes has a larger selection of treatment options including peritoneal insulin administrations and non-insulin pharmaceuticals as well as conscious modifications to lifestyle and dietary habits1.diabetes is becoming a worldwide public health issue pre- vailing at approximately 10 globally among adults7.

we will review these rela- tionships in detail.gut microbiota and type 2 diabetesobesity has been attributed to increasing the risk of multifacto- rial diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

additionally the gut microbiome might be a new biomarker for type 2 diabetes prediction as gut metagenome-based computational models could predict the type 2 diabetes-associated phenotype in glucose-intolerant patients29.
