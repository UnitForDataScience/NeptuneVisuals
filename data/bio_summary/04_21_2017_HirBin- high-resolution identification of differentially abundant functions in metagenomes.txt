The 112 bins that were not detected at the sub-bin level had a lower average abundance com- pared to other bins suggesting that their significance was lost due to too low power Mann-Whitney U-test p- value  2.210-16 Additional file When the identity cut-off was increased to 75 the difference between the non-significant bins with a significant sub-bin and the significant bins without a significant sub-bin decreased 396 bins that gained significance and 292 bins that lost significance.

Thus the GSEA analysis suggests that the analysis of sub-bins provides additional biological insight into the differences of the microbiome of between healthy individuals and individuals with t2d.Effects seen at the sub-bin level are often diluted at the bin levelTo further investigate the impact of sub-binning when using HirBin we analyzed two bins in more detail by studying the sub-binning profile for these bins at differ- ent sequence identity cutoffs.

Identification of differentially abundant genes pathways and functions can consequently be performed by statistical compari- son of the abundance of the bins between metagenomes sampled from different environments or conditions Functional binning of metagenomes is today a super- vised process where a reference sequence or the sequence reads are annotated using sequence homology often usingc The Authors.

The analysis using HirBin at 50 and 75 sequence similarity was compared to the analysis using TIGRFAM annotations without sub-binning bins.

The fold changes and false discovery rates of all bins and sub-bins at the different sequence similarity cut-offs are presented in Additional file The number of detected representative sub-bins were 15740 at the 50 and 10798 at the 75 sub-binning level compared to the number of detected bins TIGR- FAMs that were 2465.

Thus at a 50 sequence identity cutoff HirBin identified 987 add- itional bins where the significant effect only could be identified at a more specific level while the effect was lost for 112 bins.

Furthermore integrative analysis using GSEA showed compared to the analysis using traditional bins a highernumber of significantly over-represented Gene Ontology terms when using sub-bins calculated with HirBin.

In the unsupervised annotation step sub- binning step the amino acid sequences of the annotated domains are clustered based on sequence similarity using a provided sequence similarity cutoff which gener- ates the sub-bins.

The coordinates of the annotated genes were converted from amino acid sequences to nucleotide refer- ence coordinates to facilitate in mapping the raw reads to the reference sequence for each annotated domain.Unsupervised clusteringThe protein sequences belonging to each TIGRFAM do- main is for a given amino acid sequence similarity cutoff clustered by HirBin using either UCLUST clusterfast in USEARCH v8.0 or agglomerative hierarchical clustering clusteragg in USEARCH v8.0 .

The proportion of sig- nificant sub-bins decreased at the stricter sequence identity cutoff 75 which resulted in 10798 sub-bins of which 1248 11.6 were significant.A large proportion of the significant sub-bins corre- sponded to bins that were not significant at the bin TIGRFAM level.
