the complete case analysis is followed by an assessment of the impact of any missing data.the sample size calculation was based on preliminary measurements the baseline mean abdominal pain severity primary endpoint was estimated as 9 with a standard deviation of 3.5. it was predicted that after 3 months a mean decrease would be observed in the probiotic group with a means of 2 and 0 in the probiotic and placebo groups respectively and a standard deviation of 3.5. assuming an allocation ratio of 11 to guarantee 80 power to detect an effect size of 0.57 mean difference of 2 with standard deviation of 3.5 for the abdominal pain severity between probiotic and placebo a total effectivesample size of 100 was required.

in male patients the 3-month trial of probi- otic reduced the log of baseline fecal calprotectin by 75. in non-adjusted terms male patients on probiotic had a fecal calprotectin that went from 36 lgg iqr 14-103 to 42 lgg iqr 16-118 while patients on placebo went from 66 lgg iqr 34-135 to 106 lgg iqr 52-162. thus in male patients the probiotic prevented a rise in fecal calprotectin during the 3-month trial p  0.05.acute diverticulitis episodesonly one patient was hospitalized with diverticulitis during the study period at which time the patient was withdrawn from the trial the patient was on placebo.

the current study was not powered to assess the effectiveness of the probiotic at preventing episodes of acute diverticulitis--but nevertheless it is an undeniably important outcome experienced by 11 patients 7.7 3 and 8 on probiotic and placebo respectively.

we hypothesized that a probiotic would reduce abdominal pain in such patients.

methods we conducted a single-center double-blind placebo-controlled trial of probiotic treatment symprove in adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic non- acute symptomatic diverticular disease.

143 patients were randomized to receive 1 mlkgday of probiotic liquid n  72 or placebo n  71 daily for 3 months.

.symprove is a liquid multi-strain probiotic that has been beneficial in reducing symptom scores in patients with classic ibs sisson et al.

the null hypothesis tested throughout is that of no difference between the groups receiving symprove or placebo over 3 months in terms of the average abdominal pain scores level of inflammatory markers and other related symptoms as well as diverticulitis-episode-free time.methodsstudy designthis was a single-center double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a 3-month probiotic treatment symprove in adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic non-acute symptomatic diverticular disease.

the placebo and probiotic were packaged in identical sealed boxes identified by a trial batchcode number only.

the time-by-treatment interaction was found to be non- significant p  0.18 indicating that the reduction over time was similar in the probiotic and placebo groups.the mean change of total abdominal pain in the probi- otic group from baseline 9.5 sd  7.7 range 0-28 n  62 to 3 months to 5.9 sd  6.8 range 0-24 n  49 based on the corresponding paired data was 3.2 sd  5.8 range -14 to 20 n  47. the mean total abdominal pain for the placebo group was 7.5 sd  7.0 range 0-22 n  62 at baseline and 6.2 sd  6.5 rangehalitosis1000dizzyweak20000-23 n  55 at 3 months.
