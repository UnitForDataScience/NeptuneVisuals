Fifteen patients on probiotic and eight patients on placebo P  0.10 did not complete the trial.Table shows that a total of 25 patients experienced 28 adverse events 15 were on the probiotic and 13 on placebo Chi-square test P  0.64 10 of which resulted in with- drawal of the trial 8 were on the probiotic and 2 on placebo Fisher's exact test P  0.27.

It was predicted that after 3 months a mean decrease would be observed in the probiotic group with a means of 2 and 0 in the probiotic and placebo groups respectively and a standard deviation of 3.5.

Although the mean in the probiotic group was slightly higher no significant dif- ference in baseline abdominal pain severity between the two arms of the trial was found mean difference  2 95 CI -0.62 to 4.6 P  0.13.Abdominal pain severity was first analyzed in terms of the sum of the seven daily scores yielding a continuous outcome ranging from 0 to 28 with larger values indicatingfor the baseline value and eGFR category the mean dif- ference between probiotic and placebo in terms of the reduction at 3 months was found to be -0.54 95 CI-2.4 to 1.3 P  0.56.

The current study was not powered to assess the effectiveness of the probiotic at preventing episodes of acute diverticulitis--but nevertheless it is an undeniably important outcome experienced by 11 patients 7.7 3 and 8 on probiotic and placebo respectively.

We hypothesized that a probiotic would reduce abdominal pain in such patients.

Methods We conducted a single-center double-blind placebo-controlled trial of probiotic treatment Symprove in adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic non- acute symptomatic diverticular disease.

143 patients were randomized to receive 1 mLkgday of probiotic liquid N  72 or placebo N  71 daily for 3 months.

In relation to placebo the probiotic signifi- cantly decreased the frequency of four of the eight secondary endpoints constipation diarrhea mucorrhea and back pain P  0.04.
