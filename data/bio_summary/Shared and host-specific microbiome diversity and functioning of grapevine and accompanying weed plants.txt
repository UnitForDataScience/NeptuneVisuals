Such interactions play key roles for soil quality plant productivity and plant health by for example mineralizing soil organic matter stimulating plant defence mechanisms andor inhibiting phytopathogens Lugtenberg and Kamilova 2009 Com- pant et al.

phyla classes genera and OTUs were conserved across different plant compart- ments and plant species although the relative abundance of the common taxa varied across the five plant species.

As different plant species and varieties are characterized by distinct root exudation patterns the plant exerts a pro- nounced effect on root microbiota Micallef et al.

Despite the significant differences in microbiomes associated with dif- ferent plant species rhizosphere samples of the five plant species tested shared 145 OTUs which contributed to 52.4 of the total microbial abundance in the rhizosphere.

Constrained analysis of principal coordinates CAP of Bray-Curtis dissimilarities based on 16S rRNA gene V5-V6 regions split into the rhizosphere and root plant compartment and constrained to the plant grouping factor.
