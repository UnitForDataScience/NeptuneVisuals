However 'lysis from without' LO can occur when a large number of phage more than 100 attach to the bacterial cell and in the absence of phage replication cause membrane swelling and bulging subsequent hole formation cytoplasmic leakage and cell death Tarahovsky Ivanitsky and Khusainov  Abedon  Kazi and Annapure .Post-harvest phage applicationsDirect application of phage to foodDirect application methods include spraying food with phage dipping food in a phage preparation or adding phage as liquid to a large volume of food Hagens and Loessner .

In contrast the exclusively lytic lifecycle is the fun- damental process behind phage therapy and phage biocontrol with an endpoint resulting in death of the host cell and release of lytic phage.Due to the narrow host range of phage strain specific in most cases cocktails consisting of two or more phage can be used to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum and reduce the risk of phage resistance.FOODBacteriocinsWhile bacteriocins can be produced by a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria LAB bacteriocins are of particular interest to the food industry for a number of reasons.

Based on this concept it has been possible to produce improved phage in terms of host range and infectivity through a process of phage 'training' which simply involves serial passage of the phage in the same clonal host population whereby the phage can rapidly evolve to overcome the initial steps of phage re- sistance Ebert .

The study by Liu et al  also revealed that the phage are capable of replication at refrigeration temperature al- though with increased latent periods suggesting their suitability for biocontrol of E. coli O157H7 on beef during storage or trans- port.The nature of the food environment can be a significant factor in phage biocontrol strategies whereby phage incorpo- ration into the food matrix may require higher phage titres than when applying the phage to the surface owing to the re- duced probability of phage-target bacterium contact.

In this regard a liposome encapsulated Salmonella phage cocktail proved significantly more stable in simulated gastric juice than non-encapsulated phage and improved phage retention in the chicken gastrointestinal tract with encapsulated phage being detected in the cecum samples of 38.1 of chickens 72 h after oral administration compared to only 9.5 of chickens harbour- ing non-encapsulated phage Colom et al.

Sandia National Laboratories Albuquerque New Mexico have developed a phage host-range expansion technol- ogy which claims to increase the host range of phage reduce the number of phage required for cocktails and can mutate known phage strains for specific bacteria of interest.

who propose that the adverse conditions of the gastroin- testinal tract or the inability of phage to reach target bacteria may represent obstacles to phage efficacy and must be overcome through novel strategies.The results have been more promising with regard to phage use for pathogen biocontrol in poultry with treatment schedules having an impact on phage efficacy.

As a specific example Meaden Paszkiewicz and Koskella  revealed that phage resistance in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae resulted in a substantial cost in terms of growth when in its tomato plant host with reduced den- sities recorded relative to the phage sensitive strain but which was not observed in nutrient-rich media.Furthermore it is thought that phage have a stronger evo- lutionary potential owing in part to their shorter generation times and larger population sizes Gandon and Michalakis .

There are im- portant considerations when using phage for post-harvest food applications first most foods are solid and hence the surface mi- crostructure will influence phage diffusion rates bacteria may not be readily accessible to phage and bacterial numbers will most likely be low assuming good hygienic standards have been met Hagens and Loessner .
