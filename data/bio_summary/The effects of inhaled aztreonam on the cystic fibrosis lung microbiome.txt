Moreover it may be possible to use signa- tures within the microbiome of individuals with CF to predict treatment response to particular CF therapeutics.In this retrospective study a cohort of 24 patients with at least two sputum samples collected pre- and post- AZLI treatment initiation were used to analyze changes in the CF microbiota following AZLI therapy.

Azithromycin has been shown to considerably reduce exacerbation frequency improveweight gain and reduce lung function decline in those with chronic P. aeruginosa infection It also has broad activity against microbiome constituents perhaps explaining its importance in CF treatment Even DNase has been shown to release antimicrobial peptidesdefensins bound by sputum DNA and induce changes in cultured organisms recovered following treatment initiation Despite only 18 of samples being taken from patients during concurrent systemic therapies marked differences in the microbiota were found when compared to the samples from patients taken off systemic therapies.

Moreover while some patients for example 11 and 21 were dominated by Pseudomonas others for example 9 and 13 had a more diverse microbiome composed of organisms belonging to several different genera.Changes induced in the microbiome following initiation of AZLIFrom our samples no differences were noted in alpha diversity in those samples collected prior to and post- initiation of AZLI even when samples were filtered on the basis of receipt of systemic therapy Fig.

To determine if this may be the case we sought to define the changes induced in the CF microbiome following the initiation of AZLI and correlate whether microbiome composition influenced response to therapy.MethodsPatients and sample collectionSince 1997 the Calgary Adult Cystic Fibrosis Clinic CACFC has kept and maintained a frozen repository of sputum from adult CF patients submitted for clinical assessment.

responders versus non-responders and therefore potentially biasing our findings.Future studies assessing investigational CF agents would be well advised to prospectively incorporate sputum serum and urine biobanking of specimens that would allow for a retrospective analysis of factors associating with treatment outcomes including the microbiome metagenome metabolome infammasone and resistome as technological advancements continue.ConclusionsResults from our study suggest that the CF microbiome is relatively resilient to AZLI perturbations.

Ultimately 60-80 of CF patients will become chronic- ally infected with P. aeruginosa Chronic infection Correspondence 1Department of Microbiology Immunology and Infectious Diseases The University of Calgary Calgary AB Canada4Department of Medicine The University of Calgary 3330 Hospital Drive NWCalgary AB CanadaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlewith P. aeruginosa and its conversion to an alginate hyper-producing mucoid phenotype is associated with progressive decline in lung function worsening quality of life increased risk of hospitalization and reduced survival Accordingly novel management strategies for both acute and chronic infections have been at the forefront of efforts to improve outcomes in CF.

Indeed prelimin- ary data suggest that normal flora derived from individ- uals with CF are markedly more resilient to the effects of antibiotics relative to those derived from normal popula- tions infrequently exposed to antibiotics .The present cohort and CF patients in general experi- ence a tremendous treatment burden with polypharmacy and multiple other antibiotics respiratory therapies and nutritional and gastrointestinal supplements that may further confound our findings.

Moreover their work suggests that Prevotella isolates may protect P. aeruginosa from the effects of antimicrobial agents thereby suggesting that the constituents in the CF microbiota may alter treatment responsiveness.Similar to the present study Bernarde et al.

Further- more no correlation has ever been demonstrated between improvements in lung function and decline in P. aeruginosa density  - This suggests that these inhaled antibiotics may have additional unknown mechanisms of action.Recently a complex polymicrobial community ofmicroorganisms residing in the lower airways referred to as the CF lung microbiota has been recognized Many of these organisms are specifically not cultured or ignored entirely through traditional culture-based approaches However the role of the CF microbiome at this point in health and disease is relatively unknown.
