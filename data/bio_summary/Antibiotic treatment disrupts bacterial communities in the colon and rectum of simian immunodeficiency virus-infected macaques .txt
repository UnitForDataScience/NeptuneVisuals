A further interesting trend revealed by PCoA of the samples from before and after the antibiotic treatment was that the bacterial communities from all three of the sample sites were more similar after the antibi- otic treatment than they had been before the antibiotic treat- ment as demonstrated by clustering of the post-antibiotic sam- ples in PCoA plots Fig.

Comparing all of the samples from before closed symbols and after open symbols the antibiotic treatment demonstrated that there was a greater degree of similarity between the bacterial communities at each site after the antibiotic treatment B.

This trend was further demonstrated by PCoA of samples taken after the antibiotic treatment which did not show distinctive clustering C. The antibiotic treatment led to increased species diversity in the colon mucosa but decreased diversity in the stool- associated communities while rectal swabs showed a minor but not statistically significant decrease in diversity.

LEfSe analysis of the bacterial communities of the colon biopsies A stool B rectal swabs C and across all sites D before and after the antibiotic treatment demonstrated that facultative anaerobic bacterial taxa including Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae were significantly expanded after the antibiotic treatment while many fermentative obligate anaerobes such as Ruminococcaceae were depleted.6FEMS Microbiology Letters 2017 Vol.

qPCR of total 16S rRNA genes revealed that the stool blue squares had a significantly higher bacterial load than did the colon mucosa red circles and that the total bacterial load before the antibiotic treatment closed symbols was significantly greater than the bacterial load after the antibiotic treatment open symbols in both compartments A.

However after the antibiotic treatment the rectal swab samples did not show a significant reduction in the total bacterial load although some rectal swab samples did show reduced bacterial loads after the antibiotic treatment Fig.

The specific changes to microbiome function associated with antibiotic treatment in these animals are the subject of ongoing metagenomic studies.Colonic microbiota play a key role in maintaining homeostais of the mucosal immune system Belkaid and Hand  and disruption of the microbiome by antibiotic treatment may also influence immunity.

Helicobacteraceae was identified as being significantly depleted after the antibiotic treatment only when the colon biopsy sam- ples were analyzed independently by LEfSe analysis.Finally we estimated the total bacterial load and Helicobacter load at each sample site before and after the antibiotic treat- ment using qPCR targeting either all bacterial 16S rRNA genes or only Helicobacter 16S rRNA genes Fig.

Further inves- tigation of the dynamics of intestinal bacterial communities during combination antibiotic therapies and assessment of an- tibiotic resistance genes will be valuable to understand these mechanisms.At all of the sample sites the antibiotic treatment led to in- creased abundances of similar bacterial phylotypes especially Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae.

After the antibiotic treatment there were increased abundances of similar taxa of facultative anaerobic bacteria including Lactobacillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae at each sample site.Keywords macaque microbiome antibiotics SIV HIV rectal swabINTRODUCTIONAntibiotics are widely used in human health and veterinary practices and are known to disrupt the gastrointestinal GI mi- crobiota Becattini Taur and Pamer .
