2006. at this point however we cannot rule out the possibility that these ants regularly acquire related bacterial strains from the environment and that these bacteria while symbiotic are not solely confined to the guts of argentine ants.

first argentine ants har- boured low-density bacterial communities with low qpcr-based estimates of symbiont titre and a surpris- ing prevalence of failed bacterial 16s rrna amplifica- tion across castes and stages of development.

2011. accordingly amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes suggested strong impacts of dietary regime on the bacterial communities of 30 argentine ants fig.

12 340 quality reads per individual among these antscombined with the stronger tendencies for dominance by single bacterial species and strains it would appear that bacterial communities of argentine ants are near the low end of the diversity spectrum among insects.

rice canyon 1996  1998 showed comparatively higher 'success' rates of bacterial amplification table s8 appendix s2 supporting information.we were interested in determining whether there was any evidence for shifts in bacterial density across the trophic shift in rice canyon experienced between the early 1996-1998 collections and those obtained several years later in 2002-2003. workers from before the shift with quality dna templates showed lower rates of 16s rrna amplification failure 21.9 n  32 than those collected subsequently 49.1 n  53 fisher's exact test p  0.02. they also showed lower although non- significant proportions of samples yielding weak 16s rrna amplification 56.3 of n  32 with band intensi- ties 0.77 compared to the lower trophic level workers from the later time point 73.6 with weak amplifica- tion out of n  63 fisher's exact test p  0.15. how- ever when examining qpcr data we found no significant differences in normalized bacterial densities across these time points fig.

in addition the presence ofthese mixed community types showed a strong correla- tion with relative 16s rrna band intensities all were found exclusively in ants with 0.77 relative 16s rrna band intensity scores while ants scoring above this value possessed communities dominated mostly by sin- gle taxa fig.

our frequent failure to amplify 16s rrna from argentine ants appears instead to be part of an emerging phenomenon across the ants rubin et al.

ants from argentina were collected in 2009. invasive ants from rice canyon ca are split into two time points with year abbreviations 96-98 and 02-03 corresponding to times when they were intermediate vs. low on the trophic scale in this habitat.

variance was high for introduced argen- tine ants in rice canyon and in ants fed in the labora- tory on experimental diets.

in contrast variance was generally low with some outliers for field-caught argentine ants from their native range and for the small number of surveyed introduced ants from california when reared under standard laboratory conditions fig.

thus while most argentine ants have few bacteria there are several strong exceptions under both natural and artificial con- ditions.functional analysisto infer the potential functions of common bacteria from argentine ants we utilized published genomes from close relatives addressing whether these microbes encoded intact pathways for nitrogen metabolism.
