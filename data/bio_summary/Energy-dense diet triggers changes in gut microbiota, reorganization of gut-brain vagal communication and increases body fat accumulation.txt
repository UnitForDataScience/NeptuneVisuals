While our study did not establish whether gut microbiota dysbiosis is sufficient to promote vagal remodeling colonization of germ free animals with dysbiotic microbiota has previously been found to induce hypothalamic inflammation Duca et al.

Therefore the potential effect of minocycline in LFD rats may be related to modulation in microbiota composition rather than a direct anti-inflammatory effect.Antibiotics-driven modulation of gut microbiota has traditionally been conducted via oral delivery of broad spectrum antibiotics at doses ranging from 40 to 500 mg daily Membrez et al.

There is evidence that the GI microbiota contribute to the development of obesity Montiel- Castro et al.

Conventionalization of germ-free animals with microbiota from lean or obese donors results in recapitulation of the donor phenotype Ridaura et al.

Interestingly diet composition rather than adiposity affects the microbiota composition de La Serre et al.

These treatments led to acute and dramatic decreases in microbiota diversity and abundance with Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes not being the most abundant phyla Carvalho et al.

2003 and motility has beenVaughn et al.Page 11demonstrated to modify microbiota composition Kashyap et al.

Therefore diet-shifted microbiota may alter vagal satiety signaling to the hindbrain feeding centers to increase energy intake and adiposity de Lartigue et al.2011.The goal of our study was to determine whether HFD-induced High-fat-diet-induced changes in gut microbiota composition can drive remodeling of the vagal pathway to stimulate body fat accumulation.METHODSMale Sprague-Dawley rats 460 g BW Simonsen Laboratories CA were individually housed in a temperature-controlled vivarium with ad libitum access to food and water 12- hour lightdark schedule.

Normalization of the microbiota composition in HFD rats using minocycline was protective against HFD-induced neuronal damage and increase in adiposity showing that gut microbiota dysbiosis is necessary for HFD-driven deleterious effects on gut-brain signaling.

While effective in promoting weight loss such treatment did not result in normalization of the HFD-associated microbiota hence in this study we chose to use a lower dose and a different rout of administration to avoid wiping out the gut microbiota.
