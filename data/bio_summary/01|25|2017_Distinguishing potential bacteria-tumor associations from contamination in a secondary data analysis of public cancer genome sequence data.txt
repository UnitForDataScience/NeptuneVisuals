Microbial contamination has been identified in nucleic acid extraction spin columns where column contamination during manufacturing was responsible for the discovery of a novel DNA virus Another example of microbial contamination in a hu- man genomics project was the identification of HPV-18 in cervical cancer and nine other cancer types from TCGA This was determined to be contamination in the non-cervical cancer samples when it was realized that the HPV-18 reads had characteristics of the typical HPV-18 integration in HeLa cells and lacked reads aligning to the regions of the HPV-18 genome that are typically not integrated  Therefore the pres- ence of HPV-18 in the non-cervical cancer TCGA data suggests that HeLa cells which contain this HPV-18 integration were actually the cause of the contamination  Additionally contamination from liver cancer samples was the source of HBV in one kidney cancer TCGA sample Bacterial presence in TCGA dataIn order to determine the microbial component of vari- ous cancers we analyzed the relative abundance subse- quently referred to as abundance of bacteria-derived paired-end Illumina sequencing in TCGA data that was made available in the Sequence Read Archive SRA as previously described Briefly reads were aligned to the human genome and RefSeq with Burrows-Wheeler aligner BWA ALNSAMPE a likely taxonomic assign- ment was made for each read pair Additional file Figure S1 and the results Additional file were loaded into a database for analysis and visualization with Krona and MicroView which can be found at MicroView is an interactive website and derivative of our LGTview which enables the interrogation of metadata using a graphical interface connected to an underlying data- base of raw data for each bacterial read pair Additional file MicroView is referenced in the remainder of the manuscript to denote when data was mined from Micro- View that could not be represented in an individual fig- ure.

However it is important to note that only 3 of 26 normal samples and 87 of 425 tumor samples contained bacterial read pairs at the time this data was downloaded and analyzed Table From the samples containing bacteria the normal samples only had 4526 bacterial read pairs compared to 983611 bacterial read pairs from the tumor samples Table The GBM dataset had approximately the same number of bacterial read pairs per sample for both the tumor and paired normal samples Table Both the tumor and normal samples had about a third of the read pairs from Ralstonia picketti with low levels of read pairs from Enterobacteriaceae Pseudomonas aeruginosa and M. tu- berculosis complex Additional file Figure S3.

Therefore for example Pseudomonas reads should be considered Pseudomonas- like reads.Nine cancer types were examined Table and found to have differing abundances of putative bacterial read pairs ranging from 11 of patients with at least one sample containing bacterial read pairs in lung squamous cell carcinoma LUSC to 100 of patients having at least one sample with bacterial read pairs in STAD Table STAD AML and ovarian serous cystadeno- carcinoma OV have large proportions of Pseudomonas Acinetobacter and Mycobacterium read pairs respect- ively Fig.

Enterobacteriaceae Propionibacterium Ralstonia and Staphylococcus taxa MicroView.Dominant bacteria in TCGA sequencing projectsAll of the cancer types investigated had one or more samples containing read pairs present that were assigned to bacterial taxa Table However only STAD and kid- ney papillary carcinoma KIRP had more sequencingruns with bacterial read pairs than sequencing runs without any bacterial read pairs present Table Additional file Figure S2.

It does not appear that filtering for these potential contami- nants substantially altered the alpha diversity of any cancer type Additional file Figure S5.DiscussionLack of evidence supporting contamination as origin of some dominant bacterial speciesThrough this comprehensive evaluation of the bacterial taxa present in the Illumina paired-end reads from an early release of TCGA data we describe the presence of bacteria associated with specific cancer types.

A subset of these viruses are known to inte- grate into the human genome  while viruses parasites and bacteria can all promote cancer through other mechanisms Of the bacteria known to be associated with carcino- genesis the mechanisms linking H. pylori to gastric car- cinoma and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma are best understood  In addition to H. pylori many other microbes have been associated with various carcinomas  For example S. haemato- bium with bladder carcinoma Salmonella typhi with gallbladder cancer Chlamydia pneumoniae with lung cancer Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus bovis with colon cancer and Escherichia coli and Fusobacterium spp.

Some DNA extraction methods are preferred for breaking bacterial cell walls meaning that samples undergoing methods that are more efficient at breaking the bacterial cell wall such as bead beating could have a higher bacterial yield than those ex- tracted with other methods.

In addition all Ralstonia read pairs were removed from the AML dataset and all Mycobacterium read pairs were removed from the OV and GBM datasets.Gene feature calculationsThe mappings of each bacterial read pair to all of the complete bacterial genomes in RefSeq were combined with genome annotations to determine the gene features for each bacterial read pair alignment.Additional filesAuthors' contributionsKMR drafted the manuscript developed the pipeline analyzed the data and provided guidance to KEA.

5 The log10-transformed ratios of bacterial read pairs from a specific taxon to the total number of bacterial read pairs from that patient were calculated for all ovarian cancer patients.

Therefore all cancer types were subsampled to the number of bacterial read pairs from GBM which had the fewest bacterial read pairs.
