Hypothetically even atypical pathogens that are not yet annotated in any database would become discernable although we have not encountered such a case among our samples.Multi-locus sequence typing of pathogens using unbiased sputum sequencesMulti-locus sequence typing MLST is a well- established method to characterize isolates of a given microbial species in the context of previously observed strains of that species via DNA sequencing of a limited pre-defined group of diagnostic genes Traditional MLST requires the isolation and culture of microbes of interest followed by specific PCR assays targeting the genes used for strain typing.

This agrees with previous studies which suggested that free human DNA in the lung stems from disintegrating inflammatory cells such as neutrophils that release DNA into sputum particularly in the case of the diseased lung tissue leading to an increased sputum viscosity Conversely healthy subjects produced smaller volumes of sputum with lower DNA concentrations but their re- sidual DNA was also mostly of human origin Additional file Figure S2.Lung microbiota composition varies strongly across individualsAfter a limited conservative assembly of the non- human sequence fraction into contigs approximately half of the assembled nucleotides could be assigned a taxonomic identity through homology searches irre- spective of subject groups Fig.

Compositionally the CF flora only marginally overlapped with those of the healthy and smoker populations.Observed microbiota in CF subjects match clinical diagnosisFor five of the six CF subjects all bacterial pathogens identified in the clinical culture diagnosis were alsoidentified through the DNA sequencing each with at least 10000 bp mapped to their genome Additional file Table S2.

The sequences of previously typed strains used for building the tree were downloaded from The tree was rooted using Bordetella pertussis GenBank accession LN849008 as an outgroup.Identification of antibiotic resistance genes and cassettes We used the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Data- base to search for resistance-conferring genes in our samples.

The code for this analysis is available at MLST and phylogenetic placement of abundant clonal speciesWe constructed a maximum likelihood tree for S. malto- philia using RAxML under the GTRCAT model with 1000 bootstraps using the concatenated sequence composed of the seven housekeeping genes atpD gapA guaA mutM nuoD ppsA and recA.

We then separated and quantified human and non-human read pairs the latter were further assembled into contigs Additional file Table S1 and annotated using homology-based searches see .The observed DNA concentrations in sputum varied across subject groups with CF and COPD patients pre- senting on average higher DNA concentrations than the healthy controls Fig.

The predicted variants were further filtered with the help of VcfFilter available with the FreeBayes package using a minimum quality score of 30 and minimum total read depth of 6 reads per position.Contig binning via entropy landscapesWe recruited all paired-end reads that had contributed to the assembly process back against the non-human contigs using Bowtie2.

The majority of strains isolated from CF patients belong to the species A. xylosoxidans which is also an intrinsically multidrug- resistant opportunistic pathogen Aside from the patients strains can also be found in a variety of aquaticenvironments ranging from moist soils to dialysis solu- tions Achromobacter infections have been generally observed in older patients with pulmonary diseases but their implication in deteriorating lung function has remained unclear Accurate identification and discrimination of different Achromobacter species has been a challenging task due to limited taxonomic delin- eation.
