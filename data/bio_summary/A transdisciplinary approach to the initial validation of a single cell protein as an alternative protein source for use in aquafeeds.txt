the food conversion ratio fcr of shrimp fed diets containing kbm shr-kl and shr-kh were not statistically different than those fed the control diet shr-c 1.70 - 0.12 orthogonal contrast q test -0.99 p  0.7. the shrimp fed the shr-kh had a statistically greater fcr than those fed shr-kl orthogonal contrast q test  -4.48 p  0.05.in the consumer taste trial diet did influence shrimp preference df  4 kh 2  9.8 p  0.05. this was largely because shrimp fed diet shr-c received more votes as ''most preferred'' 50 of all first place votes.

a second issue associated with sub-scale pellet manufacturing was the inclusion of air bubbles in the shrimp diet shr-kh 100 kbm replacement that did not sink as well as the other two diets shr-lk and shr-c. while all pellets were consumed by shrimps those fed shr-hk did need to swim in the water column to retrieve some of the pellets while those fed shr-lk and shr-c mostly fed off the tank floor.
