However the effect of I. aquatica ethanolic extract on the metabolites in the body has remained unknown.Purpose This study provides new insights on the changes of endogenous metabolites caused by I. aquatica ethanolic extract and improves the understanding on the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of I. aquatica ethanolic extract.Methods By using a combination of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR with multivariate analysis MVDA the changes of metabolites due to I. aquatica ethanolic extract administration in obese diabetic-induced Sprague Dawley rats OBSTZIA were identified.Results The results suggested 19 potential biomarkers with variable importance projections VIP above 0.5 which include creatinecreatinine glucose creatinine citrate carnitine 2-oxoglutarate succinate hippurate leucine 1-methylnicotinamice MNA taurine 3-hydroxybutyrate 3-HB tryptophan lysine trigonelline al- lantoin formiate acetoacetate AcAc and dimethylamine.

Metabolites such as TCA intermediates succinate 2-oxoglutarate and succinate amino acids tryptophan AcAc and dimethylamine were found to be unimproved by comparing with the ND group.DiscussionEffect of I. aquatica ethanolic extract on glucose and energy metabolismFrom the serum result I. aquatica ethanolic extract is capable of promoting glycolysis by lowering the glucose level.

These results indicate that I. aquatica ethanolic extract possessed anti-hyperglycemic activity as it postpones the glucose absorption for postprandial glucose as been proven from their OGTT result increase the glucose uptake in the adipocyte and lowers the glucose level after 4 weeks of treatment.

Therefore the aim of the present study was1 to find potential biomarkers in urine that were altered by I. aquatica ethanolic extract and 2 to improve the understanding of the ther- apeutic efficacy and mechanism of I. aquatica ethanolic extract as an anti-hyperglycemic agent.Materials and methodsSolvents and chemicalsNon-deuterated KH2PO4 sodium deuterium oxide NaOD tri- methylsilyl propionic acid-d4 sodium salt TSP deuterium oxide D2O sodium azide carboxymethyl cellulose CMC and metformin were purchased from Merck Darmstadt Germany.Preparation of I. aquatica ethanolic extractThe aerial part of I. aquatica was collected at Universiti Putra Malaysia Agricultural Park Serdang Malaysia and dried at 40 degC in an oven for 5 days.

This suggests that I. aquatica ethanolic extract especially at 1000 ugml possess in- sulin-mimetic and insulin-sensitizing activities during enhancing glu- cose uptake into 3T3F442A adipocytes.Preliminary studyTable S1 shows the OGTT result for rats treated with different doses 150 250 and 500 mgkg of I. aquatica ethanolic extract.

All of these results suggested that the metabolic pathways in-cluding carbohydrate and lipids were markedly disturbed in the dia- betic state.Table 2Effect of I. aquatica ethanolic extract on adiponectin secretion from 3T3F442A adipocytes.Values expressed as means - standard deviations from four independent experiments.p  .05 p  .01 p  .001 compared with control incubation using Student t-test.Dp  .05 DDp  .0 compared to 100 nM insulin using Student t-test.High level of HDL in OBSTZIA rats compared to OBSTZ was due to I. aquatica ethanolic extract administration.

In short I. aquatica ethanolic extract improved the EGP level but did not improve energy production adenosine triphosphate ATP via the TCA cycle.Effect of I. aquatica ethanolic extract on lipid metabolismA higher level of formiate was also found in the OBSTZIA groupcompared to others .

From the results shown in  an increase in the urinary al- lantoin concentration of OBSTZIA rats shows that I. aquatica ethanolic extract has promising effects in improving kidney functions especially glomerular filtration rate GFR.ConclusionIn conclusion I. aquatica ethanolic extract manage to upregulate metabolites such as creatininecreatine carnitine MNA trigonelline leucine lysine 3-HB and downregulating metabolites including glu- cose and TCA's intermediate.

Although I. aquatica ethanolic extract did not significantly alter the glucose concentration in the serum biochemistry result the PLSDA result A and B showed that only a few metabolites in the glucose region can be identified in OBSTZIA compared to the OBSTZ group.

This result is also supported by the result from glucose uptake in 3T3-F442A that showed that I. aquatica ethanolic extract has the ability to increase glucose uptake alone or together with insulin in adipocyte cells.
