Pathogenic bacter- ial infections are often characterized by a large and broad-based decrease in species diversity in part due to the dominance of a small number of species  To determine whether the sporadic high abundance of single species was associated with similar decreases in species diversity each sample was analyzed for intrinsic alpha species diversity by means of the Shannon index and inverse of the Simpson index Inverse-Simpson.

This small-scale spot check suggested that there exist differences in the mi- crobial viability or plating efficiency between species even within the same genus.Variation in species abundanceTable presents relative abundance of 9 selected abun- dant species in all 20 jejunal samples and in the oralTable 3 Average composition of the jejunum by genus and its correlation with bacterial loadPercentages represent average metagenomic abundance of the genus over all 20 subjects as a percentage of all bacteria col 2.

Instead the Firmicutes component of subject F was more typical of oral bacteria with an abundance of the class Bacilli which includes facultative anaerobes such as the Streptococci.Genus and species level analysis reveal differences from oral microbiotaAlthough the phylum profile showed great similarity with oral bacteria analysis at the species and genus level indicated substantial differences.

Fewer than 101-102 CFUml typically pass down the alimentary tract to the duodenum andjejunum Another possible source of microbes is the wall of the jejunum itself where bacteria are tightly associated with the villi of the intestinal mucosa The glycoprotein matrix on the surface of these villi could play a role similar to glycoprotein-rich mucosal layers of the colon which foster a renewable seed population of bacteria in the lower gut Yet another possible source is the colonic lumen which normally contains a total of 1012-1013 bacteria Continuous downward peristalsis and restriction of retrograde flow by the iliocaecal valve play an active role in keeping the upper jejunum free of colonic bacteria.

Earlier studies that used bacterial culture to quantify bacterial load within the jejunal lumen were generally motivated by clinical interest in a gastrointestinal dysfunction that is often associated with an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine For this reason we considered it important to measure the density of bacteria in the lumen as well as to determine its composition profile by phylum genus and species.

Although the feces of infants are rich in Proteobacteria includingEscherichia coli the phylum Proteobacteria is present but relatively rare in the microbiome of the adult colon The only jejunal outlier in the PCA analysis sub- ject F had a Firmicutes-abundant phylum profile super- ficially typical of colonic bacteria but further examination at the genus and species level revealed that it lacked extreme obligate anaerobes belonging to the class Clostridia which are characteristic of the colonic bacteria.

Live bacterial cultures re- trieved from the human proximal jejunum have included the gram-positive genera Streptococcus and Veillonella as well as the gram-negative enterobacterial genus Escherichia and Enterobacter - In recent years culture-independent microbial identification via high- throughput DNA sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes has transformed our ability to investigate the com- plex bacterial populations of the human body  Because this new methodology provides efficient and re- liable detection of many bacteria including those that are not readily grown in culture it has been proposed that a complete survey of jejunal bacteria will require such a culture-independent approach Currently there are only two published 16S rRNA metagenomic studies of bacteria from the humanjejunum but neither of these sampled the je- junal lumen.

One interpretation of these re- sults is that mechanisms governing bacterial species composition of the jejunum are surprisingly robust since species composition appeared unaffected by the se- vere inflammatory pathology of IBS In the current exploratory study we have built upon this earlier work with some new approaches.

Given the consistently high abundance of this operational taxonomic unit OTU in the jejunum and in our saliva control the widespread commensal Streptococcus mitis reported previously in the intestine appears to be a more likely provisional species identity within the viridans group Streptococci Because of these two cases taxonomy of each of the 45 most abundant species assigned by the Illumina software was checked by BLAST search of primary se- quence data.

Species identities confirmed as well as those requiring taxonomic correc- tions are also listed in the Additional files and To simplify the analysis of over 800 species identified per specimen we selected the top 10 most abundant bacterial species of each patient.
