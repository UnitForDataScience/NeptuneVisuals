Further research is needed to determine the compo- sition of skin bacteria on gametocyte-positive individuals in comparison with healthy individuals or those infected with asexual stage parasites by 16S rRNA sequencing of the skin microbiome .Concluding RemarksEvidence is accumulating that gametocytes and specifically high microscopically detectable levels of gametocytes lead to increased attractiveness of vertebrate hosts to vector mosqui- toes .

Evidence for Plasmodium-Induced Changes in Host AttractivenessTable 1. continuedaThese studies used microscopy to detect Plasmodium parasites and gametocytes and it is possible that submicroscopic levels were present in individuals categorizedas having asexual parasites or being parasite-free.sensitive molecular techniques to detect low densities of gametocytes in all children confirming that increased attraction to mosquitoes depends on high levels of gametocytes and is not associated with low-density gametocytes or the nontransmissible asexual progenitors of gametocytes.

We discuss i evolutionary concepts in parasite manipulation of vectors and vertebrate hosts ii effects of malaria parasites on the vertebrate host that may change attractiveness to mosquitoes and thereby influence transmission including parasite develop- mental stage clinical symptoms host age and immunity and host odour profile and iii mechanisms of manipulation of host attractiveness by Plasmodium with emphasis on the role of transmission stages gametocytes see  in mosquito attraction mosquito attractive cues emitted by Plasmodium and the role of skin bacteria in mediating Plasmodium-induced changes in host odour.1Laboratory of Entomology Wageningen University Droevendaalsesteeg 1 6708 PB Wageningen The Netherlands 2International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology PO Box 30772-00100 GPO Nairobi Kenya 3Medical Microbiology Radboud University Medical Centre Geert Grooteplein 10 6525 GA Nijmegen The Netherlands4Present address NetherlandsInstitute of Ecology Droevendaalsesteeg 10 6708 PB Wageningen The NetherlandsCorrespondence J.G.

It has been suggested that upregulation of existing host-seeking cues induced by Plasmodium infection could deceive mosquito vectors and result in increased attractiveness of infected vertebrate hosts despite the negative fitness impact of feeding on infected hosts .

This could also be the case when vertebrates are infected with malaria parasites resulting in increased attractiveness of people who harbour gametocytes.

Gametocytaemia could have a strong effect on host attractiveness see below and we hypothesize that manipulation of attractiveness by Plasmodium is most beneficial to the parasite at high levels of gametocytaemia particularly in the case of P. falciparum infection where gametocytes are not produced during every replication cycle.Plasmodium-Mediated Changes in Host AttractivenessMosquitoes locate their vertebrate hosts primarily by using olfactory cues .

Manipulation is also observed in arthropod vectors of parasites such as Trypanosoma-infected tsetse flies that probe more frequently than noninfected flies on vertebrate hosts  and Borrelia afzelii-infected ticks that identify their blood hosts more readily than noninfected ticks  thus increasing transmission.Plasmodium parasites manipulate mosquito vectors directly and indirectly through effects on attractiveness of the vertebrate host.

However the likelihood of mosquito infection increases with increasing gametocyte density .In conclusion malaria symptoms host age and immunity through its relationship with symp- toms may alter host attractiveness to mosquitoes but we believe that these effects are not specific enough to explain manipulation of host attractiveness by Plasmodium parasites.

While these studies demonstrate that mosquito behaviour is influenced by malaria parasites in vertebrate hosts only two studies discussed below have also analysed the odour profiles of infected and healthy hosts  .Mechanisms of Parasite Manipulation of Host Attractiveness Changes in host phenotype may result from chemical substances emitted by the parasite while in the host or by the emission of chemical substances from the host itself through the action of the parasite.

Mosquito vectors become infected with malaria parasites when they ingest mature gametocytes during a bloodmeal.
