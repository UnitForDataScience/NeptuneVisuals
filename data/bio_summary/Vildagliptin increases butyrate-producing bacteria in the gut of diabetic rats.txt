Vildagliptin treatment reduced the blood glu- cose levels before and after glucose load and the area under the curve of blood glucose P0.01 .Fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance HOMA-IR GLP-1 and IL-6Serum insulin level HOMA-IR and IL-6 level in the diabetic rats were higher than that in the normal controls P0.01  However the serum GLP-1 level was lower in the diabetic rats than in the normal controls P0.01  Vildagliptin reduced the serum insulin and IL-6 levels alleviated insulin resistance and increased serum GLP-1 in diabetic rats P0.05 .Global structural changes in the gut microbiota in response to vildagliptin treatmentA total of 1609238 usable pyrosequencing reads 61894 unique sequences were obtained from 30 samples.

The body weights of the diabetic rats and vildagliptin-treated rats did not significantly differ .Fasting blood glucose HbA1c and glucose toleranceFasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in the HFDSTZ rats were significantly increased compared with those of the normal controls P0.01 .

In addition there were fourteen genera positively associated with fasting insulinHeat map of the relative abundance log10 transformation of specific taxa in the fecal microbiota of rats in phyla level.levels Parasutterella Desulfovibrio ChristensenellaceaeR-7group LachnospiraceaeUCG- 010 Oscillibacter Anaerotruncus FamilyXIIIAD3011group RuminococcaceaeUCG-010 Anaerovorax Kurthia Parvibacter and Eubacteriumbrachygroup.DiscussionAs expected our study showed that vildagliptin diminished fasting blood glucose levels and prevented both glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.

Some oral antidia- betic agents namely berberine and metformin and energy-restricted diets could increase the SCFA-producing bacteria Bacteroides and Lachnospira in HF diet-induced obese rats and dia- betic patients  .Our data showed that Prevotellaceae abundance was lower in the vildagliptin treated rats than in the HFDSTZ rats.

In another study there was a reduction in the abundance of Ruminococcaceae in rats treated with a bitter melon formulation which could reduce fasting blood glucose compared to the diabetic rats .

Whole blood hemoglobin A1c HbA1c was measured by a high performance liquid chroma- tography HPLC method Variant II Bio-Rad Laboratories Hercules CA USA.Oral glucose tolerance test OGTTAfter a 12-week treatment rats were fasted for 10 h before the glucose tolerance test.

Fasting blood glucose blood glucose after glucose loading and serum insulin levels were significantly reduced in the LV and HV groups compared with those in the T2D group.

All rats were caged at 24 - 1 oC with lights on from 600 a.m. to 600 p.m.The rats were fed a standard diet kcal  10 fat 20 protein and 70 carbohydrate 3.85 kcalgm or a high-fat diet kcal  45 fat 20 protein and 35 carbohydrate 4.73 kcalgm Research Diet New Brunswick NJ USA.

Alpha and beta diversity analyses of the NCHV group showed that vildagliptin has little effect on the physiological state.The microbial structure of vildagliptin-treated rats differed substantially from that of diabetic ratsTo further explore the similarities and differences among normal diabetic and vildagliptin- treated rats we explored the similarities and distinctions in species distribution in the NC HFDSTZ and HFDSTZHV groups.
