for example com- pared with pond cultivation mode the activities of akp were significantly higher in midgut and hindgut in paddy p  0.01 and at the same time was significantly lower in foregut in paddy p  0.01. the activities of sod in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in foregut p  0.01 and were extremely significant lower in hindgut p  0.01. the activities of lzm in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut p  0.01 and were extremely significant lower in hindgut p  0.01.amino acid composition analysisresults of amino acid composition in loach muscles at the autumn are summarized in table .

in addition the delicious amino acids were 6.89 and 7.35 g100 g for samples from paddy and pond respectively.the content of tyrosine was extremely significantly higher in paddy cultivation mode than that of in pond cultivation mode p  0.01. on the contrary the contents of asparaginic acid glutamic acid alanine and lysine were extremely signif- icantly lower in paddy cultivation mode than in pond cultiva- tion mode p  0.01. the contents of threonine leucine and the total of amino acids were significantly lower in paddy cultivation mode than that of in pond cultivation mode p  0.05. however the percentage of valine methionine tyrosine and phenylalanine based on total amino acids in muscle was significantly higher in fish cultured in paddies than in ponds p  0.01. and there were no differences about delicious amino acid daa content between two modes.discussionintestinal histological analysisas shown in table  the general trend of the intestine length body length intestine lengthoverall length and carcass weightweight of loach were gradually increased in paddy field than in pond and the index of carcass weightweight of loach was significant higher in paddy field than in pond p  0.05. a possible reason is of the food because food was easy to obtain at random in paddy field than in pond.

the fact couldtable 6the immune enzyme activities of loach in different cultivationsnote values are as mean - sd n  10. in the same cultivation mode different letters within each row demarcate significant p  0.05 differences according to the duncan's test based on one-way analysis of variance uppercase letters indicate significant differences at level 0.01 p  0.01 while lowercase at level 0.05 p  0.05. in two cultivation modes significant differences at level 0.05 p  0.05 and at level 0.01 p  0.01 were indicatedresult from the air breathing of the posterior of intestine.

the perimeter and fold height of intestine were lower in paddy cultivation mode than that of in pond cultivation mode p  0.01. the fold radical of foregut and hindgut showed significant higher in paddy cultivation mode than that of in pond cultivation mode p  0.05 or p  0.01. though the perimeter of intestinal indicated significant higher both in midgut and hindgut in pond than in paddy p  0.01 as far asthe total absorption area view-1 there were no difference in two cultivation modes.intestinal microbiota analysisin this study complex but remarkably similar dgge patterns were observed among individuals fig.

compared with pond cultiva- tion mode the activities of acp in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut p  0.01 the activities of akp in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut p  0.01 the activities of sod in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in foregut p  0.01 and the activities of lzm in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut p  0.01. it had been reported that those samples might receive attack from external environmental at any time al- though there were no diseases outbreak perez et al.

in both culture conditions results based on microscopy observation showed that the intestinal perimeter fold height fold radical and total absorption of the gut were significantly higher in the foregut than that found in the mid- gut and hindgut p  0.01. the average final body weight of fish was similar between the two culture conditions p  0.05.the percentage of carcass weight to whole loach weight for samples collected from paddy field 91.6 - 1.1 was signifi- cantly higher than the index measured for loach from pond 87.3 - 3.4 p  0.05. results based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the shannon-diversity index evenness and richness of intestinal flora were in- creased from summer to fall in paddy cultivation.

in the paddy cultivation mode the diversity indexes of content samples were significant p  0.05 or extremely significant p  0.01 lower than that of epithelial intestinal mucosa and water samples in summer and the diversity indexes of water samples were extremely significant p  0.05 higher than that of epithelial intestinal mucosa and con- tent samples in autumn.

in two cultiva- tion modes the activities of akp and acp both presented extremely significant difference among the different intes- tinal segment p  0.05 or p  0.01. while the activities of sod and lzm detected less fluctuation except for some difference.
