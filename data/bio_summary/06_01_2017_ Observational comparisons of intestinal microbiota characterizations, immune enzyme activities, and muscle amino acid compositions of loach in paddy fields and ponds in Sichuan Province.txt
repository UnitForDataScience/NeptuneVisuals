In the paddy cultivation mode the diversity indexes of content samples were significant P  0.05 or extremely significant P  0.01 lower than that of epithelial intestinal mucosa and water samples in summer and the diversity indexes of water samples were extremely significant P  0.05 higher than that of epithelial intestinal mucosa and con- tent samples in autumn.

In the same cultivation mode and same season uppercase letters represent the extremely significant difference P  0.01 among different samples lowercase letters represent significant difference P  0.05 among different samples.P  0.05 P  0.01 compare with summer samples in the same kind of samples and indexesdifferences in different intestinal segment.

Ten healthy individuals were randomly sampled from both each pond and paddy in summer and autumn each time.In the intestinal histology enzyme activity and amino acid analysis experiments the fish were carried to the laboratory in oxygen filling bags within 3 h. In the gut microbial analysis experiment the fish tissue samples were collected in fish farm directly and the samples were carried to the laboratory in ice within 3 h. The fish were euthanized by a high dose of MS 222 Yun et al.

The average final body weight of fish was similar between the two culture conditions P  0.05.The percentage of carcass weight to whole loach weight for samples collected from paddy field 91.6 - 1.1 was signifi- cantly higher than the index measured for loach from pond 87.3 - 3.4 P  0.05.

Compared with pond cultiva- tion mode the activities of ACP in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut P  0.01 the activities of AKP in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut P  0.01 the activities of SOD in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in foregut P  0.01 and the activities of LZM in paddy cultivation mode were extremely significant higher in midgut P  0.01.

Note the 1-10 in a c e and g were intestine mucosa samples the 1-10 in b and f the 1-6 in d and the 1-7 in h were intestinal contents samples and the last three lanes in each diagram from a to h were water samples.

In a e b and f 1-13 and 14-26 represent the samples which were in summer and autumn respectively 1-10 and 14-23 were intestine mucosa samples and 11-13 and 24-26 were water samples.

In the pond cultivation mode the diversity indexes of water samples were extremely signif- icant P  0.05 higher than that of epithelial intestinal mucosa and content samples.

The a- d were the samples which were collected in paddy cultivation mode and the e-h were the samples which were collected in pond cultivation mode0.05 respectively and there were no significant differ- ences P  0.05.

In the same cultivation mode different letters within each row demarcate significant P  0.05 differences according to the Duncan's test based on one-way analysis of variance uppercase letters indicate significant differences at level 0.01 P  0.01 while lowercase letters at level 0.05 P  0.05.
