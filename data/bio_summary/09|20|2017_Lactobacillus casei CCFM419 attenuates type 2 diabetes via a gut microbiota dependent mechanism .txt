After acclimatiz- ation 8 mice were fed a normal diet C group and the others were given a high-fat diet M group P group 108 group 109 group and 1010 group.

In addition except for the N group and P group significant differences in the IL-6 values were only found between the M group and 109 group which suggested that 109 CFU of L. casei CCFM419 noticeably attenu- ated systemic inflammation P  0.05 Fig.

108 group from weeks 3-12 except week 9 109 group fromweeks 3-12 except week 6 1010 group from weeks 3-12 except weeks 6 and 9 P  0.05 Fig.

With the exception of the P group the IL-10 values in the M group were not sig- nificantly different from those of the C group and L. casei CCFM419 dose groups Fig.

Although the AUCglucose values were still higher than that of the N group they were significantly lower than that of the M group.

The pancreatic islet cells of normal mice dis- played a round or elliptical and clear cellular characteristic in the C group whereas the islets of the mice in the M group dis- played an irregular structure and unbroken cellular mor- phology with a reduced volume of islet cells.

casei CCFM419 could prevent the degeneration of the islets or induce their regeneration.Effect of different doses of L. casei CCFM419 on inflammatory factorsCompared to the C group mice in the M group had signifi- cantly higher blood serum levels of TNF-a P  0.05 Fig.

6C.Effect of different doses of L. casei CCFM419 on GLP-1 levelsGLP-1 an incretin hormone with anti-diabetic properties that is secreted by intestinal epithelial L cells is related to GCG and PC3 mRNA expressions.23 GCG mRNA expression in the jejunum ileum and colon in the M group was significantly lower than that of the C group P  0.05 Fig.

As shown in Table 1 the M group con- tained significantly lower levels of SOD GSH and GSH-Px but significantly higher concentrations of MDA compared to the C group.

As expected the levels of FGB and PBG in the M group were higher than 7.0 and 11.1 mmol L-1 after the STZ injection and also significantly higher than that of the control mice P  0.05 Fig.
