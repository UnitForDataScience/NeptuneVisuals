after acclimatiz- ation 8 mice were fed a normal diet c group and the others were given a high-fat diet m group p group 108 group 109 group and 1010 group.

in addition except for the n group and p group significant differences in the il-6 values were only found between the m group and 109 group which suggested that 109 cfu of l. casei ccfm419 noticeably attenu- ated systemic inflammation p  0.05 fig.

108 group from weeks 3-12 except week 9 109 group fromweeks 3-12 except week 6 1010 group from weeks 3-12 except weeks 6 and 9 p  0.05 fig.

with the exception of the p group the il-10 values in the m group were not sig- nificantly different from those of the c group and l. casei ccfm419 dose groups fig.

although the aucglucose values were still higher than that of the n group they were significantly lower than that of the m group.

4d compared to the m group p  0.05. these significant differences observed between the m group and l. casei ccfm419 dose groups indicated that 108 and 109 cfu of l. casei ccfm419 showed a better ability of improving insulin resistance thanfig.

5. the pancreatic islet cells of normal mice dis- played a round or elliptical and clear cellular characteristic in the c group whereas the islets of the mice in the m group dis- played an irregular structure and unbroken cellular mor- phology with a reduced volume of islet cells.

casei ccfm419 could prevent the degeneration of the islets or induce their regeneration.effect of different doses of l. casei ccfm419 on inflammatory factorscompared to the c group mice in the m group had signifi- cantly higher blood serum levels of tnf-a p  0.05 fig.

6c.effect of different doses of l. casei ccfm419 on glp-1 levelsglp-1 an incretin hormone with anti-diabetic properties that is secreted by intestinal epithelial l cells is related to gcg and pc3 mrna expressions.23 gcg mrna expression in the jejunum ileum and colon in the m group was significantly lower than that of the c group p  0.05 fig.

as shown in table 1 the m group con- tained significantly lower levels of sod gsh and gsh-px but significantly higher concentrations of mda compared to the c group.

as expected the levels of fgb and pbg in the m group were higher than 7.0 and 11.1 mmol l-1 after the stz injection and also significantly higher than that of the control mice p  0.05 fig.

in line with these findings the reduction period of fbg in the 108 and 109 groups was longer than that of the 1010 group p  0.05 fig.

oral administration of glucose to the m group mice increased blood glucose levels quickly within 30 min which slowly dropped over the next 90 min fig.

the m group aucglucose value was significantly higher than those of the other groups p  0.05 fig.

2 effect of different doses of l. casei ccfm419 on fbg a and pbg b. data are expressed as mean - sem n  8.  p  0.05 was considered as significantly different from the c group.
