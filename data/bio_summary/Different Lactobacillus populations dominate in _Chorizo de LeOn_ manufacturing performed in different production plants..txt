The microbial communities and their dynamics were studied by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons whereas oligotyping  was used for a sub-genus resolution of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus populations.Material and methodsChorizo de Leon manufacturing and samplingFive Chorizo de Leon factories from now on A B C D and E in the north-west region of Castilla y Leon Spain were selected to carry out the study.

At the half of the ripening process the microbial population was replaced by Lactobacillus in all manu- facturers A and B. Lactobacillus relative abundance was stable until the end of the process reaching abundances of 83.8 in Cho-rizo de Leon from manufacturer B and higher than 92.0 in thosefrom manufacturers C-1 C-2 and D. Its abundance was lower 65.1 and 69.2 in final products from manufactures A and E where Brochothrix 22.1 and Staphylococcus 19.7 reached higher levels respectively A and B.The differences between samples were evaluated by Weighted UniFrac phylogenetic metric .

Most studies are mainly focused on LAB and CNC populations as their behavior during ripening is important in establishing the sensorial safety and nutritional properties of the final products as well as in extending the shelf-life  .Several studies have investigated the Spanish dry fermented sausage chorizo microbial ecology  but none focused on Chorizo de Leon.HTS methods have changed the way of studying food microbial ecology giving the researchers the opportunity of an in-depth characterization of the microbial ecology of different environ- ments and to monitor the dynamics of potential pathogens spoilage and fermentative microbes  .Microbial and chemical changes are indicators of meat quality or freshness .

The 16S amplicon sequencing methods have become the most widely used in food microbiology research during the last years  andwhen combined with fruitful bioinformatics analysis pipelines they can provide in depth microbial ecology insights also at sub-genus diversity level .This study aims to an in depth investigation of the microbial populations involved in the Chorizo de Leon ripening process from the raw meat to the final products.

Plotting was carried out in R environment  by using ggplot2 made4 and factoextra packages.Nucleotide sequence accession numberAll the sequencing data were deposited at the Sequence Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information PRJNA386744.ResultsThe microbial population involved in the ripening of Chorizo de LeonA and B shows the relative abundance of the 13 most abundant genera in the different manufacturing steps from the different making companies and from the overall process respec- tively.

Lactobacillus population increased widely as theripening process begun remaining stable until the end of the process 81.89 and 83.35 average at the half of the ripening pro- cess and in Chorizo de Leon final products respectively.

The diverse microbial composition observed during the first stages of Chorizo deLeon evolved during ripening to a microbiota mainly composed by Lactobacillus in the final product.Oligotyping performed on 16S rRNA gene sequences of Lactobacillus and Staphylococcus populations revealed sub-genus level diversity within the different manufacturers likely responsible of the charac- teristic organoleptic properties of the products from different companies.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless samples from the late-ripening stagesclustered together showing a similar microbial evolution in Chorizo de Leon ripening where Lactobacillus almost dominate indepen- dently from the initial meat contamination .Sub-genus diversity analysis of the key genera Lactobacillus and StaphylococcusLactobacillus and Staphylococcus represent the most important bacterial populations in dry fermented sausages fermentation and ripening as well as in the development of their organoleptic and safety properties.
