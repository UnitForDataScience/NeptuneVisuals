with increasing prevalence the likelihood of coinfection increases which hence is an indicator of behavioral habits the prevalence of stis differs between regions.

tri- chomonas vaginalis tv prevalence is highest in african and american regions and the lowest rates are reported in the western pacific region chlamydia trachomatis ct on the other hand has its highest prevalence in north and south america while in africa it is only the fourth most frequent sti .

neisseria gonorrhea ng prevalence is high in africa and in the western pacific region but low in the american continent prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus hiv is 4.7 in africa but differs strongly from country to country mounting up to 24 among women in some regions .

2016 found hpv16 hpv18 hpv31 and hpv42 to be suppressed ina vaccinated society  but as vaccinations have never been introduced in pr'incipe this cannot have had any role in our findings.prevalence of tv in pr'incipe island is lower than in mainland southern africa where up to 25 95 ci 17.9-31.4 of women seem to be infected 17. however that tv prevalence is still higher than in europe where it ranges from 1.3 italy 1 to 0.4 belgium 19 and latin america 3.6 95 ci 2.2-5.6. in mexico the prevalence of tv was related to economical fluctuation its frequency was found to be countercyclic and the authors related the finding to accessibility to healthcare service 20. our findings did not support this hypothesis because sao tome' and pr'incipe is one of the poorest countries in the world and medical care is scarce.

still the prevalence of tv is lower than in the african continent while the prevalence of ng 2 andtable 3 epidemiology and risk factors for stis hpv hiv2ct tv or ng positive of 100 unselected women presenting for pap smear inmenopause 4 7.55 11.40.90alcohol use 36 67.926 59.10.09pregnant 14 26.49 19.10.50age of first delivery mean - sd20.1 - 3.118.9 - 2.40.06number of abortions mean - sd0.51 - 1.00.74 - 0.90.40ct 3 in our sample resembles those in neighboring african regions.

ct prevalence is around 4 in most african and european regions around 5.5 in the americas and lowest in southeast asia 1 while ng prevalence being typically dependent on the economic burden 20 is higher in africa 2 than in europe 0.4 a larger sample and longitudinal observations would be advantageous for a more accurate conclusion.

the size of the study of pr'incipe island did not allow conclu- sions of the relation between hpv or abnormal cytology and stis and should be reassessed in larger samples.besides the high prevalence of hr-hpv other than hpv16 or hpv18 another major finding of this study was the staggering prevalence of avf and vaginal infections.

coinfection of hpv with other stis was 8.3. prevalence of abnormalvaginal flora avf was 82.5 mostly bacterial vaginosis bv 54.6 and moderatesevere aerobic vaginitis msav 25.8. hr-.

the association of abnormal pap test with msav was not significant the prevalence of ng ct tv and hr-hpv was according to expected while that of hr-avf was higher.

the surprisingly low prevalence of hpv16 and hpv18 must be considered in the design of programs for prevention and vaccination this setting can be useful as a model for postvaccination scenarios.introductionsexually transmitted infections stis constitute a worldwide major public health problem .

detailed information about the prevalence of stis is especially important to enable better development of primary and secondary prevention models.
