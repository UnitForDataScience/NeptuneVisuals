a more recent systematic review which included a randomized trial for fmt in ibd noted less promis- ing results with 45 of patients achieving remission 22 of patients with uc 60.5 of patients with cd.the variability in these findings likely reflects the underlying heterogeneity in the primary studies of fmt for ibd which in turn may be related to several factors such as donor selection fmt preparation and delivery and length of diagnosis or severity of disease.safety of fmtin addition to efficacy safety of the procedure is an important factor in assessing the usefulness of fmt for ibd.

fmt may also be a potential treatment of pediatric cd as one recent case series noted remis- sion in 5 of 9 patients 56 after fmt with 7 of 9 patients 78 demonstrating engraftment of donor microbiota.interestingly although one study did not find a significant decrease in crohn's disease severity following fmt patients reported signifi- cantly increased quality of life scores after the procedure.prior work from one of us for fmt in active crohn's disease defined as hbi 5 had mixed results.of the 20 subjects enrolled for fmt 19 had complete follow-up data.

typically microbial diversity is substantially dimin- ished in patients with ibd compared with healthy individuals.furthermore in contrast to healthy individuals the fecal microbiota of patients with both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis contains a signif- icantly lower proportion of the bacteroidetes and fir- micutes phyla particularly clostridium which are normally dominant in the human fecal microbiota and a significantly higher proportion of the proteobac- teria phylum.notably these differences are present even in patients with crohn's disease who are treatment-naeurive suggesting that intestinal dysbiosis in these patients is not a consequence of therapy but rather a potential early change in ibd.evidence from post-surgical patients who have been treated for crohn's disease also suggests a causal relationship between gut microbiota composition and ibd.

although minimal side effects are typically reported for fmt for c. difficile infection one case report did note a uc flare following fmt in a patient who was previously in remission for over 20 y before the procedure.similarly a recent case series noted that 2.9 of patients treated for c. difficile who had underlying ibd required hospitalization for ibd flare after fmt.

several studies have suggested that patients with ibd have decreased populations of bacteria capable of producing butyrate a known anti-inflammatory mol- ecule also used as an energy source by the colonic epithe- lium.one study has already found that ibd patients who responded to fmt replenished these buty- rate-producing bacteria suggesting that this may a key mechanism to target in the future.ideally future work will lead to targeted microbial therapies aimed at restoring intestinal microbiota functions currently diminished in patients with ibd.lastly the issue of cause and effect is still an unan- swered question.

two essential issues with these small case series are single fmt infusions and selection bias in recruitment patients can be very motivated for an fmt trial to the point of compromising research pro- tocols as a failed trial of fmt in uc noted.given the mixed success of these small studies 2 recent randomized trials evaluated the clinical efficacy of fmt in uc.

given the decreased efficacy of fmt for c. difficile infection in patients with underlying ibd it ispossible that the increased side-effects noted in this population are confounded by the presence of both diseases.future directionswith increasing numbers of studies including ran- domized trials of fmt for ibd 39 registered studies on clinicaltrials.gov as of this writing we will be faced with more clinical data in an area where a mechanistic understanding is lacking.

e. coli nissle 1917 is a well-studied probiotic which has been shown to be as effective as mesalazine at maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis.other individual probiotics with demonstrated efficacy in ibd include lactobacillus gg bifidobacteria strains and the yeast saccharomy- ces boulardii.one of the most promising probiotic supplements vsl3 is a set of 8 bacterial strains that significantly reduces disease severity and induces remission in patients with uc compared to the pla- cebo.additionally vsl3 can prevent pouchitis following total proctocolectomy and j-pouch forma- tion.however engraftment of probiotics is often poor as demonstrated by lack of detectable probiotic strains 2 weeks following cessation of intake.in contrast to both antibiotics and probiotics fecal microbiota transplantation fmt may represent a more robust method of manipulating the gut micro- biota as a therapy for patients with ibd.

furthermore unlike probiotics evidence suggests that fmt results in long-term engraftment in recipients with c. difficile infectionthe scale and content of fmt also varies considerably from probi- otic therapy as donor fecal material contains approxi- mately 1011 bacterial cells per gram of stool in addition to viruses fungi and archaea.all together these factors suggest that fmt may be a more promis- ing therapy for ibd than either antibiotics or probiot- ics.

one review found promising results for fmt in ibd with the majority of patients achiev- ing reduction of symptoms cessation of ibd medica- tions andor clinical remission.

this diversity may ultimately be beneficial for deriving a mechanistic underpinning for fmt in ibd though currently it limits our interpreta- tion of fmt as a clinical success or failure.one essential issue to clarify and define is that of engraftment of a microbiota.

the truth is likely in between a cure and no effect at all and while overall the use of fmt for ibd is promis- ing clearly the course will not be the same as fmt for recurrent c. difficile infection.

fmt has already emerged as a successful therapy for clostridium difficile infec- tionand is currently being explored as a potential treatment of ibd.this review will outline the associa- tions of ibd and the gut microbiota and then discuss the current data on fecal microbiota transplantation in ibd.associations between the intestinal microbiota and ibdmicrobiota and early intestinal immune system developmentevidence in both human and mouse studies strongly suggests that early intestinal immune system develop- ment is highly dependent on the intestinal micro- biotawhich in turn may impact susceptibility to ibd.

below we discuss current evidence available on the use of fmt for ibd.ulcerative colitisearly reports of fmt for uc suggested a reversal of disease in selected patients.
