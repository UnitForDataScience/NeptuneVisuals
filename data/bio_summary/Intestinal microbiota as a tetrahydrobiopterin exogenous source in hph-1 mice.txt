The hph-1 mouse tissue BH4 increases with age and the adult hph-1 mouse ileal tissue BH4 content is similar to that of wild-type control animals.The partial and age-dependent GTPCH1 expressionactivity in the hph-1 mice contributes to the higher tis- sue BH4 content in adult hph-1 mice when compared with early in life.

When compared with wild type control animals adult hph-1 mice have a higher systemic blood pressureand manifest pulmonary hypertension as early as the neonatal period.Interestingly the hph-1 mice tissue BH4 content is age-dependent.

OPENReceived 22 June 2016Accepted 29 November 2016Published 12 January 2017Intestinal microbiota as a tetrahydrobiopterin exogenous source in hph-1 miceJaques Belik12Yulia Shifrin1 Erland Arning3 Teodoro Bottiglieri3 Jingyi Pan1 Michelle C. Daigneault4  Emma Allen-Vercoe4Tetrahydrobiopterin BH4 is a cofactor of a number of regulatory enzymes.

Although there are no known BH4 exogenous sources the tissue content of this biopterin increases with age in GTPcyclohydrolase 1-deficient hyperphenylalaninemia-1 hph-1 mice.

Since certain bacteria are known to generate BH4 we hypothesize that generation of this biopterin by the intestinal microbiota contributes to its tissue increase in hph-1 adult mice.

The goal of this study was to comparatively evaluate hph-1 mice and wild-type C57Bl6 controls for the presence of intestinal BH4-producing bacteria.

Adult but not newborn wild-type control and hph-1 mouse fecal material contained PTPS-2 mRNA indicative of the presence of BH4-generating bacteria.

A reduced or absent BH4 endogenous pool results in severe clinical manifestations such as phenylketonuria movement disorders systemic and pulmonary hypertension.The hyperphenylalaninemia-1 hph-1 mouse strain was created via N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ENU mutation and has a partial deficit in GTP cyclohydrolase I EC 3.5.4.16 GTPCH1 the first and rate-limiting enzyme responsible for de novo BH4 generation.

GTPCH1 activity of adult hph-1 mice is two-fold higher when compared with the newborn counterpart.

We previously reported however that new- born hph-1 mouse lungs have 30-fold lower tissue BH4 content when compared with same age wild-type con- trols.
