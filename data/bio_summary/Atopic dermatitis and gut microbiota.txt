The complexity of AD pathogenesis and the possibility of clo- nal diversity among S. aureus could be one explanation of why the connection between gut flora and eczema development has not been fully established.Staphylococcus aureus is often found on the skin in AD mostlyon inflamed skin11 and flares of AD are associated with S. au- reus SAgs.4 In this issue of the BJD Nowrouzian et al.12 report on their observational study in which they looked more clo- sely at commensal S. aureus strains in the gut microbiome dur- ing the first 18-month postpartum period along with concomitantly registered development of AD and allergy signs.

Authors of the current study have previously suggested that commensal S. aureus in the gut microflora carrying combina- tions of SAgs stimulate and educate the immune system and thus modify the development of AD.13 In the current study12 there was found to be a negative correlation between AD development and the occurrence of certain adhesins and SAgs supporting the idea that the composition of the gut micro- biome perhaps specific S. aureus strains in early childhood has an impact on AD and allergy development.

Expanding the use of the CDASI to nondermatologists will undoubtedly increase the number of rigorously designed studies that include a focus on skin outcomes and will thereby serve to enhance the data available to guide treatment of the frequently refractory cutaneous manifestations of DM.Conflicts of interestNone declared.Atopic dermatitis and gut microbiotaDOI 10.1111bjd.15276During the past decades we have learnt that the interplay between the environmental microflora and the immune sys- tem is essential for educating the immune system and thus for our survival.12 This interplay takes place at the barriers of the body skin lung and gut.

It has been described that a lower diversity of the gut flora or an imbalance in the composition of the gut microbiome are associated with development of allergy.3 In a similar way it has been shown that a greater diversity of skin commensals improves the function of the immune system while a decreased diversity is associated with1Division of Dermatology University ofArizona Tucson AZ U.S.A.2Department of Dermatology Brigham and Women's Hospital Harvard Medical School Boston MA U.S.A.E-mail httpsorcid.org0000-0002-9192-4465D.J.B.
