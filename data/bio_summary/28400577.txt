This indicated that the fish oil diet had a different impact on gut microbiota of middle-aged rats from the lard and soybean oil diets.On the phylum level the caecal and colonic samples of the fish oil group could be separated from those of the soybean oil group and the lard group Fig.

Comparisons of gut bacteria on OTU level using LefSe A caecal bacteria B colonic bacteria between soybean oil and fish oil C colonic bacteria between lard and fish oil.

The remaining 10 OTUs were more abundant in the fish oil group p 0.05 including Lactobacillus OTU137 OTU153 and OTU878 and Desulfovibrio OTU917.Twenty-six OTUs were observed different between the lard group and the fish oil group Fig.

On the corresponding third KEGG level the abundances of predicted metabolism of bile acids and fatty acids and DNA repair and recombination proteins were higher in the fish oil group than those of the lard group and the soybean oil group while the abundances of predicted amino acid related enzymes were the lowest in the fish oil group Supplementary Fig.

In the in vivo study the amount of triglyceridesin the ileal contents was the highest in the lard group but the lowest in the fish oil group as it is in the caecum Supplementary Table  indicating that fish oil can be more efficiently absorbed than lard in the small intestine.

And thus it is inferred that the oxidation of PUFAs in fish oil could induce the higher abundance of Proteobacteria in the fish oil group.

In this study we explored gut microbiota structure in middle-aged rats aged 12 months after feeding 4 ww soybean oil lard or fish oil for 3 months respectively.

The results showed that the gut microbiota structure in the fish oil group was substantially different from those of the soybean oil and lard groups in both in vitro and in vivo studies.

The relative abundances of phylum Proteobacteria and genus Desulfovibrio in the caecal and colonic contents were the highest in the fish oil group p  0.05.

The mRNA levels of biomarkers for inflammation in the colon including IL-1b IL-6 IL-17 IL-18 and TNF-a were also the highest in the fish oil group p 0.05.
