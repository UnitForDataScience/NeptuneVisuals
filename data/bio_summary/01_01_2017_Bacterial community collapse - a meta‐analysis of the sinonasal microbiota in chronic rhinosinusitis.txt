Equitability measured using Simpson's even- ness suggested that bacterial communities in both healthy and CRS-affected sinuses have uneven distributions of taxa healthy 5 0.15 6 0.07 CRS 5 0.16 6 0.08 p  0.05.Assuming Simpson's evenness does not yield significant differences between groups sample size calculations rec- ommended a minimum of 74 subjects for each CRS and healthy group in order to be able to observe a significant difference in the other alpha diversity measures.Meta-data statistics and variance partitioningA large proportion of the studies included in this meta- analysis did not publish individual patient meta-data rath- er averages from all patient data age asthma prevalence antibiotic usage comorbidities were published.

Indicates a significant difference between the means of group fragmentation Wilcoxon rank sum test W 5 7907.5 p  0.0001.the order Burkholderiales specifically Burkholderia and Propionibacterium are central phylotypes and likely gate- keepers whose presence is important for stabilizing the healthy bacterial community.Functional prediction of CRS versus healthy state sinus microbiotaWe applied PICRUSt bioinformatics software to the data set to evaluate potential metagenome function in healthy and CRS bacterial communities.

Disease state CRS vs. healthy subjects contributed significantly to variation in the model even after removing the effect of study R2 5 0.009 p 5 0.018 Supporting Information Table S5.Bacterial network analysisImaging the spread of data in a two-dimensional non-met- ric multidimensional scaling nMDS plot revealed a high degree of overlap in the clustering of CRS and healthy sub- jects Fig.

Alpha diversity box plots for CRS versus healthy subjects Alpha diversity metrics expressed as boxplots of CRS n 5 131 versus healthy n 5 58 subjects.

The genus-level phylotype Corynebacterium was again associ- ated with CRS bacterial communities and Burkholderia was associated with healthy subjects.CoNet analyses revealed negatively correlated bacteria bacteria that consistently and significantly do not occur together in CRS bacterial communities.

Our network analyses revealed that healthy sinonasal bacterial commu- nities are less fragmented than those in CRS subjects.CoNet results suggested members of the genus Bur- kholderia were significantly associated with healthy subjects however this finding was not supported by LEfSE results.

CRS affectsapproximately 5-10 of the population and annual treat- ment costs associated with CRS exceed 8.6 billion in the United States alone Ray et al.
