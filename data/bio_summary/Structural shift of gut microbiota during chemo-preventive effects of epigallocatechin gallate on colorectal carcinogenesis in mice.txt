in group 3 treatment of mice with 1 egcg caused a significant decrease in the mean number of acf per mouse when compared with the model mice treated with aomdss 5.38 - 4.24 vs13.13 - 3.02 p  0.01. these results indicate that 1egcg significantly inhibited acf formation induced byaomdss in fvb mice.egcg attenuates aomdss-induced colorectal carcinogenesisstarting from 10 wk after treatment mice in the model group showed apparent diarrhea and rectal bleeding.

statistically significant differences were seen in the shannon and simpson indexes between the mo group and control group 4.10 vs 3.23 p  0.022 while no significance was seen between the eg group and control group 2.81 vs 3.23 p  0.230 figure 4a.

as figure 5 shows at the 8th week the abundance of bacteroides as well as anaerotruncus in the mo group was significantly higher than that in the bd group and eg group but clostridiaceae which can produce butyrate and ruminococcus in the mo group were significantly reduced.

via bioinformatics analysis principal coordinate analysis and cluster analysis of the tumor formation process we found that the diversity of gut microbiota increased in the tumor model group while that in the egcg interfered group eg remained relatively stable.conclusiongut microbiota imbalance might be a potential mechanism for the prevention of malignant tran- sformation by egcg which is significant for diagnosis treatment prognosis evaluation and prevention of colorectal cancer.key words epigallocatechin gallate gut microbiota colorectal cancer high throughput sequencing ch- emoprevention animal experimentc the authors 2017. published by baishideng publishing group inc. all rights reserved.wang x ye t chen wj lv y hao z chen j zhao jy wang hp cai yk.

in addition common intestinal opportunistic pathogens such as enterobacteriaceae streptococcus and prevotella were not found to be enriched in the mo group.specifically at week 11 the abundance of lactobacilli in the eg group was significantly higher than that in the bd group and the mo group p1  0.028sporadic reports suggested that egcg may inhibit proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens clostridium difficile and bacaeroides in vitro but egcg is less inhibitory to or even stimulatory to probiotic bacteria such as bacillus bifidus and lactobacillus.

in groups 1 and 2 all mice survived to the end of the experiment and two mice died in group 3 from asphyxia caused by gavage and intestinal obstruction.

considering the complexity of gut microbiota this study was designed with the following research objectives in mind 1 to preliminarily understand the compositions of the gut microbiota in mice at the 8th week  precancerous stage and the 11th week progressive stage of colorectal cancer 2 to preliminarily understand the change in gut microbiota during the process of colorectal cancer progression in mice as compared to healthy mice and to clarify the effects of egcg intervention on this change and 3could well reflect the structure of the gut microbiota inmice.it is worthwhile to note that in 2011 kosticet al11 castellarin et al12 and marchesi et al28 simultaneously found that there were gut microbiota disorders at varying degrees in colorectal cancer patients using sequencing techniques and the fusobacterium was enriched in cancer tissues as compared to the healthy tissues.

the structure of the gut microbiotaof mice interfered with green tea extract egcg basically remained relatively stable and bioinformatics analysis showed that the structure of the flora in these mice was similar to that of healthy mice with no obvious fluctuations in the number of bacteria.
