Considering the complexity of gut microbiota this study was designed with the following research objectives in mind 1 to preliminarily understand the compositions of the gut microbiota in mice at the 8th week  precancerous stage and the 11th week progressive stage of colorectal cancer 2 to preliminarily understand the change in gut microbiota during the process of colorectal cancer progression in mice as compared to healthy mice and to clarify the effects of EGCG intervention on this change and 3could well reflect the structure of the gut microbiota inmice.It is worthwhile to note that in 2011 Kosticet al11 Castellarin et al12 and Marchesi et al28 simultaneously found that there were gut microbiota disorders at varying degrees in colorectal cancer patients using sequencing techniques and the Fusobacterium was enriched in cancer tissues as compared to the healthy tissues.

Forty- two female FVBN mice were randomly divided into the following three groups group 1 10 mice negative control was treated with vehicle group 2 16 mice positive control was treated with AOM plus vehicle and group 3 16 mice EG was treated with AOM plus EGCG.

Forty-two female FVBN mice were randomly divided into the following three groups Figure 1 group 1 10 mice negative control was treated with vehicle group 2 16 mice positive control was treated with AOM plus vehicle group 3 16 mice EG was treated with AOM plus EGCG.

To further confirm the protective effect of EGCG on colorectal carcinogenesis and observe structural changes of gut microbiota involved during this process an animal model of colorectal cancer was established.Research frontiersA large number of reports have confirmed the role of bacterial flora in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer outlining the structure of gut microbiota in patients with colorectal cancer.

A study by Jahns et al33 on human colorectal cancer tissues showed that butyrate could inhibit COX2 gene expression in nodal tissues and the activities of related proteins in vitro studies also found that butyrate might activate caspase 3 and caspase 9 to induce apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells upregulate pro-apoptotic gene BAK expression and activate mitochondrial pathways to induce cell apoptosis and the like.The gut microbiota of mice in the same tumor modelgroup was different.

Statistically significant differences were seen in the Shannon and Simpson indexes between the MO group and control group 4.10 vs 3.23 P  0.022 while no significance was seen between the EG group and control group 2.81 vs 3.23 P  0.230 Figure 4A.

As Figure 5 shows at the 8th week the abundance of Bacteroides as well as Anaerotruncus in the MO group was significantly higher than that in the BD group and EG group but Clostridiaceae which can produce butyrate and Ruminococcus in the MO group were significantly reduced.

The role of gut microbiota as an intermediate link for EGCG's impact on colorectal cancer occurrence and development is still unclear.EGCG acts as a means of chemical prevention of colorectal cancer and gut microbiota is very likely to be one of its targets.

Via bioinformatics analysis principal coordinate analysis and cluster analysis of the tumor formation process we found that the diversity of gut microbiota increased in the tumor model group while that in the EGCG interfered group EG remained relatively stable.CONCLUSIONGut microbiota imbalance might be a potential mechanism for the prevention of malignant tran- sformation by EGCG which is significant for diagnosis treatment prognosis evaluation and prevention of colorectal cancer.Key words Epigallocatechin gallate Gut microbiota Colorectal cancer High throughput sequencing Ch- emoprevention Animal experimentc The Authors 2017.

Little is known about the dynamic changes of the gut microbiota in the process of tumor formation especially for the status of gut microbiota during the early stage of disease progression which indeed is a key time point for chemical prevention.At the same time it will be informative for the elucidation of flora changes as a direct cause of colorectal cancer formation or flora changes as a direct result of colorectal cancer occurrence andor progression.
