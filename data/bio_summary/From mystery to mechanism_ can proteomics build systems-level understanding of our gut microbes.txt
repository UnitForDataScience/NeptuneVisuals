This suggests that a single assay targeting specific host proteins from stool could sensitively diagnose multiple emerging disease states in a widely applic- able manner.A second surprising finding from this work was the starkly different rates at which the host proteome and the microbiota respond to gut ecosystem perturbations.

However by expanding this approach with other '-omic' tech- nologies researchers can begin to map the complex network linking host regulatory pathways with the microbial adapta- tions that allow them to thrive in diverse host environments.Outlook our multi-omics futureWhile it is clear that proteomics significantly contributes to our understanding of host-gut microbe interaction networks complementary -omic technologies represents one strategy for addressing some of the challenges that proteomics faces.

This immensely complex ecosystem is characterized by dynamic interactions between the host diet and the gut microbiota and contributes to metabolic disorders autoimmunity and cancer .

However a growing number of metaproteomic studies wherein mass spectra are searched against databases containing very large gut microbe commu- nities are beginning to reveal how the collective proteomic output of the gut microbiota and the host reflect this intricate and dynamic system .

One key finding from this work is that host protein signatures can sensitively distin- guish both slight and major microbiota perturbations.

Antibiotic-induced perturba- tions of the intestinal microbiota alter host susceptibility to enteric infection.

However the mechanisms shaping how these fluctuations occur and how these changes influence host physiology are poorly understood.

These studies demonstrate thatmetaproteomics can deliver mechanistic insight that would escape other 'omic' measurements and that connections between diet microbes and host biology can be readily dis- tilled from these kinds of data.As with the majority of prior gut microbiome research we note that stool specimens are well suited to this kind of metaproteomic research because they are collected noninva- sively and in relatively large quantities.

Furthermore since stool contains pro- teins from the host microbes and diet researchers can simul- taneously measure all three domains from a single specimen.

Sequential host and microbe protein isolation via differential centrifugation 33 represents one possible solution to this challenge.
