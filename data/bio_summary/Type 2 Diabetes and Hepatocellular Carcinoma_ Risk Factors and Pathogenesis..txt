There is also now a significant body of evidence to suggest that the presence of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance is associated with significantly poorer outcomes in individuals with hepa- titis C infection increasing the risk of liver fibrosis and cir- rhosis worsening the response to antiviral therapy increasing the risk of HCC increasing the chance of death due to liver- related causes and shortening the time from diagnosis to liver transplantation .

These data would sug- gest a synergistic additive interaction between diabetes and the other major risk factor for HCC and indeed there are similar data to suggest this synergism also exists with alcohol- ic liver disease .There is also evidence to suggest that certain anti-diabetic medications may have a modifying effect on the risk of devel- oping HCC.

A further meta-analysis published 5 years later assessed 26 prospective studies includ- ing over 25000 cases of primary liver cancer and showed that those with excess body weight as defined by a body mass index greater than 25 kgm2 had a summary relative risk of HCC of 1.48 while those with obesity had a summary relative risk of HCC of 1.83 .

Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseIntroductionType 2 diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma HCC are closely linked due to their association with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD and obesity.

NAFLD repre- sents a wide spectrum of clinical liver disease ranging from hepatic steatosis to significant fibrosis steatohepatitis NASH and end stage liver cirrhosis.

A recent whole exome sequencing study of 243 liver tumours could not identify any particular mutation signature unique to HCC in the context of NAFLD in contrast to HCC secondary to alcoholic liver disease or hepatitis B virus where such sig- natures were identified .

The INSYTE randomised placebo- controlled double blind trial is testing the effects of a synbiotic on liver fat disease biomarkers and intestinal microbiota in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and is currently in recruitment phase  NCT01680640.
