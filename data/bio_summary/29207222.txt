in fact the use of scfas to restore physiological levels of anaerobic bacteria sutterellaceae lactobaillaceae and bacteroidaceae and not of aerobic bacteria such as finucutesproteobacteriae and actinobacteriae that are at higher concentration in the intestine of chronic kidney disease patients allows the reduction of uremic toxins like indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate 98.very recently soleimani has shown with a prospective randomized double-bin placebo-control clinical trial that supplementation for 12 weeks of pro-biotics produced in 60 diabetic hemodialysis the reduction of 22 mgdl for glucose 0.4 for hba1c 6.4 mcuml for serum insulin 1933 ngml for the c-reactive protein compared to the placebo group and then in conclusion improvement in diabetic parameters .moreover use of natural symbiotics like beta glucan contained in whole-grain pasta induces increase of scfas such as 2-methyl-propanoic acetic butyric and propionic acids and significant reduction of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate .conclusionsresearchers investigated a lot in the last years the interrelation between kidney and gut  the so- called gut-kidney axis and between intestinal microbioma or disbiosis and kidney damage.it is indisputable that inflammation and intestinal disbiosis influence chronic kidney disease progression and conversely chronic kidney disease influences microbiota changes towards a proteolyitic flora instead of a saccarolytic one with production and absorption of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate.

they also positively influence auto-immune diseases -.urea disbiosis and outcomesin chronic kidney disease and in dialysis patients there is an accumulation of uremic toxins with an intermediate molecular weight such as phenylacetylglutamine hippurate indoxyl sulfate and p- cresol sulfate  these are protein-bound solutes with a scarce dialytic clearance 36 for indoxyl sulfate and 31 for p-cresol sulfate respectively.

urea is directly involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in chronic kidney disease patients through the generation of isocyanic acid and protein carbamylation both processes with a high atherosclerotic impact  -.moreover vlpd allows a better control of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease because it ensures bicarbonate administration with vegetable proteins .figura 3. correlation between urea and homocitrulline levels.figura 4. correlation between urea and homocitrulline levels for each type of diet free diet is bleu line  mediterranean diet is red line and vlpd is green line.

in addition high levels of urea cause change of intestinal microbiota promoting proteolysis  with production and absorption of uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate .very recently andersen and coll showed in mouse experiments that disbiosis caused by chronic kidney disease-related inflammation produced a diffusion through intercellular spaces of intestinal bacteria to the liver with an increased release of endotoxins .

preliminary data from medika study renal effects of mediterranean diet and very low-protein diet with ketoacids vlpd on physiological intestinal mibrobiota in ckd registered in clinicaltrial.gov with the number nct02302287 ongoing show that in 30 patients a very-low protein diet significantly reduces indoxyl sulfate levels of 72 from 0.46-0.12 to 0.13-0.05 mcgml p0.002 and il p- cresol sulfate levels of 51  p0001 figure 2 83. in detail vlpd is a vegetarian diet with no animal proteins and 03 gkg of body weightday of vegetable proteins with supplementation of essential amino-acids and ketoanalogues of non essential amino-acids and a caloric intake of 30- 35 kcalkg of body weightday .figura 2. indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol-sulfate reduction levels during mediterranean diet and vlpd respect to free diet.moreover nowadays it has been put back at the top the idea that urea is a toxin and it must be therefore treated.

similarly the role of intestinal microbiota on nitrose cycle that induces reduction of nitric oxide in chronic kidney disease through reduction of intestinal species that are able to transform ammonium in nitrate was already explored .use of a proper nutrition as mediterranean diet is may induce the development of intestinal bacteria flora able to control the intestinal cellular immune system contrast the formation of uremic toxins in the intestine and favor production of scfas.moreover chronic kidney disease influences microbiota characteristics especially through high levels of urea that is reconsidered a real uremic toxin that need therefore to be treated .

as a consequence of high values of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate relevant pathophysiologic changes occurred such as production of reactive oxygen species interaction between leukocytes and endothelium increase of cellular proliferation and aging myocytes hypertrophy cardiac fibrosis inflammation oxidative stress cytokines production inflammatory genes expression raas activation renal tubular damage insulin-resistance lipogenesis reduction and lipolysis activation .intestinal alterations in chronic kidney disease may be a consequence of a erroneous nutritional therapy with the use of a low content of fibers due to the fear of hyperkalemia.

very low protein diet reduces serum levels of indoxyl sulfate and p- cresyl sulfate in chronic kidney disease.

regarding intestinal microbiota disbiosis in chronic kidney disease is determined also by high levels of urea that cause enterocolites not clinically relevant through ammonium hydroxide formation from urea decomposition and ammonium ion hydroxilation due to intestinal bacterial urease.

therefore urea an old and forgotten molecule must be reconsidered now as a real uremic toxin.vlpd is able to efficiently reduce urea levels in patients with chronic kidney disease leading its values into the normal range in many patients despite a reduced residual renal function lower than 15 mlmin   .

in fact administration of ketoanalogues permits recycling urea nitrogen to transform the ketoanalogous in the corresponding no-essential amino acid maintaining a proper dose of energy intake in conclusion we think that the utilization of nutritional therapy to reduce urea levels and restore physiological microbioma in chronic kidney disease is mandatory.references rocchetti mt cosola c di bari i et al.

a prospective randomized cross-over controlled trial showed that urea reduction in 60 subjects induced a significant cyanate lowering  also correlation between urea and homocitrulline was significant y  10.2 x  6.97 r  0.72 p0.001 figure 3. figure 4 shows that vlpd was more efficient than mediterranean diet in reducing urea and therefore cyanate levels .

mediterranean diet is characterized by the assumption of fresh products and great amount of vegetables and fruit with use of legumes nuts olive oil fish and a moderate consumption of red wineknowledge of a relationship between microbiota and chronic kidney disease has led nephrologists to study with even greater interest the relation between mediterranean diet and chronic kidney disease.

therefore taking into consideration the mutual influence between kidney and intestine the care of intestinal disbiosis must be a therapeutic target in chronic kidney disease .nowadays the role of these uremic toxins in promoting negative cardiovascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease patients it is well known in the scientific community.

prebiotics have synergistic action with probiotics and administered together symbiotics may have an important role in restoring the physiological intestinal microbiota and delaying chronic kidney disease progression  .scientific literature described the relationship between use of symbiotics and reduction of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulphate -.
