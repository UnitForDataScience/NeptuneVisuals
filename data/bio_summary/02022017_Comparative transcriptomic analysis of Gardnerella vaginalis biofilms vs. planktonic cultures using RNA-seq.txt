Therefore a better understanding of BV-associated G. vaginalis biofilm physiology and virulence is needed to understand the high persistence and resistance of biofilm cells.The purpose of our study was therefore to identify the major transcriptomic features of BV-associated G. vaginalis biofilms as compared to their planktonic counterparts using high-throughput RNA-sequencing RNA-seq.Transcriptomic comparisons between biofilm and planktonic cultures that have been carried out for Staphylococcus aureusStaphylococcus epidermidisStreptococ- cus mutansand Streptococcus pneumoniaindicate that gene- regulated processes in the biofilm led to a protective mode of growth by developing an effective cellular response to stress and decreasing metabolic activity.Herein we sequenced the transcriptome of BV-associated G. vaginalis biofilms and planktonic cultures and used a data analysis approach based on direct and functional gene interactions namely gene set enrichment and cluster analysis.RESULTSTranscriptome analysisA total of 561302 planktonic phenotype and 311643 biofilm phenotype sequencing reads were obtained for the complemen- tary DNA cDNA libraries.

Jefferson3 and Nuno Cerca 1INTRODUCTIONBacterial vaginosis BV is the most prevalent vaginal condition in women of reproductive age and can cause several problems such as preterm birth endometritis and increased risk of acquisition and transmission of sexual transmitted diseases.Examination of vaginal biopsy specimens has demonstrated that most cases of BV are characterized by the adherence of a bacterial biofilm to the vaginal epithelium and that Gardnerella vaginalis is the pre- dominant species of the biofilm mass.However G. vaginalis colonization does not always lead to BV.

Moreover in BV-associated G. vaginalis biofilm cells transcript levels of the gene HMPREF04240573 which encodes a LysM domain-containing protein possibly associated with autoaggrega- tion of G. vaginalis were also increased similar to what was observed for Lactobacillus reuteri biofilms.Transcripts encoding the ComEA protein HMPREF04240943 which is involved in DNA repair and NLPA lipoprotein HMPREF04240888 gene which is involved in ABC transporters were also found in greater abundance in biofilms cells.Transcriptome analysis of Gardnerella vaginalisJ Castro et al3Fig.

Importantly our findings provide key insights into the development of biofilms and the pathogenicity of G. vaginalis the predominant bacterial species isolated in women with BV.Here we showed that BV-associated G. vaginalis biofilm cells alter their gene expression profile namely transcript levels of genes involved in metabolism with downregulation of genes associated with glycolysis and carbon metabolism and translation with downregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins as also reported for other microorganisms such as S. epidermidisS.

Furthermore BV- associated G. vaginalis biofilm cells showed decreased transcript levels of genes encoding several factors involved in energy production such as HMPREF04241336 a gene encoding primary receptors for chemotaxis and transport of many sugar based solutes.

In addition the expression levels of genes associated with glucose metabolic pathways were also lower in biofilms cells namely gap that also has a role in oxidoreductase activity and gpmA that displays an important role in a subpathway of the glycolysis pathway glycolysisgluconeogenesis pathway of G. vaginalis 409-05 is shown in the Supplementary Material Fig.

Taken together these results imply that G. vaginalis biofilm cells are characterized by the reduction of basic cell processestranslation and metabo- lism glycolysis and carbon metabolism.Among the transcripts elevated in biofilm cells we found HMPREF04240563a gene with a molecular function related to hydrolase activity.

This might play an important role in adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells similarly to what has been described in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.Furthermoreour data supported the previous hypothesis that G. vaginalis biofilm development is likely associated with type II glycosyl- transferase.
