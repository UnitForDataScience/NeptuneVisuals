Mice 6 per group received daily treatment with the antibiotics as noted above and fecal specimens were collected prior to treatment on day 3 of treatment and at 2- to 5-day intervals after the final antibiotic dose for analysis of the intestinal microbiota and stool metabolites.Impact of antibiotic treatment on enterococci and facultative Gram-negative bacilliTo quantify the burden of C. difficile fresh stool samples were collected on days 1 3 and 7 after the administration of spores.

We used a mouse model to compare the effects of tigecycline versus other commonly used antibiotics on colonization resistance to C. difficile and on the metabolic functions of the intestinal microbiota.Methods--To assess in vivo colonization resistance to C. difficile mice were challenged with oral C. difficile spores 1 7 or 12 days after completion of 3 days of treatment with subcutaneous saline tigecycline ceftriaxone piperacillin-tazobactam or linezolid.

At 9 days after the last antibiotic dose none of the treatment groups developed overgrowth of C. difficile after challenge by oral gavage data not shown.Effect of treatment on enterococci and facultative Gram-negative bacilli by cultureAs shown in Figure 2A in comparison to controls tigecycline promoted overgrowth of enterococci during treatment with recovery to levels not significantly different from controls by 6 days after the last antibiotic dose.

Mice 3 per group at each time point were challenged with 104 colony-forming units of non- toxigenic Clostridium difficile spores by orogastric gavage 2 or 7 days following treatment with 3 days of daily subcutaneous tigecycline A linezolid B piperacillintazobactam C or ceftriaxone D. Concentrations of C. difficile in feces were measured by quantitative cultures 1 black bars 3 grey bars or 7 white bars days following challenge.

Each of the antibiotics resulted in 10-fold increases in 20 or more compounds during treatment day 3 and on day 2 after treatment but fewer than 10 compounds remained elevated 10-fold by day 12 after treatment.

Finally we previously reported that clindamycin or piperacillintazobactam treatment resulted in alteration of a wide range of fecal bacterial metabolites including intermediates in carbohydrate or protein metabolism that increased pentitols gamma-glutamyl amino acids and inositol metabolites or decreased pentoses dipeptides with treatment 9.A number of the compounds that increased or decreased by 10-fold in concentration during antibiotic treatment demonstrated normalization within 6 to 12 days concurrent with recovery of colonization resistance Figure 3.

Do piperacillintazobactam and other antibiotics with inhibitory activity against Clostridium difficile reduce the risk for acquisition of C. difficile colonization BMC Infect Dis.

Levels of bacterial metabolites in fecal specimens of mice treated with the same antibiotics were analyzed using non- targeted metabolic profiling by gas chromatograph GCmass spectrometry MS and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS UPLC-MSMS.Results--All of the antibiotics disrupted colonization resistance to C. difficile when challenge occurred 2 days after treatment.
