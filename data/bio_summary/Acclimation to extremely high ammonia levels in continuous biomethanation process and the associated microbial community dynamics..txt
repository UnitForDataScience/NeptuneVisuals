Calculations and statisticsOrganic loading rate-OLR g VS L-1 d-1Total ammonium nitrogen-1.95 - 0.13.3-3.84.3-6.06.5-8.08.5-10The FAN concentration was calculated by the following equationTAN g NH -N L-1 P1 was used as the baseline before acclimation strategy with addition of NH4Cl.FAN TAN1101and measured TAN levels and the calculated FAN levels for both re- actors are depicted in an E-supplement file.AnalysesPhysicochemical analysesTS VS TKN and TAN were measured according to .

First even though TAN levels were increased 1.6-folds to 10 g NH4-N L-1 the FAN levels were stable 800-850 mg NH3-N L-1 E-supplement file throughout the experiment due to the lower pH along with the am- monia increase c. This supports the hypothesis expressed by many researchers that FAN is the major toxic form of ammonia .

Overall the current study using protein-rich microalgae as primary substrate has shown for the first time that a successful continuous AD acclimation process to extremely high ammonia levels is possible.Microbial community dynamicsAlpha diversity a based on Chao 1 bias-corrected index decreased alongside with the increase of ammonia levels in both re- actors.

indicating strong hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity at extreme ammonia levels  7 g NH -N L-1.

Overall this study demonstrated for the first time that ac- climation of methanogenic communities to extreme ammonia levels in continuous AD process is possible by developing a specialised acclimation AD microbiome.IntroductionAnaerobic digestion AD is a sustainable technology that can pro- duce biogas and nutrient-rich bio-fertilizer from a broad variety of re- sidual biomass e.g.

Acclimation of microbial consortia to high ammonia levels could provide a practical and cost-effective method to digest protein-rich substrates .

Additionally a recent research showed that fast and efficient acclimatization of anaerobic consortia to high am- monia levels is possible in batch and fed-batch reactors  .

Lack of successfully acclimatizing the processTherefore the main aim of the present study was to use for the first time CSTR reactors fed with protein-rich microalgae 3rd generation biomass as the main substrate to successfully acclimatize methano- genic consortia to extremely high ammonia levels  7 g NH -N L-1 overcoming the microbial washout effect.
