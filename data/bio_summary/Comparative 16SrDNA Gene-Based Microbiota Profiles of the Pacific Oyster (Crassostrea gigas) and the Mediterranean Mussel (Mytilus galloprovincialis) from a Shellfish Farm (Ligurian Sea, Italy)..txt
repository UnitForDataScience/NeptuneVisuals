.In the haemolymph bacterial diversity was higher inC. gigas than in M. galloprovincialis and was dominated by the genera Pseudoalteromonas 24 and 25 relative abun- dance in C. gigas and M. galloprovincialis respectively and Vibrio 24 and 14 relative abundance in C. gigas andM.

.Effect of Depuration on C. gigas and M. galloprovincialisMicrobiotaThe composition and diversity of the bacterial community were also evaluated in haemolymph and digestive gland of specimens of C. gigas and M. galloprovincialis collected after commercial depuration.

Beta-diversity analysis also showed that the composition of the bacterial community was very similar in the haemolymph of C. gigas and M. galloprovincialis whereas differences were observed in the bacterial community compo- sition of digestive gland in the two bivalve species Fig.

The Vibrio genus also dominated the composition of the bacterial community in the digestive gland with higher relative abundance in C. gigas 36 than M. galloprovincialis 28 Fig.
