9f suggesting that Mesh controls insect gut-microbe homeostasis by regulating the expression of Duox but not Nox gene.Mesh regulates Duox expression via Arrestin-mediated MAPK phosphorylationWe examined the roles of major immune signaling pathways in AaDuox and AaMesh expression in the mosquito gut through dsRNA-mediated knockdown of key pathway modulators including components of the MAPK pathways AaP38 AaERK and AaJNK AaMyd88 of the Toll pathway AaImd of the Immune deficiency Imd pathway AaDome of Janus kinase JAK-signal transduction and activators of transcription STAT pathwayXiao et al.Page 6phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase AaPI3K and AaAkt of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway Supplementary Fig.

Induction of Duox gene expression is limited in an off-state status by phospholipase Cb PLCb-mediated mitogen- activated protein kinase MAPK P38 dephosphorylation in the Drosophila gut epithelia7.Modest ROS levels are achieved by activation of basal Duox expression through intracellular Ca2 mobilization by a G-protein a subunit q protein Gaq-PLCb signal cascade618.

Since generation of Duox-mediated ROS is a major gut immune response in maintenance of insect gut homeostasis our study reveals a fine-tuning mechanism for Duox expression to manage healthy gut-microbe interactions in insects.ResultsMesh controls Duox expression and gut microbiome load in A. aegypti and DrosophilaProteins with CCP domains are key immune factors restricting microbial infection in invertebrates232426.

Ectopic expression of DmMesh in Drosophila S2 cells resulted in more than 3-fold higher expression of the DmDuox Supplementary Fig.

Second depletion of the gut microbiome reduces Mesh expression while reconstitution of the microbiome recovers Mesh and Duox expression level in a microbial burden-dependent manner.

Besides the Duox gene that we focused on this study expression of a C-type lysozyme 9 LYSC9 was also significantly impaired by immuno-blockingsilencing AaMesh suggesting expression of LYSC9 might be controlled by Mesh-mediated signaling.

However under healthy conditions the expression of Duox is off-set by MAPK P38 dephosphorylation via PLC-b- MAP kinase phosphatase-3 MKP3 signaling7 indicating that the MAPK P38 signaling cascade plays a central role in regulating Duox expression during pathogenic microbial infections.

We show that a gut membrane-associated protein named Mesh plays an important role in controlling proliferation of gut bacteria by regulating Duox expression through an Arrestin-mediated MAPK JNKERK phosphorylation cascade.
