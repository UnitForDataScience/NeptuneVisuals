Maternal-to-offspring transmission of microbiota that impacts stress-related behavior and physiology was supported by evidence that maternal stress altered the maternal vaginal microbiota and that the inheritance of such microbiota abnormalities was sufficient to induce negative thigmotactic behavior in the offspring  Jasarevic et al.

ultrasonic vocalizations aggression mating juvenile play would provide greater insight into the nature of social behaviors affected by the microbiota.Links between the microbiota and social behavior are supported by additional studies that examine disruptions in the composition of the gut microbiota rather than the complete absence of microbes as in GF mice.

Transplantation of the microbiota from offspring of high-fat diet-fed mothers into GF mice re- capitulated social deficits whereas transplantation of standard microbiota into GF mice corrected social deficits.

This effect of the conventional microbiota on regulating social behavior could be mediated by the indigenous gut bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri which was reduced in the gut microbiota of high-fat diet offspring compared to controls.

Additional studies are needed to elucidate clear molecular and cellular signaling pathways between gut bacteria and the central nervous system and to determine whether microbial modulation of social behavior is host or context dependent.Reciprocal Interactions Between Social Behavior and the MicrobiotaIn addition to studies that support an effect of the microbiota on modulating social behavior there is also evidence that social behavior itself shapes the microbiota.

Although additional research is needed to test the causality and directionality for interactions between the microbiota and social behavior these initial studies have raised the question of whether microbiota-mediated changes in social behavior affect social transmission of the microbiota and whether there are consequences on both host and microbial fitness.

Social interactions could also propagate disease- causing microorganisms highlighting a need to examine whether pathogenic and mutualistic microbes have differential effects on the manifestation of social behavior.The Microbiota and Autism Spectrum DisorderEmerging research linking the microbiota to social behavior in addition to nutrition immunity and gastrointestinal function has motivated examinations of the microbiota in ASD a neurode- velopmental disease characterized by impaired social communication and stereotyped behavior and associated with various medical comorbidities including gastrointestinal issues and immune dysfunction.

Although these findings suggest that exposure to stressors can alter the composition of the gut microbiota many studies indicate that the microbiota can in turn influence stress-related behavior such as freezing reduced exploration and thigmotaxis as manifestations of the fight-or-flight response Table 2.

Taken together these findings reveal potential bidirectional interactions between the microbiota and stress behavior that may affect host responses to situational stressors.Conventionalization of young but not adult GF mice with standard SPF microbiota sufficientlyreversed abnormalities in exploratory behavior Diaz Heijtz et al.

2011.The importance of the early-life microbiota on programming later-life behavior is supported further by studies on the effects of maternal insults on the development of offspring microbiota and behavior.
