of the 287 eligible women 43 had a diagnosis of gdm and were included in the present study as the case group and 81 non-gdm women were randomlyabfigure 5 association of microbial genetic functional pathway composition in gdm patients and healthy pregnant women.

and staphylococcus aureus are sig- nificantly more abundant in overweight women than in normal- weight women .while the majority of previous studies have focused on asso- ciations between intestinal microbiota and obese states or t2d  13-15 some recent studies have sought to characterize mi- crobiota changes during pregnancy with the goal of providing novel insights into the relationship between microbiota changes during pregnancy and potential metabolic consequences .

this gene catalogue provided a suitable reference for metagenomic gene quantifica- tion microbial diversity analysis and metagenome-wide asso- ciation study for the pregnant women fecal samples.resultscomparison of the gut microbiota between gdm patients and healthy pregnant womenfirst we explored potential differences in the gut microbiome between 43 gdm patients and 81 healthy pregnant women.

future studies should explore how gut bacterial dysbiosis could be improved and evaluate the efficacy of potential interventions such as probiotics and dietary manipulation among pregnant women.methodsstudy population and samplingas part of the born in guangzhou cohort study bigcs  fecal samples were obtained from 298 pregnant women during their second trimester in guangzhou women and children's medical center gwcmc between 1 august 2012 and 31 august 2013. the inclusion criteria of the current study were as follows i without diseases that might affect glucose metabolism or mi- crobiome composition such as pre-pregnancy diabetes hyper- tension thyroid disorders asthma lipid metabolic disorders in- flammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome and celiac disease ii had not received any antibiotic treatment 1 month before sample collection iii had not taken probiotics 2 weeks before sample collection.

compared to non-gdm women women with gdm were more likely to be older and multiparous and have higher pre- pregnant weight pre-pregnancy body mass index bmi gesta- tional weight gain during pregnancy and premature delivery incidence.

a pregnant women gene catalogue containing 4 344 984 non-redundant genes was generated for fecal samples collected from these 124 pregnant women.

in the end 39.6 1 723 586 of the genes in the pregnant women gene catalogue were identified as novel.quantification of metagenomic genesthe abundance of genes in the combined non-redundant gene catalogue combining the pregnant women gene catalogue and igc was quantified as a relative abundance of reads.

here we compared the gut microbial composition of 43 gdm patients and 81 healthy pregnant women via whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of their fecal samples collected at 21-29 weeks to explore associations between gdm and the composition of microbial taxonomic units and functional genes.

gdm represents a heterogeneous group of metabolic disor- ders  that affects 3-14 of pregnancies and 20-50 of these affected women are expected to develop type 2 diabetes t2d within 5 years  .

studies based on sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna have re- vealed novel relationships between gut microbiome composi- tion and the metabolic hormonal environment in overweight and obese pregnant women in early gestation .

the objective was to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the connections be- tween the gut microbiome and the development of gdm.data descriptionwhole-metagenome shotgun sequencing was used to test gut microbial composition in fecal samples from 43 gdm pa- tients and 81 healthy pregnant women based on the illumina hiseq2000 platform in bgi-shenzhen china.

we performed de novo assembly and gene calling for data from each sample and con- structed a non-redundant gene catalogue of all pregnant women fecal samples containing 4 344 984 genes.
