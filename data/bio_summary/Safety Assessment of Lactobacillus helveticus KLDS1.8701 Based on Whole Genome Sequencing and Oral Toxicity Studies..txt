The aim of the present study is to critically assess the safety of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 based on genetic insight from the genomic data knowledge of phenotypic assays and performance in oral toxicity studies.ResultsTaxonomic Identification and MobilomesThe top-hit information from EzTaxon suggested that the strain KLDS1.8701 shares 99.93 similarity 16S rRNA gene sequence with L. helveticus DSM 20075T the value of ANI was 99.29 between the strain KLDS1.8701 and L. helveticus CNRZ 32.

A questionable and two incomplete prophage regions were identified in the genome of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 Table S1 which show differences in GC content compared to the average value of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 genome 36.89.Three separate CRISPR loci Table S2 and 9 CRISPR associated sequence cas genes were found in the genome of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 by the CRISPRfinder and searching against the local cas bank this number are relatively higher than other complete sequenced L. helveticus.

However the phenotypic results showed that the nitroreductase was not detected in the fermented supernatant and the optical purity of the produced lactic acid by the assay kit was estimated to be 98.5 L-lactic acid using LD-lactic acid enzymatic test kit implying that the production of D-lactic acid may be too little to be considered hazardous to consumers.Histamine tyramine phenylethylamine and cadaverine are produced by a one-step decarboxylation reaction with their respective active amino acid decarboxylase enzymes genes encoding these enzymes were absent in the genome of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 those genes encoding the conversion of arginine into putrescine arginine deiminase HUORS05500 ornithine carbamoyltransferase HUORS05505 carbamate kinase HUORS05510 existed as pseudogenes leading to a nonfunctional pathway genes encoding the pathway from agmatine to putrescine were not found in the genome of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701.

Almost all genera fluctuated between groups treated with L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 and the control group the groups treated with L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 in male rats showed an increase in genera containing probiotics such as Bifidobacterium Akkermansia and Lactobacillus and a decrease in genera containing opportunistic pathogens such as EscherichiaShigella Desulfovibrio Helicobacter Olsenella and Parabacteroides when compared with the control group.

The aim of the present study is to critically assess the safety of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 through multiple perspectives.

helveticus KLDS1.8701 was sequenced to mine for safety-associated genes.

The results in silico disclosed that the genome of L. helveticus KLDS1.8701 carries no transferable antibiotic resistance genes no virulence factors and only 3 genes related to adverse metabolites.
