Although our study population consisted mostly of children the majority of orthodontics study groups are composed of adolescents and young adults.Although oral hygiene education was given before the application of the SMs the present study showed that the plaque control was considered insufficient and that there were putative periodontal pathogens in the patients undergoing SM treatment.

However Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum which are other important bacteria in terms of causing periodontal disease were detected in five children two in the fixed SM group and three in the removable SM group and two children one fixed SM and one removable SM respectively.

The difference in results between our study and previous studies might be explained by the fact that the mean age of the subjects in our study group is lower than those of other studies which were carried out on orthodontic patients.

This prospective study was carried out because microbial and clinical periodontal data during SM treatment are largely lacking.The clinical results of this study demonstrated a significant increase in plaque formation after the application of both the fixed and removable appliances.

On the other hand the World Health Organization has reported that training children in the 7-9 age group about oral hygiene methods is more important and effective for preventive practices than training the other age groups.24Based on the methodology and follow-up period the limitations of this study were microbial evaluation based on detection of microorganism-prevalence of microorganism not considered and it was designed as short-term with 9-month follow-up.conclusIonThe findings of the present study emphasize theimportance of developing new oral hygiene education Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice  Volume 20  Issue 9  September 2017 and plaque control programs during SM treatment.

Thus children were randomly divided into two groups according to the type of SM used for treatment as follows Group 1 n  20 - fixed SM and Group 2 n  20 - removable SM.

Adams frequently cause a bacterial retention which can lead to an inflammatory response and resultant gingival hypertrophy and possible hyperplasia.3-5 However no information is available on the microbiological changes that these periodontal tissues experience during treatment with fixed or removable SMs.With the limited information available in the literature the aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and microbiological changes accompanying the inflammatory Address for correspondence Dr. H Simsek Department of Pedodontics Faculty of Dentistry Ordu University 52100 Ordu Turkey.E-mail This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License which allows others to remix tweak and build upon the work non-commercially as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.For reprints contact c 2017 Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice  Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknowresponse of periodontal tissues during treatment withfixed and removal SMs.MAterIAls And MethodsThis study included forty 6- to 9-year-old mean age  7.4 - 2.7 years referred to the Department of Pediatric Dentistry Faculty of Dentistry Erciyes University Turkey for the premature extraction of a primary maxillary or mandibular first or second molar due to caries andor failed pulp therapy.
