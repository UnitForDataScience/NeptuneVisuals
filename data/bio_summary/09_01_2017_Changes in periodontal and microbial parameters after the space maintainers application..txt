this prospective study was carried out because microbial and clinical periodontal data during sm treatment are largely lacking.the clinical results of this study demonstrated a significant increase in plaque formation after the application of both the fixed and removable appliances.

although our study population consisted mostly of children the majority of orthodontics study groups are composed of adolescents and young adults.although oral hygiene education was given before the application of the sms the present study showed that the plaque control was considered insufficient and that there were putative periodontal pathogens in the patients undergoing sm treatment.

on the other hand the world health organization has reported that training children in the 7-9 age group about oral hygiene methods is more important and effective for preventive practices than training the other age groups.24based on the methodology and follow-up period the limitations of this study were microbial evaluation based on detection of microorganism-prevalence of microorganism not considered and it was designed as short-term with 9-month follow-up.conclusionthe findings of the present study emphasize theimportance of developing new oral hygiene education nigerian journal of clinical practice  volume 20  issue 9  september 2017 and plaque control programs during sm treatment.

the amount of plaque was scored according to the following parameters score 0 no plaque on the tooth score 1 plaque covering up to one-third of the surface score 2 plaque covering more than one-third but less than two-thirds of the tooth surface and score 3 plaque covering more than two-thirds of the tooth.

adams frequently cause a bacterial retention which can lead to an inflammatory response and resultant gingival hypertrophy and possible hyperplasia.3-5 however no information is available on the microbiological changes that these periodontal tissues experience during treatment with fixed or removable sms.with the limited information available in the literature the aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and microbiological changes accompanying the inflammatory address for correspondence dr. h simsek department of pedodontics faculty of dentistry ordu university 52100 ordu turkey.e-mail this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike 3.0 license which allows others to remix tweak and build upon the work non-commercially as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.for reprints contact c 2017 nigerian journal of clinical practice  published by wolters kluwer - medknowresponse of periodontal tissues during treatment withfixed and removal sms.materials and methodsthis study included forty 6- to 9-year-old mean age  7.4 - 2.7 years referred to the department of pediatric dentistry faculty of dentistry erciyes university turkey for the premature extraction of a primary maxillary or mandibular first or second molar due to caries andor failed pulp therapy.

however prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum which are other important bacteria in terms of causing periodontal disease were detected in five children two in the fixed sm group and three in the removable sm group and two children one fixed sm and one removable sm respectively.

these results are in accordance with another clinical study5 which reported that regardless of the quality of plaque control fixed and removable sms can compromise periodontal health by increasing plaque accumulation.

in the removable group however the difference in bop scores between t1 and t2 was not significant p  0.05. significant differences in bop scores between the fixed and removable groups were found at the t2 assessment p  0.05.microbiologythe anaerobic microorganisms detected in the analyses of the subgingival microbiota are presented in tables 2 and 3. the most frequently isolated bacterial species were prevotella phylotypes especially prevotella oralis.the presence of anaerobic bacteria in the subgingival dental plaque increased from t0 n  13 65 to t1 n  16 80 in the fixed sm group but not significantly p  0.05 and the same values were obtained in t1 and t2 n  16 80. in the removable group however the presence of anaerobic bacteria in the subgingival dental plaque was detected at the same rate n  15 75 in t0 and t1 and it increased at t2 n  17 85 but not significantly p  0.05. the most important bacteria that cause periodontal tissue loss - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans aa porphyromonas gingivalis pg tannerella forshia and prevotella nigrescens - were not detected in any patients.

thus children were randomly divided into two groups according to the type of sm used for treatment as follows group 1 n  20 - fixed sm and group 2 n  20 - removable sm.

the difference in results between our study and previous studies might be explained by the fact that the mean age of the subjects in our study group is lower than those of other studies which were carried out on orthodontic patients.
