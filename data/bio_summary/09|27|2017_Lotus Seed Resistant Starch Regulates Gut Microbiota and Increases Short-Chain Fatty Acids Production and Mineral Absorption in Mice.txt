then the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups of 14 mice each 1 normal control nc group in which mice were given the same volume of distilled water and the basal diet was provided ad libitum 2 low dose of lrs3 ld group in which mice were given the same volume of distilled water and fed a modified basal diet with 5 lrs3 3 medium dose of lrs3 md group in which mice were given the same volume of distilled water and fed a modified basal diet with 10 lrs3 4 high dose of lrs3 hd group in which mice were given the same volume of distilled water and fed a modified basal diet with 15 lrs3 and 5 hams group in which mice were given the same volume of distilled water and fed a modified basal diet with 10 high amylose maize starch.

different letters within the before or after mean statistical differences in the category p  0.05 and the symbols  represent statistical differences between same groups before and after feeding lrs3 p  0.05.previous study of resistant starch.ruminococcaceae bands 11 and 19 belong to the firmicutes which can utilize resistant starch to produce scfas especially butyrate.band 22 was identified as representing clostridium which is also a type of putative butyrate-producing bacteria.thus medium and high doses of lrs3 could increase the amount of starch-utilizing bacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria such as bacteroidaceae lachnospiraceae ruminococcaceae and clostridium.moreover the bacteria most similar to that represented by bands 7 and 8 was rikenellaceae and those most similar to the bacteria represented by bands 9 17 18 21 and 26-28 belonged to porphyromonadaceae.

this was similar to a previous reportin which resistant starch kept subjects significantly less hungry than baseline feed for 120 min and more full and satisfied for an 180 min test period.additionally the food intake was also lower when feed contained resistant starch compared with other treatments.microbiota analysis of dgge profiles.

scfas canreduce the ph of the intestinal environment thus affecting the intestinal flora's structure promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting the proliferation of pathogens which promotes human health.resistant starch regulates the intestinal tract such as increasing the intestinal absorption of minerals lowering blood lipid effects and preventing colorectal cancer mainly through the scfas.-lotus seeds are the mature seeds from the genus nelumbo especially nelumbo nucifera which is an important commercial crop in china.it contains a high level of amylose 40 ww which may contribute to the formation of lotus seed resistant starch type 3 lrs3.lrs3 can stimulate the growth ofbifidobacterium.the prebiotic effect of lrs3 results from a combination of factors including the surface microstructure double-helix structure and biological mechanisms.

the apparent absorption of ca was significantly greater in mice fed medium and high levels of lrs3 as well as hams than in those fed the basal and the low-level lrs3 diets a. the mice in the hd group displayed the greatest apparent absorption of ca which increased as the resistant starch intake increased.

at the beginning of the experiment the body weights of the mice were 18.0 - 1.0 g. the body weights of mice in each group increased over time and the gain rate of mice in the nc group was the greatest among thesetable 2. diversity analysis from the dgge banding profiles generated from the v3 region of bacterial 16s rdnabandshannon-wiener h'evenness erichness s nc3.30 - 0.08 a0.97 - 0.01 a30.56 - 1.83 ald3.15 - 0.06 b0.97 - 0.01 a26.93 - 0.34 bmd3.16 - 0.03 b0.97 - 0.01 a26.07 - 1.06 bchd3.14 - 0.07 b0.98 - 0.01 a25.14 - 1.05 chams3.28 - 0.05 a0.97 - 0.01 a30.22 - 1.05 aadifferent letters in the same column represent significant differences between different treatments p  0.05.table 3. bacterial identification based on bands in the dggegroups p  0.05. the mice fed lrs3 gained less weight com- pared with the nc and hams groups which may indicate that diets with appropriate resistant starch contents were conducive to controlling body weight.

the sequencing analysis showed that bacteria represented by bands 5 10 12 and 14 were closest to butyrate-producing bacteria especially bands 10 and 12 that belonged to butyrivibrio which can produce butyrate by fermenting lactate and acetate.these potential butyrate-producing bacteria increased as the intake amount of lrs3 increased which was consistent with ato resistant starch or its secondary metabolites such as scfas.

the flow rates of carrier gas fuel gas and oxidant gas were 20 mlmin of n2 30 mlmin of h2 and 300 mlmin of airfigure 1. effect of lotus seed resistant starch on the body weights of mice.respectively.

this corroborated the report of giuberti et al.in which the weights of pigs were impacted markedly by the resistant starch content of the feed.
