In support of this in shallow-water corals increased bacterial diversity with increasing water depth has been suggested as a mechanism to aid nutrient acquisition.Studies of Red Sea corals along with those in the PersianArabian Gulf are of interest in light of global climate change because corals in this region thrive at summer temperatures 31 degC that are hostile for corals from other regions.

OPENReceived 30 November 2016Accepted 13 February 2017Published 17 March 2017Microbial community composition of deep-sea corals from the Red Sea provides insight into functional adaption to a unique environmentTill Rothig Lauren K.Yum Stephan G. Kremb Anna Roik  Christian R. VoolstraMicrobes associated with deep-sea corals remain poorly studied.

The discovery of deep-sea corals at this temperature prompted a reconsideration of environmental limitations of deep-sea corals previously considered to be limited to temperatures of 4-14 degC.

To further test whether differences between corals exist we excluded seawater and performed a PERMANOVA across corals.

This indicates that species richness in corals was similar to that of the sur- rounding seawater.

Microbes associated with corals in this study also seemed remarkably consistent for a given coral species in comparison to a previous study that found pronounced differences between colonies.

We identified significant differences between coral species PPERMANOVA 0.0019 Pseudo-F  3.3554 4707 unique permutations and subsequent pair-wise tests showed all coral species differed significantly from each other Table S1.Core microbiomes.

Based on the statistically significant differences between coral species we next assessed differences in absencepresence of individual bacterial taxa across coral species.

Core microbiomes largely encompassed bacterial taxa that were unique to a given coral species and only few members were shared between species.

E. fistula and R. typus from the Red Sea to extend the catalog of available coral species and provide insight into putative indications of functional adaption to this unique and warm environment.In order to characterize differences in the microbiomes from the three coral species Dendrophyllia sp.E.
