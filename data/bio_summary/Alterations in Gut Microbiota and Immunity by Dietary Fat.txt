according to two recent studies although th17 cells are well-known potent ef- fector cells in autoimmune diseases their reduction in the small intestine has been found to contribute to onset of hfd-in- duced metabolic changes.63 supporting this contention sev- eral studies have shown that th17 cells do not always induce immuneinflammatory disorders and can be divided into pa- thogenic and non-pathogenic cells.6667 in this regard intestinal th17 cells decreased by hfd seem to be non-pathogenic th17 cells rather than pathogen th17 cells.

lpam-1 a4b7 is a critical receptor for gut homing of t cells.6869 in addition il-17 per se plays an important role in the improvement of metabolic profiles since th17 cells from il-17-knockout mice have sig- nificantly less metabolic effects.64 given that th17 cells produce il-22 as well as il-17 th17 cells may also improve metabolic syndrome via il-22 production.61 moreover since th17 cell tr- ansfer leads to expansion of microbiota associated with leanphenotype such as bacteriodetes or akkermansia64 the role of gut microbiota cannot be overlooked in regards to the meta- bolic improvement by th17 cells.

in this review we summarize recent findings on changes in gut microbiota and intestinal immunity in associa- tion with diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.changes in gut microbiota associated with metabolic syndromehow does intestinal microbiota influence obesity and diabetesthe gut microbiota in humans consist of 10-100 trillion micro- organisms and outnumber all somatic and germ cells by 1041083although it has recently been claimed that such number could be an overestimation.

in- terestingly transfer of gut microbiota from obese mice to re- cipient gf mice significantly increased body fat content and insulin resistance compared to the transfer of gut microbiota from lean mice.1819 these results suggest a crucial role of gut microbiota in nutrient homeostasis and also a possible etiologi- cal role of altered gut microbiota in the development of meta- bolic syndrome.phylum level changes and enterotypeto investigate the role of microbiota in nutrient uptake or in the development of metabolic syndrome identification of indi- vidual microorganism is crucial.

the development of metabolic syndrome in tlr5-knockout mice appears to be due to changes in gut microbiota associated with the absence of tlr5 in the intestine since fecal microbi- al transplantation confers transfer of metabolic phenotype to wild-type mice.55 following studies showed a crucial role of the absence of tlr5 in intestinal epithelial cells but not that in dendritic cells dcs in the development of metabolic syn- drome.56 altered gut microbiota in tlr5-knockout mice can increase hepatic lipogenesis mediated by stearoyl coa desat- urase through production of cecal scfas.57changes in innate immune cells in the gut of metabolic syndromeat the cell level several changes were noted in obese subjects or hfd-fed mice.

a direct role of intes- tinal tlr in metabolic syndrome has been demonstrated us- ing mice with targeted disruption of myd88 specifically in gut epithelial cells that are partially protected from diet-induced obesity and metabolic inflammation.54 in contrast myd88 de- letion in myeloid cells does not improve the metabolic profile of mice fed hfd indicating a more important role of innate immune receptors in intestinal epithelial cells than in myeloid cells in the development of metabolic syndrome.an intriguing model of metabolic syndrome associated with the activation of innate immune receptors in the intestine is the occurrence of metabolic syndrome in tlr5-knockout mice.

given that cd103-cx3cr1cd11chigh macrophages preferentially induce th1 cells and cd103- cx3cr1cd11clow macrophages preferentially induce th17 cells changes in their abundances may be linked to alterna- tions of intestinal adaptive immunity see below section regard- ing adaptive immunity of the gut.changes in the adaptive immunity of the gut in metabolic syndromerecent investigations have shown a significant change in the adaptive immunity of the intestine in association with meta- bolic syndrome th1 cell increases and treg cell decreases in the intestinal lamina propria of hfd-fed mice.60 in humans cd8ab intraepithelial lymphocytes iels are increased by obesity and these iels impair insulin sensitivity of epithelial cells.65 in addition to cells traditionally associated with meta- bolic abnormalities th17 cells in the intestine may also play a role in the control of metabolic inflammation.

as discussed above the anti-diabetic drug metformin can exert beneficial metabolic effects through modulation of gut microbiota in mice and human patients.384346 the action of metformin as an anti- aging or pro-longevity agent3843 may also be related to its ef- fect on gut microbiota.44 anti-inflammatory agent 5-aminosali- cylic acid can improve metabolic syndrome through suppres- sion of inflammation as well.60 active components of akker- mansia such as amuc1100 and delivery of gut-tropic th17 cells or agents that can boost non-pathogenic th17 cells spe- cifically in the intestine may also be able to open a new horizon in the development of next-generation therapies against met- abolic syndrome or diabetes.conclusionchanges in the gut microbiota and immunity are being accept- ed as important elements in the development of metabolicsyndrome and diabetes.

compared with their lean counterparts leptin-deficient obob mice have a decreased abundance of bacteroidetes and a correspondingly increased abundance of firmicutes.21 further studies have confirmed similar changes in mice with diet-induced obesity a more physiological model of obesity than obob mice while overall diversity among firmicutes is different from that of obob mice.18 similar changes in gut microbiota have also been ob- served in humans.19 furthermore there seems to be a causality between changes in gut microbiota and obesity since transfer of gut microbiota from obese mice to recipient gf mice pro- motes fat deposition.18 the mechanism of increased firmicutes abundance in obesity might be related to an enrichment of ho- moacetogens belonging to firmicutes in obesity which facili- tates disposal of h2 produced by anaerobic bacteria during fer- mentation of nutrients.22 among bacteroidetes a role for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron a glutamate-fermenting bacteria in obesity was addressed in a recent study.

moreover administration of metformin ameliorates met- abolic inflammation and restores treg cells in adipose tissue similar to the effect of akkermansia administration.3843 in a pre- vious study metformin action on gut microbiota of hfd-fed mice is analogous to the metformin action on gut microbiota of caenorhabditis elegans which results in alteration of folate and the methionine metabolism of e. coli in the intestine of the worm.44 intriguingly metformin administration greatly in- creases the abundance of akkermansia in patients with type 2 diabetes as well.4546while these results suggest potential therapeutic value of ak- kermansia or its components as a drug candidate against meta- bolic syndrome such prospects have been hampered by the sensitivity of akkermansia to oxygen the presence of animal- derived compounds in its growth medium and the absence of metabolic effects of killed bacteria.3738 however a recent pa- per showed that akkermansia can be cultured successfully in a synthetic medium which contains no compounds that are incompatible with human administration and also that the pasteurized akkermansia has stronger effects than live bacteri- um.

however th17 cells from integrin b7-knockout mice had no such meta- bolic effects suggesting that gut homing of th17 cells is crucial in the metabolic improvement by th17 cells.

alteration of gut microbiota by th17 cells may be due to changes in antimicrobial pep- tides such as reg3g produced by paneth cells fig.

hfd in particular increas- es the frequency of th1 cells among the cd4 t cells and decreases those of th17 and treg cells.

il-17 mainly produced by th17 cells reverses decreased gran- ules and antimicrobial peptide production of paneth cells leading to expansion of microbiota associated with lean phenotype.
