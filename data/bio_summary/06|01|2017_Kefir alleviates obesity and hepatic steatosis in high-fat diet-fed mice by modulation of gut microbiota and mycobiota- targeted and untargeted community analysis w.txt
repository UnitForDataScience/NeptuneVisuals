In contrast kefir-fed mice exhibited significantly lower plasma concentrations of IL-6 than the control mice P.03 suggesting that kefir administration might ameliorate the systemic low-grade inflammation in HFD-fed mice.Effects of kefir consumption on gene expression in adipose and hepatic tissuesTo explore mechanisms by which kefir consumption affect inflammation and lipid metabolism in HFD-fed mice we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of genes encoding proteins related to lipid oxidation PPARa and AOX lipogenesis ACC SREBP-c1 DGAT and ACS and inflammation and oxidative stress TNF-a MCP1 and SOD2 as well as that of the gene encoding the adipocyte hormone leptin in epididymal adipose A and hepatic tissue B.

Then experimental mice were randomly divided into two groups 10 mice each the kefir group and control group and the initial body weights were measured.

Adipose tissues and livers of mice in the kefir group were significantly lower in weight and smaller than those of the control mice P.000009 and P.0196 respectively and Fig.

Feed efficiency or total weight gainedg of total diet consumed was lower 0.102 for the kefir fed mice than the control 0.126.Effects of kefir consumption on liver histopathologyLiver sections from mice administered kefir or milk are presented in .

The hepatocytes of the mice in the control group showed severe macrovascular accumulation of lipid droplets within the cytoplasm A and B and ballooning injury was observed around the central vein C. In contrast the hepatocytes of kefir-fed mice showed only mild accumulation of lipid droplets and no ballooningFig.

CV central vein.D and E. As such the histopathological lesion score for the mice in the kefir group was significantly lower than that of the control group P.002 F.Effect of kefir consumption on intestinal microbiota and mycobiota targeted and untargeted community analysisThe gut microbiota and mycobiota of the mice administered kefir or milk were investigated by targeted group-specific qPCR and untargeted NGS community analysis and the results are shown in.

In contrast the abundance of the family Clostridiaceae in the phylum Firmicutes was lower in the kefir group 2.89 than in the control group 5.14.Furthermore the phyla Ascomycota 49.06 and 47.05 and Basidiomycota 15.75 and 17.77 comprised the vast majority of the gut yeast flora among the mice of the kefir and control groups respectively C. The greatest increase in prevalence among classes in the phylum Ascomycota was observed for the class Saccharomycetes which contains the genus Candida the major yeast of kefir 5.51 in the kefir group and 3.76 in the control group C. Interestingly the proportion of the genus Kluyveromyces derived from kefir in the total identified gut yeast was 1.51 in the kefir group whereas the control group had none.Effects of kefir consumption on plasma lipid contents and plasma proinflammatory cytokine concentrationsMice in the kefir group exhibited significantly lower plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol than the control mice P.0019 and P.000084 respectively A.

For example B6 mice fed Bacteroides acidifaciens were less likely to gain weight than mice without B. acidifacienssupplementation .
