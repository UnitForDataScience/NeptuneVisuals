Enzymes UDP-glucosecinnamate glucosyl- transferase CGT cinnamate-glucose 40-hydroxylase CG4H p-coumaroyl-glucose 30-hydroxylase CG3H and hydroxycinnamoyl glucose- quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase HCGQT.A high acyl-quinic acid content has been linked to the allelopathic potential and resistance to root disease of some sweet potato clones169 via an inhibition of fungal toxin production.170 An elevated 5-CQA content of transgenic tomato plants has been associated with enhanced tolerance to paraquat-induced oxidative stress and resistance to infection by the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae.171 Acyl-quinic acids acting as defence metabolites may have possible links to phytohormone-activated defense signaling networks as implied in Nicotiana tabacum cells treated with salicylic acid 23 and methyl-jasmonate 24.172 The defense signaling networks produce a range of acyl-quinic acids to combat pathogens and some are capable of inhibiting cell wall degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonase and cutinase produced by the pathogens.173In tomato plants CQA has been associated with a protective ability against oxidative damage when exposed to salinity or a combination of salinity and heat.174 Studies with transgenic tobacco plants have demonstrated that inhibition of acyl-quinic acid biosynthesis makes the plants more susceptible to oxida- tive damage and accelerated cell death175 while in tomato globe artichoke and chamomile Matricaria chamomilla acyl-quinic acids appear to protect against UV damage.176-178 There is evidence that these compounds also protect against predatorsbecause those which are substrates for polyphenol oxidase and or peroxidase are readily converted to quinones which react readily with nucleophiles and link covalently to protein.179-182 This interaction is thought to have anti-feedant activity for example limiting the growth of herbivorous insect pests by impairing digestibility of the hosts' proteins.183-185Acyl-quinic acids in coffeeMuch of the literature on acyl-quinic acids focuses on coffee and green beans which contain substantial amounts.

The geometric isomers of cinnamoyl-quinic acids fragment identically48 but the cis-isomers can be distinguished by UV- irradiation62 sodium-adduct MS93 and ion mobility-MS.94 Using the hierarchical keys it is possible to identify at regio-isomer levelin excess of 20 acyl-quinic acids in a single run subject to adequate analyte concentration.3177788395-115 It is false economy to characterise CGAs and avonoids in a single run becauseavonoids require harsher MS conditions which mask the structure-diagnostic fragmentations of the acyl-quinic acids and invalidate the hierarchical keys.The hydrogen-bonding networks responsible for these distinctive fragmentations have been deduced.58 For some regio-isomers the charge may be on a phenolic hydroxyl rather than the quinic acid carboxyl.116 Accurate mass may be helpful but is not essential to distinguish diCQA from CQA-glycosides because the glycosides yield characteristic MS2 ions mz 341 and 32384 the latter as the base peak indicating a 30-glycoside.103107 TriCQA diCQA-glycosides and CQA-biosides as well as acyl- isocitric acids and acyl-quinic acids can be distinguished simi- larly but only fragmentation can distinguish between isobaric methyl-CQ FQA and isoFQA and acyl-quinides and acyl-shikimic acids.58 Methyl-CQ and methyl-diCQ fragment very differently from CQA and diCQA83 which coupled with the 'reversed' order of elution for the methyl CQ necessitates care in regio-isomer assignment.

The recoveries of acyl-quinic acidTable 7 Quantities of acyl-quinic acids and metabolites recovered in ileal fluid collected 0-24 h after the consumption of 200 mL of instant coffee containing 385 mmol of acyl-quinic acids by humans with an ileostomy after Stalmach et al.214ametabolites were much lower ranging from 3.6 to 8.8 except for CQL metabolites which corresponds to 56 of CQL intake.Of the 385 mmol of acyl-quinic acids ingested by the ileosto- mists 274 mmol 71 was recovered in the 0-24 h ileal uid asAcyl-quinic acids and metabolitesIleal uid mmolRecovery of amountingested the parent compounds and metabolites Table 7.

5 many quantitatively minor acyl-quinic acids have also been identied.33102114186187 Currently green coffee with 72 acyl- quinic acids is second only to Lonicera japonica Japanese honeysuckle which contains a record 111 in the form of 35 trans-cinnamoyl-quinic acids 17 cis isomers and 49 acyl-quinic acid glucosides.188The principal component in green coffee beans is always 5-CQA9 and is accompanied by numerous diacyl-quinic acids and some triacyl-quinic acids.

To this must be added chrysanthemorimic acids a series of recently discovered diCQAs in which one caffeic acid residue has undergone a 5  2 cycloaddition of D-glucose.55The IUPAC system however has limitations when applied to acyl-quinic acids and Abrank'o and Clifford54 have proposed a combination of IUPAC cyclitol numbering51 the Cahn-Ingold- Prelog CIP sequence rules56 plus the use of a to dene a hydroxyl trans to the quinic acid carboxyl and b to dene a hydroxyl cis to the quinic acid carboxyl to describe the orientation of a substit- uent on a carbon atom which is not a centre of chirality as fav- oured by Eliel and Ramirez.57 This approach can accommodate all eight quinic acid stereo-isomers with for example IUPAC -- quinic acid described as 1L---quinic acid 3R5R-1a3a4a5b.54 ESI Table S2 provides a comprehensive set of structures for the various quinic acids which in addition to using different styles of presentation Fischer-Tollens 2D alternative chair conforma- tions also considers the perspective from which a structure is viewed.Characterisation and quantification of acyl-quinic acidsThis section of the review draws on three open-access docu- ments which contain extensive tabulations and discussion of the topics presented here.15356ExtractionExtraction of acyl-quinic acids from plant material generally employs aqueous alcohol usually 70 MeOH.

Although Robusta coffees contain all six CFQA and all six p-coumaroyl-caffeoylquinic acids intriguingly they only contain three caffeoyl-3040-dimethoxycinnamoyl-quinic acids feruloyl-3040-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acidsp-coumaroyl-feruloylquinicacidsandp-coumaroyl-3040-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acids highlighting some subtle control of biosynthesis.Roasting of green coffee beans can result in acyl-quinic acidlosses of 90.43 Substantial transformations also occur and the number of acyl-quinic acids detected in the roasted bean increases to over 200 as judged by the number of characteristic fragments observed in tandem mass spectrometry-basedTable 3 Cinnamoyl-amino acid conjugates in green and roasted coffee beansCinnamoyl-amino acid conjugatesp-Coumaroyl-N-tyrosine186 Caffeoyl-N-tyrosine186 Feruloyl-N-tyrosine186p-Coumaroyl-N-tryptophan186 Caffeoyl-N-tryptophan186 Feruloyl-N-tryptophan186 Caffeoyl-N-phenylalanine186p-Coumaroyl-N-aspartic acid187 Caffeoyl-N-aspartic acid187analyses in comparison with the 72 derivatives detected in the green coffee bean.303133102114115186187190 Acyl migration and hydrolysis during coffee roasting changes the relative propor- tions of each subgroup being most obvious within the CQAs FQAs and diCQAs with 3-CQA being very susceptible tohydrolysis.

Of more importance is the 4-5-fold inter-individual variation in the quantity of acyl-quinic acids metabolites excreted by volunteers who consume the same coffee Table 13 which is further compounded by the large vari- ations in the acyl-quinic acids content of seemingly similar coffees consumed by the general public as noted in Section 6.43201202BioactivityPotential health benets have been associated with coffee consumption including a reduced incidence of several chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer cardiovascular disorders diabetes and Parkinson's disease and the protective effects have been ascribed at least in part to the acyl-quinic acids present in the brew.253-255 However relatively little infor- mation exists about their mechanisms of action.
