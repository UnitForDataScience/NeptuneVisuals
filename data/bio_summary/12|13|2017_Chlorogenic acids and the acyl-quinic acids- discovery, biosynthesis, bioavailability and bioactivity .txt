nevertheless with such a pattern of repeat consumptionthere is clearly a potential for a sizable accumulation of gut ora metabolites in the plasma because a subsequent dose of substrate will have entered the colon before the previous intake has been eliminated.in a further study ileostomists drank an instant coffee witha very similar 385 mmol 136 mg acyl-quinic acid content and prole to that ingested by the healthy subjects.214 plasma metab- olites were not investigated but data on the amounts of acyl- quinic acids and their metabolites in ileal uid collected over a 0-24 h period aer the ingestion of coffee are presented in table 7. the highest recovery of unmetabolised acyl-quinic acids compared to their intake was fqas 77 followed by cqas 59 and p-coqas and dicqas 46. the recoveries of acyl-quinic acidtable 7 quantities of acyl-quinic acids and metabolites recovered in ileal fluid collected 0-24 h after the consumption of 200 ml of instant coffee containing 385 mmol of acyl-quinic acids by humans with an ileostomy after stalmach et al.214ametabolites were much lower ranging from 3.6 to 8.8 except for cql metabolites which corresponds to 56 of cql intake.of the 385 mmol of acyl-quinic acids ingested by the ileosto- mists 274 mmol 71 was recovered in the 0-24 h ileal uid asacyl-quinic acids and metabolitesileal uid mmolrecovery of amountingested the parent compounds and metabolites table 7. this indicates that 30 of intake is absorbed in the stomach andor small intestine and that in subjects with a functioning colon 70 ofthe ingested acyl-quinic acids pass from the small to the large3-o-caffeoylquinic acid55 - 64-o-caffeoylquinic acid45 - 65-o-caffeoylquinic acid64 - 10total caffeoylquinic acids164 - 2259 - 83-o-caffeoylquinic acid-sulfate3.5 - 0.54-o-caffeoylquinic acid-sulfate5.1 - 0.65-o-caffeoylquinic acid-sulfate0.7 - 0.23-o-caffeoylquinic acid-o-glucuronide0.7 - 0.24-o-caffeoylquinic acid-o-glucuronide0.4 - 0.2total caffeoylquinic acid metabolites10 - 13.6 - 0.43-o-feruloylquinic acid12 - 14-o-feruloylquinic acid12 - 15-o-feruloylquinic acid13 - 1total feruloylquinic acids37 - 477 - 83-o-feruloylquinic acid-sulfate0.7 - 0.24-o-feruloylquinic acid-sulfate0.8 - 0.25-o-feruloylquinic acid-sulfate0.3 - 0.13-o-feruloylquinic acid-o-glucuronide0.4 - 0.14-o-feruloylquinic acid-o-glucuronide2.0 - 0.3total feruloylquinic acid metabolites4.2 - 0.68.8 - 1.33-o-caffeoylquinic lactone1.0 - 0.34-o-caffeoylquinic lactone1.5 - 0.1total caffeoylquinic lactones2.5 - 0.36.4 - 0.83-o-caffeoylquinic lactone-sulfate13 - 2.44-o-caffeoylquinic lactone-sulfate8.2 - 1.73-o-caffeoylquinic lactone-o-glucuronide0.6 - 0.24-o-caffeoylquinic lactone-o-glucuronide0.4 - 0.1total caffeoylquinic lactone metabolites22 - 4.456 - 114-o-p-coumaroylquinic acid1.1 - 0.35-o-p-coumaroylquinic acid1.9 - 0.2total p-coumaroylquinic acids3.0 - 0.246 - 334-o-dicaffeoylquinic acid3.0 - 0.335-o-dicaffeoylquinic acid1.3 - 0.245-o-dicaffeoylquinic acid2.2 - 0.2total dicaffeoylquinic acids6.5 - 0.746 - 5caffeic acid9.0 - 3.1caffeic acid-30- and 40-sulfates11 - 2ferulic acid0.8 - 0.3ferulic acid-40-sulfate4.2 - 1.0total caffeic and ferulic acids25 - 5-total acyl-quinic acids and metabolites274 - 2871 - 7a data presented as mean values - standard error n 14 5. n.d - not detected.intestine where they will be subjected to the action of the colonic microora.

the geometric isomers of cinnamoyl-quinic acids fragment identically48 but the cis-isomers can be distinguished by uv- irradiation62 sodium-adduct ms93 and ion mobility-ms.94 using the hierarchical keys it is possible to identify at regio-isomer levelin excess of 20 acyl-quinic acids in a single run subject to adequate analyte concentration.3177788395-115 it is false economy to characterise cgas and avonoids in a single run becauseavonoids require harsher ms conditions which mask the structure-diagnostic fragmentations of the acyl-quinic acids and invalidate the hierarchical keys.the hydrogen-bonding networks responsible for these distinctive fragmentations have been deduced.58 for some regio-isomers the charge may be on a phenolic hydroxyl rather than the quinic acid carboxyl.116 accurate mass may be helpful but is not essential to distinguish dicqa from cqa-glycosides because the glycosides yield characteristic ms2 ions mz 341 and 32384 the latter as the base peak indicating a 30-glycoside.103107 tricqa dicqa-glycosides and cqa-biosides as well as acyl- isocitric acids and acyl-quinic acids can be distinguished simi- larly but only fragmentation can distinguish between isobaric methyl-cq fqa and isofqa and acyl-quinides and acyl-shikimic acids.58 methyl-cq and methyl-dicq fragment very differently from cqa and dicqa83 which coupled with the 'reversed' order of elution for the methyl cq necessitates care in regio-isomer assignment.

5 many quantitatively minor acyl-quinic acids have also been identied.33102114186187 currently green coffee with 72 acyl- quinic acids is second only to lonicera japonica japanese honeysuckle which contains a record 111 in the form of 35 trans-cinnamoyl-quinic acids 17 cis isomers and 49 acyl-quinic acid glucosides.188the principal component in green coffee beans is always 5-cqa9 and is accompanied by numerous diacyl-quinic acids and some triacyl-quinic acids.

to this must be added chrysanthemorimic acids a series of recently discovered dicqas in which one caffeic acid residue has undergone a 5  2 cycloaddition of d-glucose.55the iupac system however has limitations when applied to acyl-quinic acids and abrank'o and clifford54 have proposed a combination of iupac cyclitol numbering51 the cahn-ingold- prelog cip sequence rules56 plus the use of a to dene a hydroxyl trans to the quinic acid carboxyl and b to dene a hydroxyl cis to the quinic acid carboxyl to describe the orientation of a substit- uent on a carbon atom which is not a centre of chirality as fav- oured by eliel and ramirez.57 this approach can accommodate all eight quinic acid stereo-isomers with for example iupac -- quinic acid described as 1l---quinic acid 3r5r-1a3a4a5b.54 esi table s2 provides a comprehensive set of structures for the various quinic acids which in addition to using different styles of presentation fischer-tollens 2d alternative chair conforma- tions also considers the perspective from which a structure is viewed.characterisation and quantification of acyl-quinic acidsthis section of the review draws on three open-access docu- ments which contain extensive tabulations and discussion of the topics presented here.15356extractionextraction of acyl-quinic acids from plant material generally employs aqueous alcohol usually 70 meoh.

the increasing proportion of glucuronidation with increasing acyl-quinic acid dose was even more marked in urine table 9 arguably indicative of phase ii udp- glucuronyltransferase activity in the small intestine epithe- lium andor in the liver and kidneys.data on the effect of dose on plasma cmax of acyl-quinic acidsand metabolites absorbed in the small intestine aer ingestion of coffee by healthy subjects with a colon lowest dose and ileostomists are presented in table 11. this reveals a clear trend towards higher cmax values with increasing acyl-quinic acids intakes.matrix effects and acyl-quinic acid bioavailabilitythere is one report on the consumption by humans of black coffee and black coffee made with milk rather than water in which urinary excretion of acyl-quinic acids and metabolites was 68 of intake with the black coffee and 40 aer ingestion of coffee with milk.

although robusta coffees contain all six cfqa and all six p-coumaroyl-caffeoylquinic acids intriguingly they only contain three caffeoyl-3040-dimethoxycinnamoyl-quinic acids feruloyl-3040-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acidsp-coumaroyl-feruloylquinicacidsandp-coumaroyl-3040-dimethoxycinnamoylquinic acids highlighting some subtle control of biosynthesis.roasting of green coffee beans can result in acyl-quinic acidlosses of 90.43 substantial transformations also occur and the number of acyl-quinic acids detected in the roasted bean increases to over 200 as judged by the number of characteristic fragments observed in tandem mass spectrometry-basedtable 3 cinnamoyl-amino acid conjugates in green and roasted coffee beanscinnamoyl-amino acid conjugatesp-coumaroyl-n-tyrosine186 caffeoyl-n-tyrosine186 feruloyl-n-tyrosine186p-coumaroyl-n-tryptophan186 caffeoyl-n-tryptophan186 feruloyl-n-tryptophan186 caffeoyl-n-phenylalanine186p-coumaroyl-n-aspartic acid187 caffeoyl-n-aspartic acid187analyses in comparison with the 72 derivatives detected in the green coffee bean.303133102114115186187190 acyl migration and hydrolysis during coffee roasting changes the relative propor- tions of each subgroup being most obvious within the cqas fqas and dicqas with 3-cqa being very susceptible tohydrolysis.

of more importance is the 4-5-fold inter-individual variation in the quantity of acyl-quinic acids metabolites excreted by volunteers who consume the same coffee table 13 which is further compounded by the large vari- ations in the acyl-quinic acids content of seemingly similar coffees consumed by the general public as noted in section 6.43201202bioactivitypotential health benets have been associated with coffee consumption including a reduced incidence of several chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer cardiovascular disorders diabetes and parkinson's disease and the protective effects have been ascribed at least in part to the acyl-quinic acids present in the brew.253-255 however relatively little infor- mation exists about their mechanisms of action.

ileal excretion reported by erk et al.238 was 70 of intake irre- spective of dose table 9 which was also the level reported by stalmach et al.214 in keeping with these observations the 3  1 ratio of urinary excretion of metabolites absorbed in the distal and proximal gi tract was not inuenced to any extent by dose following coffee acyl-quinic acid intakes of 412-795 mmol table 10.239 dose did however have a noticeable impact on the amount of conjugated metabolites appearing in ileal uid where they were equivalent to 22.3 of the acyl-quinic acids at the lowest dose and 6.7-8.9 at the three higher intakes.238 sulfated metabolites weretable 10 urinary excretion of acyl-quinic acid metabolites absorbed in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract by volunteers with a func- tioning colon after the consumption of 200 ml of coffee beverage containing 412 635 and 795 mmol of acyl-quinic acids.

it has also been shown that treatment of cultured tobacco cells with several inducers of plant stress leads to an approximate doubling of cis 5-cqa 22 in the absence of uv irradiation.50there are many other details yet to be elucidated and several intriguing questions remain to be answered regarding the factors that control the biosynthesis of acyl-quinic acids and the signicance of the observed variations.role of acyl-quinic acids in plantawith one or two notable exceptions the in planta roles of acyl- quinic acids are not known with any certainty.
