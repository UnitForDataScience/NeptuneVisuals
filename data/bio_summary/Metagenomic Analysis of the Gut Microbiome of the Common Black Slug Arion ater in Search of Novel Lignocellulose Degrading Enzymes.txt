These slugs feed activelydown to temperatures approaching 0 C and adults and eggshave been observed to survive freezing at -3C for 3 days or more Slotsbo et al.

Slugs are also known to be resistant to high concentrations of toxic metals so much so that they are often used in studies of environmental levels of pollution Ireland 1979 Seric Jelaska et al.

The ability to utilize a broad range of food sources and their physiological robustness to environmental challenges are amongst the reasons why slugs are such a successful group of organisms despite the best efforts of humans to eradicate them from agricultural and suburban land.It is now well established that the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in digestion in many invertebrates and vertebrates such as termites Brune 2014 cockroaches Bertino-Grimaldi et al.

One recent study has demonstrated the ecological richness of the gut microbiome of the gastropod Achatina fulica giant snail highlighting its metabolic capabilities with a large number of CAZymes being observed Cardoso et al.

ater is directly involved in breakdown of the lignocellulose portion of its diet Joynson et al.

Slugs have recently been proposed as vectors for the transmission of bacterial pathogens Gismervik et al.
