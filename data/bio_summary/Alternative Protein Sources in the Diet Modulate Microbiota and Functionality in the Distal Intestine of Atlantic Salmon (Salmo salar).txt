In comparison fish fed the experimental diets presented higher abun- dances of Firmicutes from 41 - 11 in fish fed PM to 52 - 21 in fish fed GMWG and lower abundances of Fusobacteria from 13 - 9 in fish fed GMWG to 16 - 5FIG 3 Gut microbiota composition relative OTU abundance at the phylum level identified in the distal intestinal digesta and intestinal mucosa samples of Atlantic salmon fed various diets.

Weissella was more abundant in fish fed SBMWG and an unidentified OTU from the family Peptostrepto- coccaceae was less abundant in fish fed the experimental diets than in the fish fed the other diets.FIG 4 Gut microbiota composition relative OTU abundance at the genus level or the lowest taxonomic level determined by the analysis of the 17 most abundant genera identified in the distal intestinal digesta samples of Atlantic salmon fed various diets.

The results of the PERMANOVA showed significant differences  in the unweighted UniFrac between the DI mucosa-associated microbial communities of fish fed the PM and SBMWG diets compared to those fed the FM diet.LEfSe analysis  showed significantly higher abundance of Jeotgalicoccus for fish fed PM compared to the fish fed the other diets.

In SPCPM-fed fish the only significant finding was reduced levels of cat whereas no significant changes were observed for fish fed the PM diet.TABLE 2 Alpha diversity results of DI gut microbiota located in different compartments of Atlantic salmon fed diets with different protein sourcesRichness observed species Two-way ANOVA modelP model0.0002Pooled SEM13P values from two-way ANOVASegment0.0001Diet0.004Interaction0.283Mean of significant observations DietsFM269BPM348ASBMWG329ASPCPM320ABGMWG307ABSectionsDigesta344AMucosa285BDiversity Shannon index nonparametric testaDiet abbreviations are as defined in  footnote a.bMean values with different superscript letters within a column are significantly different P  0.05.None of the experimental diets caused significant changes in the expression of immune-related genes compared to the FM-fed fish.PCNA immunohistochemistry.
