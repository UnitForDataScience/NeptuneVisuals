high-resolution microbiota sequencing has also been used to evaluate the role of diet in shaping the gut microbiota in fish   including salmonids such as rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss    and atlantic salmon  .

the digesta-associated microbiota showed clear dependence on the diet composition whereas mucosa-associated microbiota ap- peared to be less affected by diet composition.

whether ingredient processing or other diet components such as antinutrients play a role in the way the diet modulates the gut microbiota requires further investigations.results from the present study reported elsewhere  showed that the di histo- morphology was altered significantly by the sbmwg diet including alterations typical for soybean meal induced enteritis sbmie.

our recent study of characteristics of the microbiota along the intestine of atlantic salmon demonstrated important differences between digesta and mucosa  implying that dietary modulatory effects may be masked and therefore overlooked if only digesta-associated microbiota is characterized or if a homogenate of digesta and mucosal tissue is evaluated.

the diet composition also affected the richness of the gut microbiota although more so in the digesta-associated than the mucosa-associated microbiota with plant meals generally increasing abundance and diversity.

most important the study identified bacterial groups associated with diet-induced gut dysfunction that may be utilized as microbial markers of gut health status in fish.keywords gut microbiota salmon microbiotamarch 2017 volume 83 issue 5 e02615-16applied and environmental microbiology 1he use of alternative plant-based protein sources to partially replace fishmeal in diets for farmed atlantic salmon salmo salar is currently common practice in commercial diets .

the spcpm-fed fish presented a moderate increase whereas sbmwg and gmwg diets caused a substantial increase in the number of immunopositive cells along the length of the mucosal folds toward the apex.discussionthe results from the present study demonstrated that regardless of diet significant differences between the microbial populations in the digesta and the mucosa were observed in the salmon di which is in agreement with similar investigations charac- terizing the gut microbiota in fish       .

some studies have also investigated modulatory effects of different protein sources on the gut microbiota in salmonids  but general knowledge regarding interactions between diets gut microbiota and fish gut function and health is fragmentary and incomplete.

the core microbiota present in the mucosa was both numerically and proportionally smaller than the core microbiota of digesta with 37 otu of a total of 106 shared by all diets .

the present study aimed to gain information about whether alterna- tive dietary protein sources modulate the microbial communities in the atlantic salmon intestine and whether alterations in microbiota profiles are reflected in alter- ations in host intestinal function and health status.

possible links to variation in gut immune functions and growth performance have been suggested  and based on experience from studies with mammals gut microbiota profiling is expected to be a valuable endpoint measurement in order to assess and understand fish gut healthstatus and the effects of diet.the work presented here was part of a larger study evaluating the effects of practical atlantic salmon diets with high contents of alternative protein sources i.e.
