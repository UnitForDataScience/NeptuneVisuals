The major surface protein Msp of T. denti- cola sometimes referred to as the major sheath protein is considered to be a key virulence and adhesion factor and has been directly impli- cated in a wide variety of pathogenic processes.1822-26Msp is an orthologue of the Treponema pallidum repeat Tpr pro- tein and has been shown to be present in all oral treponeme species characterized to date.27-30 In T. denticola Msp is a highly expressed cell-surface-exposed protein and is a potent immunogenic factor.31-34 It forms hetero-oligomeric outer-membrane-associated complexes in association with the chymotrypsin-like protease complex which com- prises the PrtP dentilisin PcrA and PcrB proteins.35-37 The T. denticola Msp protein forms direct binding interactions with components of the host extracellular matrix such as fibronectin collagen and laminin as well as epithelial cells and fibroblasts.2338-41 Msp stimulates the expres- sion of host proteases including matrix metalloproteinases MMPs so promoting tissue destruction and bone resorption.42 It has hemaggluti- nating and hemolytic activities towards erythrocytes and also functions as a 'porin' in lipid bilayers and epithelial cell membranes.3343-45 Msp perturbs calcium-ion-mediated cell signaling and disrupts actin filament assembly within neutrophils and fibroblasts thereby inhibiting chemo- taxis and cell migration.46-49 Msp also modulates the binding and anti- microbial activities of the LL-37 host defense peptide.41 The T. denticola Msp protein is also involved in mediating inter-generic associations with other disease-associated periodontal organisms such as Fusobacterium nucleatum Porphyromonas gingivalis and Parvimonas micra.23385051All Msp homologues studied to date encode a conserved 20-amino-acid aa N-terminal signal peptide which targets the pro- tein for secretion.294052 However Msp homologues exhibit consid- erable variation in their monomeric molecular masses and amino acid sequence compositions.29344053 Three Msp protein 'isoforms' have been identified in T. denticola which are present in the ATCC 35405 543 aa ATCC 33520 547 aa and OTK 574 aa strains.

Estimation of phylogenetic relationships between treponeme msp gene sequences and clinical msp genotypesMaximum likelihood ML trees were constructed for the respective msp gene sequence datasets 1626 base pairs bp for Treponema strain sequences and 662 bp for clinical gene sequences using GARLI.73 The best substitution model and gamma rate heterogeneitywere determined using the Akaike Information Criterion imple- mented in JmodEltEst2.74 The best ML tree with the Maximum Clade Credibility was adopted with clade supports annotated at the branch nodes.75 The branch support values were calculated from 1000 boot- strap replicates using GARLI and Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated using mr bayEs v3.76 Branch nodes with 40 support value were shown in the figures.

Putative signal peptide sequences and cleavage sites were identified using the signalP 4.1 webserver 68 The consensus signal peptide sequences were visualized and exported in JalviEw 2.0.69 The alignment consensus annotation calculated the percentage of the modal residue per column and displayed the sequence logos with sizes in proportion to their relative abundances per column.

The structure of the clinical msp genotypes present in the periodontitis and periodontitis-free control groups were compared using weighted UniFrac analysis78 Parsimony test79 and S-libshUFF test80 implemented in mothUr.72 The P-value threshold was set to .05.3  RESULTS  Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of oraltreponeme msp genesA comprehensive collection of human oral treponeme strains belong- ing to phylogroups 1 and 2 were selected for genetic analysis.

The respective locations of the predicted signal peptide SP central variable CVN-terminal N and C-terminal C regions are indicated with red yellow and light blue bars above the alignment according to the scheme proposed by Edwards et al.39 The positions of the 'major outer sheath protein-N' MOSPN and 'major outer sheath protein-C' MOSPC domains as defined by NCBI conserved domain database CDD as previously noted by Anand et al.55 are indicated with pink and purple bars respectively.

The inclusion criteria for the peri- odontitis group were four or more posterior teeth with periodontal pockets of probing pocket depth 6 mm and probing attachment level of 4 mm plus radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss.

The periodontitis-free participants had no probing depths 3 mm and no detectable probing attachment level or radiographic evidence of bone loss.

The plaque samples were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 chilled on ice and taken to the laboratory for processing within 30 minutes after collection.

Near full-length 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified using the F24M98 primer set.64 The primers used for PCR amplification of msp genes gene fragments are listed in Table 2.
