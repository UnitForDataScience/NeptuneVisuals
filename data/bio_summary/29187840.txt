Within Caudovirales the most well-studied order of phages the highest numbers of proteins containing the PrDs when analyzing bacteriophage families with more than 10000 sequenced proteins were found among Podoviridae with over 1.74 of the total Podoviridae proteins were shown to harbor PrDs p  0.001 constituting 4.21 of the total detected PrDs among Caudovirales and .The analysis shown in demonstrates an interesting trend of representation of prionogenic domains among different bacteriophages families and host organisms.Next we determined the patterns of correlation between bacteriophage families and LLR scores  and .The average numbers of LLRs between three most abundant bacteriophage families Myoviridae Podoviridae2 and Siphoviridae were similar with the highest LLR scores obtained for Podoviridae family with an average LLR of 7.78 p  0.001 .Under the same conditions we compared the LLRs between the remaining bacteriophage families and Myoviridae were shown to have the highest number of PrDs with the LLR score over 30.

Since the members of this family have larger proteomes compared with those of other bacteriophage families we analyzed and obtained a direct correlation between the number of PrDs per bacteriophage and the proteome p  0.05 but no correlations were observed within any bacteriophage family .

A vast majority of the bacteriophage PrD-containing proteins are involved in the interactions between a bacteriophage and bacterial cell wall their attachment and penetration and the release of progeny phages.Attachment and penetration represent crucial steps in the bacteriophage-bacterium interaction since these processes allow the entry of the bacteriophage DNA inside the host.

The results obtained in this study indicate that bacteriophage prion-like proteins are predominantly involved in the interactions between bacteriophages and bacterial cell such as those associated with the attachment and penetration of bacteriophage in the cell and the release of the phage progeny.

The present predictive approach for the first time uncovers a large set of putative prionogenic proteins whose further experimental characterization might contribute significantly to understanding bacteriophages biology.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein SequencesTo identify the PrDs present in bacteriophage proteomes protein sequences were obtained from the UniProt KnowledgeBase Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL  .The protein functions were manually curated using the information from the UniProt database the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI protein sequence database and the literature.Identification of PrDs in Bacteriophage ProteomesThe presence of PrDs was analyzed in all bacteriophage proteins using the prion-like amino acid composition PLAAC prion prediction program based on the HMM and trained using the known PrDs by identifying the compositional bias toward N and Q residues.

Correlations between the size of bacteriophage proteome and PrD enrichment were calculated using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test.RESULTSIdentification of PrDs in Bacteriophage ProteomesTo identify the PrDs in bacteriophages using the PLAAC algorithm we analyzed 2111 bacteriophage proteomes comprising a total of 370617 proteins retrieved from the UniProtKB database.

We detected 5040 PrPs with the LLRs higher than 0.003 1.35 of the total bacteriophage protein dataset  .In  the trends in the PrD distribution across different bacteriophage families are presented.

Notably the particular enrichment with PrDs was found across the majority of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus cyanophages identified as PrD carriers in this study.Structural Domains Associated with to Bacteriophage PrDsTo analyze the functions of bacteriophage proteins with PrDs we clustered the identified domains into five groups according to the major steps during the process of bacteriophage interactions with its host cell  .

The proteins were grouped based on their functions during the interactions with the bacterial host cells into the following groups attachment and penetration replication of bacteriophage DNA and proteinTABLE 1  Summary of the prion predicted in different bacteriophage families.synthesis assembly release and unknown functions          .

We identified several Erf proteins essential for bacteriophage DNA recombination proteins belonging to glycosyltransferase family protecting bacteriophage DNA from degradation and single-strand binding proteins  .
