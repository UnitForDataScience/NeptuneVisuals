It is not possible to determine the kind of interaction bacterial taxa have with A. lobifera however the consistent within and between site patterns observed in the bacterial associations indicate that bacterial communities arenon-random.

In contrast to the eukaryotic photo- autotrophs A. lobifera from the inner-shelf site showed the highest diversity of bacterial taxa 231 OTUs found exclusively in the inner-shelf core whereas the lowest di- versity of bacterial taxa was found in inner- and outer- shelf samples.

However bacterial communities previously detected in sediment samples along a cross-shelf gradient differ from those found in our study indicating active interaction of bacterial taxa with A. lobifera.Phyla such as Actinobacteria which is commonly as- sociated with freshwater runoff showed a strong positive correlation with A. lobifera collected from the inner-shelf reef site.

After the removal of singleton and low counts OTUs 100 counts summed across all samples a total of 451 OTUs remained belonging mainly to the following bacterial taxa across all reef sites Proteo- bacteria 31.57 - 1.60 mean - SEM Planctomycetes 10.04 - 0.46 and Firmicutes 9.85 - 0.99 Fig.

Total rich- ness estimators showed that bacterial diversity was similar among reef sites Additional file Figure S1 Additional file Table S7.

.Analysis of the core microbiome showed that a- Proteobacteria was the most consistent bacterial taxa found in A. lobifera across different reef sites.

Core microbiome among reef sites showed a different pattern of bacterial relative abundance and diversity.

Thus the most abundant photo-symbiont taxa in A. lobi- fera were highly conserved among reef sites but bacterial communities were very flexible.

further supporting the notion that individual A. lobifera can maintain partnership withTable 2 Percentage  of contribution of bacterial taxa that primarily accounted for differences in A. lobifera collected from different reef sites.

Although our study demonstrates the pres- ence of a small group of bacteria in total 30 OTUs identi- fied that are persistently associated with LBFs across reef sites a large proportion of bacterial taxa identified by thecore microbiome analysis are site-specific and likely helpA.
