OHI-S scores of the Poor and the Moderate oral hygiene groups were significantly higher than those of Good oral hygiene group P  0.002 and also the Poor oral hygiene group had significantly higher OHI-S scores than those of the Moderate oral hygiene group P  0.002.

Sequencing using the Illumina Miseq instrument produced a dataset comprised of 4019174 reads containing General and oral condition of the 90 subjects.- shows standard deviations.a Significant differences among groups were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis H-test post hoc Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction.b Significant differences were evaluated by Fisher's exact test.c Significantly higher than the Good oral Hygiene group P 0.002d Significantly higher than the Moderate oral hygiene groupe Significantly higher than the Good oral hygiene group P  0.002f Significantly higher than the good oral hygiene group P  0.05 and P  0.002 respectively.the V3-V4 region of which 3521550 passed quality control tests with an average length of 423 - 1 bp .

On the other hand Veillonella s V. dispar and V. parvula were found in great proportions in the Poor oral hygiene group relative to the Good or Moderate oral hygiene group.DiscussionThis study found that the salivary microbiome of children varied depending on oral hygiene status evaluated by OHI-S.

The agreement among all examiners in dental caries DMFT decayed missing and filled teeth index and oral hygiene OHI-S was found to be 100 kappa statistics  1.0.The first group Good oral hygiene was composed of 24 children with OHI-S scores of 0-1.2.

In addition DMFT and dmft of the Poor and the Moderate oral hygiene groups were significantly higher com- pared to the Good oral hygiene groups.Furthermore correlational analysis between OHI-S score and DMFT or dmft showed a strong correlation r2  0.898 and r2  0.999 respectively.

These results suggest that the micro- biome in the Good and Poor oral hygiene groups differed relative to the Moderate oral hygiene group.

These findings indicated that salivary microbiome in children differed by OHI-S score but there were some similar microbiome compositions in each group.Two indices of alpha diversity indicated that salivary bacterial communities in the Good and Poor oral hygiene group were less diverse compared to the Moderate oral hygiene groupP  0.05 .

Of these twenty genera genus Streptococcus and genus Veillonella showed significant differences P  0.05 in their proportions between the Good oral hygiene group and the Poor oral hygiene group .

In contrast Streptococcus s and Streptococcus anginosus S. anginosus were associated strongly with the Good oral hygiene group and Veillonella s Veillonella dispar V. dispar and Veillonella parvula V. parvula were associated strongly with the Poor oral hygiene group .
