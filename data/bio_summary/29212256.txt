Our QPCR data Figure 1E and 1F showed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of REG3-a 0.31-0.13 fold and REG3-b 1.82-0.64 fold compared to WT mice 0.04-0.01 and 0.38-0.15 in CAC.Interestingly there was a significant decrease Figure 1G in the mRNA levels of REG3-g 0.20-0.04 among TgM9 mice compared to WT mice 0.34-0.09 fold more in CAC.

In fact mRNA levels of Akkermansia muciniphila Figure 1D were also higher in TgM9 mice 0.14-0.06 fold compared to WT 0.03-0.01 mice in CAC.

Interestingly mRNA levels of Firmicutes Figure 1C were lower among TgM9 mice 0.72-0.28 compared to WT 0.93-0.38 mice in CAC.

Interestingly we also observed Figure 1H a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of S100A8 1.96-0.95 among TgM9 mice compared to WT mice 8.67-1.07 in CAC.

We observed that mRNA levels of interleukin IL-6 2.24-0.28 fold IL-1b 4.37-0.12 fold tumornecrosis factor TNF-a 2.9-0.36 fold and interferon IFN-g 4.59-0.8 fold were significantly increased among TgM9 mice compared to WT mice 1.51-0.24 3.67-0.67 2.15-0.11 and 1.55-0.06 respectively in CAC Figure 2A-2D respectively.

Interestingly the mRNA levels of IL-22 Figure 2E were significantly lower among TgM9 mice 0.29-0.11 compared to WT mice 1.08-0.21 in CAC.

TgM9 mice also showed significantly increased levels of mRNA for IL-6 TNF-a and IFN-g Figure 2A 2C and 2D respectively except for IL-1b Figure 2B compared to WT mice both exposed to water without CAC.

We observed that TgM9 mice displayed efficient barrier function 4.0-0.31 flux of 4kD FITC unitsmg of serum protein compared to WT mice in CAC 6.8-0.38 flux of 4kD FITC unitsmg of serum protein as shown in Figure 3A.

We also observed a subtle decrease in the expression of claudins-2-4 and -5 among TgM9 mice Figure 3B-3D lanes 3-4 respectively compared to WT mice Figure 3B-3D lanes 1-2 respectively both exposed to water without CAC.

TgM9 also mice exhibited efficient barrier function and decreased expressions of claudins-2 4 and -5 compared to WT mice in CAC.
