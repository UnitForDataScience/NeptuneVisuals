they are also involved in adhesion and migration of the leukocytes from the blood vessels as an inflammatory response 9 10. among all mmps mmp9 is unique for being involved in activating several signaling molecules and pathways during inflammation and cancer despite being inactive in normal tissues 11-16. mmp9 is one of the most studied mmps as an ibd mediator and it is commonly secreted by epithelial cells immune cells neutrophils and sometimes by macrophages during inflammation 10 16 17.we and others have previously shown that mmp9is a mediator of acute colitis 11 14 18 19 and colorectal cancer 20-22. we have shown that mmp9 has a contrasting protective role in cac in the setting of chronic inflammation and acts as a tumor suppressor in cac 12 13 15 23. considering the fact that gi tract is mainly constituted of epithelial cells and colon cancer has epithelial origin we have generated transgenic mice 'tg-villin-mmp9 tgm9' that constitutively expresses mmp9 under villin promoter tgm9 14 15. the aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which mmp9 maintains the epithelial-mucosal integrity in cac as the 'extrinsic mechanistic pathway'.

our qpcr data figure 1e and 1f showed a significant increase in the mrna levels of reg3-a 0.31-0.13 fold and reg3-b 1.82-0.64 fold compared to wt mice 0.04-0.01 and 0.38-0.15 in cac.interestingly there was a significant decrease figure 1g in the mrna levels of reg3-g 0.20-0.04 among tgm9 mice compared to wt mice 0.34-0.09 fold more in cac.

comprehensive characterization of tgm9 have been done and published by our group 14 15. mice were maintained on a 12-hour dark-light cycle and allowed free access to no purified diet pellets and tap water.cac inductionanimals were divided into two groups- one as control group exposed to water only without cac and another as experimental group with cac induction.

in fact mrna levels of akkermansia muciniphila figure 1d were also higher in tgm9 mice 0.14-0.06 fold compared to wt 0.03-0.01 mice in cac.

interestingly mrna levels of firmicutes figure 1c were lower among tgm9 mice 0.72-0.28 compared to wt 0.93-0.38 mice in cac.

they are equally important in modulating tumor growth and metastasis 27. interestingly we also observed figure 1h a significant decrease in the mrna levels of s100a8 1.96-0.95 among tgm9 mice compared to wt mice 8.67-1.07 in cac.

we observed that mrna levels of interleukin il-6 2.24-0.28 fold il-1b 4.37-0.12 fold tumornecrosis factor tnf-a 2.9-0.36 fold and interferon ifn-g 4.59-0.8 fold were significantly increased among tgm9 mice compared to wt mice 1.51-0.24 3.67-0.67 2.15-0.11 and 1.55-0.06 respectively in cac figure 2a-2d respectively.

interestingly the mrna levels of il-22 figure 2e were significantly lower among tgm9 mice 0.29-0.11 compared to wt mice 1.08-0.21 in cac.

tgm9 mice also showed significantly increased levels of mrna for il-6 tnf-a and ifn-g figure 2a 2c and 2d respectively except for il-1b figure 2b compared to wt mice both exposed to water without cac.

we observed that tgm9 mice displayed efficient barrier function 4.0-0.31 flux of 4kd fitc unitsmg of serum protein compared to wt mice in cac 6.8-0.38 flux of 4kd fitc unitsmg of serum protein as shown in figure 3a.

we also observed a subtle decrease in the expression of claudins-2-4 and -5 among tgm9 mice figure 3b-3d lanes 3-4 respectively compared to wt mice figure 3b-3d lanes 1-2 respectively both exposed to water without cac.

tgm9 also mice exhibited efficient barrier function and decreased expressions of claudins-2 4 and -5 compared to wt mice in cac.

tgm9 mice showed increased muc2 and tff3 levels compared to wt mice in cac.

as described previously 15 cac was induced among both tgm9 mice n30 and wt n30 mice by 3 cycles of dextran sodium sulfate dss mp biomedicals salonoh.

there are significant gaps in understanding the mechanism of the cac due to the following two reasons i alteration in gut lumen agents such as microbiota population expression of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species ros due to chronic inflammation in cac.
