The metabolic benefits of probiotics may be strain specific so the optimal species dose and duration of treatment in GDM requires further elucidation.ConclusionsThe present review found that while probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in insulin resistance in pregnant women with GDM there was no significant effect on fasting blood glucose or LDL-cholesterol levels.

A study conducted in 256 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance found significant reductions in FBG insulin concentrations and insulin resistance following probiotic supplementation potentially reducing participants' GDM risk .

However increased insulin resistance combined with an inability to secrete the additional insulin required to maintain glucose homeostasis can result in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus GDM in the mother and macrosomia in the baby.GDM is defined as the development of glucose intolerance with first onset during pregnancy .

Trial participants represented a range of demographics with various forms of metabolic disease including GDM hypercholesterolemia and T2DM  which was likely to have contributed to the large interstudy heterogeneity observed.The contradictory findings of this review in comparison to other published reviews investigating the effect of probiotics on FBG may be related to the small sample sizes n  60-149 and short study durations 6-8 weeks in the women with GDM.

The objective of this review was to investigate the effect of probiotics on fasting plasma glucose FPG insulin resistance HOMA-IR and LDL-cholesterol levels in pregnant women diagnosed with GDM.

Probiotic supplementation for 6-8 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in insulin resistance in pregnant women diagnosed with GDM.

However probiotic supplementation in women with GDM was associated with significant reductions in insulin resistance which could potentially reduce their requirement for glucose-lowering medication later in their pregnancy.The mechanisms whereby probiotics alter glucose homeostasis are not completely understood.

Trials of longer duration 8 weeks may have generated outcomes with larger effect sizes.Three of the four studies included in this review - reported significant reductions in insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR following probiotic supplementation in women diagnosed with GDM.
