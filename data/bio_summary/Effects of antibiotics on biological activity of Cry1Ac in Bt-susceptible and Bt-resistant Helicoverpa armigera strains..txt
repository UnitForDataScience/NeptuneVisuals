here we just investigated the effect on bt toxin-induced toxi- city using cry1ac protoxin the results also may be different if we used bt sporecrystal mixture.coinciding with the results from this study that antibiotics have different effect on midgut microflora and cry1ac toxicity in different h. armigera strains it was suggested that midgut microflora might be play important and often essential roles in bt-induced toxicity of h. armigera.

2. effect of different concentrations of antibiotic cocktail on insecticidal activity of cry1ac in corrected mortality a and percent reduction in corrected mortality b against h. armigera larvae in 96s btr and fs strains.

this was consistent with the idea that gut bacteria could enter the haemocoel of the insect following toxin action and contribute to toxicity .the corrected larval mortality reduction percentage among strains was significantly different when the larvae were reared on diets con- taining antibiotics and challenged with cry1ac b r2  83.2 strains f  37.40 p  0.01 antibiotics f  22.32 p  0.01. anti- biotics had less effect on larval mortality in fs than in 96s and btr maximum of 56.38 reduction.

both dead larvae and the larvae that failed to respond to gentle probing were scored as dead.effect of antibiotics on midgut microflora in h. armigera strainsthe antibiotics which have different spectra of target bacterial taxa gentamicin streptomycin aureomycin and ampicillin were pooled together to make a cocktail with a final concentration of 250 ug ml-1.

the mortality reductions in most treatment with different concentration of antibiotics were not significant differ- ence between these two different populations b. moreover the larval mortalities in all treated concentration of cry1ac were obviously reduced after larvae pretreated by 250 ug ml-1 antibiotics both in 96s and btr strains the lc50 values reduced to 3.50 and 1467.34 mg ml-1 respectively.

1. effect of antibiotic cocktail 250 ug ml-1 diet on total midgut bacterial quantity against h. armigera larvae in 96s btr and fs strains.

larval mortality was recorded after 5 days and reduction in mortality percentage was calculated as follow mortality reduction percentage  c - tc x 100 c  the mean mortality percentage of control t  the mean mortality percentage of each treatment.

the susceptibility of h. armi- gera larvae to bt toxins is influenced by factors such as the interactions between midgut microflora and the insect host the extent of binding of bt toxin proteins to brush border membrane vesicles  .

the specific effects of various antibiotics on reduction of bacterial populations were recorded previously in some insects  fi .the corrected larval mortality due to lc50 value of cry1ac wasdecreased along with increasing concentrations of antibiotics in 96s 35.48 to 1.59 y  43.94-4.47x and r2  86.0 btr 27.63 to1.45 y  35.38-3.36x and r2  83.2 and fs 47.22 to 22.48y  52.01-2.93x and r2  76.6 a. our results agreed withprevious reports in which larval survival was directly proportional to the antibiotic cocktail concentration in h. armigera fig.

the complexinteraction between the insect-gut symbionts and bt pathogenicity might be due to the wide diversity of microbial composition in insect species and it can be influenced by the plant host and differences in digestive enzymes  .antibiotics can eliminate the resident midgut microbial community in many insect species and reduce populations of gut microflora such as enterococcus and enterobactor which correlated with a decrease in in- sect mortality caused by bt .

to confirm the effect of high concentration of anti- biotics on toxicity of cry1ac the lc50 of larvae which pretreated by 250 ug ml-1 antibiotics for 5 days in 96s and btr strain were tested again.statistical analysisthe effective concentration of toxin cry1ac to kill 50 of larvae lc50 was calculated by probit analysis using polo plus software.

we supposed that the diversity of midgut microflora in h. armigera changed along with the evolution of resistance to cry1ac but elimination of midgut microflora with antibiotics had no effect on resistance level.
