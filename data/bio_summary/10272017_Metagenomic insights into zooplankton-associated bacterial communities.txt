This suggests that the zooplankton-associated bacterial community consists of specialized ecotypes belonging to only a few phylogenetic groups that act as an interactive community such as a consortia able to metabolize different compounds released by the zooplankton either as exudates from the body surface or as a by-product of the digestion processes occurring in the zooplankton gut.Zooplankton-associated bacterial community and its implication in the global biogeochemical cyclesThe zooplankton-associated microbial community exploits zooplankton as a microhabitat.

Pilus protein-encoding genes were mainly associated with Gammaproteobacteria 100 of the PilF genes and 17 of the PilC genes Bac- teroidetes 26 PilC genes Planctomycetes 23 of the PilC genes whereas fimbriae protein-encoding genes were affiliated to Bacteroidetes 27 and Planctomycetes 23 Figs 5 and 6 Supporting Information Table S2.

Thus only specific zooplankton species might be suitable hosts for methanogenic archaea and fuel methane production in oxygenated waters.ConclusionIn the North Atlantic Ocean the bacterial community asso- ciated with crustacean zooplankton is mainly shaped by the zooplankton host taxa-specific interactions and the bacterial community of the ambient water to which the zoo- plankton host is exposed.

The zooplankton-associated bacterial community is able to colonize the zooplankton's internal and external surfaces using a large set of adhesion mechanisms and to metabolize complex organic compounds released or exuded by the zooplankton such as chitin taurine and other complex molecules.

Correction added on 26 December 2017 after first online publication the text has been revised within the third sentence sec- ond paragraph on page 9.microbial community revealed a highly specialized bac- terial community able to exploit zooplankton as microhabitat and thus mediating biogeochemical pro- cesses generally underrepresented in the open ocean.

Mem- bers of the zooplankton-associated bacterial community were more evenly distributed than those of the ambient water and exhibited a comparatively low diversity with few but abundant OTUs.Bacterial community composition in zooplankton versus ambient waterPrincipal Coordinates Analysis PCoA using weighted Unifrac distances Lozupone et al.

2014 indicating that this group may play a major role in the colonization of the zooplankton exoskeleton.The microbial community associated with the zooplank- ton's gut might consist of a transient passing through the digestive system of the host and a persistent bacterial community Grossart et al.

The metagenome of the zooplankton associated community harbours genes indicative for pH regulation of the cytosol's acidity by removing protons or using ammonia as proton scavenger to produce ammonium Booth 1985 Slonczewski et al.

The bioavailable phosphorus released by the zooplankton mainly in form of inorganic phosphate could be directly metabolized by the copepod-associated bacterial community which harbours large number of genes encoding for phosphate transport- ers Fig.

Additionally the presence of detoxification genes implies that the zooplankton-associated bacterial community responds to the presence of toxic by-products derived from digestive processes occurring in the host's gut.The contribution of archaea to the zooplankton- associated microbial community was negligible in the pre- sent study.
