this suggests that the zooplankton-associated bacterial community consists of specialized ecotypes belonging to only a few phylogenetic groups that act as an interactive community such as a consortia able to metabolize different compounds released by the zooplankton either as exudates from the body surface or as a by-product of the digestion processes occurring in the zooplankton gut.zooplankton-associated bacterial community and its implication in the global biogeochemical cyclesthe zooplankton-associated microbial community exploits zooplankton as a microhabitat.

pilus protein-encoding genes were mainly associated with gammaproteobacteria 100 of the pilf genes and 17 of the pilc genes bac- teroidetes 26 pilc genes planctomycetes 23 of the pilc genes whereas fimbriae protein-encoding genes were affiliated to bacteroidetes 27 and planctomycetes 23 figs 5 and 6 supporting information table s2.

thus only specific zooplankton species might be suitable hosts for methanogenic archaea and fuel methane production in oxygenated waters.conclusionin the north atlantic ocean the bacterial community asso- ciated with crustacean zooplankton is mainly shaped by the zooplankton host taxa-specific interactions and the bacterial community of the ambient water to which the zoo- plankton host is exposed.

6. we also detected several genes involved in phos- phorus utilization such as phosphate transporters exopolyphosphatase exop alkaline phosphatase ap and polyphosphate kinase-encoding ppk genes mainly associated to bacteroidetes and alphaproteobacteria figs 5 and 6 supporting information table s2.additionally the zooplankton-associated bacterial commu- nity harboured many genes involved in iron utilization primarily associated with bacteroidetes alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria.

genes involved in gliding motility were the most abundant membrane associated genes with 1053 assigned reads glda gldd gldf gldg gldh gldi gldj gldk gldl gldm gldn gldo remb spra sprb predominantly associated to the bacteroidetes phyla 98 of the total reads fig.

1986. the bioavailable phosphorus released by the zooplankton mainly in form of inorganic phosphate could be directly metabolized by the copepod-associated bacterial community which harbours large number of genes encoding for phosphate transport- ers fig.

the metagenome of the zooplankton associated community harbours genes indicative for ph regulation of the cytosol's acidity by removing protons or using ammonia as proton scavenger to produce ammonium booth 1985 slonczewski et al.

2014 indicating that this group may play a major role in the colonization of the zooplankton exoskeleton.the microbial community associated with the zooplank- ton's gut might consist of a transient passing through the digestive system of the host and a persistent bacterial community grossart et al.

5. other genes involved in microbial adherence processes such as pilus and fimbriae- encoding genes were also found in the zooplankton- associated microbial community.

the pres- ence of taurine catabolic genes in the metagenomes such as the taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase and sulfo- acetaldehyde acetyltransferase indicates the potential importance of taurine as a substrate for zooplankton- associated bacterial communities figs 5 and 6. surpris- ingly even though most of the taurine catabolic genes were associated with alphaproteobacteria none were affili- ated to sar11 likely due to the low contribution of this clade to the zooplankton-associated bacterial community.the copepod's hindgut exhibits low oxygen concentra- tions from suboxic to anoxic and low ph tang et al.

the zooplankton- associated bacterial community also harboured genes involved in reductive tca and anaplerotic carbon fixation pathways isocitrate dehydrogenase aconitase citrate lyase idh aco cl fig.

additionally the presence of detoxification genes implies that the zooplankton-associated bacterial community responds to the presence of toxic by-products derived from digestive processes occurring in the host's gut.the contribution of archaea to the zooplankton- associated microbial community was negligible in the pre- sent study.

finally metagenomic analyses provided insights into the yet underexplored metabolic interaction between the zoo- plankton and the associated bacterial community.resultsbacterial community richness and diversityrarefaction analyses phylogenetic diversity pd chao richness and observed operational taxonomic units otus showed clear differences between zooplankton- associated and ambient water bacterial communities supporting information fig.

the zooplankton-associated bacterial community is able to colonize the zooplankton's internal and external surfaces using a large set of adhesion mechanisms and to metabolize complex organic compounds released or exuded by the zooplankton such as chitin taurine and other complex molecules.
