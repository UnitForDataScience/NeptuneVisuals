Mice were divided into four groups and subjected to either acontrol liquid diet control group CON a 4 wv ethanol-containing liquid diet ethanol group EtOH a 4 wv ethanol-containing liquid diet supplemented with 0.4 g L-1 LPPE low dose LPPE-sup- plemented group EtOH  L-LPPE or a 4 wv ethanol-containing liquid diet supplemented with 0.8 g L-1 LPPE high dose LPPE-supplemented group EtOH  H-LPPE for 8 weeks.

CON mice fed acontrol liquid diet EtOH mice fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet EtOH  L-LPPE mice fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet sup- plemented with 0.4 g L-1 LPPE and EtOH  H-LPPE mice fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet supplemented with 0.8 g L-1 LPPE.and protein levels in the L-LPPE-supplemented group were markedly decreased by 54 32 and 35 respectively com- pared to those of the EtOH group  p  0.05.

The EtOH group EtOH  L-LPPE group and EtOH H-LPPE group were given the ethanol-containing liquid diet alone or supplemented with 0.4 and 0.8 g L-1 of LPPE respectively ad libitum for 8 weeks.
