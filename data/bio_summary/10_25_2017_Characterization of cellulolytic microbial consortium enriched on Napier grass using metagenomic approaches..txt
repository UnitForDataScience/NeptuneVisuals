The 16s rRNA sequences were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive  with the accession number SRP063648.Shotgun sequencing of Np-LMC metagenome The Np-LMC metagenome DNA library was sequenced on an ION Proton sequencing system Life Technologies following the manufacturer's protocols.

The Np-LMC was functionally stable according to their degradation efficiencies on the non-pretreated Napier grass and filter paper with a typical incubation time of 6e7 d in each batch cycle.Comparative microbial community profiles The partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified using the metagenomic DNA samples prepared from the Np-LMC cultivated for 2 5 7 12 and 19 d Np-LMC-d2 -d5 -d7 -d12 and -d19 as the template with the universal bacterial specific primer pair attached to specific tag sequences.

Various groups of cellulose-degrading Clostridium also stably existed in the consortium along the incubation period.Biomass degrading efficiency of the Np-LMC Lignocellulolytic enzyme activities in the crude extracellular fraction of the Np-LMC were examined .

The degradation of native rice straw reached 37 4 at the end of the experiment whereas the non-pretreated Napier grass was only slightly decomposed by 30 - 2 on day 10.Shotgun sequencing of Np-LMC metagenome The meta- genomic DNA samples prepared from the Np-LMC cultivated for 2 7 and 19 d were further investigated for their gene profiles by shotgun sequencing on an ION Proton platform.

These results suggested that the Np-LMC contain a broad genomic potential to degrade various types of plant poly- saccharides including hemicellulosic polymers.Acetylxylan esterases belonging to the CE4 family were identi- fied as major CEs in the Np-LMC enzyme system.

In this study an active structurally stable mesophilic lignocellulolytic degrading microbial consortium Np-LMC was constructed from forest compost soil microbiota by successive subcultivation on Napier grass under facultative anoxic conditions.

Anaerobic facultative bacteria Dysgonomonas and Sedimentibacter and aerobic bacteria Comamonas were the major genera found in Np-LMC.

The dynamic community profiles and metabolic po- tentials of the Np-LMC were investigated using culture- independent methods on a next generation sequencing platform.

The work provides insights into the cooperative actions of microbes and enzymes in decomposition of energy grass and shows the potential of Np-LMC as a promising microbial agent for enhancing conversion efficiency of fibrous lignocellulosic substrates to bio- energy and bio-products of economic importance.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials Decomposed forest litter resulting from natural degradation of forest litter collected from several locations in the Queen Sirikit Botanic Garden Chiang Mai Thailand was used as a microbial source for preparation of lignocellu- lolytic consortia.
