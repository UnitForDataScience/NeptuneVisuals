The comparison of this group of children with the group of children treated with laser therapy only would be inadequate as the latter were usually in a better general condition.

The average time between laser therapy and ranibizumab injection was shorter in this group on average 15 days compared to 31 days in children with primary ROP regression.

ROP reoccurred - after a period of transient remission they again met the criteria for treatment listed by ETROP guidelines - in 6 children in 10 eyes in two children ranibizumab was injected in one eye.

The mean gestational age GA at birth of studied infants was 25 - 2 weeks 23 to 30 weeks the mean birth weight BW was 790 - 243 g 480 to 1450 g. The mean time at which laserFigure 1.

The study gives an insight into anatomical and functional outcomes of ROP treatment in the Central and Eastern European population.Despite significant progress in the treatment methods retinopathy of prematurity ROP is a disease that still causes blindness or impaired vision in children.

The clinical characteristics of 28 infants included in the study are shown in Table .The enrolled children had a systematic follow-up which ranged from 11 to 66 months.

This child differed significantly as far as gestational age and birth weight compared to the remaining patients in the study group GA 28 weeks BW 1400 g. The data on profiles of patients with and without retinal detachment according to IC-ROP international classification of ROP are shown in Table  all children enrolled to this study had either plus or pre-plus disease.

The total number of children born in the study period was 29758.

The medical records of 53 eyes of 28 infants treated by conventional laser photocoagulation with deferred intravitreal 0.25 mg0.025 mL ranibizumab injection were analysed.

The second patient received ranibizumab within two days after laser treatment.
