In particular PA catabolism has been associated with the production of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid 3-phenylpropionic acid 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid  as the main metabolites whereas apples and apple components including isolated PAs formed 3-34-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid 3-3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid 3-phenylpropionic acid benzoic acid 2-34-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 2-3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid .

Changes in phenylacetic A 3-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid B 34-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and C Homovanillic acid and phenylpropionic acid D 3-3-Hydroxyphenylpropionic acidE 3-4-Hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and F Hydroferulic acid derivatives throughout 24-h in vitro batch culture fermentations inoculated with human feces n  3 healthy donors and administrated with Renetta Canada Golden Delicious and Pink Lady as the substrates treatments.

Furthermore in human subjects chocolate intake a rich source of flavanols increased the urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid ferulic acid 34-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid vanillic acid and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid .In this study we demonstrated that whole apples could modify the gut microbiota composition and affect the extent of degradation of soluble fiber and polyphenols through the production of SCFAs and phenolic acids with Renetta Canada variety showing the most beneficial effects.

Significant increases were observed over time for 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid Renetta Canada and Pink Lady p  0.034 and p  0.043 respectively 34-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid Renetta Canada p  0.05 3-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid Pink Lady p  0.009 hydroferulic acid Renetta Canada p  0.046 4-hydroxybenzoic acid Pink Lady p  0.017 and pyrocatechol Pink Lady p  0.049.

Calibration was done using standard solutions of acetic acid propionic acid i-butyric acid and n-butyric acid Sigma-Aldrich Schnelldorf Germany in acidified water pH 2.

There were no significant changes in the concentration of the polyphenol microbial metabolites between the three apple varieties when each time point 0 5 10 or 24 h was explored separately with the exception of caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid significantly higher concentration with Renetta Canada fermentation compared to Golden Delicious and Pink Lady at 0 h and t-ferulic acid significantly higher concentration with Renetta Canada compared to Pink Lady at 0 h.Figure 5.

Significant differences p  0.05 from the 0 h time point within the same treatment.Figure 6.Changes in benzoic acid derivatives A Gallic acid B 4-Hydroxybenzoic acidC Protocatechuic acid and D Pyrocatechol throughout 24-h in vitro batch culture fermentations inoculated with human feces n  3 healthy donors and administrated with Renetta Canada Golden Delicious and Pink Lady as the substrates treatments.

Pink Lady was associated with the formation of 3-4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid and benzoic acid derivatives in particular 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and pyrocatechol.

In particular significant reductions throughout the fermentation were detected for -catechin Renetta Canada --epicatechin Renetta Canada and Golden Delicious procyanidin A2 Renetta Canada Golden Delicious and Pink Lady neochlorogenic acid Golden Delicious cryptochlorogenic acid Golden Delicious quercetin-3-glc Renetta CanadaGolden Delicious and Pink Lady quercetin-3-rha Renetta Canada Golden Delicious and Pink Lady kaempferol Renetta Canada isorhamnetin Renetta Canada phlorizin Renetta Canada and Golden Delicious and vanillin Renetta Canada and Golden Delicious Table S4.Table 3.

In contrast significant decreases throughout the fermentation were shown for caffeic acid Renetta Canada and Golden Delicious p  0.000 and p  0.001 respectively p-coumaric acid Renetta Canada and Golden Delicious p  0.001 and p  0.001 respectively trans-ferulic Renetta Canada and Golden Delicious p  0.002 and p  0.003 respectively and trans-isoferulic Renetta Canada p  0.001 as these metabolites can also appear as precursor polyphenols in apples Figure S3.
