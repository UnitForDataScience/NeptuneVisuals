How many different kinds are there What are their replication styles and rates How do genes transported by phage influence bacterial phenotypes relevant to hu- man health Most broadly how do phage affect human welfareWe are starting to see proposals for associations between large groups of phages and specific human dis- ease.

Historically phage transduction has been viewed as only a minor contributor to transmission of antibiotic resistance genes with transformation and par- ticularly conjugation mediating transfer to a far greater extent However a recent metagenomic study sug- gested that phage commonly encode antibiotic resistance genes and that in mice the frequency of antibiotic resist- ance genes on phage actually increases with antibiotic treatment .

Following the review of methods we summarize a few recent studies that illuminate the nature of the human gut virome and transfer of phage DNA sequences between cells and between humans.Biochemical methods for purifying and sequencing VLP genomesIt is possible to study the viral populations of human gut by purifying DNA from total stool then sequencing and aligning the reads to viral databases However viral DNA represents only a small minority of the total DNA recovered and most viral sequences do not closely re- semble viral genomes available in databases the dark matter problem mentioned above .

Viral lineages detected include single stranded DNA viruses such as Anelloviruses Circo- viruses and Parvoviruses and double-stranded DNA viruses such as Adenoviruses and Papillomaviruses.

This problem is of less concern for identifica- tion and discovery of pathogenic viruses that infect human cells where there are fewer different types and these viruses have been closely studied because of their medical importance.

For RNA viruses in health human stool viruses of plants seem to predominate and are inferred to be transients from food.

Mobile DNA 2017 812DOI 10.1186s13100-017-0095-yViral communities of the human gut metagenomic analysis of composition and dynamicsVarun Aggarwala1 Guanxiang Liang12 and Frederic D. Bushman1BackgroundThe human virome is overwhelmingly composed of un- studied bacterial viruses of unknown importance to health and disease.

The human microbiome contains roughly 100 trillion cells equaling or exceeding the number of human cells comprising our bodies Stool from healthy individuals can contain 1011 cells per gram which are predominantly bacteria but also contain archaea and microeukaryotes - Studies are just beginning on the viral populations associated with our microbiota but early work has established that the communities are large and dynamic -Here we review recent studies of the human virome.

We then review metagenomic studies documenting movement of whole populations of phages between human individuals during fecal microbial transplantation.Composition of the human gut viromeMultiple studies have now investigated the composition of the human gut virome providing an initial picture of its structure e. g. -  As above re- searchers have first purified VLPs then acquired DNA sequence data allowing assembly and evaluation of con- tigs.
