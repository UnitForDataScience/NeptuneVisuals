how many different kinds are there what are their replication styles and rates how do genes transported by phage influence bacterial phenotypes relevant to hu- man health most broadly how do phage affect human welfarewe are starting to see proposals for associations between large groups of phages and specific human dis- ease.

possibly this is due to packaging efficiency viral capsids can incorporate only a certain amount of nucleic acid and lengthening viral genomes by transposon inser- tion may result in genomes that are incorporated rela- tively inefficiently.movement of phage between humans during fecal microbial transplantationfecal microbiota transplant has been successful in treat- ment of relapsing clostridium difficile c. difficile infec- tions fmt treatment appears to work by restoring a more normal anaerobic gut community though mea- surements typically show that the new communities in patients are complex mixtures of strains from donor recipient and new acquisition the general behavior and possible contribution of the virome in fmt is just starting to be investigated.chehoud et al.

historically phage transduction has been viewed as only a minor contributor to transmission of antibiotic resistance genes with transformation and par- ticularly conjugation mediating transfer to a far greater extent however a recent metagenomic study sug- gested that phage commonly encode antibiotic resistance genes and that in mice the frequency of antibiotic resist- ance genes on phage actually increases with antibiotic treatment .

in addition viral protein sequences are available in refseq uniprot and custom databases of viral proteins are also available for vlp samples from ocean various geographical habitats  or humans however alignment to these databases is often challenging when sequence identity is less than 30. viruses often accu- mulate substitutions at high rates -rna viruses replicate using error prone rna-dependent rna poly- merases retroviruses use error prone reverse tran- scriptases  and single stranded dna viruses also show high rates of substitution these challenges can be addressed by focusing on pro- file methods for detecting distant homologs of known viral families.

viral lineages detected include single stranded dna viruses such as anelloviruses circo- viruses and parvoviruses and double-stranded dna viruses such as adenoviruses and papillomaviruses.

following the review of methods we summarize a few recent studies that illuminate the nature of the human gut virome and transfer of phage dna sequences between cells and between humans.biochemical methods for purifying and sequencing vlp genomesit is possible to study the viral populations of human gut by purifying dna from total stool then sequencing and aligning the reads to viral databases however viral dna represents only a small minority of the total dna recovered and most viral sequences do not closely re- semble viral genomes available in databases the dark matter problem mentioned above .

this problem is of less concern for identifica- tion and discovery of pathogenic viruses that infect human cells where there are fewer different types and these viruses have been closely studied because of their medical importance.

for rna viruses in health human stool viruses of plants seem to predominate and are inferred to be transients from food.

the human microbiome contains roughly 100 trillion cells equaling or exceeding the number of human cells comprising our bodies stool from healthy individuals can contain 1011 cells per gram which are predominantly bacteria but also contain archaea and microeukaryotes - studies are just beginning on the viral populations associated with our microbiota but early work has established that the communities are large and dynamic -here we review recent studies of the human virome.

we then review metagenomic studies documenting movement of whole populations of phages between human individuals during fecal microbial transplantation.composition of the human gut viromemultiple studies have now investigated the composition of the human gut virome providing an initial picture of its structure e. g. -  as above re- searchers have first purified vlps then acquired dna sequence data allowing assembly and evaluation of con- tigs.
