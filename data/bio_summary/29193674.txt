VogelDepartment of Biological Sciences Bio-NMR CenterUniversity of Calgary Calgary AB CanadaPregnancy and lactation are associated with a host of physi- ological changes in the mother primarily aimed at supporting the offspring before and after birth7 that involve a reshaping of the maternal metabolic environment.8 However the systemic metabolic impact of pregnancy and lactation are not entirely un- derstood.

Obese dams were heav-ier throughout gestation main effect of diet p  0.01 al- though there was no significant interaction between time and diet consistent with similar gestational weight gain between the two groups Figure 1A C. There was a significant inter- action between diet and time for maternal body weight dur- ing lactation p  0.001 where obese dams remained heavier than lean dams throughout lactation despite greater weight loss by weaning Figure 1B C. There was no difference in body weight change from pre-pregnancy to weaning Figure 1C.

There was a significant main effect of time on en- ergy intake during both gestation and lactation p  0.05 where dams consumed more energy during the second week of gesta- tion compared to the first p  0.01 and energy intake signifi- cantly increased in both groups as lactation progressed p  0.01.

There were no differences in gly- caemia or insulinaemia during gestation or lactation Figure 3A- H. However there was a main effect of time on HOMA-IR levels p  0.05 where HOMA-IR decreased in both groups from ges- tation lean 1.50.2 obese 1.80.6 to lactation lean 0.9 0.1 obese 0.90.3.

Finally differences in ser-ine threonine and glycine metabolism in obese dams is notable as alterations in this metabolic pathway has been identified as discriminatory between pregnancies with or without gestational diabetes.31The increase in the urea cycle metabolites specifically in lac- tating dams could indicate altered protein turnover during lac- tation compared to pregnancy which is consistent with a study demonstrating increased circulating urea and citrulline in lactat- ing mice as a result of increased protein catabolism.32 Notably both ornithine and citrulline were stronger contributors to the lactation profiles in lean compared to obese dams suggesting a greater extent of protein catabolism in lean dams perhaps due to lower adipose tissue stores.The transition to lactation was also associated with decreases in circulating levels of all three BCAA.

As in the placenta BCAA catabolism in mammary glands is carried out by BCAA transaminase which uses 2-oxoglutarate to form their re- spective a-ketoacids and glutamate.33 The a-ketoacids once in the milk may be used as intestinal cell energy substrates by the neonate.Due to the association of breastfeeding with favorable alter- ations in metabolism the lactation period is posited to 'reset' pregnancy-associated changes in maternal metabolism includ- ing increased adiposity and insulin resistance.40 However our metabolomics data clearly show that lactation represents a dis- tinct metabolic state compared to pre-pregnancy.

Finally lactation did not induce a return in abun- dance of all microbial groups to that of pre-pregnancy levels fur- ther underscoring that lactation itself is a metabolically unique period in maternal metabolism.Although the present study contributes insight into differ- ences between diet-induced maternally obese and lean dams we are not able to distinguish between the effects of maternal obesity itself or the high fatsucrose diet.
