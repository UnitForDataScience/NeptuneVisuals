intestinal dysbiosis has also been implicated in colorectal cancer and microbes may determine treatment response for non-in- testinal malignancies.for more than 10 years intestinal microbial alterations have been associ- ated with localised radiation in humans and mouse models.importantly mice that lack colonisation of microbes ie raised germ free were resistant to lethal radiation enteritis indicating that the microbiota controls intestinal disease processes consequent to radiation-in- duced damage.in this context however the functional role of radiation-induced microbial alterations remained yet to be determined.in this issue gerassy-vainberg et al demonstrated that radiation-induced dysbiosis promoted susceptibility to radiation-induced injury and intestinal inflammation.

consequent to dysbiosis intestinal inflammation in both disease entities ie radiation-induced enteritis and ibd may be partly driven by il-1 receptor signalling.thus the results presented by gerassy-vainberg et al suggest that common mechanisms arein part by modulation of il-1b signal- ling.

1 is microbial composition or diversity a reli- able predictive marker of radiation-in- duced lesions 2 what is the impact of radiation-induced injury on viruses and fungi and what is their role for intestinal disease processes 3 do specific bacte- rial species determine the inflammatory tone and how do they modulate inflam- matory responses 4 is it possible to prevent or treat radiation-induced lesions by targeting the gut microbiota in this regard a recent study in mice demon- strated that microbiota composition is associated with susceptibility to radiosen- sitivity and that faecal microbiota trans- plantation alleviated consequences of irradiation.whether these findings may be translated into a therapeutic approach for human radiation-induced disease deserves further attention.funding hs is supported by equipe atip-avenir 2012 and european research council erc-2016- stg-715776.
