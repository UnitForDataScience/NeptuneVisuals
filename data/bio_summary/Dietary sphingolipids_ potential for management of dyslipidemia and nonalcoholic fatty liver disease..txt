In contrast egg SM added to the diet of milkfat-fed C57BL6J mice did not alter plasma lipids when fed with added cholesterol and actually increased serum cholesterol and triglycer- ides when fed without added cholesterol.In the latter study serum SM concentrations were elevated with egg SM feeding and were strongly positively correlated with serum cholesterol in the mice.On the other hand milk SM 0.25 wtwt of diet has been shown to sig- nificantly reduce serum cholesterol by approximately 15 to 25 when fed to C57BL6 mice consuming a milkfat-enriched diet 21 fat by weight regardless of the cholesterol content of the diet.However when milk SM was fed for 8 weeks as part of a milk phospho- lipid concentrate 0.25 SM wtwt of diet there were no changes in plasma lipids in mice fed a palm oil-based high-fat diet 20 fat by weight.Increases in plasma cholesterol th62 plasma SM th50 and aortic atherosclerosis were observed when female LDLr-- mice were fed a modified AIN-76A diet con- taining 1 wtwt ox brain sphingolipids 28 SM for12 weeks.

The acyl-coenzyme A CoA synthetases known to be involved in long-chain fatty acid uptake were shown to enhance sphingoid base uptake into mammalianintestinal epithelial cells.Recent evidence shows that after ingestion very long-chain ceramide species spe- cific to milk SM appear in the lymph of rodents sug- gesting that diet-derived sphingosine and fatty acids are reincorporated into complex sphingolipids and can enter circulation.Dietary SM contains a mixture of natural SM spe- cies that vary in their fatty acid and sphingoid base composition.For example milk SM contains more very long-chain fatty acids C220-C240 relative to other natural sources of SM such as egg which is pri- marily composed of palmitic acid C160.Milk SM also has a more varied distribution of sphingoid bases d160-d190 which includes dihydrosphingosine d180 a base that lacks the double bond of sphingo- sine between carbons 4 and 5 4E.These variable SM species may have differential bioactivity for example C160-dihydro-SM d180160 which contains dihy- drosphingosine interacts more favorably with choles- terol in membrane model systems and is more readily hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinase than is C160-SM SM d181160 which contains sphingosine.Furthermore dihydroceramide the hydrolytic product of dihydro-SM has no effect on apoptosis whereas short-chain ceram- ides are an established inducer of programmed cell death in many systems.Both dihydroceramide and very long- chain ceramides C220-C240 have been shown to an- tagonize apoptotic processes induced by shorter-chain ceramides.EFFECTS OF DIETARY SPHINGOLIPIDS ON DYSLIPIDEMIADietary cholesterol and fat are widely recognized to in- fluence fasting plasma lipids.

Compared with egg SM milk SM had a greater ability to inhibit the intestinal absorption of fat and cholesterol in rats potentially because of stronger hydrophobic interactions between milk SM and other lipids.In rodent feeding studies supplementation with dietary sphingolipids has been shown to variably alter serum lipids with most studies showing reduc- tions-others showing no effect-and some even showing increases.Duivenvoorden et alsup- plemented hyperlipidemic APOE3Leiden mice fed a Western diet 15 cocoa butter 0.25 cholesterol by weight with various types of complex and simple sphingolipids eg egg SM ceramide sphingosine and phytosphingosine in order to examine the effects of sphingolipids on plasma lipids.

Thus there is clearly a need to find effective alternative thera- pies that prevent lipid absorption but without negative side effects.Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently reduce the acute intestinal absorption of cholesterol triglycerides and long-chain fatty acids in rodents.-Products of SM digestion such as ceram- ides and sphingosine also inhibit the uptake of both cholesterol and fatty acid in vitro.Products of al- kaline sphingomyelinase hydrolysis of milk SM were shown to be more potent than intact milk SM at in- hibiting cholesterol uptake by Caco-2 cellsalthough it is unclear whether this is also true for fatty acid uptake.

Plasma alanine transaminase and serum amyloid A were also significantly lower with 1 phy- tosphingosine feeding suggesting a reduction in liver injury and inflammation.The complex dietary sphingolipids appear to reduce triglyceride biosynthesis in the liver as mice fed a milk SM-enriched high-fat diet 0.35 SM 28 fat by weight tended to have lower fractional synthesis of hep- atic triglycerides and displayed a significant reduction in the ratio of palmitoleic acid C161n7 to palmitic acid C160 in the liver an indicator of stearoyl-CoA desatur- ase 1 activity.Feeding egg SM at 0.6 and 1.2 wt wt for 4 weeks to mice fed a Western-type diet 21 butter fat 0.15 cholesterol by weight reduced hepatic total lipid content by 33 and 40 respectively.These changes were associated with significant reductions in hepatic total cholesterol content and mRNA expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis in the mice fed 0.6 egg SM.In another study male Zucker fatty rats were fed a control AIN-76A diet or the same diet supple- mented with either 0.5 wtwt SM prepared from chicken skin or 0.5 wtwt glucosylceramide from corn.After 45 days total hepatic lipid and phospho- lipid content were reduced in both the SM-enriched and the glucosylceramide-enriched diets.

Recently it was observed that 10-week supplementation of a lard-based high-fat diet 31 lard 0.15 cholesterol by weight with either 0.1 milk SM or egg SM wtwt significantly attenuated the development of hepatic stea- tosis and adipose tissue inflammation in C57BL6 J mice.These reductions in hepatic triglycerides with SM feeding were associated with lower mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 in the liver suggesting a reduced capacity for synthesis of hepatic triglycerides.

APOE3Leiden mice be- come markedly hyperlipidemic when fed diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol.Feeding of 0.2 wtwt and 0.4 wtwt dietary sphingolipids resulted in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride reductions of more than 20 with sphingoid bases showing efficacy equivalent to that of more complex sphingolipids.Dietary phytosphingosine was further examined and was shown to reduce plasma cholesterol and triglycer- ides by inhibiting the absorption of long-chain fatty acids and cholesterol.Dietary chicken-derived SM as well as ceramides from milk and corn were shown to significantly reduce plasma cholesterol in gen- etically obese rodents after 4 weeks.

Overall although dosages and durationsvary studies in which sphingolipids were added to the diet of rodents consuming large amounts of dietary cholesterol or to the diet of genetically obese rodents typically show reductions in plasma cholesterol whereas those in which sphingolipids were fed but cholesterol was not added in large amounts to the diet typically re- port no changes or elevations in plasma cholesterol or plasma SM.In humans dietary sphingolipids also show poten- tial to improve dyslipidemia.
