The sequences for this article have been deposited in NCBI SRA under the accession number SRP092622.Diversity and structure of the microbial communitiesThe minimum number of clean sequences was 39073 Y1 in all samples and therefore the library size of each sample was randomly normalized to 39073 sequences to conduct the down- stream analyses for different samples at the same sequencing depth.To determine richness of the microbial communities in samples OTUs and Chao1 at species level cutoff 3 were summarized in Table S2.

Each soil sample was homogenized with sterile tools and then split for two purposes50 g of soil was air-dried at room temperature grounded and sieved with 100 meshes 150 mm for soil characterization analysis 10 g of the identical sample was prepared for soil microbial DNA extraction.The physicochemical characteristics were determined as previ- ously described  .

The two percentages below the taxon name are the relative abundance of the taxon in all of the taxa left and in all of the selected taxa at the identical taxonomic level right.more microbes in the two samples possessed heavy-metal re- sistances due to higher efficiency of adaptable gene mutation and heavy-metal resistant gene transfer.In term of the relative abundances of the microbial community composition at phylum level Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria dominated across the 13 samples Proteobacteria was most abun- dant in D2-D4 S1 and Y2eY5 accounting for 27.0 Y4 to 44.1 D4 whereas Actinobacteria were predominant in the rest samples D1 S2 S3 Y1 and Y6 accounting for 24.1 D1 to 41.6 Y1 .

Mantel test was conducted with the vegan package to test the linear or monotonic independence between diversity indices and soil properties .Results and discussionSites and soil sample physiochemical propertiesA total of 13 soil samples were collected from three geograph- ically and climatically different Chromite Ore Processing Residue COPR disposal sites in Mouding Yunnan province D1-D4 101o5400600E 25o3001400N tropical climate annual precipitation880.1 mmyear Shangnan Shanxi province S1eS3 110o8805900E33o4909800N subtropical monsoon climate annual precipitation803.2 mmyear and Yima Henan province Y1eY6 111o8604900E 34o7902000N temperate continental climate annual precipitation666.9 mmyear China.

The OTUs at a 97 nucleotide similarity level were used for richness Chao1 and alpha diversity Shannon analyses with QIIME program.Statistical analysesHierarchical cluster analysis HCA was generated on the environmental variables of the 13 soil samples with Pearson correlation measure and Between-groups linkage method and the dendrogram demonstrated the cluster relationship between these samples.

In our study 13 soil samples were collected from three different COPR disposal sites in Mouding Shangnan and Yima China and these samples were polluted by multiple heavy metals.

Therefore the elevated metals such as Cr Cd Pb and Hg in the COPR soil samples may contribute to select the resistant bacteria that dominated such environment.The analysis of similarities ANOSIM revealed a significantdifference of microbial communities between the Low and High groups p 0.008.

It indicated that total Cr content was a relatively strong predictor for the three microbial variables of the soil samples.

However total Cr content affected the indices of soil microbial communities in different manners the first split of the trees for all OTUs and dominant phyla separated the samples with a high threshold value 251.3 and 1241 mg kg-1 respectively while the first split for diversity indices with a low threshold value 76.9 mg kg-1.
