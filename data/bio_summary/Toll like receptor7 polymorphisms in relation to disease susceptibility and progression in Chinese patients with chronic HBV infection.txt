a significantly higher frequency of tlr7 rs179010 c allele was found in male chb patients than in controls 74.8 vs 59.5 p  0.002. the frequency of rs179009 g allele was markedly increased with disease progression when male patients with chb lc and hcc were compared p  0.012. the haplotype cta was significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to chb among male patients p 0.000. frequency of the haplotype ctg was higher in male patients with hcc than chb p  0.005. no such differences in these allele frequencies were found between female patients and controls.

in the male group the frequency of haplotype cta was markedly higher in patients with chb p  0.000. in contrast a lower frequency of haplotype tta was found in patients with chb than in controls 25.2 vs 40 p  0.0001. as for disease progression the possible influence of tlr7 rs179009 on the devel- opment from chb to hcc in men was confirmed by haplotype cta and ctg distribution in patients with hcc compared to those with chb p  0.0001 for haplotype cta p  0.003 for haplotype ctg table .

no significant difference of haplotype cta distribution was found in menwomen who were hbeag negative and with hcc compared to those with chb supplementary table .discussionin this study we found that genetic variation of tlr7 plays a role in susceptibility to chb infection and affects disease progression from chb to hcc in chinese men.

no significant differences in frequencies tlr7 rs2074109 and rs179009 polymorphisms were observed when male or female patients with chb lc and hcc either combined or alone were compared with controls.table 2. the genotypes and allele frequencies of three tlr7 snps in patients with chb lc and hcc combined cases and controls.

the genotype and allele distributions of the three snps of chb lc and hcc groups are shown in table .an increased frequency of the minor allele g of tlr7 rs179009 was found in men along with severity of chb-related diseases being from 12.9 in patients with chb to 22.6 in patients with hcc p  0.012 adjusted by age.

nonetheless cytokines are the primary cause of inflammation and can mediate liver injury after hbv infection.in this present study chinese men with chb had a significantly higher frequency in major allele c of tlr7 rs179010 suggesting an increased risk of chb infection.

some important cytokines like ifn-a and il-6 were not determined in study subjects.in conclusion our findings supported the role of tlr7 rs179010 in predisposition of chb in chinese men while tlr7 rs179009 a allele was associated with a decreased risk of disease progression from chb to hcc.

we studied the effect of tlr7 polymorphisms on disease susceptibility and progression of chronic hepatitis b chb infection in chinese adults.

blood samples were taken from 612 patients with confirmed chb hepatitis b virus hbv-related liver cirrhosis lc or hepatocellular carcinoma hcc and 293 controls.

our results indicated that tlr7 polymorphisms play an important role in disease susceptibility and the progression of chb infections in chinese adults and may partly explain the high incidence of hbv related diseases in chinese men.hepatitis b virus hbv infection is a global health problem.

hbv carriers are at an increased risk of liver dam- age and many of them suffer from progressive liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis b infection chb liver cirrhosis lc and hepatocellular carcinoma hcc.

in china there are 97 million hbv carriers and at least 20 million of them have an active chb infection alone or combined with lc andor hcc.

levels of ast afp tbil and dbil were increased but alb levels were decreased significantly with the progression of the disease all p 0.001. hbv-dna copies were significantly decreased from chb to lc and hcc p 0.001. other indices of patients such as white blood cell hemoglobin blood platelet creatinine and prothrombin activ- ity were also examined.

the observed genotype dis- tributions of these three snps were in agreement with the hardy-weinberg equilibrium all p values 0.05. for tlr7 rs179010 the prevalence of major allele c was significantly higher in male patients with combined chb lc and hcc than that of controls 68.3 vs 59.5 p  0.029 table .
