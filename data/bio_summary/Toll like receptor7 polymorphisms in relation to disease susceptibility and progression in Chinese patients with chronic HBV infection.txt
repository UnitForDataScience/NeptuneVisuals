No significant difference of haplotype CTA distribution was found in menwomen who were HBeAg negative and with HCC compared to those with CHB Supplementary Table .DiscussionIn this study we found that genetic variation of TLR7 plays a role in susceptibility to CHB infection and affects disease progression from CHB to HCC in Chinese men.

The genotype and allele distributions of the three SNPs of CHB LC and HCC groups are shown in Table .An increased frequency of the minor allele G of TLR7 rs179009 was found in men along with severity of CHB-related diseases being from 12.9 in patients with CHB to 22.6 in patients with HCC P  0.012 adjusted by age.

As for disease progression the possible influence of TLR7 rs179009 on the devel- opment from CHB to HCC in men was confirmed by haplotype CTA and CTG distribution in patients with HCC compared to those with CHB P  0.0001 for haplotype CTA P  0.003 for haplotype CTG Table .

Nonetheless cytokines are the primary cause of inflammation and can mediate liver injury after HBV infection.In this present study Chinese men with CHB had a significantly higher frequency in major allele C of TLR7 rs179010 suggesting an increased risk of CHB infection.

Some important cytokines like IFN-a and IL-6 were not determined in study subjects.In conclusion our findings supported the role of TLR7 rs179010 in predisposition of CHB in Chinese men while TLR7 rs179009 A allele was associated with a decreased risk of disease progression from CHB to HCC.

We studied the effect of TLR7 polymorphisms on disease susceptibility and progression of chronic hepatitis B CHB infection in Chinese adults.

Blood samples were taken from 612 patients with confirmed CHB hepatitis B virus HBV-related liver cirrhosis LC or hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and 293 controls.

A significantly higher frequency of TLR7 rs179010 C allele was found in male CHB patients than in controls 74.8 vs 59.5 P  0.002.

The frequency of rs179009 G allele was markedly increased with disease progression when male patients with CHB LC and HCC were compared P  0.012.

The haplotype CTA was significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to CHB among male patients P 0.000.
