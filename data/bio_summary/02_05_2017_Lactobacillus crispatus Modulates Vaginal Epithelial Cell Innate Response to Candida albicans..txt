The concentrations of IL-6 decreased obviously in group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans compared with that in group VK2E6E7 with medium alone 18.91 - 0.65 vs. 27.97 - 0.15 pgml P  0.001.In contrast the concentrations of IL-8 increased dramatically in group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans compared with that in group VK2E6E7 with medium alone 25.93 - 0.68 vs.21.30 - 0.72 pgml P  0.001 and group VK2E6E7 with L. crispatus showed a marked reduction in the IL-8 level compared with group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans alone 12.41 - 0.06 vs. 25.93 - 0.68 pgml P  0.001.VK2E6E7 with medium alone showed an approximately 2-fold increase in the concentration of IL-17 compared with group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans alone 60.03 - 2.71 vs.30.65 - 1.87 pgml P  0.001.

The capacity of L. crispatus to adhere to VK2E6E7 and inhibit C. albicans growth was also tested by scanning electron microscopy SEM and adhesion experiments.Results Compared with group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans when treated with L. crispatus the adhesion of C. albicans to VK2E6E7 cells decreased significantly by 52.87 - 1.22 47.03 - 1.35 and 42.20 - 1.55 under competition exclusion and displacement conditions respectively.

albicans with its host and local rather than systemic immunity plays a decisive role in controlling the infection by initiating immune responses and even providing protection.The significant role played by epithelial cells in the innateimmune response to C. albicans has been demonstratedThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License which allows others to remix tweak and build upon the work non-commercially as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.For reprints contact c 2017 Chinese Medical Journal  Produced by Wolters Kluwer - Medknowby several recent studies.56 Epithelial cells from different sites of the human body7-9 inhibited C. albicans growth by producing cytokines and antimicrobial peptides AMPs.910 However the study of innate immune defense mechanisms of anti-C. albicans in the vagina has developed slowly.Lactobacilli are predominant members of vaginal microbiome in healthy women and play an important role in maintaining a healthy vaginal flora such as by competitive exclusion of pathogenic bacteria competition for nutrients production of antimicrobial substances and activation of the immune system.11 Co-aggregation of C. albicans and lactobacilli may be important in the vagina especially to reduce the adhesion of the fungus to the vaginal mucosa and to restore the vaginal microbiome by the production of favorable metabolites12 and the modulation of cytokine expression.13Lactobacillus crispatus an H2O2-producing strain is the most common species among the healthy human vaginal microbiota and contributes to the normal bacterial composition of vaginal ecosystem.14 In our study we assessed the role of L. crispatus on the ability ofC.

L. crispatus inhibited the adhesion hyphal formation and proliferation of C. albicans as well as maintaining the morphology and viability of vaginal epithelial cells notably.Lactobacillus crispatus modulates cytokines' secretion by human vaginal epithelial cellTo determine whether L. crispatus could influence the immune response of VK2E6E7 to C. albicans a set of experiments were performed using four groups of cells which were defined as group VK2E6E7 with medium alone group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans group VK2E6E7 with L. crispatus and group VK2Figure 1 Inhibition of the adhesion of Candida albicans to vaginal epithelial cells.

albicans the IL-4 concentrations showed no statistically significant differences compared with group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans 24.10 - 0.97 vs. 23.12 - 0.76 pgml P  0.221.In addition VK2E6E7 treated with L. crispatus and infected with C. albicans showed an increased release of IL-6 compared with cells stimulated with C. albicans alone 24.72 - 0.83 vs.18.91 - 0.65 pgml P  0.001 but to a lesser degree than that induced by L. crispatus alone 35.33 - 0.55 vs.18.91 - 0.65 pgml P  0.001.

Therefore Lactobacillus crispatus was explored for its capacity to intervene in the immune response of vaginal epithelial cells VK2E6E7 to C. albicans.Methods We examined the interleukin-2 IL-2 4 6 8 and 17 produced by VK2E6E7 cells infected with C. albicans and treated withL.

The concentration of IL-4 was similar to that of the group VK2 E6E7 with C. albicans 24.10 - 0.97 vs. 23.12 - 0.76 pgml P  0.221.Conclusions L. crispatus can attenuate the virulence of C. albicans modulate the secretion of cytokines and chemokines and enhance the immune response of VK2E6E7 cells in vitro.

The effect of L. crispatus on the adhesion of C. albicans to VK2E6E7 was assessed using a L. crispatusVK2E6E7 ratio of 1001.Interference experiments with C. albicans were performed using procedures described by Osset et al.16 with some modifications.

After co-cultured for 12 h the culture medium was aspirated washed three times with PBS and replaced with 1 ml 1 x 107 lactobacilli for an additional 24 h. There were four groups in this study which included group VK2E6E7 with medium alone group VK2E6E7 with C. albicans group VK2E6E7 with L. crispatus and group VK2E6E7 with suspensions of L. crispatus afterinfection with C. albicans.

The results demonstrated that L. crispatus caused significantly decreased adhesion of C. albicans to VK2E6E7 by 52.87 - 1.22 47.03 - 1.35 and 42.20 - 1.55 in the competition exclusion and displacement experiments respectively Figure 1.Scanning electron microscopy assessmentThe SEM study further verified the interaction betweenVK2E6E7 C. albicans and L. crispatus.
