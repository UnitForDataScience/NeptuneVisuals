herein the complex connections among circadian rhythms eating behaviors the gi microbiome and health are reviewed highlighting the need for additional translational research in this area.introductionthe impact of diet on the composition and function of the gastrointestinal gi microbial community and hu- man health is an area of rapidly evolving research that is particularly important as the cost and prevalence of chronic diseases rise to staggering figures and standard efficacious treatments such as dietary and physical ac- tivity modifications are infrequently prescribed and even less frequently followed.the trillions of microbes that make up the gi microbiome form a microbial or- gan with a collective gene set 150 times larger than the human genome providing metabolic immunologic and protective functions for the host.in addition to contributing to immunologic development and meta- bolic function the gi microbiome also influencesnervous system development and function.

further work is needed with interventions rather than observational studies to establish a causal link between misaligned rhythms and the microbiome investigating not only microbial composition but also the functional capacity of the microbiome andor metabolomics.results from trf studies indicate that restricting the time of food access may be protective against weight gain insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.these results also indicate there is a connection between the microbiome and metabolic health.

chronic sleep fragmentation a model of obstructive sleep apnea also affects both the murine microbiome and health.poroyko et al.demonstrated that mice exposed to chronic sleep fragmentation by tactile stimu- lation every 2 minutes during the sleep phase had in- creased food intake and decreased colonic barrier function and that transplantation of the firmicutes- enriched microbiome of these animals into germ-free animals resulted in enhanced inflammatory response674nutrition reviewsvr vol.

this is of note because others have reported that micro- biome alterations can persist for longer than dietary interventions and even longer than the metabolic con- sequences of dysbiosis.trf did however decrease the relative abundances of several presumed obesogenic microbes such as lactobacillus and lactococcus specieshuman microbiome displays cyclical thaiss et al.

mice have adifferent core microbiome than humans but many of the species comprising the microbiome are similar and present in relatively similar abundances.

feature articlecomplex interactions of circadian rhythms eating behaviors and the gastrointestinal microbiota and their potential impact on healthjennifer l. kaczmarek sharon v. thompson and hannah d. holscherhuman health is intricately intertwined with the composition and function of the tril- lions of microorganisms that make up the gastrointestinal gi microbiome.

emerging preclinical research suggests that gut microbes experience diurnal rhythms and the health effects of eating patterns including time-restricted feeding and meal frequency may be related to the gi microbiome.

emerging research suggests that some of the observed health effects related to eating patterns such as time-restricted feeding trf and meal frequency may also be related to the gi microbiome.

this specific microbial ratio has been associated with obesity or ill health in both rodent models and humans.these results suggest that a combination of a high-fat diet and circadian disruption may be what drives microbial dysbiosis in mice.snps of clock geneor risk of metabolic syndrome shift workrisk of obesity and metabolic syndromeshift work daily energy expenditurezarrinpar et al.

plausible mechanisms underlying the inverse relation- ships between more frequent eating occasions and lower glucose insulin total cholesterol and ldl cho- lesterol concentrations include a lower glycemic load as food is spread throughout the day slower stomach emptying from smaller meals leading to a lower need for insulin decreased insulin leading to decreased stimulation of enzymes for cholesterol synthesis and increased ldl receptors as a result of the lower circu- lating cholesterol.impact of eating frequency on the microbiotaalthough there is considerable research on eating fre- quency and health the impact of eating frequency on the gi microbiome has only recently been explored.

in both models the microbiome has been suggested as a potential mediator between circa- dian misalignment and negative health consequences.

to date evidence from human studies has not been robust because of issues such as small sample sizes and methodologic lim- itations inherent to human research including the inabil- ity to conduct germ-free experimentation.there is extensive research on the connection be- tween eating frequency and health but almost no pub- lished research on the connection between eating frequency and the microbiome.
