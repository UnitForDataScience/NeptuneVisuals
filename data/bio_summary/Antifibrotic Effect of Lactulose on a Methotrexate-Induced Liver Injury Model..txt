Lactulose reduces both blood endotoxin levels and liver damage In a rat model lactulose administration increases liver regeneration after hepatectomy by inducing hydrogen as a result of decreasing the oxidative stress response and excessive inflammatory response In our study as all the histological and bio- chemical results clearly demonstrated we evaluate that lactulose treatment has antifibrotic effects on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity in rats and this effect of lactulose can be due to impact on intestinal microbiome.ConclusionHepatotoxicity is a dose-limiting side effect in long-term MTX treatments used in dermatological or other inflamma- tory diseases.

Many studies demonstrated thatMTX-induced hepatic injury may be due to oxidative stress Recently some studies indicate that the intestinal flora might play a critical role in liver fibrosis and hepatocel- lular carcinoma -As a synthetic disaccharide lactulose has a wide range of applications in the food industry especially as a probiotic food and it has been used as a drug mainly for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and constipation Although dysregulated intestinal microbiome has been found associated with complications of end-stage liver disease there is no study about the effect of lactulose on MTX-induced liver toxicity to the best of our knowledge.

Plasma pentraxin 3 PTX3 levels were measured in each 100 ml sample by a standard ELISA apparatus at 450 nm by usingTable 1p 0 0001 MTX  lactulose group compared with normal group.p 0 01 MTX  lactulose group compared with normal group.

These results comply with previous studies Moreover we corre- lated these histological changes with serum and biochemical studies that also suggested liver injury.Our observations clearly demonstrated that MTX treat- ment increases serum levels of ALT as shown by previous studies -We also found that systemic inflammatory response indicator TNF-a has increased due to MTX admin- istration and has been decreased by lactulose treatment.In this study we postulate that MTX administration triggered serum TGF-b increase indicating the role of thisabcdefFigure 1 Liver histopathology HE x20 magnification a-b normal liver c-d bridging necrosis fibrosis and cellular infiltration in portal area pa arrow central venous CV e-f decreased bridging necrosis fibrosis and cellular infiltration in portal area pa arrow.p 0 0001 MTX  lactulose group compared with normal group.

TGF-b is a cen- tral regulator in chronic liver disease and contributes to all stages of disease progression from initial liver injury to fibrosis and carcinoma while lactulose depresses the TGF-b response.Another important finding of the study is that MTX exposure triggered increase in plasma PTX3 which is a glycoprotein in the PTX family and plays an important role in the primary inflammatory response Recently PTX3 has been used as a biomarker of liver diseases We suggest that PTX3 can be used as a marker for MTX- induced hepatotoxicity and lactulose treatment can reduce PTX3 plasma levels.We observed that MTX administration significantly increased both plasma and tissue MDA in comparison to the normal group.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of lactulose treatment on MTX-induced hepatotoxicity in a rat model.

Group 1 subjects were given lactulose 5 gkgday and group 2 subjects were given saline 1 mlkgday for 10 days.

We suggest that lactulose has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on an MTX-induced liver injury model.

The presented study aimed to investigate the antifibrotic effects of lactulose on a methotrexate-induced liver injury rat model.Materials and MethodsAnimals.

Group 1 rats received lactulose 5 gkgday Duphalac syrup Abbott and group 2 rats received saline  0.9 NaCl 1 mlkgday.
