S1 included mice dosed by oral gavage with corn oil vehicle CO with 0 0.1 1.0 and 10 mgkg TCDD and mice dosed by oral gavage with AC vehicle with 0 0.1 1.0 and 10 mgkg TCDD.

Herein we examined the bioavailability of TCDD sequestered to AC on a key murine gut commensal and the influence of AC on the community structure of the gut microbiota.

Responses were not observed with equivalent TCDD doses administered with AC.The goals of this study were to 1 examine the bioavailabil- ity of TCDD sequestered to AC AC-TCDD on a key gut commensal in the murine model and 2 characterize the influ- ence of AC on the gut microbiota.

Taken together the expression of SFB functional genes further verifies that TCDD was not bioavailable when adsorbed on to AC.Effect of AC and CO on gut microbiome The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to examine the influence of AC and CO on gut microbiota in the ileum.

Therefore the short-term ingestion of AC does not appear to have a threatening influence on the structure of the gut microbiome.Results of this study support the remedial use of AC to mute TCDD-induced responses to the gut microbiome of a murine host.

This ques- tion was partially answered in a recent study examining 2378-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin TCDD-induced hall- mark toxic responses in mice administered with TCDD se- questered by AC or freely available in corn oil by oral gavage.

Concordant with previously described stud- ies TCDD administered on AC eliminated both the toxic re- sponse in mice Boyd et al.

3 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis using DNA extracted from ileum comparing naive mice with groups dosed with corn oil CO or dosed with activated carbon AC.

This was examined here via 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene sequencing using DNA extracted from ileal tissues of mice exposed to AC-TCDD.Materials and methodsAnimals and experimental design Pathogen-free female B6C3F1 mice that were 5 to 8 weeks old were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories Portage MI USA and handled as previously described Boyd et al.
