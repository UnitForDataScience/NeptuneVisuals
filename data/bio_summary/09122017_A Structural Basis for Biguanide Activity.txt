The PFM and MFM rotation is in the opposite sense while the angles for MFM and BFM are more similar.Gabel et al.Page 28Summary of Kd and Ki values.Table 1aAdditional ligand bound to the pABG subsite.bBuffer 100 mM TrisHCl 50 mM MES 50 mM Acetic Acid 1 mM EDTA 5 mM BME pH 7.0 25deg CcBuffer 20 mM Tris-HCl pH  7.2 uncorrected 120 mM NaCl 1 mM TCEP 0.5 mM EDTA 0.25 mM NaN3 in D2O.dAn initial fit with variable DH gave a Kd  26.7-11.0 mM DH  -1.1-3.2 kcalmol the large error in DH prompted an alternate fit with DH set  0.eIle50 and Ile61 each exhibit two resonances only one of which titrates upon MFM addition.fA non-linear global fit of all the data gives a Ki of 17.9 -3.5 mM.

Schematic illustrating the pteridine- and pABG-binding subsites of the DHFR folate binding siteThe panels illustrate how the subsites are occupied by A folate B 24-diaminopyrimidine DAP and pABG C metformin MFM and pABG D MFM and a 4-methyl-substituted hippurate E MFM and the NSAID Fenbufen.

In summary in the E. coli enzyme pABG exerts both positive cooperativity as well as an indirect enzyme-mediated negative cooperativity on metformin binding.Consistent with contributions from both effects positive cooperativity of MFM and pABG in DHFR inhibition studies was not observed.Cooperative inhibition for pABG and MFM was also evaluated using steady state kinetics data not shown.

The quaternary complexes in which the nicotinamide ring is in molecule D or out of the active site molecule A both correspond to closed conformations of the Met20 loop although the loop conformations are not identical Figure S6.To better understand how MFM might bind to DHFR modeling of MFM to DHFR was carried out using a Gaussian analysis with the starting position based on three observationsthe structural analogies with the buformin and DAP-pABG complexes 2 the selective perturbation of Ile d-CH3 resonances positioned near the binding site and 3 the extensive ILOE observations that connect the metformin methyl groups with ligands occupying the pABG subsite.

ILOE build-up data for MFM and ligands bound to the pABG subsiteA A series of 1D NOE spectra obtained at the indicated mixing times by irradiating the MFM methyl resonance at 3.04 ppm and observing the pABG aromatic resonances.

68 have observed very strong cooperativity between a pair of ligands 24-diaminopyrimidine DAP and p- aminobenzoyl-L-glutamate pABG corresponding to methotrexate fragments that occupy the pteridine and pABG binding subsites of L. casei DHFR Figure 3A Figure S2.In contrast with the results for the L. casei enzyme the E. coli DHFR exhibits substantially lower affinity for pABG Kd  7.9 mM Figure S3 and the fraction of bound pABG is insufficient to produce transferred NOE signals.

The Kd values from serial titration studies with DMBP and then MFM in the presence of 75 mM DMBP were 5.4 mM DMBP and 7.0 mM MFM.

The affinity of the ecDHFR for MFM is  20-fold weaker than for DAP so that metformin is not as effective as DAP for recruitment of pABG.

The MFM shows the same set of favorable H-bond interactions that is observed for the BFM and PFM complexes and the two methyl carbon atoms are positioned 4.2 A and 4.8 A from the closer pABG meta carbon.

The resulting a value which describes the cooperative inhibition by MFM and pABG was 3.3 - 1.3.
