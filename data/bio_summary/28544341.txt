Furthermore these fatty acids recovered the suppression of 3-adrenergic receptor-stimulated uncoupling protein 1 expression and secretion of adiponectin in C3H10T12 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes re- spectively under inflammatory conditions suggesting that enone fatty acids can ameliorate dysfunctions of adipocytes induced by inflammation.Conclusion These findings indicate that synthesized enone fatty acids show potent anti- inflammatory effects leading to the improvement of inflammation-induced dysfunctions in adipocytes.KeywordsAdipocytes  Gut microbiota  Inflammation  Obesity  Polyunsaturated fatty acidAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-siteReceived January 19 2017Revised April 28 2017Accepted May 15 2017Correspondence Tsuyoshi GotoE-mail Abbreviations 10T12 C3H10T12 ALA a-linolenic acid AP-1 activator protein 1 BMDM bone marrow-derived macrophage CLA conjugated linoleic acid ERK extracellular signal-regulated kinase ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay GLA -y- linolenic acid GPR G-protein-coupled receptor INF-y inter- feron -y IKBa inhibitor of NF-KB a JNK c-jun N-terminal kinases L1-CM 3T3-L1 adipocyte conditioned medium LAlinoleic acid LCM LPS-stimulated RAW conditioned medium LPS lipopolysaccharide MAPK mitogen-activated protein ki- nase MCP-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 NF-KB nu- clear factor-KB NO nitric oxide NRF2 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 PPAR peroxisome proliferator activated recep- tor PUFA polyunsaturated fatty acid RAW RAW 264.7 RCM non-LPS-stimulated RAW conditioned medium TNF-a tumor necrosis factor-a UCP1 uncoupling protein 1 33AR 33 adrener- gic receptorIntroductionThe increasing rate of obesity is becoming a worldwide public health issue because obesity causes a number of metabolic symptoms including insulin resistance type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

Lastly we also investigated whether these fatty acid metabolites can amelio- rate inflammation-induced dysfunctions in adipocytes.Materials and methodsChemical reagents and cell cultureAll fatty acid metabolites were produced as described previously 8 from the following dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid LA a-linolenic acid ALA and-y-linolenic acid GLA all the fatty acids were dissolved in ethanol.

p  0.05 p  0.01 versus the LPS- treated vehicle group gray bar.The selected fatty acid metabolites were designated as fol- lows KetoC 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid number 6 aKetoC 10-oxo-trans-11-cis-15-octadeca-dienoic acid number 18 and -yKetoC 10-oxo-cis-6-trans-11-octadeca-dienoic acid number 30.

10-oxo- 12Z-octadecenoic acid a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria potently activates PPAR gamma and stimulates adipogenesis.

10- Oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid generated from linoleic acid by a gut lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum is cy- toprotective against oxidative stress.

Several of these fatty acids metabolized from dietary fatty acids by gut lactic acid bacteria can be detected in the blood and organs 8.

The gut microbiota produces several spe- cific fatty acids such as hydroxy oxo and conjugated fatty acids from dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs via the metabolism of saturation 8.
