the gut microbiota produces several spe- cific fatty acids such as hydroxy oxo and conjugated fatty acids from dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids pufas via the metabolism of saturation 8. among these specific fatty acids conjugated linoleic acid cla is reported to have a protective effect on joints in inflammation-related arthritis 9. moreover 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid suppresses tnf-a-induced barrier impairment in caco-2 cells and dex- tran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice 10. several of these fatty acids metabolized from dietary fatty acids by gut lactic acid bacteria can be detected in the blood and organs 8. therefore it is possible that these specific fatty acids may alleviate obesity-induced inflammation in adi- pose tissues however research on this comprehensive anti- inflammatory effect is insufficient the detail mechanism is unclear and studies on obesity-induced inflammation are lacking.in a previous study we have identified genes encod-ing enzymes involved in fatty acid saturation metabolism in lactobacillus plantarum 8. here several conjugated pu- fas which are absent in natural food have been generated and their anti-inflammatory effect was investigated.

furthermore these fatty acids recovered the suppression of 3-adrenergic receptor-stimulated uncoupling protein 1 expression and secretion of adiponectin in c3h10t12 and 3t3-l1 adipocytes re- spectively under inflammatory conditions suggesting that enone fatty acids can ameliorate dysfunctions of adipocytes induced by inflammation.conclusion these findings indicate that synthesized enone fatty acids show potent anti- inflammatory effects leading to the improvement of inflammation-induced dysfunctions in adipocytes.keywordsadipocytes  gut microbiota  inflammation  obesity  polyunsaturated fatty acidadditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article at the publisher's web-sitereceived january 19 2017revised april 28 2017accepted may 15 2017correspondence tsuyoshi gotoe-mail abbreviations 10t12 c3h10t12 ala a-linolenic acid ap-1 activator protein 1 bmdm bone marrow-derived macrophage cla conjugated linoleic acid erk extracellular signal-regulated kinase elisa enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gla -y- linolenic acid gpr g-protein-coupled receptor inf-y inter- feron -y ikba inhibitor of nf-kb a jnk c-jun n-terminal kinases l1-cm 3t3-l1 adipocyte conditioned medium lalinoleic acid lcm lps-stimulated raw conditioned medium lps lipopolysaccharide mapk mitogen-activated protein ki- nase mcp-1 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 nf-kb nu- clear factor-kb no nitric oxide nrf2 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 ppar peroxisome proliferator activated recep- tor pufa polyunsaturated fatty acid raw raw 264.7 rcm non-lps-stimulated raw conditioned medium tnf-a tumor necrosis factor-a ucp1 uncoupling protein 1 33ar 33 adrener- gic receptorintroductionthe increasing rate of obesity is becoming a worldwide public health issue because obesity causes a number of metabolic symptoms including insulin resistance type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.

lastly we also investigated whether these fatty acid metabolites can amelio- rate inflammation-induced dysfunctions in adipocytes.materials and methodschemical reagents and cell cultureall fatty acid metabolites were produced as described previously 8 from the following dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic acid la a-linolenic acid ala and-y-linolenic acid gla all the fatty acids were dissolved in ethanol.

because the diverse gut microbiota releases a number of different functional metabo- lites combined effects of the fatty acid metabolites might be important to protect the adipose tissue from inflammation and adipocytes dysfunction under obese condition.peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ppars are divided into a -y o ligand-dependent nuclear receptors which are expressed in macrophages and adipocytes and regulate the transcription of target genes involved in metabolism and inflammation 26. ppara agonists suppress inflam- mation by hindering the activation of nf-kb 27 activation of ppar-y inhibits inflammatory signaling via suppression of mapk and nf-kb pathways in raw macrophages 28. most la-derived fatty acid metabolites including ketoc ac- tivate ppara while 10-oxo-cis-12-octadecenoic acid ketoa and ketoc specifically stimulate ppar-y activity 29. in this study we showed that the selected enone fatty acids suppress inflammatory responses in raw macrophages by inhibiting the nf-kb and mapkap-1 pathways.

moreover the effect of fatty acid metabolites may be associ- ated with some kind of g-protein-coupled receptors gprs which recognize various fatty acids depending on their struc-ture such as the length and the position of double bond 30. one of fatty acid-binding gprs gpr120 is expressed in adipocytes and macrophages its binding to docosahexaenoic acid inhibits inflammation and increases insulin sensitivity via inhibition of nf-kb and mapk pathways 31. hence the anti-inflammatory effect of enone fatty acids may partly be mediated via activation of fatty acid-binding gprs.additionally ketoc has been reported to alleviate ox- idative stress through upregulating the production of nu- clear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 nrf2 subsequently increasing expression of anti-oxidative enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 in the liver 32. oxidative stress can induce inflammation via activation of transcription factor nf-kb or nod-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome 33. thus suppression of oxidative stress is considered an effec- tive way to decrease inflammation.

10-oxo- 12z-octadecenoic acid a linoleic acid metabolite produced by gut lactic acid bacteria potently activates ppar gamma and stimulates adipogenesis.

10- oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid generated from linoleic acid by a gut lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus plantarum is cy- toprotective against oxidative stress.

re- cent studies have shown that gut microbiota-generated spe- cific compounds such as short-chain fatty acids can modu- late the lipid metabolism of the host 22 23. many advance technologies has been developed to investigate gut microbial communities such as liquid chromatography-tandem ms lc-msms 24. previously we have identified genes encod- ing enzymes involved in fatty acid saturation metabolism in lactobacillus plantarum and synthesized several conjugated pufas such as ketoc aketoc and -yketoc 8. in the presentfigure 8. treatment with combined enone fatty acids effectively suppresses the production of proinflammatory factors in raw macrophages.

7e and f. these results suggested that the anti- inflammatory activity of enone fatty acids exerted a beneficial effect on inflammation-induced dysfunctions in adipocytes.treatment with low-dose of combined enone fatty acids enhances the anti-inflammatory effect in raw macrophagesin raw macrophages the production of no and the expres- sion of inos were significantly increased by stimulation with lps but were suppressed by treatment with enone fatty acids in a dose-dependent manner fig.
