However in contrast to results from taxonomic diversity analyses eelgrass leaves were not more phylogenetically similar to seawater communities from the same seagrass bed in comparison to seawater communities from other seagrass beds indicating that seawater harbors globally phylogenetically similar communities that can assemble onto seagrass leaves despite differences in the specific OTUs present in different locations.Environmental sources of eelgrass-associated microorganisms.

For instance these predictions could be evaluated using a shotgun metagenomic approach combined with mass spectrometry to probe the physiology of taxa such as Sulfurimonas that we suspect play functional roles in eelgrass' tolerance of marine sediment conditions and their numerical associations with host-derived metabolites detected on seagrass tissues.Prior research has documented a positive relationship between seagrass biomass production rates and the density of sulfide-consuming lucinid clams in seagrass beds owing to the hypothesized in situ oxidation of sulfide by symbiotic bacteria housed in clam gills .

While culture- independent techniques have been used to describe the microbiome composition in seagrass-colonized marine sediments  an extensive characterization of in situ seagrass leaf and root surface microbiomes across the host's geographic range is still lacking leaving potentially important but unculturable microorganisms overlooked and making it difficult to identify general patterns in seagrass symbiont community struc- ture taxonomic cooccurrence and community assembly.Here we report the results of a comprehensive analysis of microbial communities associated with leaf and root surfaces of individual Z. marina plants spanning their geographic range throughout the Northern Hemisphere.

We then determined whether host-associated microbial communities were more similar to the microbial com- munity in the adjacent environment than to that of all other seagrass beds by comparing intercentroid distances against the distributions generated from 1000 permutations of the randomized data set.

By contrast we detected 529 enriched and 1004 depleted OTUs on seagrass roots  consistent with a higher degree of host recruitment and higher selectivity against particular environmental microorganisms on belowground seagrass tissues 23.2 of taxa detected on roots exhibited patterns in normalized abundance that differed from those observed in sediments.

Indeed abundant bacteria that are predicted sulfur oxidizers have been detected in marine sediments attached to seagrass roots  and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism T-RFLP community profiling  of root surfaces in a single European seagrass bed has suggested similar patterns in Epsilonproteobacteria community dominance .

Three leaf root water and sediment samples were collected from each of two physically separated seagrass beds at 25 ZEN locations 50 seagrass beds total  using identical sampling protocols were placed into 2-ml collection vials and were covered in ZYMO Xpedition buffer.

The return of terrestrial seagrass ancestors to oceans is among the most extreme habitat shifts documented in plants making them an ideal testbed for the study of microbial symbioses with plants that experi- ence relatively harsh abiotic conditions.

In this study we report the results of a global sampling effort to extensively characterize the structure of microbial commu- nities associated with the widespread seagrass species Zostera marina or eelgrass across its geographic range.

Given that human activities are changing the nutrient conditions in habitats worldwide  and the central role of microorganisms in plant nutrition    there is a pressing need to answer basic empirical questions about microbial associates of plants such as seagrasses that experience atypical abiotic conditions including questions about their geographic distributions putative community assembly patterns and functional roles.Much of our current knowledge of seagrass symbionts comes from targeted surveys of specific bacterial taxa using culture-dependent methods and microscopy under laboratory conditions or from field studies at local or regional spatial scales e.g.
