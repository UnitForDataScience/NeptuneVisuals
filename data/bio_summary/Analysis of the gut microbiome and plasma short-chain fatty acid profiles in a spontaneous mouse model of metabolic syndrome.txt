These results indicate that the dysbiosis in TSOD mice led to a loss of type and quantity of SCFAs which may have a role in the development of metabolic syndrome in this mouse model.DiscussionTo investigate the hypothesis that alterations in the gut microbial community may contribute to the sponta- neous development of metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice we analyzed the gut microbiota and plasma SCFA profiles in 24-wk-old TSOD mice.

Given that these pathological manifestations in TSOD mice are closely related to low-grade inflam- mation we hypothesized that alterations in gut microbiota and plasma SCFA profiles in TSOD mice may affect a host's immune system and induce inflammation which would underlie the development of metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice.

In this study we analyzed the gut microbiome and plasma SCFA profiles in 24-wk-old TSOD mice that had already developed insulin resistance and NASH.ResultsAnalysis of the gut microbiome in TSOD mice.

These data suggest that the TSOD mouse is a useful model for metabolic syndrome and can manifest the characteristics of the obesity-specific gut microbiome.Also among the major bacterial families we found two families in the phylum Firmicutes--Clostridiaceaeand Erysipelotrichaceae--that showed significant increases in 24-wk-old TSOD mice Table .

Inasmuch as the gut microbiome in TSOD mice favored Firmicutes species which mainly produce butyrate and did not favor Bacteroidetes species which primarily produce acetate and propionate alterations in the SCFA profiles in TSOD mice seemed to roughly reflect the altered FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio of the microbial community.

Thus TSOD mice may be useful for analyzing the effects of novel therapeutic agents especially those that modulate gut microbiota for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome-associated HCC.The gut microbiota was reportedly significantly affected by obesity in humans and in animal models.

We found that the percentage of Turicibacter which was implicated in the production of butyrate was markedly higher in 24-wk-old TSOD mice in agreement with the increase in plasma butyrate in 24-wk-old TSOD mice.

The growth of Bilophila can reportedly be promoted by increased taurine-conjugated bile acids which is consistent with the possibility that bile acid-favoring Firmicutes increased in TSOD mice.Plasma SCFA profiles in TSOD mice also differed from those in control mice.

Acetate which was decreased in TSOD mice is mainly produced by the Bacteroidetes phylumof which abundance was also decreased in TSOD mice.
