similar patterns that were seen in the ascending colon in alc were also different from nalc p  1.0e-02 and controls p  0.01 and the descending colon with alc compared to nalc p  1.0e-02 and controls p  0.04. the sigmoid colon had the lowest difference between alc and nalc p  0.02 and controls p  0.05. on the other hand when controls and nalc were compared only the ti p  1.0e-02 and descending colon p  0.03 were significantly different.the proportion of autochthonous taxa lachnospiraceae ruminococcaeae and clostridiales cluster xiv nava and stappenbeck 2011 was significantly lower in all alc tissuescirrhosis alcohol and gut-liver axis1859table 1. subject characteristicscontrol n  34alc n  37nalc n  68age548.756.06.957.26.2gender menwomen23112985315 ethnicity caucasian african american latino others2662027540511160 body mass index27.27.327.95.729.13.9meld score-14.37.813.97.0 with hepatic encephalopathy-15 4130 44lactulose use -15 4130 44rifaximin use -15 4130 443-day recall average daily caloric intake231063221156912090981daily bowel movement frequency median iqr1 1.52 2.52 1.5endotoxemia median iqr euml0.08 0.090.89 1.630.07 0.26tnf-a median iqr pgml0.003.0 15.001.8 5.39data are presented as mean sd unless mentioned otherwise p  0.05 kruskal-wallis test meld model for end-stage liver disease a validated score for cirrhosis severity alc actively drinking cirrhotic patients cirr abstinent cirrhotic patients and controls healthy controls.

alcohol use exacerbates intestinal inflammation and results in gut dysbiosis in noncirrhotic individuals schnabl and brenner 2014. prior smaller studies have shown that alcohol use can increase the hepatic bile acid ba production and an increased conversion from primary-to-secondary bas in the intestinal lumen which can be harmful to the gut-liver axis kakiyama et al.

the current study demonstrated this ba profile change is evident even at the duodenal level resulting in a higher secondary ba and con- jugated secondary ba profile in actively drinking cirrhotic patients.

2011. ba profile was performed using liquid chroma- tography lcms and resulted in total ba conjugated moieties secondary and primary bas and their ratio kakiyama et al.

together these ba-responsive receptors mediate the enterohepatic ba cycle by linking hepatic ba synthesis with intestinal absorption of bas ridlon et al.

prior smaller studies have shown a higher secondary ba profile in the stool of actively drinking noncir- rhotic and cirrhotic patients and in animal models which was also reflected in a higher serum ba profile of conjugated secondary bas in this population axelson et al.

this group also showed higher endotoxemia systemic and ileal inflammatory expression and lower amino acid and bioener- getic-associated metabolites without change in antimicrobial peptide expression.conclusions despite cirrhosis continued alcohol misuse predisposes patients to widespread dysbio- sis with alterations in microbial functionality such as a toxic ba profile which can lead to intestinal and systemic inflammation.key words bile acids microbiota metabolomics inflammation functionality.lcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality world-wide rehm et al.

therefore alcohol misuse in the background of cirrhosis can affect both microbiota structure and func- tionality associated with endotoxemia a more toxic ba profile and potentially greater consumption of amino acids and other metabolites.the alterations in the gut milieu in alcohol misuse are associated with intestinal barrier impairment and resultantsystemic inflammation.

therefore potential contributions of ethnicity and alcohol dose-response could not be defined.we conclude that even in the background of cirrhosis continued alcohol misuse predisposes patients to widespread dysbiosis with alterations in microbial functionality such as a toxic ba profile which can lead to intestinal and systemic inflammation.

the proportion with decompensated cirrhosis was similar between alc and nalc groups table 1. the alc patients had a mean duration of alcohol use of 35 11 years.
