toward the resolution of a fight-or-flight response vagal ach suppresses adrenergic stimulation of the spleen thereby stifling the production of immune cells.69 moreover it binds to achr found on immune cells to suppress the nf-kb pathway and the subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines.6970 furthermore vagal afferents stimulate the anti-inflammatory pathway of the hpa axis thus reinforcing its restorative function figure 7.70restoration of the immune system.

this relatively hardwired response pathway originates in sympathetic premotor neurons of the brainstem and hypothalamus.2324 the brainstem receives somatosensory stimuli and mediates arousal.25 it quickly detects danger.8 the brainstem is implicated in instinctual primitive responses that are not muddled by subjective interpretation.26 therefore this pathway is not biased by judgment.the second branch of sympathetic premotor neurons originates in hypothalamic regions eg the pvn and receives enough information about the somatosensory trigger and the psychological interpretation to offer an immediate threat assessment.2728 however a quick assessment instead of a complete analysis can lead to a false alarm as follows 1 the sympathetic premotor neuronal pathway projects to sympathetic preganglionic neurons which innervates the sympathetic ganglia with cholinergic projections ie secreting neurotransmitter acetylcholine ach22 and 2 the postganglionic neurons emerge from those projections and innervate the internal organs directly injecting catecholamines and immediately eliciting the physical stress response.2229 however a prolonged stress response is needed to ward off a potential danger effectively.intermediate stress response.

the shift from theth1 to the th2 immune response upregulates nicotinic achr on the gut epithelial surface which is also heavily innervated by vagal ach afferents thereby upregulating ach-achr binding on the epithelium ultimately to trigger anti-inflammatory responses figure 9.77chronic dukkha or sufferingthe hpa axis restores homeostasis by lowering inflammation that accompanies a fight-or-flight response.

oxytocin downregulates stress responses.20 among its other functions avp plays a crucial role in reducing the stress response of the hpa axis through a negative feedback mechanism21 toward theconclusion of a stressful event.in summary the hypothalamic stress control center integrates information from the limbic and cerebral cortices promotes a fight-or-flight response if necessary and regulates the neuroendocrine pillars ie the hpa sns and psns of the cycle of sukha ie homeostasis and dukkha ie suffering.

ironically these inputs can carry a faulty interpretation of upstream signals thus resulting in an erroneous fight-or-flight response.stress responsea phased fight-or-flight response initiates 1 an immediate induction of sympathetic hormones 2 a longer lasting intermediate effect facilitated by the sns and 3 a prolonged effect induced by the hpa axis.22immediate stress response.
