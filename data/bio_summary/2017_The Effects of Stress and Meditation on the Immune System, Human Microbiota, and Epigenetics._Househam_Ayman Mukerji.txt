Oxytocin downregulates stress responses.20 Among its other functions AVP plays a crucial role in reducing the stress response of the HPA axis through a negative feedback mechanism21 toward theconclusion of a stressful event.In summary the hypothalamic stress control center integrates information from the limbic and cerebral cortices promotes a fight-or-flight response if necessary and regulates the neuroendocrine pillars ie the HPA SNS and PSNS of the cycle of sukha ie homeostasis and dukkha ie suffering.

Fortunately with practitioners now empowered by an understanding of stress physiology the teachings may be interpreted in terms of the underlying science.The mental state of equanimity that can be achieved through the practice of meditation is in part characterized by an absence of stress.

The review consists of studies reflecting the processes underlying the state of stress and the state devoid of stress.

The limbic system includes the amygdala hippocampus thalamus hypothalamus basal ganglia and cingulate gyrus.The hippocampus helps individuals to remember the context of past events that were perceived as fearful and the hippocampus-lateral-septum pathway helps them associate the context with an appropriate stress response.56 The midline thalamus plays a role in predicting a threat based on past experiences.7 The amygdala which is activated in emotional responses acts as a switch for the stress alarm system and initiates sympathetic and HPA responses.89 The amygdala is the seat of the instinctual fear response and does not necessarily thoroughly appraise the threat.10In summary the limbic integrative center is where the threat level of an event is judged based on primal instincts and a subjective version of past memories thus it is possibly prone to emotional bias and judgment errors.Cortical Integrative Center.
