however none of the symptoms provoked during breath testing were associated with dietary outcome in the multivariate analysis and as such these symptoms could not be used to independently predict the effect of dietary intervention in our cohort.peak breath methane concentrations above the thresh- old of 10 ppm were associated with adequate dietary relief in fructose intolerance by both uni- trend and multivariate significant analyses indicating an indepen- dent association between methane production duringab012345time h012345time hfructose intolerance n  394lactose intolerance n  2591-247 2315 291.003-5101 4927 521.19 0.58-2.450.636-859 2910 191.88 0.78-4.570.16or odds ratio ci confidence intervals.fructose breath testing and dietary outcome.

the very favourable efficacy of the low-fodmap diet in this study corroborates the results of earlier smaller studies with mixed groups of mainly ibs patients often including patients with malabsorption increased breath gas concentrations but not necessarily intolerance pro- voked symptoms during breath test.9-17 20 32 33associations between clinical symptoms of fgid and outcome of a low-fodmap dietchronic diarrhoea and pruritus emerged as the univari- ate predictors of a positive outcome of the low-fod- map diet highly significant in fgid patients with fructose intolerance and a consistent trend in patients with lactose intolerance.

malabsorption was defined as an increase20 ppm in hydrogen or 10 ppm in methane levels over baseline twice in succession.15 intolerance was defined as an increase 2 over baseline in our previously published symptom score index which is the sum of the intensities 0  none 1  mild 2  intense of abdominal disten- sion or bloating flatulence fullness nausea diarrhoea abdominal cramps borborygmi and gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms scored hourly concurrently with the col- lection of the breath samples.15 additional non-gi symp- toms rated but not part of the symptom index were tiredness diminished concentration headache myalgia arthralgia palpitations oral aphthoid ulcers and skin rash.dietary protocolall patients shown to be fructose or lactose intolerant by breath testing were referred to the same experienceddietician for a standardised 4-week dietary adaptation based on published low-fodmap diet guidelines.11 patients received individual instruction by the dietician regarding a diet low in fermentable saccharides and polyols which was maintained for 3-4 weeks.

consequently we studied the predictive value of clinical symptoms and breath test results on the outcome of a low-fodmap diet in a large cohort of patients with fgid and fructose or lac- tose intolerance in a single referral centre.patients materials and methodsall successive patients referred to our gastroenterology practice by general practitioners between january 2008 and december 2011 with fgid and with either fructose or lactose intolerance as defined below and referred for specialist low-fodmap dietary advice were eligible for inclusion in this longitudinal observational study.

defined as peak 10 ppm.and a low-fodmap diet reduced urinary histamine release in a recent study.40 further investigation of the role of histamine and biogenic amines in fgid and the response to dietary and microbiome manipulation are clearly of interest as a possible contributing mechanisms.associations between symptoms and gas concentrations during breath testing and outcome of a low-fodmap dietsome symptoms provoked during breath testing were predictive of an adequate response to the low-fodmap diet by univariate analysis.

factors relating to patient demographics microbiome composition and metabolismand to the subtype of ibs may be associated with the response to a low-fodmap diet but no large-scale studies of response predictors have been published to the best of our knowledge.15 23 26 the ability to predict responders to the low-fodmap diet would not only allow rationalisation of resources and improved clinical care but also provide insights regarding possible disease mechanisms.we hypothesised that the chronic clinical symptoms as well as the type of symptoms provoked during breath testing but not the breath gas results would be associated with the efficacy of the low-fodmap diet.

patients with fructose or lactose intolerance consumed a low-fod- map diet and global adequate symptom relief was assessed after 6-8 weeks and corre- lated with pre-diet clinical symptoms and breath test results.resultsa total of 81 of 584 patients completing the low-fodmap diet achieved adequate relief without significant differences between fgid subgroups or types of intolerance.

differences in the fermentation of the monosaccharide fructose and the disaccharide lactose have been shown and the resident microbiome will be influenced by the type of malabsorbed sugar.47 there is indirect evidence for this in the significant positive association of outcome with peak methane production in fructose intolerancebut with both peak methane and hydrogen concentra- tions in lactose intolerance.methodological considerationsthe outcome of treatment studies in fgid is currently assessed by global relief scales related quality of life measures or by specific symptoms or groups of symp- toms.19 48 in this study we chose the global relief assess- ment as the broadest main outcome measure as changes in specific symptoms incompletely assess the impact of treatment in fgid or changes in quality of life.49 the study objective therefore was not to evaluate predictors of responsiveness of individual gi and non-gi symptoms to a low-fodmap diet which may have yielded differ- ent patterns.

responses may differ between studies based on the patient selection criteria although in a pre- vious large study we showed responses to a low-fod- map diet to be similar in patients with fructose or lactose intolerance with or without malabsorption.15 in this study only patients with lactose or fructose intoler- ance were included signifying that all patients per defini- tion had gastrointestinal symptoms during breath testing.

the association of peak methane levels and abdominal fullness during fructose breath testing with an adequate response to the low-fodmap diet indicates sensitivity to rapid intestinal distension possibly due to an osmotic effect with subsequent methanogenic fermentation by intestinal flora of fructose could be a trigger of symp- toms in fgid patients with fructose intolerance.

the main proposed mechanism of action of the low-fodmap diet has been a reduction in small intestinal malabsorption of osmotically active short-chain carbohydrates resulting in diminished intestinal water content and downstream effects on colonic fermentation and gas production.11 recently other factors such as alterations in the gut microbiome immune responses and sensation have been recognised as potentially relevant but their exact role in symptom response has yet to be fully eluci- dated.15 21 22consequently the selection criteria for the low-fodmap diet have also evolved from patients with malabsorption demonstrated by breath tests to patients with symptoms provoked by high doses of sugars to prac- tically all ibs patients without further testing.11 15 21-24despite the rising popularity of the low-fodmap diet certain limitations must be emphasised.
