However none of the symptoms provoked during breath testing were associated with dietary outcome in the multivariate analysis and as such these symptoms could not be used to independently predict the effect of dietary intervention in our cohort.Peak breath methane concentrations above the thresh- old of 10 ppm were associated with adequate dietary relief in fructose intolerance by both uni- trend and multivariate significant analyses indicating an indepen- dent association between methane production duringab012345Time h012345Time hFructose intolerance n  394Lactose intolerance n  2591-247 2315 291.003-5101 4927 521.19 0.58-2.450.636-859 2910 191.88 0.78-4.570.16OR odds ratio CI confidence intervals.fructose breath testing and dietary outcome.

The very favourable efficacy of the low-FODMAP diet in this study corroborates the results of earlier smaller studies with mixed groups of mainly IBS patients often including patients with malabsorption increased breath gas concentrations but not necessarily intolerance pro- voked symptoms during breath test.9-17 20 32 33Associations between clinical symptoms of FGID and outcome of a low-FODMAP dietChronic diarrhoea and pruritus emerged as the univari- ate predictors of a positive outcome of the low-FOD- MAP diet highly significant in FGID patients with fructose intolerance and a consistent trend in patients with lactose intolerance.

In patients with lactose intolerance similar nonsignificant trends in associations were seen with adequate dietary responses more common in patients with chronic diar- rhoea 1.79 0.91-3.54 P  0.092 and pruritus 2.080.90-4.80 P  0.086.Associations between breath test results and outcome of dietary programmeThe associations between provoked symptoms and exhaled gas concentrations measured during fructose and lactose breath testing and dietary outcome are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

There was no significant association between the cumu- lative number of symptoms experienced during breath testing with either fructose or lactose and the outcome of the dietary programme Table 5.Multivariate associations between clinical symptoms breath test variables and the outcome of dietary adaptationMultivariate analysis of the clinical symptoms breath test variables and the outcome of dietary adaptation ining 0.49 0.21-1.13 P  0.094.

Consequently we studied the predictive value of clinical symptoms and breath test results on the outcome of a low-FODMAP diet in a large cohort of patients with FGID and fructose or lac- tose intolerance in a single referral centre.PATIENTS MATERIALS AND METHODSAll successive patients referred to our gastroenterology practice by general practitioners between January 2008 and December 2011 with FGID and with either fructose or lactose intolerance as defined below and referred for specialist low-FODMAP dietary advice were eligible for inclusion in this longitudinal observational study.

Patients with fructose or lactose intolerance consumed a low-FOD- MAP diet and global adequate symptom relief was assessed after 6-8 weeks and corre- lated with pre-diet clinical symptoms and breath test results.ResultsA total of 81 of 584 patients completing the low-FODMAP diet achieved adequate relief without significant differences between FGID subgroups or types of intolerance.

Malabsorption was defined as an increase20 ppm in hydrogen or 10 ppm in methane levels over baseline twice in succession.15 Intolerance was defined as an increase 2 over baseline in our previously published symptom score index which is the sum of the intensities 0  none 1  mild 2  intense of abdominal disten- sion or bloating flatulence fullness nausea diarrhoea abdominal cramps borborygmi and gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms scored hourly concurrently with the col- lection of the breath samples.15 Additional non-GI symp- toms rated but not part of the symptom index were tiredness diminished concentration headache myalgia arthralgia palpitations oral aphthoid ulcers and skin rash.Dietary protocolAll patients shown to be fructose or lactose intolerant by breath testing were referred to the same experienceddietician for a standardised 4-week dietary adaptation based on published low-FODMAP diet guidelines.11 Patients received individual instruction by the dietician regarding a diet low in fermentable saccharides and polyols which was maintained for 3-4 weeks.

It is known and also evident from this study that the peak localisation of metabolism is more distal and the time to peak gas metabolite concentrations more delayed for lac- tose than for fructose.15 42 43 This difference in time to peak metabolism and absorption between fructose and lactose may explain the positive predictive association of dietary outcome with fullness a more proximal intestinal symptom with fructose intolerance and flatulence a more distal intestinal symptom with lactose intolerance.

Responses may differ between studies based on the patient selection criteria although in a pre- vious large study we showed responses to a low-FOD- MAP diet to be similar in patients with fructose or lactose intolerance with or without malabsorption.15 In this study only patients with lactose or fructose intoler- ance were included signifying that all patients per defini- tion had gastrointestinal symptoms during breath testing.
