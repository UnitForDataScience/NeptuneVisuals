Finally we examine the potential for nutritional interventions affecting the gut microbiota to reshape the T cell epigenome and address the inflammatory component of various diseases.Keywords gut microbiota epigenetics regulatory T cell T helper 17 cell inflammatory bowel diseases obesity type 2 diabetesiNTRODUCTiONImmune homeostasis is a complex process involving a wide variety of key immunological players.

The same miR cluster has further been reported to be critical for the differentiation of Treg withthe loss of miR-17-92 significantly affecting the accumulation of activated Tregs and their differentiation into IL-10-producing cells .FiGURe 2  epigenetic regulation of the T helper 17regulatory T cell Th17Treg balance by the gut microbiota.

miR-21 promotes Th17 differentiation and mediates the development of EAE as shown by the association between the defect in Th17 differentiation and the strong resistance to EAE in miR-21-deficient mice .

Given the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of immune functions notably in the control of Th17 cell and Treg differentiation it is not surprising that inflammatory diseases are linked to a substantial remodeling of the host epigenome in varioustissues  -.

microRNA-155 modulates Treg and Th17 cells differentiation and Th17 cell function by targeting SOCS1.

In a murine model of colitis the methyltransferase G9A has been identified as playing a key role in T-cell differentiation in particular by facilitating dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 supporting Th17 cell and Treg differentiation both in vivo and in vitro .

These alteration were mediated by the regulation of macrophageinfiltration and their regulatory rather than inflammatory polari- zation in the adipose tissue  confirming the effect of the gut microbiota on inflammation in metabolic diseases.Although it is clear that a link exists between the gut microbiota and the immune system this association is complex.

genetic deficiency in TLR1 and or environmental factors pathogens are present immune activa- tion and the resulting inflammatory process could contribute to altering IECs function and affect their secretory pattern resulting in a remodeling of the gut microbiota .The relationship between the gut microbiota and the immune system and in particular the Th17Treg balance is now well established.
