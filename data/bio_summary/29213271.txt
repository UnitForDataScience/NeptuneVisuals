Once acute sickness subsides depression-like behavior may ensue in which cytokine-induced HPA axis hyperactivity plays a particular role .Given the abundance of the gut microbiota  it is com- monly assumed that a large part of the circulating levels of LPS and related PAMPs derive from bacteria in the GI tract  and that the effects of intraperitoneally IP administered LPS replicate primarily the reactions to increased translocation of LPS from the gut lumen under conditions of enhanced mucosal permeability.

In concluding these novel aspects of immune-brain interaction are put into perspec- tive with disturbances of mental health that become manifest under conditions of stress and with emerging opportunities of therapeutic intervention.MULTiPLe COMMUNiCATiON PATHwAYS ALONG THe GUT-BRAiN AXiSThe communication network between GI microbiota mucosa endocrine system immune system and enteric nervous system on the one hand and the brain on the other hand uses at least five information carriers  gut microbiota-derived molecules immune mediators gut hormones vagal afferent neu- rons and spinal afferent neurons .

While we know many factors that govern the composition diversity and function of the gut microbiota we still lack a full comprehension of the signaling systems that govern the homeostatic interaction between the gut microbiota and the local immune system as well as the resilience of this homeostatic cross-talk.

Theyidentified Wntb-catenin signaling in gut endothelial cells as an important control mechanism which when downregulated may enable certain pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella typhimu- rium to enter the bloodstream .Although the list of identified chemical messengers derived from the gut microbiota is steadily increasing only a limited number of these molecules have been investigated in their effects on gut-brain and immune-brain signaling PAMPs such as LPS lipoteichoic acid LTA and peptidoglycan components SCFAs and 4-EPS .

Given that the BBB is essential for brain development function and homeostasis the control of BBB permeability is probably an important mechanism whereby the gut microbiota controls brain activity and behavior.immune Signaling via the vagus NerveAs alluded to before immune signaling from the gut to the brain can also take a neuronal route particularly via the vagus nerve.

Specifically the levels of peptidoglycan in the developing brain parallel the postnatal microbial colonization of the gut whilepeptidoglycan-sensing molecules TLR2 NODs PGRPs are expressed during early postnatal brain development and altered in response to perturbation of the gut microbiota .

Taken together with many other findings  it is thus emerging that gut microbiota and gut leakinessrepresent an important interface in the impact of stress on mood disorders.iMPACT OF iNTeSTiNAL iNFLAMMATiON ON BRAiN AND BeHAviORUlcerative colitis and Crohn's disease the two major manifesta- tions of IBD are associated with an increased risk of mental dis- orders and can be exacerbated by stress.

Therefore PYY GLP-1 and potentially other gut hormones emerge as targets for the control of GI inflammation pain and their relation to brain processes regulating emotion and affect.Gut Microbiota intestinal inflammation and Stress ResponsivityAn emerging interface between GI immune system GI inflam- mation and brain is posed by the gut microbiota and its multitude of signaling molecules.

Thus the impact of stress on the gut initiates a vicious cycle that is composed of both a brain-gut and gut-brain segment the two segments being con- nected in the gut via the microbiota-immune network .
