The honey bee colonies were then placed at six different locations in two landscape types in the southern UK on 2-4 April 2014 Figure 1 i farmland areas immediately adjacent to 5 m large 0.38 km2 oilseed rape OSR fields that were in flower and had been seed-treated with thiamethoxam Cruiser Syngenta Ltd. ii agricultural land distant to OSR Distant with the nearest OSR field boundaries being located1.25 km from hives and therefore little visited as average foraging distances are short 1.1 km during the OSR blooming period April- May Couvillon Schurch  Ratnieks 2014.

Both tests of abundance we used show that honey bee workers foraging on OSR farms had a lower rel- ative abundance of a dominant member of the bee gut community an Alphaproteobacteria species B. apis than bees not foraging on OSR.

Adult for- ager bees found on the exterior of the colony were sampled from each apiary just after peak OSR flowering time when workers at the OSR farms had been foraging and storing nectar and pollen from the OSR.

apis Kwong  Moran 2016 was higher in relative abundance in bees exposed to agricultural landscapes distant to OSR Distant than bees exposed to OSR farms OSR Table S2 Figure 2.

Using a cus- tom honey bee bacterial database of currently available genomes of bee gut bacteria we were able to assign 92 of the sequence reads to spe- cies level 99.93 to phylum level 98 to family and 95 to genus level and verify that the major previously identified taxa or strains were present in our data Neisseriaceae S. alvi Orbaceae G. apicola andF.

2014 however trends observed here in L. kunkeei and also A. adventoris re- quire further investigation as these species were represented in very low read numbers there was large read number variation in some sam- ples and we did not include the crop in our analysis of the gut.What do such differences in a bee's microbial community mean To date the most abundant gene function category Clusters of Orthologous Groups - COG found to be enriched in the honey bee metagenome in a metagenome sequencing study Engel et al.
