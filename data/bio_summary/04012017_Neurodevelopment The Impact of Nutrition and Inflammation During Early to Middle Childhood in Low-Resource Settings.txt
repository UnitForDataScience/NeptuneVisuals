findings related to socioemotional development were less clear primarily due to the small number of studies and differences in measurement of socioemotional development across differing ages.at least three mechanisms may link early stunting to development during early to middle childhood 1 biological insults that disrupt early brain development 2 delayed motor skills that may disrupt the exploration associated with cognitive development and 3 reduced expectations from parents and peers based on short stature.

so too has our knowledge of more functional aspects of brain development in the first 2 years of life largely due to advances in imaging tools suitable for young infants such as electroencephalography eeg event-related potential erp and functional near- infrared spectroscopy fnirs.1011 however there are enormous gaps in our knowledge of structural and functional brain development during the early and middle childhood periods for several reasons.first with the exception of the increasingly rare primate models of development rodent models do a relatively poor job of simulating human brain development during the preschool and elementary school years.

number of children enrolled as a percentage of the eligible population for both boys and girls increased from 21 in 1996-2000 to 67 in 2011- 2015.5 however access and retention continue to be concerns and the 2015 global monitoring report indicates that 58 million primary school-age children were out of school in 2015.4 in addition to low enrollment and attendance related to crisis and conflict distance and denial of access problems related to children's health and nutrition interfere not only with children's participation in primary school but also their ability to learn.key neurodevelopmental considerations during early to middle childhoodalthough the groundwork for brain development begins just a few weeks after conception and continues through the first postnatal years of life experience during middle and latejohn et al.page 3childhood can still exert a tremendous influence on changes in synapse number and myelin integrity as both processes continue to develop well beyond the first years of life.6 it is during this time that nutrition and inflammation for example can have a large impact on myelination and that exposure to multiple forms of adversity can impact the development of learning and memory circuits that reside in the medial temporal lobe e.g.

possible mechanisms include altered brain structure leptininsulin regulation oxidative stress cerebrovascular function blood-brain barrier inflammation and decreased motor performance associated with a degraded musculoskeletal system.17micronutrientsiodine--iodine deficiency disrupts production of thyroid hormones thyroxine t4 and triiodothyronine t3 which are necessary for neurogenesis neuronal migration synaptogenesis and myelination.1819 severe deficiency can cause goiter and intellectual disability and even mildmoderate deficiencies are associated with intellectual delays that can disrupt academic functioning.18 iodine supplementation trials appear to partially reduce the negative effects of iodine deficiency but ensuring adequate maternal iodine status prenatally can prevent iodine deficiency during the period of rapid brain development.18john et al.page 5zinc--zinc plays a critical role in central nervous system cns development specifically neuron formation migration and synapse generation.20 zinc is found in high concentrations in the hippocampus cerebellum pre-frontal cortex cortex and limbic system and animal studies have documented zinc's role in neurodevelopment.19 21 evidence from human supplementation trials has found positive associations between prenatal or infant zinc supplementation and motor development including processing speed and motor aspects of attention but not with measures of cognitive processing.21 one supplementation trial conducted among school-age children in china found beneficial effects of zinc supplementation on neuropsychological functioning when zinc was combined with other micronutrients 22 but trials of zinc supplementation alone among school-age children conducted in canada and guatemala found no effects on cognition or academic performance.

iron is necessary for myelination frontal cortex and basal ganglia development.28 in toddlerhood iron deficiency has been associated with impaired social-emotional behavior including shyness wariness and low responsivity.29 iron deficiency anemia in early infancy is a risk factor for impaired mental and motor development and has been associated with long-term negative functional consequences.19although the associations between iron deficiency and infant and child development are strong nutritional interventions early in life when children's rate of growth is rapid and nutritional demands are high have met with limited and inconsistent success either in alleviating nutritional deficiencies or in promoting early development.30 31 possible explanations for the limited findings are 1 the origins of iron deficiency may occur prior to conception or prenatally and postnatal interventions are too late 2 interventions may be most effective when targeted to deficient populations or 3 iron deficiency often occurs in the context of other micronutrient deficiencies leading to recommendations to focus on multiple micronutrient deficiencies.32john et al.page 6multiple micronutrientsmicronutrient deficiencies often co-occur especially when micronutrients are derived from common sources such as animal source foods.

this process is advanced in girls as compared to boys by one to two years consequently girls enter these events earlier and conclude sooner than do boys.89 thus even if children traverse the infancy period - a critical time for many aspects of brain development - various environmental factors can still impact brain development during later periods see figure 1.furthermore our understanding of the developmental sequence as well as the genetic and experiential contributions to brain development have grown tremendously over the past few decades.

neuroscientific evidence has documented the adverse and pervasive role of poverty on early brain development specifically on psychoimmunological functioning and self-regulation12 but there has been little attention to the combined effects of poverty and nutritional deficiencies on neurodevelopment.childhood stunting closely associated with poverty and a major threat to child development is often used as a population-based indicator to compare nutritional adequacy across countries.
