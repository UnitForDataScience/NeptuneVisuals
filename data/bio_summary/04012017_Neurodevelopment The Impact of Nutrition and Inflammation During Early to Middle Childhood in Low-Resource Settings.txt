Research in these key areas will be critical to the development of interventions to optimize the neurodevelopmental potential of children worldwide in the early to middle childhood years.IntroductionThe foundations of health and well-being stem from the interplay between genes and environment that begin as early as conception and extend through early and middle childhood ages 3-12 years.1 2 Children with adequate opportunities for early care and learning nutrition and protection from infectious and non-infectious causes of inflammation have the best chances of thriving.

Iron is necessary for myelination frontal cortex and basal ganglia development.28 In toddlerhood iron deficiency has been associated with impaired social-emotional behavior including shyness wariness and low responsivity.29 Iron deficiency anemia in early infancy is a risk factor for impaired mental and motor development and has been associated with long-term negative functional consequences.19Although the associations between iron deficiency and infant and child development are strong nutritional interventions early in life when children's rate of growth is rapid and nutritional demands are high have met with limited and inconsistent success either in alleviating nutritional deficiencies or in promoting early development.30 31 Possible explanations for the limited findings are 1 the origins of iron deficiency may occur prior to conception or prenatally and postnatal interventions are too late 2 interventions may be most effective when targeted to deficient populations or 3 iron deficiency often occurs in the context of other micronutrient deficiencies leading to recommendations to focus on multiple micronutrient deficiencies.32John et al.Page 6Multiple MicronutrientsMicronutrient deficiencies often co-occur especially when micronutrients are derived from common sources such as animal source foods.

Integrated interventions that combine nutrients with opportunities for responsive caregiving and early learning have been recommended36 and evidence suggests that trials that include both early education and nutrition are more likely to result in cognitive benefits than single intervention trials3738 but relatively few integrated trials or programs have been evaluated systematically.39 Table 1 provides a summary of key gaps in knowledge related to nutrition and neurodevelopment in early to middle child development.The Impact of Inflammation on Neurodevelopment During Early to Middle ChildhoodFetal exposure to maternal infection and inflammation may have long-term consequences well into early to middle childhood though these effects are more often studied during the infancy and adolescent periods.

Findings related to socioemotional development were less clear primarily due to the small number of studies and differences in measurement of socioemotional development across differing ages.At least three mechanisms may link early stunting to development during early to middle childhood 1 biological insults that disrupt early brain development 2 delayed motor skills that may disrupt the exploration associated with cognitive development and 3 reduced expectations from parents and peers based on short stature.

Children who have avoided early threats or who have emerged with relatively few negative consequences have often been protected by responsive caregiving.82 In a striking example at age 12 children raised in Romanian orphanages and randomized at 18-24 months to high-quality foster care showed stress responses marked by cortisol and parasympathetic nervous system reactivity that differed from children randomized to remain in the orphanages and approached responses expected of non-institutionalized children.83 The foster care group also continued to show better brain electrical activity measured by EEG as long as they remained in high-qualityJohn et al.Page 10foster care.11 This neuroscientific evidence provides support for early intervention programs that focus on responsive caregiving.Furthermore preprimary educational programs that include well-qualified personnel working with both parents and children can have beneficial effects on children's cognitive performance 84 and prepare children for primary school.85 Recent evidence has illustrated the beneficial effects of incorporating neurodevelopmentally-based teaching methods into preprimary classes particularly among children from low-income families.86 Skills often categorized as self-regulation e.g.

Charles A Nelson was a panelist at the original NICHD scientific meeting contributed to the writing of the initial manuscript reviewed and revised subsequent versions of the manuscript approved the final manuscript as submitted and is accountable for all aspects of the work.John et al.Page 2already identified e.g environmental factors and 7 studies on the effects of interactions between nutritional infectious and inflammatory factors on neurodevelopment in early to middle childhood.

Finally significant attention has been paid to malnutrition early in life with far less attention paid to inflammatory disease and the effects these two forms of adversity exert on older children particularly those with an early developmental history of malnutrition or illness.The Impact of Nutrition on Neurodevelopment During Early to Middle ChildhoodFood insecurity or inconsistent access and availability to a diverse safe and nutritionally adequate diet for an active life style a primary cause of nutritional deprivation is associated with poverty and may impact both the quantity and quality of available food contributing to lack of macro- and micronutrients.

The most common of these infections worldwide such as helminth infection diarrheal disease and malaria are typically most frequent in children under 3 years of age but the effects of infection in the younger years often lasts into early or middle childhood and infection does continue albeit with less frequency and severity through the latter period.Diarrheal disease in the first two years of life has also been associated with cognitive impairment in early to middle childhood in a number of studies notably from Brazil56-58 and Bangladesh.59 Other infections with well-documented effects on neurodevelopment in school age children include intestinal helminths60-63 schistosomiasis60 64 and malaria.65-69 Other than HIV none of these infections directly infect the CNS they all act through indirect mechanisms that are still poorly described yet likely involve inflammation.

Table 2 summarizes key gaps in knowledge related to inflammation and neurodevelopment during early to middle childhood.The Interaction of Nutrition Inflammation Neurodevelopment and Other Influencing Factors During Early to Middle ChildhoodInteractions between nutrition infection inflammation and environmental factors are clearly important in neurodevelopmental impairment in early to middle childhood.
