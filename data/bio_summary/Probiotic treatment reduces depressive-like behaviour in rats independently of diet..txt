Importantly MDD is associated with increased rates of dysmetabolic conditions including obesity and diabetes mellitus type II and this association may be partly caused by an unhealthy diet associated with MDD Interestingly it has been shown that diet has a major impact on the GM  and particularly a Western pattern high-fat low- fibre diet is associated with marked changes in GM composition and poor microbial diversity However it remains unknown whether a such diet interacts with the effects of probiotics.In the present study we therefore aimed at evaluating the effect of probiotic treatment on depression-related behaviour in rats on a control or high-fat diet HFD.

However some conceptual and mechanistical aspects need further elucidation.We therefore aimed at investigating whether the habitual diet may interact with the effect of pro- biotics on depression-related behaviour and further examined some potentially involved mechanisms underlying the microbe-mediated behavioural effects.Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control CON or high-fat diet HFD for ten weeks and treated with either a multi-species probiotic formulation or vehicle for the last five weeks.Independently of diet probiotic treatment markedly reduced depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test by 34 95 CI 22-44.

No diet x treatment interactions were found.DiscussionThe main finding of the present study is that probiotic treat- ment markedly reduced the level of depressive-like behaviour independently of diet.

Fixed effects included day and session BM time OGTT or analyte cytokines and their interactions with diet treatment and diett treatment.

Interestingly 4-EPS was recently found to be responsible for some of the aberrant behaviours associated with an autism-like phenotype in mice and the level of 4-EPS was simi- larly reduced by probiotic treatment Our results therefore urge for intensified research into these metabolites and their potential role in MDD.HFD markedly affected the plasma metabolome but nointeractions between diet and probiotic treatment were seen.
