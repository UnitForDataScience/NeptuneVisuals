importantly mdd is associated with increased rates of dysmetabolic conditions including obesity and diabetes mellitus type ii and this association may be partly caused by an unhealthy diet associated with mdd interestingly it has been shown that diet has a major impact on the gm  and particularly a western pattern high-fat low- fibre diet is associated with marked changes in gm composition and poor microbial diversity however it remains unknown whether a such diet interacts with the effects of probiotics.in the present study we therefore aimed at evaluating the effect of probiotic treatment on depression-related behaviour in rats on a control or high-fat diet hfd.

however some conceptual and mechanistical aspects need further elucidation.we therefore aimed at investigating whether the habitual diet may interact with the effect of pro- biotics on depression-related behaviour and further examined some potentially involved mechanisms underlying the microbe-mediated behavioural effects.forty male sprague-dawley rats were fed a control con or high-fat diet hfd for ten weeks and treated with either a multi-species probiotic formulation or vehicle for the last five weeks.independently of diet probiotic treatment markedly reduced depressive-like behaviour in the forced swim test by 34 95 ci 22-44. furthermore probiotic treatment skewed the cytokine production by stimulated blood mononuclear cells towards ifn''  il2 and il4 at the expense of tnfa and il6.

interestingly 4-eps was recently found to be responsible for some of the aberrant behaviours associated with an autism-like phenotype in mice and the level of 4-eps was simi- larly reduced by probiotic treatment our results therefore urge for intensified research into these metabolites and their potential role in mdd.hfd markedly affected the plasma metabolome but nointeractions between diet and probiotic treatment were seen.

false discovery rate correction was applied due to the measurement of 19 gene transcripts.bold values are significantly affected by diet or probiotics also noted with ds and ps.p significant effect of probiotic treatment.

a non-targeted plasma metabolomics analysis revealed that probiotics raised the level of indole-3-propionic acid a potential neuroprotective agent.our findings clearly support probiotics as a potential treatment strategy in mdd.

thirteen metabolites were found to be affected by probiotic treatment and three of these changes remained significantly dif- ferent after fdr correction interestingly two microbial tryptophan metabolites indole-propionic acid and indole-acrylic acid were upregulated by probiotics f136  16.4 p  0.001 and f136  13.5 p  0.001 respectively in addition to a metabolite related to amino acid metabolism namely acetylornithine urea cycle metabolite f136  143 p  0.0001. however no further changes in tryptophan or tryptophan catabolites kynurenine path- way metabolites were seen in animals on probiotics nor was any clear distinction between veh and pro groups evi- dent in the pca supplementary fig.
