preliminary examination of y. pestis proteomic data from a few un-related experiments using two standard laboratory strains the avirulent kimd27  and the virulent co92  suggested that protein abundance differences might provide a general signature of laboratory adaptation.we therefore took advantage of the archived data at the proteomics facility located at the wr wiley environmental and molecular sciences laboratory emsl at the pacific north- west national laboratory pnnl which has over a period of years performed mass spec- trometry-based proteomic analysis for numerous studies addressing diverse biological questions and targeting hundreds of different organisms  .

we therefore conclude that the analytical facility might have a small influence on the wild versus laboratory prediction when presenceabsence data was used.however in general the proteomic signature for laboratory adaptation is different from the signature for the laboratory facility.the fact that the proteomic data could be used to distinguish samples analyzed in the two different facilities is not altogether surprising.

the fact that the lasso selected features we had previ- ously identified as significantly changing during our laboratory evolution experiment suggests that the lrc is selecting real features in the data that distinguish wild strains from their labora- tory-adapted relatives.the lrc also selected some relative abundance and presenceabsence features that we did not observe to be significantly changing in the serial passage experiment likely reflecting the protein features selected to distinguish wild and laboratory-adapted y. pestis in the logistic regression classifier using relative protein abundance data.the final lrc also includes an intercept term of -0.0569 and optimal tuning parameters of l  0.0241 and t  0.5. see .ti shaded cells indicate proteins whose abundance changed significantly between the ancestor wild isolates and the descendant lineages in our previous study titi although this polypeptide was not identified by leiser et al  as significantly changing the b subunit of the same protein was identified.inclusion of the many additional genotypes culture media and growth conditions in the aggregated dataset.

it does demonstrate that adaptation to laboratory conditions involves broad changes in protein expression that can be used to classify samples as originating from wild or laboratory strains.

all of the wild isolates in this study as well as the virulent laboratory strain co92 belong to the molecular group 1.ori roughly corresponding to classical biovar orientalis the only molecular group endemic to the u.s. the avirulent laboratory strain kimd27  is a mem- ber of the molecular group 2.med and the classical biovar mediaevalis .

this result suggests that the changes in expression of these three proteins observed during our ear- lier serial passage experiment were likely an effect of prolonged growth in bhi and not a gen- eral response to laboratory adaptation.discussionwe have shown that a machine learning tool the lasso logistic regression classifier can suc- cessfully distinguish biomass from minimally-cultured wild strains of y. pestis and biomass of long-term laboratory strains using mass spectrometric proteomic data.

more broadly our work suggests it will be possible to mine public proteomic data repositories to extract information unrelated to the original intent of the experiments and thus extend the utility of such data.adaptation to laboratory growthit is important to emphasize that all of the cultures used in our study were grown in laboratory media and that the identity of the medium was not important in the classification of wild vs. laboratory-adapted strains.

our results suggest that protein abundance measurements might pro- vide a direct measurable signature of laboratory adaptation and could lead to faster more con- fident determinations without requiring the availability of matched environmental samples.the use of protein abundances to distinguish wild from laboratory strains requires addi- tional testing.

this dual approach mirrors standard practice in comparative proteomics where in addition to pro- teins with measurable quantitative expression differences proteins that are detected in only one experimental condition and therefore ineligible for a quantitative comparison are also consid- ered to be potentially differentially regulated.classifying wild versus laboratory-adapted samplesusing either the relative protein abundances or the presenceabsence indicators as features we developed logistic regression classifiers lrcs to distinguish between the wild and laboratory strains.

as in the classifier using relative abundance data glucose-6-phosphate isomerase presence was strongly predic- tive of laboratory adaptation while ail and sulfite reductase were strongly predictive of wild strains.testing the classifierthe lrc was very accurate in assigning wild or laboratory-adapted status to the samples using the replicated 10-fold cross-validation in which 90 of the data was used for training and 10 for testing in each replicate.

the presence of additional high-performing although larger feature sets high- lights that there is rich information present in proteomics data.as a final test of the lrc's ability to distinguish wild from laboratory strains we performed a permutation test  to determine whether the lrc had indeed identified a significant or real connection between the protein features and the strain laboratory-adapted or wild--as opposed to the relationship occurring by chance.

tests with numerous additional standard laboratory strains will be very important to confirm the general utility of the approach.validation would entail acquiring proteomics data on a large number of independent wild yersinia pestis samples including new wild isolates cultured in controlled conditions with no confounding variables and constructing a classifier with only some of the samples reserving some for a true external validation.

targeted assays mass spectrometric or immunological could then be developed for proteins selected by the classifier and measurements conducted on an even larger blinded set of new wild and laboratory-adapted samples and the statistical performance evaluated.ideally other studies would in parallel illuminate the underlying mechanisms by which organisms adapt to laboratory conditions the process of domestication of a wild pathogen involves genetically programmed regulatory responses and evolutionary changes probably including evolution of the regulatory networks themselves.
