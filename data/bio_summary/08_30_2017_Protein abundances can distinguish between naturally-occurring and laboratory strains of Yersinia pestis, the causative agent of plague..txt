We therefore conclude that the analytical facility might have a small influence on the wild versus laboratory prediction when presenceabsence data was used.However in general the proteomic signature for laboratory adaptation is different from the signature for the laboratory facility.The fact that the proteomic data could be used to distinguish samples analyzed in the two different facilities is not altogether surprising.

More broadly our work suggests it will be possible to mine public proteomic data repositories to extract information unrelated to the original intent of the experiments and thus extend the utility of such data.Adaptation to laboratory growthIt is important to emphasize that all of the cultures used in our study were grown in laboratory media and that the identity of the medium was not important in the classification of wild vs. laboratory-adapted strains.

It does demonstrate that adaptation to laboratory conditions involves broad changes in protein expression that can be used to classify samples as originating from wild or laboratory strains.

These samples were produced for diverse experiments studying effects of phenomena such as changes in growth medium presence of antibiotics temperature shifts Overview of the samples represented in the assembled data sets.Brain-heart infusionTiAdditional cultures of the wild isolates used in the serial passaging experiment were also grown in LB and TSB for this study they are not included in the 8 genotypes but are included in the 25 culturesLuria-Bertani brothSSTryptic soy brothPThe time cultures were grown prior to harvest was not always provided in the archived data some of the laboratory cultures may have been grown for different periods of time than those listedBest case scenario medium Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Mediummutations inactivation methods and laboratory evolution on the Y. pestis proteome.

This result suggests that the changes in expression of these three proteins observed during our ear- lier serial passage experiment were likely an effect of prolonged growth in BHI and not a gen- eral response to laboratory adaptation.DiscussionWe have shown that a machine learning tool the Lasso logistic regression classifier can suc- cessfully distinguish biomass from minimally-cultured wild strains of Y. pestis and biomass of long-term laboratory strains using mass spectrometric proteomic data.

Our results suggest that protein abundance measurements might pro- vide a direct measurable signature of laboratory adaptation and could lead to faster more con- fident determinations without requiring the availability of matched environmental samples.The use of protein abundances to distinguish wild from laboratory strains requires addi- tional testing.

This dual approach mirrors standard practice in comparative proteomics where in addition to pro- teins with measurable quantitative expression differences proteins that are detected in only one experimental condition and therefore ineligible for a quantitative comparison are also consid- ered to be potentially differentially regulated.Classifying wild versus laboratory-adapted samplesUsing either the relative protein abundances or the presenceabsence indicators as features we developed logistic regression classifiers LRCs to distinguish between the wild and laboratory strains.

The fact that the Lasso selected features we had previ- ously identified as significantly changing during our laboratory evolution experiment suggests that the LRC is selecting real features in the data that distinguish wild strains from their labora- tory-adapted relatives.The LRC also selected some relative abundance and presenceabsence features that we did not observe to be significantly changing in the serial passage experiment likely reflecting the Protein features selected to distinguish wild and laboratory-adapted Y. pestis in the logistic regression classifier using relative protein abundance data.The final LRC also includes an intercept term of -0.0569 and optimal tuning parameters of l  0.0241 and t  0.5.

As in the classifier using relative abundance data glucose-6-phosphate isomerase presence was strongly predic- tive of laboratory adaptation while Ail and sulfite reductase were strongly predictive of wild strains.Testing the classifierThe LRC was very accurate in assigning wild or laboratory-adapted status to the samples using the replicated 10-fold cross-validation in which 90 of the data was used for training and 10 for testing in each replicate.

The presence of additional high-performing although larger feature sets high- lights that there is rich information present in proteomics data.As a final test of the LRC's ability to distinguish wild from laboratory strains we performed a permutation test  to determine whether the LRC had indeed identified a significant or real connection between the protein features and the strain laboratory-adapted or wild--as opposed to the relationship occurring by chance.
