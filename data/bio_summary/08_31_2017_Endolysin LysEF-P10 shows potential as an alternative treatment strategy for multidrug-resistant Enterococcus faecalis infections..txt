In contrast in addition to killing their natural target E. faecalis several other reported E. faecalis phage lysins such as the amidase ORF9 of phage PhEF24C PlyV12 of E. faecium phage Ph1 IME-EF1 lysin EFAL-1 Lys168 and Lys170 reported to kill the related species E. faecium.

Other E. faecalis strainsand E. faecium strainswere also used to determine the bactericidal spectrum of LysEF-P10.Binding activity of LysEF-P10C-GFP and LysEF-P10B-GFP with E. faecalis.

For this reason there is an urgent need to develop new antibacterial agents to fight infections caused by multidrug-resistant E. faecalis particularly the vancomycin-resistant strains.Several studies have investigated the characteristics and therapeutic administration of E. faecalis phages.

Additionally it remains unknown whether in vivo administration of E. faecalis phage lysin affects the commensal E. faecalis that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract.

Although the E. faecalis strain used in the challenge differed between theprevious study and this study the lethal challenge dose of E. faecalis was similar.

As E. faecalis is the principal member of the genus Enterococcus this result indicates that the E. faecalis strain used in the challenge may be capable of entering and colonizing the gut.More importantly we found that when LysEF-P10 was administered the abundance of the genus Enterococcus in the faeces fell.

The acquisition of virulence factors and introduction of the bacterium to new areas of the body due to medical intervention have led to the designation of E. faecalis as a leading cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections worldwide.

The green fluorescence emitted by GFP at 488 nm was only observed for E. faecalis N10 cells treated with LysEF-P10B-GFP as shown in Fig.

The elimination of VREF E. faecalis E028 using LysEF-P10 was not affected by whether the mice were immunized with LysEF-P10.Moreover no side effects were observed when a large dose of LysEF-P10 5 mg was i.p.

The concentration of each protein was 20 ugml and E. faecalis N10 was adjusted to 108 CFUml.
