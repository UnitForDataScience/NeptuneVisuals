LANCL2 was first recognized as a mammalian receptor for abscisic acid ABA Downstream effects of LANCL2 and ABA have shown broad anti-inflammatory and metabolic activ- ity including modulation of calcium-dependent glucose transport and Akt pathways as well as the downregulation of inflammatory markers Recently a novel class of bis-benzimidazolyl- terephthalanilides BTTs has been discovered to bind to LANCL2 and promote beneficial effects in the context of inflammatory bowel disease the properties of which have been optimizedand assessed for toxicity As a result we seek to assess the ability of NSC61610 a BTT to reduce CDAD as an alternative to antibiotic therapy.However the need to co-administer standard of care antibiotics in addition to alternative therapeutics designed to in part promote commensal preservation in clinical trial settings may lessen their impact Additionally while important for the understanding of disease progression and pathologies the ability of animal models to independently predict the effectiveness of C. difficile treatments is questionable Notably in animal trials of anti-toxin antibodies the majority of the effectiveness was shown to be through anti- Toxin A antibodies The anti-Toxin B antibodies were thought to have little to no independent effect.

The non- responders to LANCL2 treatment had on average a 50 lower Treg to Th17 ratio compared to responders E. A smaller but simi- lar trend was observed within the quantity of commensal bacteria D however no trend was observable in C. difficile clearance between LANCL2 responders and non-responders F.

difficile infection increases disease severity and colonic inflammationTo assess the validity of LANCL2 as an important molecule in the immune response to C. difficile we infected both wild-type mice and mice deficient in LANCL2 LANCL2--.

Comparison between LANCL2 single parameter knockouts antibiotics and fecal microbiome transplantation D.Experimental validation LANCL2 ligand NSC61610 administration lessens clinical signs of disease and cellular markers of inflammationTo determining the viability of LANCL2 activation and sub- sequent immunoregulation as a C. difficile therapeutic option C57BL6 wild type mice were infected with C. difficile strainVPI10463 and a subset of infected mice was given 20 mgkg NSC61610 by gavage daily.

The novel plat- form has the potential to accelerate the development of novel immunoregulatory treatments for the infectious and immune- mediated disease.MethodsModel pipelineThe model pipeline  uses a previously calibrated and described tissue level model of C. difficile infection which is pub- lically available from the BioModels repository The fifteen most sensitive parameters from previous analysis were then re- calibrated to fit mouse model data corresponding to treatments that have progressed to the clinical trial stage.

The NSC61610 demon- strated a large reduction in neutrophils compared to the untreated infected group H. The NSC61610 group also displayed a significant reduction in the Th17 CD4 T cell population com- pared to the untreated infected group I.

difficile burden Recent advances in CDI treatment led to the development of alternative strategies that modulate the com- mensal microbiome such as fecal microbiome transplantation or administration of non-toxigenic C. difficile or directly influence the capability of C. difficile to induce inflammation such as anti-toxin A and B antibodies The success of these alternative treatments suggests that development of therapeutics with similar effect pro- files such as those targeting the activation of immunoregulatory pathways may find similar efficacy.Among the immunoregulatory pathways that may offer promise in the treatment of enteric pathogens like C. difficile is the LANCL2 0933-3657c 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The change in simulated neutrophil influx is shown as a representative quantity of immune activation effects A-D. As expected FMT treatment was predicted to have the largest effect on commen- sal bacteria regrowth while LANCL2 activation displayed lesser but similar beneficial effects E-H. Anti-toxin antibody treatment did not display major differences compared to standard antibiotic treatment.

Single parameter knockouts within LANCL2 treatment resulted in two noticeable shifts C. The first was the loss of an effect on commensal regrowth which varied along component 2.

The fecal microbiome transplantation lacking commensal regrowth had worsened recurrence F. Similarly the LANCL2 treatment lacking commensal regrowth had worsened recurrence I.
