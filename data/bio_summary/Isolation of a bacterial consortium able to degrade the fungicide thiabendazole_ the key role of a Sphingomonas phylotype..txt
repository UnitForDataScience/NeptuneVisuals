At the day of inoculation and 2 4 7 and 14 days later sub-samples from all treatments were collected to determine the degradation of TBZ and the composition of the consortium via 16S rRNA generRNA-DGGE and cloning.Samples of the antibiotic-treated consortium which main- tained their degrading capacity were sub-cultured in a fresh medium amended with the same antibiotic for four successive cycles.

Imazalil is not degraded by the TBZ- degrading consortium but it was preferred over succinate or glucose as an alternative C source control treatment since the latter compounds promote the non-selective proliferation of all the bacteria in the consortium and thus would have not allowed the identification of the key degrading member based on the increase in the abundance of their 16S rRNA gene.

The obtained sequences were edited and analysed for best match with the on-line BLAST.The capacity of the consortium to degrade structurally related chemicals to TBZInitially the capacity of the consortium to degrade compounds of similar chemical structure to TBZ like i the fungicides fuberidazole carbendazim and the main metabolite of the lat- ter 2-aminobenzimidazole and ii 1H-benzimidazole-2-car- boxylic acid 1H-benzimidazole-2-carboxamide and benz- imidazole previously identified as intermediate metabolites of TBZ in photodegradation studies EC  was tested.

Thus after 1 month of sub-culturing the consortium was able to completely de- grade TBZ in 7 days compared to the same consortium after 24 months of sub-culturing which degraded TBZ in 2 days Fig.

Karpouzas 1Received 15 October 2016  Revised 9 January 2017  Accepted 12 January 2017  Published online 2 February 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017Abstract Thiabendazole TBZ is a fungicide used in fruit- packaging plants.

We report the isolation via enrichment cultures from a polluted soil of the first bacterial consortium able to rapidly degrade TBZ and use it as a carbon source.

Denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE and clon- ing showed that the consortium was composed of a- b- and g-Proteobacteria.

LC-MSMS analysis verified that TBZ degrada- tion proceeds via cleavage of the imidazole moiety releasing thiazole-4-carboxamidine which was not further transformed and the benzoyl moiety possibly as catechol which was even- tually consumed by the bacterial consortium as suggested by SIP-DGGE.Keywords Thiabendazole .

The key degrading members of the consortium were identified with a multiphase approach including q-PCR denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE cloningand stable isotope probing SIP-DGGE.
