gvhd was classically identified as a th1-type disease due tothe high expression of cytokines such as ifn-g though subsequent studies also established a role for th2 and th17 cells which produce il-4 and il-17 and determine immune targeting for different organs.4647 as such a third stage links immune activation to effector cytotoxic functions of mediators as t cd8 cellswhich go on to induce direct damage to target cells and establish typical gvhd injury to organs as the liver skin and gut figure 1.354849conditioning regimens and initial dysbiosisgo tofew studies have addressed the impact of chemotherapy and conditioning regimens on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and shown a loss of clostridium cluster xiva and bifidobacteria and increased enterococcus during high-dose chemotherapy treatment.50-52 one study with focus on hct patients foundincreased levels of proteobacteria including escherichia species and reduced levels of firmicutes includingblautia species after chemotherapy.52 however the causal relationship between the chemotherapy and microbiota is hard to delineate because many of these patients received prophylactic antibiotics concurrently with the chemotherapy.the intestinal microbiota and gvhdgo toa normal and healthy intestinal microbiota is diverse and dominated by obligate anaerobic bacteria.1619from the time of admission to discharge from the hospital many hct patients lose this diversity and the changes that occur are influenced by antibiotic treatment as well as development of gvhd.53-55 an impactof the microbiota on gvhd development was first proposed in the 1970s when it was demonstrated that mice kept under germ-free conditions developed less gut gvhd.5657 these results were followed up by clinical studies that initially showed promising results for intestinal decontamination in hct patients5859 though later studies have not reproduced these benefits60-62 possibly due to varying success of thedecontaminating regimens.

the intestinal microbiota synthesize essential amino acids and vitamins and process otherwise indigestible components of our diet such as plant polysaccharides.7 a healthy and balanced intestinal microbiota also protects the host fromviral and bacterial infections by preventing colonization of pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract.89 theimportance and impact of the intestinal microbiota on health and disease has been increasingly revealed during the last decades and imbalances in the intestinal microbiota have been linked to obesity10 type 2 diabetes1112 irritable bowel syndrome13 and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.14 newinsights have been enabled by the development of molecular analysis methods ie 16s ribosomal rna sequencing15 that overcome the limitations of culture-based techniques in the identification of bacterialstrains.

in addition host mutations in the intracellular peptidoglycan receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing 2 nod2card15 have been associated with acute gvhd and worse survival after hct.75 interestingly this association was reduced in patients with gram-positivedecontamination suggesting the involvement of specific gut bacteria in gvhd.75 this was alsocorroborated by our group in an experimental allo-hct model where nod2-deficient mice showed increased gvhd and intestinal inflammation.76diversity loss gvhd and posttransplant infectionsgo tothe magnitude of intestinal diversity loss is a risk factor for treatment-related mortality trm including death from gvhd infections and organ failure after hct.77 in line with this weber et al showed that thelevel of urine 3-indoxyl sulfate in the urine a metabolite derived from indole produced by commensal bacteria can be used as a measure for the presence of an intact intestinal microbiota and that lower levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate correlated with higher trm rates and lower overall survival in hct patients.78 alongitudinal study of pediatric patients undergoing hct showed that it often takes over 2 months after transplantation to regain intestinal diversity.79 lost diversity and intestinal domination of opportunisticbacteria have also been shown to precede blood stream infection bsi by the same pathogen in hct patients.5580 as such some investigators are exploring alternative antibiotic prophylactic strategies thatmay better preserve patient flora and maintain gut homeostasis.

total-body irradiation is a common component of the conditioning regimen and is known to induce dose-dependent damage to the gut.37 inmouse models ionizing radiation causes direct damage to epithelial and endothelial cells and increased p53-mediated epithelial apoptosis.38 irradiation also induces enteric endothelial damage via induction ofplasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 pai-1 production which aggravates enteritis with crypt damage intestinal inflammation and fibrosis.3940 moreover these toxic effects may partially be mediated by the gut microbiota germ-free mice show reduced intestinal damage after radiation41 and broad-spectrumantibiotic treatment or deficiency in the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 myd88 a crucial adaptor for recognition of microbial molecules prevents crypt loss and reduces damage to progenitor and stem cells in mouse colon after high doses of radiation.42 the gut microbiota has howeverbeen shown to protect against dextran sodium sulfate-induced intestinal damage and to reduce damage after lower doses of radiation43 it is possible that the microbiota play different roles in the initiation of damage and the subsequent healing process.
