A plaque-forming unit PFU value between 5 x 109 to 5 x 1010 PFUmL for B. bacteriovorus and 5 x 108 to 5 x 109 PFUmL for M. aeruginosavorus was obtained when the final predator pellet was re-suspended in 1-2 mL of PBS solution toreach a final optical density OD600 of 0.2 - 0.02 for B. bacteriovorus and 0.1 - 0.02 for M. aeruginosavorus.

A previous study was also not able to detect B. bacteriovorus in the fecal and cecal contents of young chicks after oral administra- tion of predatory bacteria and an antacid signaling that exogenous B. bacteriovorus introduced into the gut environment may be short-lived.

In fact a study found B. bacteriovorus are present in higher abundance within the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals compared to patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Celiac disease and Cystic fibrosis.It was hypothesized that since B. bacteriovorus and M. aeruginosavorus are obligate Gram-negative preda- tors they would shift the abundance between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria over time.

To examine the effect of introducing predatory bacteria into the gut on host morbidity we inoculated 8.2 x 108 plaque forming units PFUrat of B. bacteriovorus 109J or 4.6 x 107 PFUrat of M. aerugi- nosavorus ARL-13 into the colons of two groups of Sprague Dawley SD rats 64 rats each via a rectal catheter 1.

To determine if predatory bacteria can cause detrimental histopathological effects within the colon histological examination of colon tissue was performed on the previously described SD rats inoculated with PBS B. bacteriovorus M. aeruginosavorus or K. pneumoniae sacrificed at three 24 48 hours or seven days post-inoculation.

Levels of IL-13 were slightly higher in rats inoculated with M. aeruginosavorus than with B. bacteriovorus at day seven possibly explained by the fact M. aeruginosavorus are epibiotic predators and are potentially more easily accessible by the immune response elements.

In this image Crystal Violet was inoculated to visualize where the inoculums would travel within the colon.control bacterial populations but also because evidence has suggested that B. bacteriovorus may actually contrib- ute to health by being a member of the healthy human gut microbiota.As B. bacteriovorus might not survive within the acidic environment of the stomach administering preda- tory bacteria through oral gavage would not allow us to assess the effect they would have within the colon.

B. bacteriovorus populations are governed by the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator oscillation where increases in B. bacteriovorus abundances are balanced by phenotypic resistance to predation by the prey.

However most studies focusing on predatory bacteria have been performed using in vitro methodologies and thus the full effect of introducing predatory bacteria into a live host has yet to be determined.The safety of administering predatory bacteria in vivo has already been examined in multiple animal models such as mice rats rabbits guinea pigs and chicks.
