the resulting peptides were designated as avbd1 nyh ssy and nyy and comparison of their killing ac- tivities indicated all to have antimicrobial properties against gram negative and positive bacteria associated with the chicken gut but with a hierarchy of nyh  ssy  nyy.cationic amps including the defensins are perceived as targeting bacterial membranes through electrostatic interactions and facilitating killing through permeation of the intact membranes causing pore formation and leakage of the intracellular content  while it is acknowledged that the in vitro ama profiles of the three avbd1 peptides reflected their linear forms this scenario probably reflected the physiological situation in vivo where the anaerobic environment of the gut par- ticularly the colon favours the reduced form of the pep- tide in vitro all three linear avbd1 peptides showed transition to an a-helical structure following ex- posure to an anionic environment which supported a classical pore-killing mechanism in which the a-helix lines up parallel to the membrane inserts into the bi- layer and disrupts membrane permeability leading to microbial cell death however using cd analyses the changes in peptide secondary structure between the peptide variants were similar and hence could not ex- plain the consistent observation that avbd1 nyh pep- tide was the most potent membrane permeabilising and killing agent.

hence the sole variant in lx has an amino acid sequence n10-y20-h32 denoted nyh the main variant in line ly has sequence ssy and the main variant in line z has sequence nsyy.anti-microbial activities of savbd1 'nyh' 'ssy' and 'nyy'peptidesthe amino acid changes underpinning the nyh nyy and ssy avbd1 variants did not significantly affect ei- ther the molecular weights 4645 4671 4568 da or net charges of the variants 7.8 7.7 7.7. to investigate the potential effects of the amino acid changes on func- tionality the antimicrobial properties of synthetic nyh ssy and nyy avbd1 peptides were compared using bacterial strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of commercially raised birds.the radial diffusion assay data although qualitative suggested a hierarchy of nyh  ssy  nyy against both gram negative and positive bacteria isolated from the chicken gi tract fig.

while the caecal microbiota data suggested the reduced abundance of lactobacilli in the microbiota of the day 4 lx compared to ly birds these data were not statistically significant and hence did not support the peptide as playing a role in gut health.the observations supporting the in vivo synthesis of three avbd1 peptides with different antimicrobial activ- ities appear to conflict with the chicken nk-lysin protein where the most potent antimicrobial form is favoured genetically .

these data sug- gested that the savbd1 nyh peptide was the most po- tent membrane permeabilising agent and supported a peptide hierarchy of nyh  ssy  nyy.avbd1 peptide secondary structureprevious studies focussed on ostrich defensins and nk- lysin linked membrane leakage properties and bacterial killing to peptide charge this could not be vali- dated for the three avbd1 peptides as their net charges were comparable.

to explore the impact of the avbd1 snps this study utilising synthetic peptides modelling avbd1 nyh ssy and nyy examined and compared the effects of the amino acid changes on the antimicrobial properties of the peptides.

however these data highlight the need for breeders to consider the im- pact of host defence molecules on the commensal as well as pathogenic populations in young birds as simply selecting for the most potent version of genes encoding peptides playing roles in innate immunity may not be beneficial commercially.abbreviationsama antimicrobial activity avbd avian b-defensin avbd1 avian b- defensin-1 ihc immunohistochemistry nyh asparagine tyrosine histidine nyy asparagine tyrosine tyrosine snp single nucleotide polymorphism ssy serine serine tyrosineacknowledgementswe acknowledge the support of bbsrc through grants bbh0186031 vla  cm bb15328451 ktn studentship kc and bbssm13127 studentship vla and a biosciences ktn phd top-up award to kc.

additionally f15 f31 and f7 provided interfacial hydrophobicity with phenyl- alanine residues shown previously by nmr to play key roles in the binding of a cationic peptides to a negatively charged membrane structural modelling also iden- tified distinct claw-like regions which have been sug- gested previously to play a key role in microbial membrane attachment the claw regions were more distinct in the nyh model and it is feasible in vivo that such structures are involved and key factors in its mem- brane attachment and permeating abilities.bioinformatics analyses of the avbds highlighted a number of positively selected sites that would mutate at a higher rate than expected for avbd1 these corresponded to snp2 ys and snp3 yh and the data presented herein supports these predictions.

following exposure of the peptides to 1 sds to model the anionic environment of the bacter- ial membrane an increase in a-helix content was ob- served for all three peptides although no significant differences in secondary structure were identified.avbd1 modellingto further investigate reasons for the differences in anti- microbial activities in silico modelling of the three vari- ant sequences was used.

.effects of avbd1 on membrane permeabilisationto further investigate the nyh  ssy  nyy antimicro- bial hierarchy the abilities of the three avbd1 peptides to permeabilise bacterial membranes were explored using artificial liposomes loaded with calcein dye.

uv circular dichroism was used to ex- plore whether the ama and permeabilisation data could be explained by changes in the secondary structure con- formations of the peptides following contact with thebacterial lipid membranes.

the cd spectra of the linear nyh nyy and ssy peptides in aqueous solution 10 mm phosphate buffer solution predicted mostly un- ordered structure but with some a-helix and b-sheet content fig.

linear amps have been shown to function directly through membrane pores but the actual mechanisms can differ with some peptides including lac- toferricin lfcin b associated with local rupture events prior to pore formation therefore in explaining the observed hierarchy of the avbd1 molecules it cannot be excluded that the presence and positioning of the avbd1 nyh nyy and syy amino acids supported novel rupture-like mechanisms.previous studies focussed on ostrich defensins and avian nk-lysin linked membrane leakage properties andhence microbial killing to peptide charge .

hence the necessity for intracellular pathogen killing has presumably driven the selection of the most potent nk-lysin agent.conclusionsthis study identified three non-synonymous snps in the avbd1 gene encoding the variant peptides nyh ssy and snyy that segregated into three lines of commer- cial broiler chickens lx ly and lz.

methods used for prediction of identities from the sequencing data were automated and involved using blastn against ribosomal databases data were formatted by ahvl to show percentage abundance of each identified genus in relation to the overall microbiome.immunohistochemistrya rabbit polyclonal antibody to avbd1 was produced by cambridge research biochemicals cleveland u.k. using the unique peptide antigen grksdsfrkngfc- amide and used in the ihc analyses.

the nyh  ssy  nyy killing pattern was observed for enterococcus faecalis although the bacteria were more sensitive to lower concentrations of the nyh peptide with 40 killing at 5mgml compared to 17 and 24 for ssy and nyy fig.
