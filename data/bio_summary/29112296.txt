Col- lectively these results demonstrate the beneficial role of TLR activa- tion so it is therefore plausible that the TLR2 and TLR26stimulation and the following NF-kB activation by live F. prausnitziimay cause its anti-inflammatory effects in the GI tract.The results of this research show that live F. prausnitzii induced higher NF-kB activation compared to dead bacteria and appear to con- flict with previous research showing inhibitory effects of F. prausnitzii on NF-kB activation Quevrain et al.

Live F. prausnitzii in apical anaerobic conditions activated TLR2 and TLR26 to a greater extent than dead F. prausnitziiBased on the results of the method development described above anaerobic 50 M199  50 BHI was chosen as apical medium when testing the effect of the three F. prausnitzii strains on TLR activation in the apical anaerobic co-culture model.The ability of live and UV-killed F. prausnitzii strains A2-165ATCC 27768 and HTF-F to activate TLRs TLR2 TLR26 and TLR4 was determined in conventional 5 CO2 in air atmosphere and apical anaerobic conditions.

DISCUSSION  Method developmentWe have successfully demonstrated that it is possible to adapt and perform the TLR activation assay in the apical anaerobic co-culture model while maintaining the viability of the TLR-expressing HEK293 cell lines.The main technical obstacle for performing the TLR activation assay in the apical anaerobic co-culture model was the pressure on the HEK293-TLR2-Luc cell layers when the inserts were transferred into the co-culture chamber.

A schematic of the apical anaerobic co-culture model usedfor the co-culture of HEK293-TLR-Luc cell lines with F. prausnitziiand photographs of the co-culture chamber are shown in Figure 1.Most of the parts of the co-culture chamber were autoclaved before each experiment.

The different effects on TLR activation between live and dead bacteria highlight the importance of using physiologically relevant co-culture models such asthe apical anaerobic co-culture model to decipher the mechanisms of action of live obligate anaerobes.

The effect of live F. prausnitzii on TLR activation was tested using the apical anaer- obic co-culture model and compared to the results obtained when testing dead bacteria that were killed in the presence of oxygen or through exposure to UV-light.

Further- more the TLR26 activation by live F. prausnitzii in apical anaerobic conditions was 2.2-fold higher than the TLR26 activation by live and UV-killed F. prausnitzii in conventional conditions.

The TLR activation induced by the three F. prausnitzii strains was normalised against the results obtained using the respective positive controls.Two co-culture chambers were used to perform the TLR activationassay in both conventional and apical anaerobic conditions.

Determining the activation of TLRs by bacteria from here on referred to as the TLR activation assay is a method to test theimmune-stimulatory potential of bacteria Anderson et al.

However the activation by live bacteria was only 1.1-fold higher than UV-killed bacteria therefore the difference was less than that seen in apical anaerobic conditions and may notbe biologically relevant.For the activation of TLR26 the interaction between the envi- ronment and livedead status was significant as shown in Figure 5b p  .001.
