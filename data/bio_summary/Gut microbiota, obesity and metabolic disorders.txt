farnesoid x receptor fxr is one of the main regulator of bile acid metabolic homeosta- sis and it is implicated in pathogenetic processresponsible for different metabolic disorders.56 fxr is mainly expressed in intestine andliver and its physiological ligands are repre- sented by a number of endogenous bile acids at various affinities.57its activity is mainly to regulate expression of genes involved in synthesis and transport of bile acids regulating enterohepatic circula- tion.58bile acid metabolism in intestine by gut mi- crobiota and in liver produces both agonists and antagonists for fxr receptors modulating biological role depending on intestinal micro- bial composition an increase of the prevalence of bile salt hydrolase produced bacteria lac- tobacillus bacteroides clostridium and bi- fidobacterium causes a decrease of intestinal tauro-b-muricholic acid t-b-mca amount a powerful fxr antagonist.59 60 activity block of fxr in experiments on animals was cor- related to a lower weight gain obtained by high fat diet if compared to wild-type mice as well as an increase of insulin sensitivity in leptin- deficient mice with an obob background com- pared with the obob mice expressing the wild- type fxr.61 62scfa introduced by diet or products de-rived from metabolism of intestinal microbial species have an effect in metabolic regulation.

over time the study on ip has gained the interest of many research groups highlighting the role that its increase could have in determining different metabolic disorders both in animal and human mod- els.40-42in a study by miele et al.

different studies highlighted the potential role in hunger control as well as of lipid and glu- cose metabolism through epigenetic regula- tion of enzymes involved in metabolic path- ways.63 64 moreover they have a biological effect through the link with g-protein-coupled receptors also known as free fatty acid recep- tor 2 and 3 ffar2 and ffar3 expressed in intestine and adipose tissue.65 66in a recent study on test animals lu et al.

pro- or anti-inflammatory ac- tivity of some food would be only in part their intrinsic property since in some cases it can be linked to the formation of bacterial metabolites which once absorbed in intestine carry out a local andor systemic action.23 in this regard dietary phospholipid phosphatidylcholine me- tabolism by bacterial enzymes causes the for- mation of trimethylamine tma metabolized by hepatic flavin monooxygenases to tma n- oxide which is able to stimulate macrophage activity and induce atherosclerosis a condition that could explain at least in part the higher cardiovascular risk in patients with both par- ticular dietary habits and intestinal microbial flora.24-26 the same diet can be able to trigger metabolic and inflammatory alterations as hap- pens in subjects who follow the western diet that is able to influence cytokine signaling has a direct action on immune cells and increases toll-like receptors tlr expression and intesti- nal permeability ip.27-30 this harmful dietary habit causes a modification in intestinal micro- bial composition as happens in cases of high fat diet related dysbiosis.31 32aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr is a tran- scription factor whose activity is regulated by a great number of dietary components and it modulates immune response.

the activation of the jnk promotes in- sulin receptor serine phosphorylation of insu- lin receptor substrate 1 resulting in impaired signal transduction into the cell and the inhibi- tion of intracellular glucose uptake.another important concept concerning ip increase is low grade bacteremia a condition that could precede the onset of low grade in- flammation in metabolic disorders a high-fat diet can induce intestinal dysbiosis and leaky gut syndrome to increase bacterial contact with intestinal surface thus allowing the passage of bacterial products or bacteria in toto in circu- lation.

the activation of in- flammatory systemic cascade through the pro- duction of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf-a il-1b plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 il-6 interferon- gamma ifn-g causes insulin resistance re- duction of adiponectin and increase of resistin which represent the triad that precedes type ii diabetes mellitus development.51therefore low grade bacteremia seems to precede insulin resistance and diabetes devel- opment and is supported by concomitant re- sistance to leptin able to modify the mecha- nism of hunger control in hypothalamus and to increase intestinal bacterial translocation thus worsening leaky gut syndrome.51several animal studies unveiled the possible modification of metabolic phenotype after the transfer of microbiota from obese mice to germ-free one.52 53moreover antibiotic therapy applied to high-fat fed mice with developed endotoxemia caused a decrease in its intensity through anincrease in intestinal integrity a decrease in levels of inflammatory markers and an im- provement in parameters associated with obe- sity and diabetes.54 studies on rats showed that the activation of the endocannabinoid cb2 receptor improves glucose tolerance and the blocking of the cb1 receptors demonstrated an effect that mimics the action of cb2 recep- tor agonists.
