Our study in conjunc- tion with the already published studies shows that a large scale well controlled study including control groups taking dopaminer- gic drugs and drug naive PD patients is needed to obtain detailed robust data about changes in the gut microbiota in PD.

Since a previous large study explicitly mentioned that COMT-inhibitors had an influence on bacterial counts  we performed an analysis without the four patients taking COMT- inhibitors which did not substantially change the results .Comparison to previous studiesFour previous studies that are in principle comparable addressed differences in the microbiota between PD patients andcontrols  .

We did not include another recently published study in the comparison because the bacterial nomen- clature used is not compatible with our study .ROC analysisTo explore the potential usefulness of microbiota analysis as a biomarker for PD we performed a ROC analysis.

The main weakness of our study is the low number of participants and the imbalanced gender distribu-Table 1Comparison of p-values of bacteria associated with PD in this study or in previous studies.

This study explores whether PD patients n  29 have gut microbiota differences com- pared to control subjects n  29 which might support a role of the gut microbiota in the PD pathophysiology.ResultsDemographics and Clinical dataTable A.1 contains detailed demographic and clinical data.

A significant increase of Lactobacillaceae in PD patients is in accordance with three previous studies while the fourth study provides no informa- tion on Lactobacillaceae  .

In our study PD patients did not report probiotic use or other dietary habits explaining the difference in Lactobacillaceae abundance.
