It is conceivable that this association may develop early in life as a result of biological processes catalyzed by the gut microbiota during infancy.Key words enterotypes gut microbiota TCI-125 temperament.INTRODUCTIONur bodies are colonized by trillions of bacteria collectively known as the microbiome which reside in many niches ofthe human body including the gut skin vagina and oral cavity 1.

Considering that there is a sensitive period in early life for the gut microbiota to affect the brain and behavior later in life 6 and that the HPA axis and neuro- transmitters including dopamine and serotonin play a role in deter- mining one's temperament 383637 our study results present the possibility that differences in stable temperaments between stable enterotypes may have formed during gut microbiota-temperament interactions in early life.Even though it has been suggested that temperament is genet- ically innate 10 some studies on the genetics of temperament have shown conflicting results.

On the basis of the GBA theory and our understanding of gut microbiota-brain development we pro- posed that some temperament differences between enterotypes may have formed in early life and that strong temperament tenden- cies which are known to be related to psychotic disorders may be alleviated during the period in which the gut microbiota is mallea- ble early in life.

 ORIGINAL ARTICLEThe Association Between Temperament and Microbiota in Healthy Individuals A Pilot StudyHojun Kim KMD PhD and Young-Jae Park KMD PhDABSTRACTObjective The purpose of this study was to examine whether enterotypes in the gut microbiome could be determined by clustering va- lidity indexes and whether these enterotypes were associated with individual differences in temperament traits.Methods Sixty healthy Korean participants 21 men 27.58.1years 39 women 34.514.3years were asked to answer 60 temperament questions novelty seeking harm avoidance reward dependence and persistence from the Korean version of the Temperament and Char- acter Inventory-125.

Together with their contributions to physical health gut microbiota also contribute to mental health and the communication system that integrates the brain and gastrointestinal system including the gut microbiome is known as the gut-brain axis GBA 3.

Considering the relationship between the gut microbiota and brain development it is possible that temperament which refers to certain tendencies in re- action to emotional stimuli 7 is associated with the development of the gut microbiota.

For maturation of temperament and the gut microbiota modulation of some proteins including synaptophysin and PSD-95 stress hormones including corticosterone and neuronal circuits Temperament and Microbiota related to neurotransmitter activity by the gut microbiota may affect the brain and behavior 6.

Considering the gut microbiota-temperament interaction excessive temperament characteristics may be partly modulated during the malleable period of the gut microbiota.In this pilot study we showed that enterotype structure in healthy Korean adults was consistent with those used in previous studies.

Finally the differences in temperament between enterotypes were examined.Results There was no significant effect of sex or age on gut microbiota and temperament scores.

The no- tion of the stability of the gut microbiota structure was extended and the following three enterotypes were proposed according to their dominant OTUs Bacteroides Prevotella and Ruminococcus 1.
