We tested the fol- lowing hypotheses within a tropical forest in Panama the degree to which soil nutrients mediate leaf dynamics production reten- tion and enemy damage varies substantially among co-occurringtree species the degree to which foliar bacteria mediate leaf dynamics varies substantially among tree species and interactions among soil nutrients and foliar bacteria will be frequent thereby mediating leaf dynamics among co-occurring host plant species.

Thus when any single species increases in abundance its per cap- ita growth rate slows relative to growth rates of other species which aids in species coexistence Chesson 2000.

We applied 125 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as urea 50 kg P ha-1 yr-1 as triple super-phosphate and 50 kg K ha-1 yr-1 as KCl.Study speciesWe selected five common and relatively shade tolerant woody species from five different families these species vary in life his- tory traits and spanned a wide range of maximum adult heights.

We chose to use MANOVAs because all five species were nested within the N P and K treatments and MANOVAs allowed us to avoid pseudo- factorialism by adjusting for correlated response variables among species Morrison 1976 Morin 1983 Winer et al.

It is important to note that c. 10 seedlings died during the entirety of the experiment and mortality did not differ among tree species or nutrient or antibiotic applications.The impacts of macronutrients on leaf dynamics separate from the effects of antibioticsLeaf production For three species N and K interacted to cause increases or decreases in leaf production by 55-88 Tables 1 2 Fig.
