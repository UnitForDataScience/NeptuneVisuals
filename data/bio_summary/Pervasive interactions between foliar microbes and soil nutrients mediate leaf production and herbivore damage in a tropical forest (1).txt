thus future studies should address the interactions among microbes herbivores and plant hosts in species- rich ecosystems where enemy pressure is substantial.implications for plant diversity maintenance and niche differentiationstudies have demonstrated that increased soil nutrient availability decreases realized niche space of co-occurring species yet it remains uncertain whether soil nutrients alone can maintain hyper-diversity of plant species in tropical forests e.g.

n addition alone decreased leaf retention for all four species sig- nificant for three or four but this decrease disappeared or was even reversed desmopsis when n and p were added together n 9 p interactions tables 1 2 fig.

we tested the fol- lowing hypotheses within a tropical forest in panama the degree to which soil nutrients mediate leaf dynamics production reten- tion and enemy damage varies substantially among co-occurringtree species the degree to which foliar bacteria mediate leaf dynamics varies substantially among tree species and interactions among soil nutrients and foliar bacteria will be frequent thereby mediating leaf dynamics among co-occurring host plant species.

here we went one step further to measure the impacts of these interactions on leaf production and retentionleaves occur within the first few weeks of leaf expansion coley  aide 1989 kursar  coley 2003 reviewed by coley  barone 1996. moreover it is important to point out that plants infected with foliar pathogens may suffer reduced performance yet often show no visible symptoms reviewed by griffin  car- son 2015. for example pseudomonas tomato a plant pathogen can decrease tomato leaf production by as much as 30 without showing any sign of infection bashan  okon 1981. indeed we found that antibiotics or their interactions with nutrients caused no differences in foliar pathogen damage yet caused increases in leaf production by up to 140. thus our results lead us to suggest that high nutrient tissue concentrations partic- ularly for n and k together and n and p together may com- monly make host plants more vulnerable to plant enemies.

1a as did adding n alone but adding both k and n together did not cause an additive increase in leaf production significant n 9 k interaction fig.

we reduced foliar bacteria with antibiotics for 29 months and measured leaf production retention and damage for seedlings nested within a replicated 15-yr factorial nutrient enrich- ment experiment nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k.our results demonstrate that when we applied antibiotics soil nutrients - particularly n - always regulated seedling leaf production and to a lesser extent herbivore damage for all five tree species.
