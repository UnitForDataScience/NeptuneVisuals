The absence of shift in milk microbiome may indicate that microbial communities are dynamic and an antimicrobial induced dis- turbance of the milk microflora could be reversed by the time that cows started a new lactation i.e.

The only difference found in our beta diversity were the effects of time in our analysis of similarities suggesting that stage of lactation might a more important factor influencing milk microbiome composition than the use of antibiotics at dry off.ConclusionUse of dry cow therapy based on a standalone teat sealant without mastitis resulted in a similar incidence of mastitis somatic cell count bacterial culture bacterial load and milk microbiome than cows assigned to receive teat sealant with antibiotic.

At the time of enrollment Dry off there were no differences P  0.47 in somatic cell count scores between cows assigned to receive antibiotic ceftiofur hydrochloride with teat sealant ATS score 2.6 n 36 cows and cows receiving the teat sealant alone TS score 2.5 n 36 cows.

The major losses caused by mastitis include reduced milk production discarded milk premature culling reduced conception rates and cost with therapy-.New bacterial infections occur more often during the dry-off period than in any other time points during the lactation.

However the effects of using dry cow therapy with teat sealant alone or with antibiotics on milk microbiome and bacterial load have not been investigated.Therefore the aims of this study were to compare the effects of dry cow therapy with and without antimicro- bial on milk microbiome and bacterial load in cows diagnosed as negative for mastitis at dry off.ResultsDescriptive Evaluation of Mastitis Incidence Somatic Cell Count and Bacterial Culture.

The findings of the study revealed that milk microbiome cure rates and bacterial load did not shift with the treatment of mastitis suggesting that microbial infections in the mammary gland might not necessarily benefit from antimicrobial use.Investigation of dry cow therapy without antibiotics effects on mammary gland pathogens and its co-inhabitant microbes are necessary to elucidate mastitis pathogenesis AMR and the feasibility of implement- ing programs to reduce antimicrobial use in dairy cows.

Dry cow therapy based on teat sealant without antibiotics can be used with no detrimental impacts on milk microbiome and bacterial load in cows with a healthy mammary gland.Mastitis is the most prevalent disease and the primary cause of economic losses in dairy cows.

In the present study only healthy cows were used thus the results in milk microbiome shift could have been different if cows with mastitis were also included.
