We will test the hypothesis that prophylactic azithromycin is effective through its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in preventing worsening of lung function and in reducing exacerbations in chil- dren and adolescents receiving ART who have HIV- associated chronic lung disease.MethodsdesignStudy designBREATHE Bronchopulmonary function in response to azithromycin treatment for chronic lung disease in HIV- infected children is a two-site double-blind placebo- controlled individually randomised trial in which we intend to enrol 400 perinatally HIV-infected children and adolescents aged 6-19 years with HIV-associated chronic lung disease who have been receiving ART for a minimum of 6 months.

Importantly no asso- ciation was observed between abnormal lung function ART use or duration or CD4 count suggesting that this form of HIV-related chronic lung disease may not be responsive to ART.OB is a chronic obstructive lung disease that follows a severe insult to the lower respiratory tract resulting in fibrosis of the small airways The most common presentation is the post-infectious variant closely related to severe viral infection in the first 3 years of life It is also seen in the context of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell HSC and lung transplant recipients as a re- sult of a graft-versus-host reaction HIV is asso- ciated with both high incidence of respiratory infections and persistent immune activation despite ART - Thus HIV-associated OB may share causal pathways with both post-infectious and post-transplant variants.Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment modal- ities in OB is sparse.

Pre-specified effect modification analyses will include site and baseline se- verity of lung disease.Sample size and powerThe following assumptions were made to calculate the sample sizeMean FEV1 z-score of -2.04 in the control groupPatients randomised in equal proportions to the two regimensUp to 25 of participants unassessable owing to loss to follow-up death or suboptimal spirometric tracesNo change in FEV1 z-score in the control armDifference in the trial arm mean FEV1 z-scores ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 an effect assumed to be of clinical relevanceSD ranging from 0.55 to 0.82 to assess the impact of variability on the difference in mean value the study has power to detectUnder these assumptions a sample size of 400 recruited participants and 300 participants with outcome data 25 unassessable based on previous studies of Zimbabwean children will enable 80 power to detect a difference in trial arm means ranging between 0.17 and 0.23 an effect size difference in meansSD of 0.32 Fig.

Our group has investigated bronchodilators and short course high-dose steroids in patients withchronic lung disease who are receiving ART and isoniazid preventive therapy with no suggestions of benefit per- sonal communication T. Mwalukomo.Whereas in the pre-ART era lymphoid interstitial pneu- monitis LIP was the most common cause of chronic lung disease studies in the ART era show that OB is the most likely underlying cause with LIP being an excep- tional finding.
