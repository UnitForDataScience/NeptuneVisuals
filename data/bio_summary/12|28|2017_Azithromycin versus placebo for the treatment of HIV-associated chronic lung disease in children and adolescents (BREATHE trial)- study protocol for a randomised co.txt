long-term azithromycin for indigenous children with non-cystic-fibrosis bronchiectasis or chronic suppurative lung disease bronchiectasis intervention study a multicentre double-blind randomised controlled trial.

we will test the hypothesis that prophylactic azithromycin is effective through its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in preventing worsening of lung function and in reducing exacerbations in chil- dren and adolescents receiving art who have hiv- associated chronic lung disease.methodsdesignstudy designbreathe bronchopulmonary function in response to azithromycin treatment for chronic lung disease in hiv- infected children is a two-site double-blind placebo- controlled individually randomised trial in which we intend to enrol 400 perinatally hiv-infected children and adolescents aged 6-19 years with hiv-associated chronic lung disease who have been receiving art for a minimum of 6 months.

unblinding of treating physicians will be carried out in case of preg- nancy or other events after decision by the dsmb.outcome measuresthe primary outcome is the mean difference between trial arms in fev1 z-scores generated using global lung function initiative reference standards between trial arms at 12 months after initiation of the study drug adjusted for site and baseline fev1 z-score.

pre-specified effect modification analyses will include site and baseline se- verity of lung disease.sample size and powerthe following assumptions were made to calculate the sample sizemean fev1 z-score of -2.04 in the control grouppatients randomised in equal proportions to the two regimensup to 25 of participants unassessable owing to loss to follow-up death or suboptimal spirometric tracesno change in fev1 z-score in the control armdifference in the trial arm mean fev1 z-scores ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 an effect assumed to be of clinical relevancesd ranging from 0.55 to 0.82 to assess the impact of variability on the difference in mean value the study has power to detectunder these assumptions a sample size of 400 recruited participants and 300 participants with outcome data 25 unassessable based on previous studies of zimbabwean children will enable 80 power to detect a difference in trial arm means ranging between 0.17 and 0.23 an effect size difference in meanssd of 0.32 fig.

the study drug will be dispensed by the study pharmacist.

cri- teria for stopping the study drug are allergic reaction qtc prolongation  500 milliseconds hepatic toxicity with alt  80 iul concomitant use of drugs known to produce qtc prolongation pregnancy during the course of the study and any adverse reaction with daids sever- ity grade  3. in case of any serious adverse events the institutional review boards and the data and monitoringsafety board dsmb will be notified.

importantly no asso- ciation was observed between abnormal lung function art use or duration or cd4 count suggesting that this form of hiv-related chronic lung disease may not be responsive to art.ob is a chronic obstructive lung disease that follows a severe insult to the lower respiratory tract resulting in fibrosis of the small airways the most common presentation is the post-infectious variant closely related to severe viral infection in the first 3 years of life it is also seen in the context of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell hsc and lung transplant recipients as a re- sult of a graft-versus-host reaction hiv is asso- ciated with both high incidence of respiratory infections and persistent immune activation despite art - thus hiv-associated ob may share causal pathways with both post-infectious and post-transplant variants.evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment modal- ities in ob is sparse.
