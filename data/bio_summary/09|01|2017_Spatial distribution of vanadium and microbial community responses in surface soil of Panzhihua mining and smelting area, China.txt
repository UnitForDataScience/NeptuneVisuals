therefore it is urgent to investigate thetable 1physicochemical properties of original soil samples in panzhihua region china.table 2total vanadium content in the soil in panzhihua region and previously reported vanadium-contaminated area.influences of vanadium contamination on soil ecosystems espe- cially on microbial communities in panzhihua region.fractions of chemical speciation for vanadium in the soil sam- ples were illustrated in .

although the sequencing reads for every cultivated soil sample decreased if compared with the corresponding original soil sample the amount of otus increased in the cultivated soil samples which is reflected by the rarefaction curves of the mi- crobial species richness in all soil samples fig.

however little is known about the influence of vana- dium on soil microorganisms including bacteria and fungi although they have vital functions in soil ecosystems  .to fill the knowledge gaps a study on the spatial distribution of vanadium in surface soil as well as its influence on microbial communities was performed in panzhihua region southwestern china.

obviously the vanadium concentration in all collected soil samples from panzhihua region exceeded the soil vanadium background value 82 mg kg1 in china and also the mean soil vanadium content 103 mg kg1 in northern england .

it was reported that vanadium distributed abundantly in air water and soil in panzhihua region due to the intensive mining and smelting activities implying soils in this area were polluted by vanadium .specifically surface soil samples from different processing stages of vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite in panzhihua mining and smelting area were collected to analyze the distribution and morphology of vanadium.

each jar was inoculated with 100 g collected soil samples and 150 ml simulated groundwater with vanadate and nutrients which contained the following components per liter c6h12o6 0.7500 g nh4cl 0.1557 g kh2po4 0.0299 g kcl 0.0283 g cacl2 0.2464 g mgcl26h2o 1.0572 g nahco30.8082 g and navo3 0.1795 g. the medium was refreshed every 3 d and the total incubation period was approximately 240 d. all the incubation experiments were carried out at room temperature 22 - 2 oc.chemical analysisthe soil samples were air-dried at room temperature and sieved through 2 mm mesh before further analysis.

specifically ph was measured in dissolved soil with a ratio of soil to deionized water of 12.5 wv the content of om was quantified by k2cr2o7-volu- metry and tn was determined by semi-micro kjeldahl method.

total genomic dna from 10 soil samples was extracted by fastdna spin kit for soil oiagen ca usa according to the manufacturer's instructions.

hierarchical cluster analysis was performed by using vegan package of r .results and discussionvanadium distribution and speciation in soil samplesthe vanadium concentration varied greatly in soil samples fromdifferent manufacturing locations  displaying as smelting  waste dump  concentrator  tailing reservoir  mining plant.

the mining roasting and dumping processes generated lots of dusts which eventually caused the increase of vanadium in the soil through nature weathering processes such as drying and rewetting  .remarkably average vanadium concentration in smelting area 4793.6 mg kg1 was highest among all the soil samples collected in panzhihua region and was also significantly higher than all previous reported vanadium-contaminated areas .

additionally differences in species rich- ness and diversity among the five cultivated soil samples were not as obvious as the original ones implying cultivation with the same substrate induced the convergence of bacterial communities  .the dominant phyla of bacterial communities in soil sampleswere present in .

interestingly bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were prevalent in all the five original soil samples but bacteroidetes were not retrieved in any cultivated soil samples suggesting that they were sensitive to vanadium toxicity as reported before  .

an example in this study was there were less actinobacteria in co-1 than that in the other 4 cultivated samples most likely because there were not much actinobacteria in the inoculated sample co-0.influence of vanadium on bacterial communitiesthe similarities and differences of bacterial communities for five original soil samples were visualized by hierarchical cluster anal- ysis at genus level a. specific bacterial genera were discussed to interpret their ecological roles in soil ecosystem.
