For example the anaerobic environment of both ponds shared a stimulus response of metabolic processes governed by chemoorganotrophic bacte- ria while the aerobic environment for the FFTaged appeared more selective with the inclusion of chemolithotrophic bacteria capable of metabolizing iron and sulfur.In conclusion the presented results demonstrate that GI treatment of fresh and aged oil sands FFT leads to a positive shift in the microbial community development with time.After GI treatment a significant stimulation p  0.05 of natural hydrocarbon degraders i.e.

Within this group the Ferruginibacter genus was highly stimulated as a result of GI treatment within the aerobic FFTaged system which could represent an important bio-indicator for healthy wetland es- tablishment and increased potential for reclamation toward constructed wetlands.Species from Gammaproteobacteria were stimulated as a result of GI treatment irrespective of tailings material but were more dependent on anaerobic conditions with Enterobacter and Pseudomonas demonstrating higher relative abundance within G samples.

Higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes observed in G samples along with the physiological activities of this group is a possible response to the change or breakdown of com- plex hydrocarbons.Previously studies regarding microbial communities harbored in oil sands tailings material tended to focus at the phylum and class taxa levels   .

The significant in- crease p  0.05 in their relative abundance within G samples suggests that GI may have putatively degraded hydrocarbons of the systems and presumably created more bioavailable car- bon for microbes to degrade even further.The effects of GI treatment on the Deltaproteobacteria community showed distinct differences for both fresh and aged FFT materials under anaerobic conditions.

The complexity of micro- bial community structure in oil sands tailings is an important consideration and there is a need for a detailed systematic study which links the governing physical and chemical pro- cesses with the microbial ecology of the system.

This research provides an enhanced understanding of oil sands tailings biogeochemistry and the impacts of GI treatment on microorganisms as an effect for targeting toxic organics.

Although it has been reported that continual biodegradation reduces the concentra- tion of these compounds the extraction process releases them from the oil deposits and they become concentrated in the tailings ponds typically in the range of 40-120 mgL  .Due to their amphipathic characteristics NAs are capable of disrupting the lipid structure of cell walls and causing death by narcosis  explaining the toxic effect severity of NAs to living organisms in the environment.The degree of toxicity however varies with age of oil sands process-affected material OSPM as changes in NA fraction components over time are thought to be related to changes in toxicity .
