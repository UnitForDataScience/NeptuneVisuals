within this group the ferruginibacter genus was highly stimulated as a result of gi treatment within the aerobic fftaged system which could represent an important bio-indicator for healthy wetland es- tablishment and increased potential for reclamation toward constructed wetlands.species from gammaproteobacteria were stimulated as a result of gi treatment irrespective of tailings material but were more dependent on anaerobic conditions with enterobacter and pseudomonas demonstrating higher relative abundance within g samples.

for example the anaerobic environment of both ponds shared a stimulus response of metabolic processes governed by chemoorganotrophic bacte- ria while the aerobic environment for the fftaged appeared more selective with the inclusion of chemolithotrophic bacteria capable of metabolizing iron and sulfur.in conclusion the presented results demonstrate that gi treatment of fresh and aged oil sands fft leads to a positive shift in the microbial community development with time.after gi treatment a significant stimulation p  0.05 of natural hydrocarbon degraders i.e.

increased presence of ferruginibacter suggests the microbial component of aerobic fftaged g samples holds high potential for this direction of reclamation.fftfresh anaerobic and aerobic microbial developmentwithin the anaerobic fftfresh system three genera were sig- nificantly stimulated as a function of gi treatment desulfuromonas pseudomonas and pontibacter table .

the significant in- crease p  0.05 in their relative abundance within g samples suggests that gi may have putatively degraded hydrocarbons of the systems and presumably created more bioavailable car- bon for microbes to degrade even further.the effects of gi treatment on the deltaproteobacteria community showed distinct differences for both fresh and aged fft materials under anaerobic conditions.

from a chemical biological and treatment perspective stp represented a fresh tailings pond early in development relative to the aged p1a tailings pond.

this research provides an enhanced understanding of oil sands tailings biogeochemistry and the impacts of gi treatment on microorganisms as an effect for targeting toxic organics.

1 community composition of bacterial phyla a proteobacterial classes b and bacteroidetes classes c within fftaged and fftfresh in both anaerobic left and aerobic right conditions based on otu relative abundance illustrating temporal differences as a function of gi treatmentsignificant p  0.05 differences between g- and g samples at the phylum level were the greater proportion of bacteroidetes at the expense of reduced proportions of proteobacteria in g samples.

the gi process appeared to have stimulated this group at nearly all sample time points p  0.05. higher relative abundance of bacteroidetes observed in g samples along with the physiological activities of this group is a possible response to the change or breakdown of com- plex hydrocarbons.previously studies regarding microbial communities harbored in oil sands tailings material tended to focus at the phylum and class taxa levels   .

therefore it makes sense that the aerobic fftfresh system would show no long-term stimulatory effect as a result of the gi treatment because a strict anaerobic community can- not tolerate the presence of oxygen regardless.comparative assessment of microbial response to gi between fresh and aged fftthe microbial assemblages of fftfresh and fftaged appeared to show significant differences p  0.05 between g- and g samples over time figs.
