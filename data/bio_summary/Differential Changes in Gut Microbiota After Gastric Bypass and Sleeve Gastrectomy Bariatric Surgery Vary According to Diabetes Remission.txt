c. A significant increase in Roseburia intestinalis species was seen after diabetes remission achieved by both RYGB and SG surgery.Effects of RYGB and SG on Gut Microbial Fermentation Capacity Changes in functional capacity of gut microbiota indicated by KO and KEGG pathways were different among those achieving diabetes remission after RYGB vs SG.

Metformin therapy is associated with altered gut microbiota  and has been linked with increased short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria .Proton-pump inhibitor therapy is also linked with altered gut microbiota among RYGB patients .We aimed to compare changes in gut microbiota among patients with T2D undergoing RYGB or SG and to identify whether any gut microbiota changes associated with diabetes remission after both surgeries.MethodsPatients Faecal samples were collected from the first 14 pa- tients with obesity and T2D who were randomized to RYGB or SG as part of a double-blind clinical trial in New Zealand in the week prior to surgery and 1 year later.

Differential Changes in Gut Microbiota After Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy Bariatric Surgery Vary According to Diabetes RemissionRinki Murphy 1  Peter Tsai2  Mia Jullig3  Amy Liu4  Lindsay Plank5  Michael Booth6Published online 13 October 2016 Springer ScienceBusiness Media New York 2016AbstractBackground It is unclear whether specific gut microbiota is associated with remission of type 2 diabetes T2D after distinct types of bariatric surgery.Aims The aim of this study is to examine gut microbiota changes after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass RYGB or sleeve gastrectomy SG surgery in obese patients with T2D.Methods Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of DNA fragments using Illumina HiSeq2000 was obtained from stool samples collected from 14 obese T2D patients pre- operatively while on very low calorie diet and 1 year after randomisation to laparoscopic SG n  7 or RYGB n  7.

While there are differences between SG and VBG both these procedures maintain the length of the gastrointestinal tract in contrast to RYGB.We found an increase in gut microbiota diversity after RYGB but not after SG.Overall RYGB resulted in increases in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and a decrease Bacteroidetes phyla while SG resulted in an increase in Bacteroidetes phyla.

The primary outcome of this study is to determine whether RYGB or SG is more effective in achieving remission of diabetes defined as HbA1c  6  42 mmolmol without the use of diabetes medication at 5 years .

KEGG Orthology and pathway anal- ysis predicted contrasting and greater gut microbiota me- tabolism changes after diabetes remission following RYGB than after SG.
