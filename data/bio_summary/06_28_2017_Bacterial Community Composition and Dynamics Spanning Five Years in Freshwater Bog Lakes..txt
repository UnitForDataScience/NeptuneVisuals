Our primary goals for this data set were to census members of the bog lake bacterial community and to identify taxa that are core to the bacterial community of bog lake ecosystems.

Two of the goals of this study were to determine the core bacterial community of bog lakes in general and to determine if the mixing regime affects core community membership.

We hypothesized that the mixing regime structures the bacterial community leading to an association between mixing frequency and alpha and beta diversity in bog lakes.

The observed association between mixing frequency and richness suggests that water column mixing or one or more covarying environmental parameters structures the bacterial community.Clusters of community composition.

Our data supported these results and suggest that these trends are indeed linked with mixing regime as we included multiple lakes of each type sampled over multiple years in this study.Our results support previous research on the characteristics of bacterial communi- ties in the epilimnion and hypolimnion and the association of lake mixing frequency with community composition.

The sampling sites are located near Boulder Junction WI and were chosen to include lakes that represent the three mixing regimes corresponding to polymictic multiple mixing events per year dimictic two mixing events per year usually in spring and fall and meromictic no recorded mixing events conditions .

This shows that the amounts of variability in the bacterial community differ by site as well as by year.The core community of bog lakes.

Additionally these systems may be ideal for addressing some of the core questions in microbial ecology such as how community assembly occurs how interactions between taxa shape community composition and how resource partitioning drives the lifestyles of bacterial taxa.To address these issues and more we continue to collect and sequence samples for the North Temperate Lakes Microbial Observatory and we are expanding our sequenc- ing repertoire beyond 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of long- term multisite observations as analyzing only a single year of data or one lake would not have allowed us to describe the dynamics and composition of these freshwater bacterial communities to the extent presented here.IMPORTANCE Lakes are excellent systems for investigating bacterial community dy- namics because they have clear boundaries and strong environmental gradients.

Understanding the drivers and controls of bacterial communities on long time scales would improve both our knowledge of fundamen- tal properties of bacterial communities and our ability to predict community states.
