The heatmap of the KEGG terms associated with serum glucose and lipids was constructed by R software.To estimate the contribution of gut microbiome to the variation of serum glucose and lipids a 100x cross-validation was performed as described by Fu et al.. For each analysis the data set was randomly split into a 70 discovery set and a 30 validation set.

However how much the gut microbiome contributes to the variance of serum glucose and lipids is largely unknown.

Here we carried out a 16S rRNA gene based association study between cecum microbiome and the concentration of serum glucose and lipids in 240 Chinese Erhualian pigs.

We identified tens of bacterial taxa associated with serum glucose and lipids.

The pathogenic bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria showed significant associations with increased serum lipid levels while the bacteria Lactobacillus and Bacilli had negative correlations with serum lipids.

Cross-validation analysis revealed that 23.8 variation of serum glucose and 1.66.0 variations of serum lipids were explained by gut microbiome.

The results provide meaningful information to get insight into the effect of gut microbiome on serum glucose and lipid levels in pigs.Serum glucose and lipids are important indicators for the condition of body metabolism.

Abnormal concentra- tions of blood glucose and lipids are associated with various kinds of chronic diseases such as obesity diabetes as well as cardiovascular diseases.

However these genetic variants together account for only 25-30 of phenotypic variation of blood glucose and lipids which suggests that a big puzzle remains to be explored.Mammalian gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem and composed of thousands of heterogeneous microbial species.
