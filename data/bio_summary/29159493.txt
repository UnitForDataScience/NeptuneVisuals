In fact the Lethocerus microbiota similar to that of the other bugs studied had among the lowest bacterial diversity in our data set.To summarize the organisms studied herein were exposed to the same environmental bacterial reservoir reflected by a high proportion of OTUs shared among the different groups.

e Venn diagram showing the number of bacterial OTUs exclusive to and shared by the intestinal microbiota of tadpoles vs. all invertebrates studied and f among the four main groups of invertebratessimilarities in scratching biofilms and algae from surfaces.

All groups had substantial numbers of exclusive bacterial operational taxonomic units OTUs in their guts but also shared a high proportion of OTUs probably corresponding to transient environmental bacteria.

These bacterial taxa are repro- ductive parasites  which might explain why they were uncommon in the intestinal tract of the analyzed species.Phylogenetic diversity PD and number of OTUs were highest in the snail samples intermediate in tadpoles and lowest in the four groups of aquatic insects Fig.

Although tadpole intestinal microbiotas differ among host species  they are also influenced by ecological factors such as aquatic environment and temperature  .Here we examine the intestinal bacterial community of tadpoles in direct comparison to intestinal microbiotas of strictly syntopic aquatic invertebrates insects and gastro- pods to better understand the degree of specialization in the composition of tadpole microbiotas.Fieldwork was carried out in Itape Rio Claro municipality Sao Paulo state Brazil 22.32618 S 47.712576 W. Specimens were collected opportunistically by dipnetting on 12 and 23 April 2016 in a single small pond 6 m in diameter taken to the lab in water from the original water body and processed within 12 h of capture.

On the other hand all sample groups also had a substantial number of exclusive bacterial OTUs in their guts Fig.

All sample groups shared a high number of OTUs suggesting that a significant proportion of the OTUs found might be transient environmental bacteria.

Tukey- Kramer pairwise tests revealed significant differences for both metrics P  0.05 for all pairwise comparisons of tadpoles and snails with major groups of insects but not among insect groups or between snails and tadpoles.Microbial composition and structure differed distinctly among groups PERMANOVA weighted Unifrac Pseudo- F  4.8279 p  0.001 unweighted Unifrac Pseudo-F  4.5562 p  0.001.

Animal guts may contain host- adapted core microbiota as well as a flexible environmentally modulated microbial pool plus transient environmental bac- teria  and the proportion of these components may differ among major host groups  .Amphibians stand out among vertebrates for their biphasic life history and in particular the anuran tadpole stands out as aElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article  contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

The differences found among groups in their gut microbiota appear to be predominantly shaped by diet and feeding mode with smaller but important host-specific effects.
