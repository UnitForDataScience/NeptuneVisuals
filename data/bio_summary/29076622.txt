To generate amore complete picture of the bacterial species and func- tional diversity we aimed to collect an extensive set of gut isolates from 60 bumblebees belonging to four Bombus species to accurately identify all isolates to the species level and to analyse their functional potential.ResultsMicrobial diversity of the bumblebee gutA total of 1940 isolates was collected from gut samples of 60 bumblebees representing four Bombus species Sup- porting Information Table S2.

2016.In conclusion in the present study we collected 1940 isolates from gut samples of 60 bumblebees representing four Bombus species and demonstrated that the bacterial species diversity in these Bombus species exceeded that suggested by phylotype analysis through 16S rRNA ampli- con sequencing.

The bacterial species diversity in these Bombus species exceeded that suggested by phylotype analysis through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and revealed that B. pascuorum and B. terrestris had a unique microbiota composition each.

A major fraction of the species isolated n 5 21 consisted of LAB and bifidobacteria.To evaluate if all predominant taxa were isolated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed on gut samples pooled according to bumblebee species.

Prevalence of isolated microbial species per bumblebee species analyzed.

If a species was represented by several MALDI-TOF MS clusters the number of clusters is given next to the species name.VC 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley  Sons Ltd Environmental Microbiology 20 214-227216 J. Praet et al.Table 1.

1 indicate that yeast species can be quite prevalent in the bumblebee gut and that a proper evaluation of the yeast diversity and of their functional role is mandatory.Our data demonstrated that the bacterial species diver- sity of the bumblebee gut is underestimated.

Several phylotypes detected through 16S rRNA amplicon sequenc- ing consisted of multiple species four novel Gilliamella species Gamma-1 A. mensalis Bacteroidetes and L. bombicola Firm-5Lacto-1 were first isolated in the course of the present study Praet et al.

the percentage of bumblebees from which a particular microbial species was isolated per bumblebee species results.
