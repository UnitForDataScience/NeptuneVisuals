although higher diversity trends were observed in the nasopharynx in the summer compared to the winter these associations were largely due to decreased alpha diversity among women compared to men in the winter wilcoxon signed-rank test richness p  0.03 shannon index p  0.002 and evenness p  0.001 respectively additional file figure s1b.

in the seasonal analyses the summer samples for both the nasal vestibule and the nasopharynx had lower euclidean distances compared to their respective winter samples wilcoxon signed-rank test nasal vestibule p  2.2 x 10-16 and nasopharynx p  2.2 x 10-16 reflecting moresimilar microbiome diversity between pairs of individuals in the summer than in the winter.

the correlation between kinship and euclidean distance remained significant nv p 1x 10-4 and np p  5.0 x 10-4 indicating that the signifi- cant effect of kinship on microbiome similarities between hutterite adults is not likely due to shared envi- ronments.
