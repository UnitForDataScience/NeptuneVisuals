Moreover Euclidean distances for the same individual paired with himherself between seasons separately within the nasal vestibule and nasopharynx samples and between nasal sites separately within the summer and the winter samples were lower than the respective distances calculated between each individual with all other individuals Wilcoxon signed-rank test nasal vestibule between seasons p  9.25x 10-8 nasopharynx between seasons p  3.97x 10-12 summer between nasal sites p  2.2x 10-16 winter between nasal sites p  2.2 x 10-16 Additional file Figure S3.

Additionally there was higher diversity in the nasopharynx in the summer compared to the nasal vestibule in the summer paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test richness p  4.6 x 10-7 Shannon index p  0.009and evenness p  0.031 respectively.

Although higher diversity trends were observed in the nasopharynx in the summer compared to the winter these associations were largely due to decreased alpha diversity among women compared to men in the winter Wilcoxon signed-rank test richness p  0.03 Shannon index p  0.002 and evenness p  0.001 respectively Additional file Figure S1B.

In the seasonal analyses the summer samples for both the nasal vestibule and the nasopharynx had lower Euclidean distances compared to their respective winter samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test nasal vestibule p  2.2 x 10-16 and nasopharynx p  2.2 x 10-16 reflecting moresimilar microbiome diversity between pairs of individuals in the summer than in the winter.

In this analysis PCoA showed clear dissimi- larities between the NV and the NP in the summer PC2 p  2.2 x 10-16 ANOSIM p  9.9 x 10-5 R  0.24 Fig.

This analysis revealed a significant negative Spearman correl- ation between kinship and beta diversity NV p 1 x 10-4 NP p  4.0 x 10-4 Fig.

The correlation between kinship and Euclidean distance remained significant NV p 1x 10-4 and NP p  5.0 x 10-4 indicating that the signifi- cant effect of kinship on microbiome similarities between Hutterite adults is not likely due to shared envi- ronments.

Overall bacteria with identified mbQTLs in this study q  0.10 had higher estimates of SNP heritability than the remaining tested bacteria Wilcoxon signed-rank test NV p  0.009 NP p  0.05.mbQTL associations with multiple bacteriaFive mbQTLs q  0.05 including the PGLYRP4 mbQTL discussed above had associations with multiple bacteria within the same nasal site at a relaxed significance thresh- old q  0.10.

The RA of 12 genera in the nasal vesti- bule and 15 in the nasopharynx differed by season after applying a Bonferroni correction paired Wilcox rank- sum test p  0.0003 nine of which were different be- tween seasons at both nasal sites Additional file Table S1B C. Similarly we looked for genus level RAs that differed between the nasal sites within each of the two seasons n  72 for the summer and 60 for the winter but did not identify statistically significant differences Additional file Table S1D E.Table 1 Sample composition a total of 332 samples were collected from 144 58 male 86 female Hutterite adults age 16 to 78 yearsNasal microbiome diversityWe used three diversity metrics to assess within sample alpha diversity for each of the four seasonal nasal site groups--the number of species richness Shannon index and evenness.
