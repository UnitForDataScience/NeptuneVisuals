to study the role of gp96 in papc function we generated cd11c cell-specific gp96-deficient mice by crossing our hsp90b1floxflox mice with cd11c-cre miceabbreviated as ko mice hereafter.

cd11c cell specific gp96-deficient mice cd11ccrehsp90b1floxflox and control littermates cd11ccre-hsp90b1floxflox were generated by crossing our hsp90b1floxflox gp96 is encoded by hsp90b1 mice with cd11c-cre transgenic mice.

given the fact that cd11c cell-specific gp96 ko mice have reduction of treg cells in the gut and are unable to mount oral tolerance we decided to closely monitor ko mice for signs of spontaneous intestinal inflamma- tion and abnormalities.

our cd11c cell-gp96 ko mice thus represent one of the rare models of spontaneous colitis.cd11c cell-specific gp96 ko mice produce high levels of iga.

we have thus successfully generated conditional gp96 ko mice with selective deletion of gp96 in dcs.

taken together we demonstrate that the mice with deletion of gp96 in cd11c papcs have altered cd4 t cell distribution withreduction of treg cells and corresponding increase of inflammatory th1 cells underscoring the importance of gp96 in dc biology fig.

.we have previously generated several lineage-specific gp96 ko mice to delineate the contribution of gp96 and its clientele in host defense including lysm-cre for macrophages cd19-cre for b cellsand cd4-cre for t cells.

one future direction is to define the source of various inflammatory cytokines in our novel ko mouse model in an effort to fully elucidate the pathogenesis of colitis due to dc-selective ablation of gp96.finally it is unclear if the loss of tolerance in cd11c-specific gp96 ko mice is due to abrogation of some important client proteins of gp96 such as cd103.

consistent with gp96 chaperone function deletion of gp96 from cd11c cells resulted in decreased surface expression of cd11c a known gp96 client fig.

p  0.05.collectively our work suggests a following instructive model for the roles of gp96 in cd11c cells in maintaining tolerance step one gp96 expression is required for differentiation of cd103 tolerogenic dcs step two cd103 tolerogenic dcs primes antigen-specific treg cells via gp96-dependent manner step three treg cells blunts the appearance of inflammatory th1 cells in the gut step four gut tolerance is accomplished.we have shown that gp96 ko dcs failed to respond to stimulation by tlr2 tlr4 and tlr9 ligands in vitro fig.

future study may need to dissect specific clientele of gp96 in dcs to complete the whole picture on the roles of gp96 in regulating tolerance in vivo.in summary our study for the first time demonstrated that cd11c cell-intrinsic gp96 is essential for main- taining gut tolerance and prevention of colitis.

to examine if our ko mice have alterations of these two subsets we isolated immune cells from mesenteric lymph node mln and clp from both ko mice and their wt littermates and performed comparative analysis.

interestingly we found that t-bet t cells th1 were significantly increased in ko mice compared with wt littermates while rorgt t cells th17 remained the same between wt littermates and ko mice fig.

in brief 8-12 week old ko mice and wt littermates were fed with 1 ova in drinking water for 3 days followed by adoptive transfer of 5 x 104 cfse labelled naive ova-specific cd4 t cells isolated from ot-ii t cell receptor transgenic mice.

based on several standard histopathological changes including degree of infiltration by neutrophils mucosal damage and loss of goblet cells we found clear evidence of moderate colitis in the entire colon of ko mice but none in the wt mice fig.
