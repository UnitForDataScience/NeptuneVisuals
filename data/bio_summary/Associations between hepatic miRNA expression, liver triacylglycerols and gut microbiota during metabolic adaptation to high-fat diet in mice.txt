.Together these data show that 1 in vitro bacterial anti- gens control hepatic miRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner and 2 in vivo hepatic miRNA expression is asso- ciated with liver triacylglycerol content during gut microbiota dysbiosis.Hepatic miRNA expression is significantly associated with liver triacylglycerol content and with Firmicutes and B. acidifaciens relative abundance during metabolic adaptation to HFD feeding in miceThe hepatic expression of miR-181a miR-666 and miR-21 was studied in our model of metabolic adaptation to HFD.

.In summary these data identify that Firmicutes Proteobacteria and B. acidifaciens of the gut microbiota cor- relate with hepatic triacylglycerol content during metabolic adaptation to HFD feeding in mice.Bacterial antigens drive hepatic miRNA expression in vitroGut microbiota dysbiosis can drive liver disease  miRNA are known modulators of liver pathophysiology  and the gut microbiota modulates miRNA expression .

Since the severity of hepatic disease is characterised by specific microRNA miRNA signatures and the gut mi- crobiota is a key driver of both hepatic disease and miRNA expression we analysed the expression of three hepatic miRNA and studied their correlation with hepatic triacylglyc- erol content and gut microbiota.Methods Two cohorts of C57BL6 4-week-old wild-type WT male mice n  62 and n  96 were fed an HFD for 3 months to provide a model of metabolic adaptation.

Hence based on the adaptation of both mice and microbes to a fatty environment a divergent metabolic phenotype may arise as we also recently reported with regard to cardio-metabolic adaptation to HFD in mice .From a molecular perspective miRNA represent promising molecules that may link gut microbiota dysbiosis to metabolic outcomes.

Conclusionsinterpretation We propose the involvement of hepatic miRNA liver triacylglycerols and gut microbiota as a new triad that underlies the molecular mechanisms by which gut microbiota governs hepatic pathophysiology during met- abolic adaptation to HFD.Keywords Gut microbiota .

Thus we further confirm our previous findings from an analy- sis of hepatic gene expression during metabolic adaptation to HFD in mice reinforcing the reproducibility of the animal model used in this study .Specific bacterial groups in the gut microbiota are associated with hepatic triacylglycerol content during metabolic adaptation to HFD feeding in miceWe previously demonstrated that a specific gut microbiotathat Bacteroidetes showed a non-significant correlation with liver triacylglycerol content Fig.

Therefore we tested whether liver triacylglycerol content was associated with both gut microbiota and hepatic miRNA expression in a mouse model of metabolic adaptation to an HFD.

.In summary hepatic miRNA expression is associated with both variations in liver triacylglycerol content and specific taxa of the gut microbiota during metabolic adaptation to HFD Fig.

5 Hepatic miRNA expression analysis and correlation with liver triacylglycerols and gut microbiota during metabolic adaptation to HFD in mice.

With regard to miRNA expression there was less variation in miR-181a expression between models suggesting this miRNA did not undergo metabolic adaptation and that there was no link with liver triacylglycerol levels Fig.
