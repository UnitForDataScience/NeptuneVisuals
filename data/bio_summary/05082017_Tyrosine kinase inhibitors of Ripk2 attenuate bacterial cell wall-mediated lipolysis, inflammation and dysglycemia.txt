certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis inhibit ripk2 in both macrophages and adipocytes thereby suppressing lipolysis reducing inflammation and attenuating poor glucose control dysglycemia caused by bacterial cell wall components.how tkis could contribute to metabolic inflammation because only tkis with a reported inhibitory effect on ripk2 attenuated inflammation and lipolysis in response to nod1 but not tlr4 activating ligands.it is important to understand how immune pathways underpin tki-induced changes in glycemia because inflammation can promote insulin resistance and dysglycemia.

our results show that ripk2 is required for nod1-mediated inflammation and dysglycemia and that certain tkis such as gefitinib block bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan-induced inflammation and lipolysis in adipocytes and inflammation in macrophages fig.

cxcl1 and il6 were quantified by elisa from rd systems denver co. for insulin signalling following 1 h pre-incubation with 5 mm gefitinib and 48 hour treatment with 10 mgml fk565 adipocytes were stimulated for 10 minutes with 100 nm insulin and washed twice in ice-cold pbs.

when cells reached 80 confluence differentiation was induced by incubating with complete culture medium containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine 0.25 mm dexamethasone 10 mgml insulin and 2 mm rosiglitazone for 48 hours day 0 to 2 and then changed to complete culture medium containing only 10 mgml insulin for 48 hours day 2 to 4. complete culture medium containing only 10 mgml insulin was replaced every 48 hours and experiments were performed on adipocytes he differentiated for 8-12 days.

specific peptidoglycan motifs promote metabolic tissue inflammation lipolysis and insulin resistance via nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 nod1.

because of the recognized contributions of dyslipidemia and inflammation to insulin resistance we sought to test if tki-mediated inhibition of ripk2 could attenuate nod1-induced impairments in insulin signalling in adipo- cytes.

inflammation can participate in insulin resistance during chronic obesity but is dispensable for short-term diet-induced insulin resistance.

these results show that gefitinib inhibits nod1-ligand but not lps-induced inflammation in adipocytes.gefitinib attenuates bacterial cell wall-mediated insulin resistance in adipocytes.

we extend these findings to metabolic cells such as adipocytes and show that gefitinib only inhibits nod1-ligand but not tlr4 ligand-induced inflammatory and metabolic responses.even within ripk2-dependent pathways we have previously shown divergence in the nod1 versus nod2-mediated effects on obesity-related metabolic inflammation and dysglycemia .

.we previously showed that injection of nod1 ligands casused acute insulin resistance and dysglycemia in mice.
