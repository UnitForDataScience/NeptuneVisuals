Certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs inhibit RIPK2 in both macrophages and adipocytes thereby suppressing lipolysis reducing inflammation and attenuating poor glucose control dysglycemia caused by bacterial cell wall components.how TKIs could contribute to metabolic inflammation because only TKIs with a reported inhibitory effect on Ripk2 attenuated inflammation and lipolysis in response to Nod1 but not Tlr4 activating ligands.It is important to understand how immune pathways underpin TKI-induced changes in glycemia because inflammation can promote insulin resistance and dysglycemia.

Based on the relation between acute Nod1 signalling and prominent features of metabolic disease and the ability of TKIs to inhibit Ripk2 we hypothe- sized that 1 Ripk2 was required for Nod1-mediated immunometabolism effects 2 TKIs that inhibit Ripk2 would lower Nod1-ligand induced lipolysis inflammation and dysglycemia.

Our results show that Ripk2 is required for Nod1-mediated inflammation and dysglycemia and that certain TKIs such as gefitinib block bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan-induced inflammation and lipolysis in adipocytes and inflammation in macrophages Fig.

Ripk2 is known to propagate inflammatory signals in response to Nod1 activation but the role of Ripk2 in metabolic perturbations downstream of Nod1 has yet to be established.Interestingly Ripk2 has emerged as a target of certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIs.

We found that inhibition of Ripk2 was the defining characteristic of TKIs that attenuated peptidoglycanmuropeptide-induced changes in inflammation and metabolism and that Ripk2 was required for Nod1 ligand-induced lipolysis and glucose intol- erance in mice.TKIs can lower blood glucose in some but not all individuals and mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in patient responses is lacking.

Cxcl1 and Il6 were quantified by ELISA from RD Systems Denver CO. For insulin signalling following 1 h pre-incubation with 5 mM gefitinib and 48 hour treatment with 10 mgmL FK565 adipocytes were stimulated for 10 minutes with 100 nM insulin and washed twice in ice-cold PBS.

Relative levels of glycerol released from 3T3-L1 adipocytes after stimulation with the Nod1 ligand FK565 10 mgmL for 48 h and pre- incubated for 1 h with 1 5 or 10 mM of various TKIs A n 6-69.

Levels of Cxcl1 released from 3T3-L1 adipocytes after stimulation with the Nod1 ligand FK565 10 mgmL for 48 h and pre-incubated for 1 h with 1 or 5 mM of the TKIs gefitinibSB203580 or imatinib A n 6.

Levels of Il6 released from 3T3-L1 adipocytes after stimulation with the Nod1 ligand FK565 10 mgmL for 48 h and pre-incubated for 1 h with 1 or 5 mM of the TKIs gefitinib SB203580 or imatinib C n 5.

Ripk2 was required for these effects on inflammation and metabolism since Nod1-mediated cytokine and blood glucose changeswere absent in Ripk2-- mice.
