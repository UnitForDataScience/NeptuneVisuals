In both models agrimoniin exhibited strong antihis- taminic activity with IC50 equal to 0.68 uM for the KO2 model and 0.49 uM for the compound 4880 model.54 Its potent antihistaminic activity in the first model could be connected to the presence of four HHDP groups the DHDG and 28 phenolic groups which especially the HHDP group have strong free radical-scavenging potential.56 The activity of agri- moniin in the second histamine-release model may be attributed to the protection of cell membrane surfaces by tannins so the active site of the G pro- tein cannot be approached by its ligand.

The first research regard- ing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of agrimoniin was conducted by Bazylko et al.

It was shown that agrimoniin is a strong tyrosinase inhibitor with ID50 equal to 0.061 mM although the mechanism of this activity has not been established owing toEA ellagic acid gall galloyl glc glucose HHDP hexahydroxy- diphenoyl.its dose-dependent activity.47 Biological activity against H. pylori and not on E. coli strains could be connected with its membrane composition espe- cially the presence of cholesteryl-6-O-phosphatidyl- a-d-glucopyranoside which is a unique lipid found only in Helicobacter species.53Histamine release inhibitionInhibition of potassium superoxide KO2 and com- pound 4880-induced histamine release of tannins agrimoniin among them was also the subject of research.54 KO2 elicits histamine release from mast cells through rapid O2- radical generation.

Agri- moniin previously found to possess a strong effect on proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes and significant antitumor activity could presumablyhave a significant influence on the activity of strawberry.74Antidiabetic activityDiabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia caused by insulin emission dis- orders susceptibility to insulin or both prob- lems.

pilosa in which one of the most abundant con- stituents agrimoniin exhibits the strongest anti- cancer and antitumor potential.882 Agrimoniin was shown in many studies to be a potent anticancer agent according to both in vitro studies on various cancer cells for example human gastric carcinoma cells SGC-790183 and in vivo tests on mice models such as mouse mammary carcinoma MM2 cells.8 Agrimoniin has strong cytotoxic activity against MM2 cells in vitro while the addition of fetal calf serum decreased its activity by about 96.

Rosaceae.7 A few years later agrimoniin was purified again by Miyamoto et al.

Fra- garia ananassa Duch and Fragaria nipponica.5For some of those species Fragaria Agrimo- nia and Potentilla agrimoniin is considered as a chemotaxonomic marker.12 Vrhovsek et al.

isolated agrimoniin from 70 acetone extracts and unequivocally identified it as one of the most abundant phenolic compounds in the fruits of F. vesca and F. ananassa.13 Furthermore Aaby et al.

As such the extraction procedures must be chosen carefully.The extraction procedures applied for agrimoniin determination in plants and commercial products Table 2 are generally solid-liquid extraction SLE using acetone14 70 acetone solution1340-43 60 acetone solution17 50 aqueous methanol solu- tion pure methanol pure water519 or hot water.910 It has been reported that ellagitannins may be unsta- ble if treated with higher temperatures resulting in their decomposition to ellagic acid.44 However the procedure developed for the extraction of aerial parts of agrimony described by Granica et al.
