rosaceae.7 a few years later agrimoniin was purified again by miyamoto et al.

fra- garia ananassa duch and fragaria nipponica.5for some of those species fragaria agrimo- nia and potentilla agrimoniin is considered as a chemotaxonomic marker.12 vrhovsek et al.

isolated agrimoniin from 70 acetone extracts and unequivocally identified it as one of the most abundant phenolic compounds in the fruits of f. vesca and f. ananassa.13 furthermore aaby et al.

as such the extraction procedures must be chosen carefully.the extraction procedures applied for agrimoniin determination in plants and commercial products table 2 are generally solid-liquid extraction sle using acetone14 70 acetone solution1340-43 60 acetone solution17 50 aqueous methanol solu- tion pure methanol pure water519 or hot water.910 it has been reported that ellagitannins may be unsta- ble if treated with higher temperatures resulting in their decomposition to ellagic acid.44 however the procedure developed for the extraction of aerial parts of agrimony described by granica et al.

the first research regard- ing the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of agrimoniin was conducted by bazylko et al.

in tnf-a- stimulated secretion ic50 was equal to 0.09 um69 in lps-induced secretion ic50 was not reachedin a concentration of 20 um probably because of the increasing effect on tnf-a production.70 however differences were spotted in two studies by almost the same team of scientists--a confer- ence paper submitted by fumagalli et al.

showed ic50 against tnf-a-stimulated il-8 secretion to be equal to 0.042 um69 while a publication sub- mitted by sangiovanni et al.

it was found that the two highest concentrations of agrimoniin-enriched extracts showed significant erythema-reducing activity.6 shi et al.
