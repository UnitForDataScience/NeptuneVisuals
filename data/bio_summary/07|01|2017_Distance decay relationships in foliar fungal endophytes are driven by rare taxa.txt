In the future con- sidering varying urban densities and pine plantation distributions throughout the landscape may reveal further insights into how humans affect the distribution and diver- sity of symbiotic fungi.Rare versus AbundantThe rare biosphere makes up the majority of microbial diver- sity and reveals important patterns in microbial ecology.VC 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley  Sons Ltd Environmental Microbiology 19 2794-28052800 R. Oono A. Rasmussen and E. LefevreStudies typically distinguish rare and abundant taxa arbi- trarily usually picking OTUs found in less than 1 of reads as rare Liu et al.

Although the whole communities of the Eurotiomycetes and Tremel- lomycetes displayed a distance-decay relationship across the region their rare communities 4042 and 2728 MOTUs respectively did not.

In contrast although the whole communities of the Dothideomycetes and Leotiomy- cetes lacked significant distance-decay relationships in the region their rare communities 172194 and 5468 MOTUs respectively displayed significant distance-decay rates Fig.

Whole taxa-specific communities are indicated with open circles and dotted regression lines and their rare communities are indicated by filled circles and solid regression lines.

4C and E. The rare MOTUs of Ascomycota showed greater distance-decay compared to the rare MOTUs of Basidiomycota Table 1.

Our finding contrasts with studies suggesting that locally rare microbial taxa are consistently rare on a global scale Finlay et al.
