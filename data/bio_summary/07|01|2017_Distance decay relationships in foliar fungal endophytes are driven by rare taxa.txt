higher anosim r-values overall for both phyla the more structured com- munities did not necessarily have greater distance-decay rates table 1. spatial structure analyses of whole fungal communities likely mask important differences in dispersal or persistence strategies among taxa but there can only be speculation and formation of hypotheses for individual taxa without better basic information on the natural history of foliar fungal endophytes.microbial eukaryotes like foliar fungal endophytes are considered ubiquitous but geographical differentiation isvc 2017 society for applied microbiology and john wiley  sons ltd environmental microbiology 19 2794-2805possible even at regional scales.

although the whole communities of the eurotiomycetes and tremel- lomycetes displayed a distance-decay relationship across the region their rare communities 4042 and 2728 motus respectively did not.

in contrast although the whole communities of the dothideomycetes and leotiomy- cetes lacked significant distance-decay relationships in the region their rare communities 172194 and 5468 motus respectively displayed significant distance-decay rates fig.

whole taxa-specific communities are indicated with open circles and dotted regression lines and their rare communities are indicated by filled circles and solid regression lines.

therefore we evaluated spatial structuring of communities of foliar fungal symbionts to estimate dis- persal limitations in the absence of these major environmental gradients at a regional scale and com- pared the beta-diversity across geographical distances to the beta-diversity within host tissue types.beta diversity within individual treesinterestingly the ffe communities appeared more differ- ent within leaves tips vs. bases than between tree branch heights bottom vs. top.

phyllosphere exhibit significantly different patterns of spatial variation unrelated to their abundance because the func- tional ecologies of fungal endophytes are seldom known by taxa even divergent fungal lineages with disparate life histo- ries are often analyzed together for ffe communities.

first do rare and abundant ffe species exhibit similar distribution patterns rare and abundant taxa have different life histories that could influence their dispersal capacities logares et al.

3. our finding contrasts with studies suggesting that locally rare microbial taxa are consistently rare on a global scale finlay et al.
