For the comparative taxonomic analysis KCTC 13623T and KCTC 32056T were purchased from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures Jeongeup Republic of Korea.The isolated strain MME2R6T and two reference strains0were routinely cultivated on TSA at 20 C unless indicatedotherwise.Genomic DNA of strain MME2R6T was extracted and purified by using a HiYield Genomic DNA Mini Kit Real Biotech Corporation.

Fatty acid composition  of strain MME2R6T and related taxa of the genus Taxa 1 strain MME2R6T 2 KCTC 13623T 3 KCTC 32056T.

According to its 16S rRNA gene sequence chemotaxonomic characteristics and phenotypic properties this strain was identified as a novel species in the genus .Strain MME2R6T was isolated from the Artic soil of Midtre Lovenbreen glacier foreland 780 54C 9.03 N 120 6C 34.47 E at Svalbard in Norway in June 2013.

The length of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MME2R6T obtained in this study was determined to be 1469 bp.

To measure the NaCl tolerance TSA as basal medium was modified so that NaCl in the medium was changed to 0 0.5  wv and 1.0-10.0  wv at intervals0.01100989610098997473- 1009597Paenibacillus swuensis DY6T JQ958374Paenibacillus gansuensis B518T AY839866Paenibacillus selenitireducens ES3-24T KC815539 Paenibacillus arcticus MME2R6T KP900012  Paenibacillus contaminans CKOBP-6T EF626690Paenibacillus elgii SD17T AY090110Paenibacillus tianmuensis B27T FJ719490Paenibacillus rigui WPCB173T EU939688Paenibacillus aestuarii CJ25T EU570250Paenibacillus stellifer DSM 14472T CP009286Paenibacillus chibensis NRRL B-142T D85395Paenibacillus telluris PS38T HQ257247Paenibacillus agaridevorans DSM 1355T AJ345023Paenibacillus popilliae ATCC 14706T AF071859Brevibacillus brevis DSM 30T AB271756Fig.

Characteristics of strain MME2R6T and related taxa of the0Tgenus bated at 20 C. Strain MME2R6 was biochemically charac-terized using API ZYM and API 20NE bioMerieux.

The results of API test strips were observed after incubation at020 C for 2 weeks.Cells of strain MME2R6T was Gram-stain-positive motile strictly aerobic and rod-shaped 0.6--0.8x1.7--2.5 um Fig.

Strain MME2R6T was catalase-positiveand oxidase-negative.

Strain MME2R6T growth range of temperature NaCl concentra- tion and pH were 4--24 0C 0--0.5  wv and at pH 7-80respectively.
