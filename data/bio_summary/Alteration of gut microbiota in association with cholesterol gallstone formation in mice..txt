Such changes in gut microbiota may contribute to the metabolic disorders of cholesterol and bile acid which were significant factors contributing to the formation of cholesterol gallstone.AbbreviationsACE Abundance-based cover-age estimator BSH Bile salt hydrolases CA Cholic acid DCA Deoxycholic acid LD Lithogenic diet LDA Linear discriminant analysis LEfSe LDA effect size LPS Lipopolysaccharide PCoA Principal coordinate analysis RDP Ribosomal Database Project SPF Specific pathogen freeAcknowledgementsNone.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant Nos.

Compared with primary bile acids secondary bile acids have different critical mi- cellar concentration and lower solubility in aqueous solution On the other hand cholic acid CA and deoxycholic acid DCA have strong antimicrobial activity The gut microbiota may act as an energy harvest organ in digestion and metabolism of macromolecularc The Authors.

High fat diet or western diet which con- tained high cholesterol only with no cholic acid in- creased in Firmicutes and a ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in mice - However in the pres- ence of cholic acid we observed a profound decrease in Firmicutes.

Two weeks after adaption to the environment the mice were randomly assigned into two groups 8 micegroup fed with either litho- genic diet containing 1.25 cholesterol  0.5 cholic acid LD group or chow diet 0.02 cholesterol chow group for 56 days.

The difference response of gut microbiota in response to cholic acid might be due to the dif- ferences in dose and length of exposure.

The threshold on the logarithmic Linear discriminant analysis LDA score for discriminative features was less than 2.0 y.ResultsLD decreased microbial richness and diversityAs expected gallstones formed in all the mice fed with LD but none in the chow group.
