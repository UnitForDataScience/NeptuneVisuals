In addition the overall structure of the gut microbiota was different between the time points before 3 and 8 weeks of age and after 11 and 15 weeks of age antibiotic treatment initiation at 9 weeks of age also in Fig.

Moreover the antibiotic-treated group before given the treatment 3 and 8 weeks of age shared similar gut microbiota composition with the Control group but the antibiotic treatment initiated at 9 weeks of age appears to have altered the bacterial composition at 11 and 15 weeks of age Fig.

This suggests that an appropriately selected antibiotic may attenuate disease flares in SLE patients by targeting Lachnospiraceae for removal.Our results have shown that a single antibiotic vancomycin can recapitulate the beneficial effect of mixed antibiotics ampicillin vancomycin neomycin and metronidazole against lupus progression in MRLlpr mice.

For single antibiotic treatment 2 gl vancomycin or 2 gl neomycin was given in the drinking water from 9 weeks of age till euthanasia at 15 weeks of age.

Together these results suggest that vancomycin given post disease onset recapitulated the attenuated disease phenotype seen with mixed antibiotic treatment.Vancomycin reshaped the gut microbiota and differentially affected KEGG pathways.

To determine the effects of antibiotics on active disease in lupus- prone MRLlpr mice we treated female mice with a combination of antibiotics ampicillin neomycin metro- nidazole and vancomycin started at 9 weeks of age and post disease onset.

These results suggest that mixed antibiotics or a single antibiotic vancomycin ameliorate SLE-like disease in MRLlpr mice by changing the composition of gut microbiota.Little is known on the role of gut microbiota in systemic lupus erythematosus SLE.

Antibiotic mixture 1 gl ampicillin 1 gl neomycin 1 gl metronidazole and 0.5 gl vancomycin was given in the drinking water starting from 9 weeks of age till euthanasia at 16 weeks of age.

In contrast neomycin an antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria did not affect the severity of lupus disease when given starting from 9 weeks of age.

The analysis showed that the presentation of functional pathways was relatively stable over time for the control group whereas treatment with vancomycin produced the most significant changes of the functional pathways at 9 weeks of age and 4 days after the initia- tion of antibiotic treatment Fig.
