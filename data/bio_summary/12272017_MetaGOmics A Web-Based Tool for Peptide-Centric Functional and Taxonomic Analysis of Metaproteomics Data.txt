All GO graphs from all proteins matched by a peptide are merged into a single non-redundant GO graph the union of the sets and the spectral count of each term is increased by the spectral count for the peptide.

Lists of identified peptides and spectral counts were parsed from the resulting Percolator XML files using an in-house script filtering peptide identifications on a q-value of 0.01 and then using peptide spectrum matches PSMs filtered on a q-value of 0.01 for spectral counts.

For example if a peptide matches two proteins with the same species the taxonomic node for that species and all of its ancestors genus family order and so on to kingdom have their spectral counts increased by the spectral count for that peptide.

In the case of spectral counting this ensures each spectrum increases the spectral count for each functional or taxonomic annotation only once which may not be the case if we assumed each protein matched by the peptide was in the sample.

For example if the peptide matches proteins that each were found in species belonging to different orders of class Betaproteobacteria we identify the class Betaproteobacteria as the LCA for which this peptide provides spectral evidence.
