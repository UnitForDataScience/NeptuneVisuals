all go graphs from all proteins matched by a peptide are merged into a single non-redundant go graph the union of the sets and the spectral count of each term is increased by the spectral count for the peptide.

lists of identified peptides and spectral counts were parsed from the resulting percolator xml files using an in-house script filtering peptide identifications on a q-value of 0.01 and then using peptide spectrum matches psms filtered on a q-value of 0.01 for spectral counts.

for example if a peptide matches two proteins with the same species the taxonomic node for that species and all of its ancestors genus family order and so on to kingdom have their spectral counts increased by the spectral count for that peptide.

in the case of spectral counting this ensures each spectrum increases the spectral count for each functional or taxonomic annotation only once which may not be the case if we assumed each protein matched by the peptide was in the sample.

note that the uploaded fasta file need only contain the proteins matched by any of the uploaded peptides and we recommend trimming very large protein databases in this way.the first step of the algorithm estimates the relative abundance of protein functions based on the relative frequencies of peptides that can be ascribed to any protein with those functions figure a. this is done by first matching peptides to unannotated proteins in the fasta file where peptides must be n-terminal in the protein or c-terminal to a lysine or arginine tryptic digestion is assumed and leucine and isoleucine are treated interchangeably.

for example if the peptide matches proteins that each were found in species belonging to different orders of class betaproteobacteria we identify the class betaproteobacteria as the lca for which this peptide provides spectral evidence.

the links do not expire.to submit data the user selects upload peptide count list and submits a tab-delimited text file containing the peptide list and associated spectral counts from a given experiment.

to upload data for analysis the user clicks upload peptide count list to upload a text file containing peptide sequences and spectral counts.

as such interpretations of changes in relative abundance of general go terms should be treated with care when there is a large ratio of unknown go annotations in one of the experiments.interpreting taxonomic changeswhen a taxonomic tree is calculated for a peptide only the taxa that are unambiguously matched by that peptide have their spectral counts incremented.

the spectral count for each go term in this dag is then incremented by the spectral count of the peptide that gave rise to it.

a table can be produced containing all go terms found in the sample the number of times peptides indicating those go terms were observed spectral count and the proportion of all scans in the experiment that were attributable to that go term table .table 1. small subset of go terms spectral counts and relative abundance ratio in a hypothetical mass spectrometry experiment.go accessiongo aspectgo namespectralratiothe second step of the algorithm estimates the relative taxonomic contribution to the number of peptide identifications for each go term figure b. for a given go term e.g.
