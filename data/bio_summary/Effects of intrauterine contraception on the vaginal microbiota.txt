Additionally we did not observe a clear difference in vaginal microbiota stability with Cu-IUD versus LNG-IUS use.Conclusions Although the vaginal microbiota can be highly dynamic alterations in the community associated with the use of intrauterine contraception Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS were not detected over 12 months.Implications We found no evidence that intrauterine contraception Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS altered the vaginal microbiota composition.

If samples were further split into LNG-IUS baseline LNG-IUS 6 months LNG-IUS 12 months Cu-IUD baseline Cu-IUD 6 months and Cu-IUD 12 months there was still not a statistically-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6Axis1 17.4Fig.

Subjects were grouped based on baseline community group and were included only if their baseline and 12 month samples each yielded at least 3437 V4 region sequences Group 1 LNG-IUS n13 Cu-IUD13 Group 2 LNG-IUS n11 Cu-IUD7 Group 3 LNG-IUS n8 Cu-IUD6.

Subjects were grouped based on their community group at 6 months and were included only if their 6 month and 12 month samples each yielded at least 3437 V4 region sequences Group 1 LNG-IUS n15 Cu-IUD11 Group 2 LNG-IUS n10 Cu-IUD6 Group 3 LNG-IUS n7 Cu-IUD8.

The objectives of this study were to determine if intrauterine contraception altered the vaginal microbiota and to compare the effects of a copper intrauterine device Cu-IUD and a levonorgestrel intrauterine system LNG-IUS on the vaginal microbiota.Study design DNA was isolated from the vaginal swab samples of 76 women using Cu-IUD n36 or LNG-IUS n40 collected prior to insertion of intrauterine contraception baseline and at 6 months.

Consistent with the high stability of the vaginal microbiota of women with L. iners-dominant group 1 vaginal microbiota based on thYC distances  81.5 of vaginal microbiotas in group 1 at 6 months were also in group 1 at 12 months .were using LNG-IUSs had more stable vaginal bacterial communities over the next 6 months than women with diverse group 3 communities using Cu-IUDs with a significantly lower thYC distance between 6 month and 12 month communities Kruskal-Wallis test p-value 0.0331 Dunn's multiple comparisons posttest between group 1 LNG-IUS and group 3 Cu-IUD P-value 0.05 B.

The vaginal microbiota of women with L. iners-dominant group1 vaginal microbiota at baseline or 6 months was more stable than the vaginal microbiota of women with diverse group 3 communities with significantly smaller thYCwas optimal with 3 groups based on the highest Laplace value found by testing groupings with up to 6 partitions.

DNA was isolated from vaginal swab samples from all subjects Cu-IUD n36 LNG-IUS n40 at baseline and 6 months and from 69 subjects at 12 months Cu-IUD n33 LNG-IUS n36.

Green indicates LNG-IUS and orange indicates Cu-IUD.mucus produced by LNG-IUS users promotes L. iners growth making a dramatic shift in community composition unlikely .

We hypothesized that the Cu-IUD and LNG-IUS would have different effects on the vaginal environment and thus potentially different effects on the vaginal microbiota composition and dynamics.
