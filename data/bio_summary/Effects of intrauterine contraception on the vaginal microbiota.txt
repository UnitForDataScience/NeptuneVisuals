AMOVA on the thYC distances indicated no differences between vaginal bacterial communities at baseline after 6 or 12 months with a LNG-IUS and after 6 or 12 months with a Cu-IUD AMOVA p-value 0.623.distances between baseline and 12 months Kruskal-Wallis test p-value 0.0247 A and between 6 months and 12 months Kruskal-Wallis test p-value 0.0107 B.

Consistent with the high stability of the vaginal microbiota of women with L. iners-dominant group 1 vaginal microbiota based on thYC distances  81.5 of vaginal microbiotas in group 1 at 6 months were also in group 1 at 12 months .were using LNG-IUSs had more stable vaginal bacterial communities over the next 6 months than women with diverse group 3 communities using Cu-IUDs with a significantly lower thYC distance between 6 month and 12 month communities Kruskal-Wallis test p-value 0.0331 Dunn's multiple comparisons posttest between group 1 LNG-IUS and group 3 Cu-IUD P-value 0.05 B.

If samples were further split into LNG-IUS baseline LNG-IUS 6 months LNG-IUS 12 months Cu-IUD baseline Cu-IUD 6 months and Cu-IUD 12 months there was still not a statistically-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.6Axis1 17.4Fig.

Additionally we did not observe a clear difference in vaginal microbiota stability with Cu-IUD versus LNG-IUS use.Conclusions Although the vaginal microbiota can be highly dynamic alterations in the community associated with the use of intrauterine contraception Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS were not detected over 12 months.Implications We found no evidence that intrauterine contraception Cu-IUD or LNG-IUS altered the vaginal microbiota composition.

Subjects were grouped based on their community group at 6 months and were included only if their 6 month and 12 month samples each yielded at least 3437 V4 region sequences Group 1 LNG-IUS n15 Cu-IUD11 Group 2 LNG-IUS n10 Cu-IUD6 Group 3 LNG-IUS n7 Cu-IUD8.

Use of intrauterine contraception was not associated with altered overall community compositionOTU 3GardnerellaOTU 5PrevotellaOTU 17CoriobacteriaceaeGroup 1Group 2Group 3We tested if either type of intrauterine contraception was associated with vaginal community composition by AMOVA on thYC distances between all baseline samples all 6 and 12 months combined LNG-IUS samples and all 6 and 12 months combined Cu-IUD samples.

All baseline samples are gray 6 and 12 month LNG-IUS samples are green and 6 and 12 month Cu-IUD samples are orange.

However the difference in 6 to 12 month thYC distances between Cu-IUD and LNG-IUS users with diverse group 3 communities at 6 months was approaching statistical significance Mann-Whitney U test p-value 0.0932 so with more subjects a statistically significant difference may be detected.DiscussionThere is a clear knowledge gap concerning how IUDs affect the vaginal microbiota and consequently women's health.

The vaginal microbiota of women with L. iners-dominant group1 vaginal microbiota at baseline or 6 months was more stable than the vaginal microbiota of women with diverse group 3 communities with significantly smaller thYCwas optimal with 3 groups based on the highest Laplace value found by testing groupings with up to 6 partitions.
