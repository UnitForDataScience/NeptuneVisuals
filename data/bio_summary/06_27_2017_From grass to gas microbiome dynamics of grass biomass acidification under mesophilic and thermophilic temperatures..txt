For amplification after initial denatura- tion at 95 degC for 5 min 35 cycles of amplification 95 degC for 30 s 54 degC for 30 s and extension at 72 degC for 1 min werecarried out.

In order to bridge this gap and to finely characterize one of the most important phases of the biogas production process the dynamic behaviour of grass acidification processes at mesophilic and thermo- philic temperatures 37 and 55 degC respectively was mon- itored through both proteomics and 16S-rDNA analysis.

Therefore successful adaption to high temperatures and well-cho- sen seed sludge might be crucial for a separated acidifica-tion step.In concordance with the reduced acid production in the thermophilic acidification two of the correspond- ing methane stages leach bed and semicontinuous batch with sewage yielded more methane per gram of input COD with thermophilic liquor than with mesophilic.

.Proteomic analysis on the high-strength liquor produced Proteins were extracted from the samples d2 d4 d6 and d8 from the first cycle of acidification.

In concordance with a previous work  the liquefied COD from the produced high-strength liquor was efficiently trans- formed into methane indicating no inhibitory effects.Usage of the high-strength liquor producedHigh-strength liquor was stored in bottles at RT upon production which were always flushed with nitrogen after opening to keep anoxic conditions.

As pH values between 4 and6.5 are common during acidification - and metha- nogenesis is inhibited at either low pH or high VFA con- centration  this renders hydrogen production in the acidification stage as a valuable sub-product in addition to the methane .

A total of 1731 proteins were quantified from samples d2 d4 d6 and d8 collected from the first cycle of acidification 556 proteins increased and176 decreased between mesophilic and thermophilic conditions 37 vs. 55 degC.

More differentially expressed proteins were found under mesophilic 120 than thermophilic 5 conditions.Conclusion Our results are the first multi-omics characterisation of a two-stage biogas production system with separated acidification and suggest that screening approaches targeting specific taxa such as Methanosaeta Metha- nomicrobium and Methanosarcina could be useful diagnostic tools as indicators of environmental changes such as temperature or oxidative stress or as in the case of Actinobacteria they could be used as a proxy of the gas produc- tion potential of anaerobic digesters.
