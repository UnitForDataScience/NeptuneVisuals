Bar 50 mm.D Density of LCMs in WT mice and mice deficient for CCR2 CX3CR1 CCR5 CCL5 TLR4 or MyD88.E-G Blood monocyte counts E at different ages before and after weaning F at 5 weeks of age after 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment G after treatment of adult mice with a single dose of M279.WT recipient mice were treated with a single dose of M279 antibody to deplete LCMs and injected i.v.

The density of LCMs in liver capsules of CCR2-deficient mice was similar to that in CCR2-sufficient mice D indicating that although CCR2 played a key role in regulating the number of circu- lating monocytes it was dispensable for their recruitment to the liver capsule andor their intrahepatic differentiation into LCMs.The chemokine receptors CXCR4 CCR5 and CX3CR1 and chemokine CCL5 also known to influence macrophage and monocyte recruitment were found to be dispensable for the re- cruiting of circulating LCM precursors andor for their intrahe- patic differentiation as determined by LCM density in deficient animals D. In addition sorted purified CX3CR1-defi- cient monocytes adoptively transferred into M279-treated recip- ient mice reconstituted the liver capsule and gave rise to LCMs H.LCMs are sensitive to anti-CSF-1R antibody F and thus depend on CSF-1R signaling.

The percentage of non-host chimerism for LCMs was approximately half that observed for Ly6Chi blood monocytes C. These results show that LCMs can be replenished from bone- marrow-derived cells in the absence of irradiation or ischemia re- perfusion-induced inflammation.To evaluate whether LCMs could be derived from blood monocytes CD45.1 WT mice were joined by parabiosis to CD45.2 Cx3cr1-GFP mice lacking CCR2  .

The positive correlation between the number of monocytes and LCM density was supported by 1 increased numbers of circulating monocytes and LCMs after weaning E 2 decreased numbers of circulating monocytes and LCMs in antibiotic-treated mice F 3 decreased numbers of circulating monocytes after treatment with M279 that depleted LCMs G and 4 the reported decrease in hematopoiesis including monocytes in germ-free mice  .CSF-1 Is Enriched in the Liver Capsule and Is Critical for LCM HomeostasisCCR2 regulates recruitment of monocytes and their differentiation into tissue-resident CX3CR1hi macrophages in the small intestinal lamina propria  and could play a similar role in re- cruiting monocytes to the liver capsule.

Bar graphs represent mean - SEM of at least three individual mice per group.E WT recipient mice were treated with a single dose of M279 antibody to deplete LCMs and GFP sorted monocytes or peritoneal macrophages from MacGreen mice adoptively transferred 7 days later.

The above data identified Cd207-EGFPhi F480 capsular cells as a distinct macrophage subset morphologically anatomically and phenotypically different from KCs leading us to name them''liver capsular macrophages'' LCMs.LCMs in Adult Livers Are Bone Marrow Derived and Can Be Replenished from Circulating MonocytesTo determine whether LCMs could be replenished from adult bone marrow BM C57BL6 mice were irradiated and reconsti- tuted with BM cells from Itgax-YFP mice in which LCMs ex- pressed the YFP reporter A 2B S3A and S3B.

9 days after adoptive transfer of sorted monocytes GFP LCMs were de- tected in the liver capsules of recipient mice E. In contrast sorted MacGreen peritoneal macrophages trans- ferred into M279-treated recipients did not give rise to LCMs E suggesting that although these cells are recruited to the liver after inflammation  they did not contribute to the LCM pool in the absence of inflammation.LCM Accumulation Accelerates at Weaning and Coincides with Establishment of the MicrobiotaLCM numbers were assessed during the postnatal period using MacGreen mice.

While our results suggest that peritoneal macrophagesC and D CD45.1 mice were parabiotically joined to C congenic CD45.2 Cx3cr1-GFP mice or D CD45.2 Cx3cr1-GFP Ccr2-- mice.
