By week 1 Listeria numbers in vat 7 continued to decrease significantly compared to those in vat 1 with a 3-log reduction recorded P  0.001.TABLE 2 L. lactis transconjugants surveyed for bacteriophage sensitivitya bacteriophage sensitivity observed by a clearing of the bacterial population  bacteriophage insensitivity observed as growth turbidity of the bacterial population.FIG 4 Counts of viable L. innocua cells in laboratory-scale cheeses.

Despite this combining fractions 23 and 37 did yield a zone of inhibition against the indicator strain suggesting that the bacteriocin is present.FIG 5 MALDI-TOF MS analysis of vat 7 lacticin nisin and plantaricin A vat 4 lacticin and nisin B vat 5 nisin and plantaricin C and vat 6 lacticin and plantaricin D. Masses corresponding to the bacteriocins are indicated.

PCR analysis confirmed that the genetic determinants responsible for lacticin production were present inFIG 1 PCR amplification using pMRC01-specific primers orf27 orf49 orf51 and orf52 to detect the presence of pMRC01 in L. lactis CSK3594 and CSK3533 and using primers designed to regions of the nisin operon nisA and nisFEG to confirm the presence of nisin genetic determinants in L. lactis CSK3281 andL.

These data confirm that lacticin is produced by CSK3594 nisin is produced by CSK3281 and both nisin and lacticin are produced by CSK3533 .The level of inhibitory activity in the culture supernatant of the double producer CSK3533 against L. lactis HP was determined to be 1000 arbitrary units AUml when measured by agar well diffusion assays corresponding to a zone size of 4.5 mm which is equivalent to the zone size produced by the nisin transconjugant L. lactis CSK3281.
