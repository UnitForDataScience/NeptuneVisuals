despite this combining fractions 23 and 37 did yield a zone of inhibition against the indicator strain suggesting that the bacteriocin is present.fig 5 maldi-tof ms analysis of vat 7 lacticin nisin and plantaricin a vat 4 lacticin and nisin b vat 5 nisin and plantaricin c and vat 6 lacticin and plantaricin d. masses corresponding to the bacteriocins are indicated.

to determine the frequency of bacteriocin resis- tancetolerance development in l. innocua freshly prepared 18-h cultures were serially diluted in mrd and spread plated on to gm17 or gm17 containing either 1000 auml or 320 auml of the appropriate bacteriocin or bacteriocin combination the latter concentration represents the arbitrary in situ concen- tration of the bacteriocins in the cheeses.

all fractions were tested for antimicrobial activity by agar well diffusion assays against the appropriate indicator strains lacticin and nisin against l. lactis hp and plantaricin against l. innocua where mass and concomitant activity were indicative of bacteriocin presence.

pcr analysis confirmed that the genetic determinants responsible for lacticin production were present infig 1 pcr amplification using pmrc01-specific primers orf27 orf49 orf51 and orf52 to detect the presence of pmrc01 in l. lactis csk3594 and csk3533 and using primers designed to regions of the nisin operon nisa and nisfeg to confirm the presence of nisin genetic determinants in l. lactis csk3281 andl.

these data confirm that lacticin is produced by csk3594 nisin is produced by csk3281 and both nisin and lacticin are produced by csk3533 .the level of inhibitory activity in the culture supernatant of the double producer csk3533 against l. lactis hp was determined to be 1000 arbitrary units auml when measured by agar well diffusion assays corresponding to a zone size of 4.5 mm which is equivalent to the zone size produced by the nisin transconjugant l. lactis csk3281.
