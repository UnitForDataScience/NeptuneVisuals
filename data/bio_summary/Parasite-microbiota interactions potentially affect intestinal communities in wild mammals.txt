There have also been some observational studies both in humans and in wildlife that have looked into the interactions between microbiota and parasites some studies did not find bacte- rial community changes upon infection Baxter et al.

It is not yet well known how coccidian in- fection affects microbiota except for the wide-spread human patho- gen Toxoplasma gondii it induces epithelial damage in the gut lumen including the loss of Paneth cells which produces antimicrobial pep- tides and leads to a shift towards Gram-negative bacteria Bar et al.

As with coccidians the resident bacteria are important in mounting the immune defence against helminths and thus microbiota composition can alter the success rate of invading helminths Hayes et al.
