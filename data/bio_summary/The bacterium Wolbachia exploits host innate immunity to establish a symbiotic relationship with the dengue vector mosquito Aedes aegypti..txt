overall our results suggest that wolbachia utilizes the host immune system to promote its symbiotic relation- ship with a. aegypti mosquitoes.resultswolbachia walbb activates both the toll and imd pathways and protects a. aegypti against bacteria and fungiwe have previously shown that walbb infection activates the toll pathway in a. aegypti to determine a possible effect of walbb on the imd pathway we conducted quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr assays comparing the transcriptfigure 1 walbb induces both the imd and toll pathways in the a. aegypti line wb1.

these results indicate that an elevated level of walbb infection is maintained through maternal transmission of the bacteria to the offspring of transgenic a. aegypti mosquitoes.antioxidants as potential effector molecules of boosted immunity enhance wolbachia infection in a. aegypti overexpressionofantimicrobialpeptideswas reported to increase tolerance to oxidant stress in drosophila melanogaster  and both walbb and boosting mosquito immunity were observed to induce the expression of antioxidants and antimicrobial peptides in a. aegypti we speculated that boosting immunity enhances wolbachia infection through alterationsfigure 4 the impact of antioxidant treatment on wolbachia abundance in transfected a. aegypti lines.

an introgression strategy was used to generate walbb infection in genetically modified a. aegypti with rel1 rel2 or both overexpressed a. walbb infection is indicated by shading of the symbols gray-filled with 'w' represents walbb infection from the wb1 mosquito line unshaded with 't' represents transgenic a. aegypti mosquitoes rel1 or rel2 line.

taken together these results show that boosting immunity promotes proliferation of walbb in a. aegypti.maternal transmission of elevated wolbachia densities in a. aegypti mosquitoes with enhanced immunity backgroundto test whether the elevated walbb infection could be maternally transmitted to the offspring ofaegypti mosquitoes with a transgenically enhanced immunity background we measured the walbb load in these offspring at the third instar larval and pupal stages.

to validate whether the effect of pgrp-le on walbb infection level was modulated through the imd pathway we further compared walbb density in w-aag2 cells after silencing pgrp-le caspar and both in w-aag2 cells supplementary figures s4c and d. we observed that although the walbb density was reduced after silencing of pgrp-le it was restored to a level similar to the control group after double knockdown of pgrp-le and caspar .

higher walbb load was observed in both wrel2 larvae po0.01 and two immature stages of the wrel1rel2po0.05 for the larvae and po0.01 for the pupae transgenic mosquitoes than in wugal mosqui- toes e. we further compared the walbb load at 7 days post eclosion in adult offspring that had not been blood fed and observed a significantly higher load of walbb in the carcasses of all three transgenic lines--wrel1 wrel2 and wrel1rel2--than in the wugal line po0.01 3f.

no significance one-way anova.rate than waco and wbt when challenged with either m. luteus po0.001 or b. bassiana po0.05 e.suppression of the imd pathway reduces the levels of walbb in both a. aegypti cells and mosquitoes because wolbachia is a gram-negative bacterium we initially hypothesized that the boosted immunity in particular the activation of the imd pathway might play an important role in preventing the over-proliferation of walbb in wb1 mosquitoes.

these results show that boosting immunity promotes proliferation of walbb in mosquito cells.the imd pathway intracellular receptor pgrp-le facilitates walbb growth in a. aegypti cellspgrp-le has been shown to function upstream of the imd pathway serving as the only known intracellular prr of gram-negative bacteria in drosophila .

because the expression of pgrp-le was induced by walbb in the carcass of a. aegypti  we investigated whether pgrp- le might have a role in sensing wolbachia in the imd pathway to facilitate walbb growth ina.

elucidating this information is essential for predicting the long-term persistence of the symbiotic relationship of wolbachia with its new host a. aegypti and the potential success of the wolbachia-mosquito system that is presently being used to control mosquito populations.in this work we utilized reverse genetic and transgenic tools to manipulate the mosquito innate immune system and test its influence on the interaction between walbb and a. aegypti.

surprisingly the level of walbb was reduced significantly in cells with either single rel2 silencing or a double knockdown of rel1 and rel2 when compared with the dsgfp-treated control fisupplementary figures s1a and b. theexperiment was repeated independently with the density of walbb measured using rt-pcr assay 5 days post treatment .

these results indicate that both pgrp-le and rel2 influence walbb through the imd pathway and pgrp-le may serve as a prr to sense wolbachia upstream of the imd pathway.boosting mosquito immunity increases walbb load in transinfected a. aegyptimanipulating the immune pathway by mean of dsrna-mediating gene silencing produces only a transient effect.

to explore whether an antioxidant could act as an effector molecule to regulate walbb infection levels we injected wb1 mosquitoes intrathoracically with glutathione and then measured the walbb levels in mosquito whole bodies 12 days post treatment.

here we have demonstrated that both the immune deficiency imd and toll pathways are activated by the wolbachia strain walbb upon its introduction into a. aegypti.

notably walbb induces peptidoglycan recognition protein pgrp-le expression in the carcass of a. aegypti and its silencing results in a reduction of symbiont load.
