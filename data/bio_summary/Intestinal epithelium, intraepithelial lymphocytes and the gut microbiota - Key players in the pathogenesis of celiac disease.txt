It consists of three main functional components the microbiota that colonize the intestines the epithelium with its specialized mucus-producing cells and cells producing antimicrobial peptides and gut-associated lymphoid tissue composed of various immune cells including IELs which come in direct contact with gut luminal antigens and lamina propria cells producing secretory IgA Figure 1.This review summarizes the role of epithelial cells and their intercellular junctions as well as IELs and the gut microbiota in the activation of early processes leading to the pathomechanisms associated with CD.EPITHELIAL JUNCTIONS - STRUCTURES RESPONSIBLE FOR GUT PERMEABILITYThe small intestinal epithelium is organized into a monolayer of specialized cells enterocytes constituting approximately 80 goblet cells secreting mucus Paneth cells synthesizing defensins and other antimicrobial agents endocrine cells secreting hormones and intestinal stem cells responsible for epithelial cell homeostasis and regeneration1314.

On the other hand there is experimental evidence that certain components of the gut microbiota such as Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus viridans are able to increase gut permeability69.The gut microbiota interacts with the host via pattern recognition receptors PRRs including Toll- like receptors TLRs expressed on the surface of epithelial and dendritic cells.

That is why it has been hypothesized that an early disruption of the gut barrier in genetically susceptible individuals which is not associated with gluten peptides and results in an increased intestinal permeability could precede the onset of gluten-induced immune events.The intestinal barrier is a complex structure that separates the internal milieu from the luminal environment12.

IL-15 plays a key role in enhanced cytolytic activity of IELs via increasing the expression of both intestinal epithelial cell surface ligands such as MICA and MICB i.e.Cukrowska B Sowinska A Bierla JB Czarnowska E Rybak A Grzybowska-Chlebowczyk U. Intestinal epithelium intraepithelial lymphocytes and the gut microbiota - Key players in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.

Microbe-derived SCFAs also have an impact on terminal differentiation of CD4 Th cells80.The gut microbiota is responsible not only for im-mune homeostasis and epithelial barrier function but also can have direct impact on gluten digestion in the intestinal tract.

Thus this in vivo study suggests that zonulin release could be affected by changes in gut microbiota composition.Recently epithelial polarity regulators especially the Par-3 protein have been reported to be likelyof Par-3 and a defect in performing lateral exclusion of Par-3 in the epithelial cells of CD patients.

Indoles produced from tryptophan by various Gram-positive and Gram- negative intestinal bacteria and acetate produced by Bifidobacterium strains enhance epithelial defense functions and suppress intestinal inflammation77-79.

disturbances in both the quantity and composition of the gut microbiota is a critical factor for the activation of innate immunity leading to epithelialbarrier dysfunctions.GUT MICROBIOTA THE MAINSTAY OF EPITHELIAL AND IMMUNEHOMEOSTASISThe microbiota colonizing the gut after birth reaches the pattern found in adults within 2-3 years of life.

Gut epithelium intraepithelial lymphocytes and gut microbiota in CDGUT MICROBIOTA AND METABOLOME IN CDSeveral studies addressed the phenomenon of gut dysbiosis in CD patients with active untreated disease and those on a GFD.

There is evidence indicating that the pioneer microbiota of the neonatal gut is essential for gut maturation as well as for metabolic and immunologic programming109110.
