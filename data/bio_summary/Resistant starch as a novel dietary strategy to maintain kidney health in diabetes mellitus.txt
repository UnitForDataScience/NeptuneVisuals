Type 3 resistant starch has a high gelatinization temperature which renders it resistant to heat and enzymes.However retrogradation of type 3 resistant starch unlike that of type 2 resistant starch may be reversible as reheating the starch may promote gelation and reduce the crystallinity of starch.Type 4 resistant starch chemically modified starchType 4 resistant starch is formed by the chemical modi- fication of starch containing molecules such as acetyl groups octenyl groups or hydroxylpropyl groups to prevent starch granules from enzymatic hydrolysis.

This is supported by the observation that trans- port of fatty acids from the lumen to the jejunum in mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity was signifi- cantly lower in those treated with type 4 resistant starch than in those treated with type 2 resistant starch which indicates that type 4 resistant starch may have reduced intestinal lipid absorption and altered fatty acid oxida- tion in the liver.Clinical studies have generally demonstrated thatconsumption of resistant starch resulted in greater im- provement in postprandial glycemic response in healthy participants- than in obese or diabetic individ- uals.However results from these human studies have been inconsistent  and only limited stud- ies have reported improved glucose metabolism after re- sistant starch intake in overweight individuals with or without type 2 diabetes.This could be due to the wide variability in resistant starch dosage and treatment duration used in these studies.

Taken together it is perhaps benefi- cial to increase the intake of resistant starch or resistant starch-containing diets over the amount that is gener- ally consumed by the US population.Protective mechanism of resistant starch gut microbiotaDiets containing resistant starch when compared with corn starch-based diets have been shown to modulate the composition of gut microbiota as demonstrated by markers associated with gut health and reduced colonic ammonia and phenol concentrations.-It is interest- ing to note that the consumption of resistant starch was followed by a shift in the composition of the human fecal microbiota.

Resistant starch is now classified into 5 categories as described below.Foods that are naturally high in resistant starch are included in the database reported elsewhere.Generally types 1 2 and 3 resistant starch can be found naturally in food while types 4 and 5 are chemically modified nativestarches designed to resist enzymatic hydrolysis.Type 1 resistant starch physically inaccessible starchType 1 resistant starch is found in whole or partly milled grains and seeds.

The mice receiving a diet composed of 10 type 4 resistant starch gained less weight had lower adiposity accumulation and expended more en- ergy than those receiving an equivalent dose of type 2 resistant starch.Likewise type 4 resistant starch but not type 2 resistant starch attenuated the postprandial glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide response in mice fed a high-fat diet.

Though commercially available HAM was adapted in most of these studies analysis of resistant starch in HAM is highly recommended prior to using HAM in interven- tional studies in order to accurately determine the dos- age of resistant starch.Estimation of resistant starch intake based on 24- hour dietary recall data from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicates that the average consumption of resistant starch among Americans aged 1 year and older is approximately 5 gd which constitutes approximately 33 of the daily average fiber intake among US adults.

It is challenging to predict the optimal levels of resistant starch that exert a protective effect against diabetes as most of this work was done by feeding resistant starch or resistant starch- containing diets acutely yet the information derived from these short-term trials in healthy individuals- could serve as a basis for determining the minimal effective dose of resistant starch that can influence glu- cose metabolism.

The intact cell walls thatsurround starch granules retard enzymatic hydrolysis of amylose and amylopectin in these products.Type 2 resistant starch resistant starch granulesThe natural form of type 2 resistant starch is usually found in raw starch or gelatinized starch such as that found in unripe banana and potato.

Similarly animal studies have also shown that glucose- and amylopectin-fed rats developed insulin resistance at an earlier age than rats fed amylose which has a lower glycemic index.Thus consump- tion of nondigestible fibers such as resistant starch and oligosaccharides which have lower glycemic indices is recommended to aid management of type 2 diabetes.Studies involving feeding of resistant starch- containing products such as high-amylose rice and cornstarch to diabetic animals have consistently shown that these products lower the postprandial glycemic re- sponse as well as circulating concentrations of triglycer- ides and cholesterol.Shen et al.reported that a diet composed of 30 HAM type 2 resistant starch increased b-cell proliferation and insulin sensitivity in pregnant Goto-Kakizaki rats a nonobese model of type2 diabetes.

Similar observations were reported by Harazaki et al.who demonstrated that replacing a 55 cornstarch diet with a 55 HAM diet equivalent to 35 resistant starch in total diet reduced both plasma insulin concentrations and glycated hemoglobin in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats an obesity-associated diabetic rat model after 4 weeks of feeding.Interestingly oral administration of type 2 re- sistant starch at 2 gd for 4 weeks to diabetic rats opti- mized lipid oxidation pathways glycogen synthesis and insulin sensitivity while the expression of genes central to fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis such as the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c SREB1c an insulin-regulated protein essential for transcriptional regulation of glycolytic and lipogenic genes was attenu- ated.This suggests that the improved postprandial in- sulin and glucose response by resistant starch could be mediated by the regulation of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism.However investigations of the effects of resistant starch on glucose metabolism report conflicting results.
