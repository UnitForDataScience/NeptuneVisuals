Paralarvae reared in captivity with Artemia showed a depletion of bacterial diversity particularly after day 5 when almost half the bacterial species present on day 0 were lost and two bacterial families Mycoplasmataceae and Vibrionaceae dominated the microbial community.

In contrast bacterial diversity increased in wild paralarvae as they developed in the oceanic realm of both upwelling systems likely due to the exposure of new bacterial communities via ingestion of a wide diversity of prey.

Vibrionaceae were the main bacterial group identified using RNA transcripts of the 16S rRNA gene from metabolically active bacterial flora of adult octopuses collected in Mexico de la Cruz-Leyva et al.

PCO3 accounted for 8.5 of total variability and was driven by the two dominating bacterial families identified from the paralarvae in aquaculture with positivewild paralarvae had on average more bacterial species andfiltering.

The same interpretation can be drawn from the direction of the vectors DML and Comamonadaceae Figure 2 pointing towardTABLE 3  Averaged number of reads reads taxa identified and percentage of bacterial reads  classified to different taxonomic levels.the oldest paralarvae in the wild thus showing that the main differences in the oceanic paralarvae were due to an increase in size DML and an incorporation of bacterial species of the family Comamonadaceae.DistLM results showed that the examined variables accounted for 31.68 Octopus 28.12 Experiment 26.88 Taxonomy and 15.28 Run of the total variability found in the microbial communities.

This reduced model also highlighted theimportance of Octopus DML and bacterial diversity H' sincebacterial diversity was differentially correlated with size of the paralarvae between the wild and captive samples.Core Gut MicrofloraRELATE analyses revealed the main bacterial families driving both the similarities Table 4 and the differences Table 5 between the sample groups.

Analysis of bacterial community and bacterial nutritional enzyme activity associated with the digestive tract of wild Chilean octopus Octopus mimus Gould 1852.

Remarkably the bacterial diversity of recently hatched paralarvae in captivity was similar to that of wild paralarvae and zooplankton thus suggesting a marked effect of the diet in both the microbial community species diversity and evenness.
