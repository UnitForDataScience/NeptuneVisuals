in addition higher srb abundance and sulfate concentrations were detected in gff digestate compared to gff manure supporting that digestate may be an environment more favorable to increased h2s pro- duction than manure.further insight was pursued by evaluating h2s production from the gff digester at different stages of manuretable 1sulfate concentrations and abundance of srbs by qpcr in manure and digestate samplesa below the detection level or sensitivity of the assayfermentation using an in vitro approach.

thus further characteri- zation of both manure and digestate srbs through isolation culturing and genome sequencing will be required to gain further insights into their contribution to h2s production in manure digesters.anaerobic manure digesters host complex and uncultured microbial environmentssince srbs have been shown to depend on other microorgan- isms to provide them with substrates the composition of their bacterial community could influence their potential for h2s production.

all manure digesters follow similar operating guidelines with a recom- mended total solid content for influent manure of 11-14 and expected total destruction efficiency of 30-40. bmanure samples were taken from the untreated manure stor- age pit at each farm while beffluent samples were acquired from the digestate exiting a digester before it is redirected to a storage lagoon.

the general goal of this study was to gain more insight on the factors that may affect h2s produc- tion in anaerobic manure digesters and explore the potential involvement of srbs in this process.materials and methodsmanure and digestate samplingsamples were collected between july 2014 and november 2014 from three dairy farms in vermont that each independent- ly operate an anaerobic digester described below for treat- ment of cattle manure as primary substrate.

it will however remain to be determined whether this mecha- nism can generate sufficient h2s to reach the levels observed in mixed manure-digestate cultures.srb microbial ecology in manure digestersfrom a microbial ecology perspective the differences in srb composition between manure and digestate were particularly striking.

unexpectedly only low to nondetectable levels of h2s were produced by digestate collected from a manure biogas plant documented to have persistently high concentrations of h2s in its biogas 2000- 3000 ppm.

indeed if the srbs re- sponsible for generating h2s require a nutrient that is not present in sufficient amounts in the environment where they are predom- inant that nutrient may be abundant in the other thus becoming available when mixing of manure and digestate occurs.a critical starting point will be the identification of srb-- nutrient combinations responsible for elevated h2s produc- tion.

sulfate-reducing bacteria srbs have been identified as the main biological source of h2s in a number of natural biological and human-made habitats and thus represent likely candidate microorganisms responsible for the production of h2s in anaer- obic manure digesters.

while further investigations will be required to determine the exact nature of these interactions in manure digesters the elevat- ed and sustained ch4 production that we have observed from co- culture of manure and digestate suggests that methanogens are likely not negatively affected by co-existing with srbs in this environment.

were maintained during the experimental period data not shown.in light of these results it was then hypothesized that ele- vated h2s production could occur in the compartment where untreated manure slurry enters the digester as a result of an interaction by mixing with digestate.
