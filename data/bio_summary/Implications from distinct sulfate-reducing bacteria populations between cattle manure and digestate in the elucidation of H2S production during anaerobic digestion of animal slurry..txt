In addition higher SRB abundance and sulfate concentrations were detected in GFF digestate compared to GFF manure supporting that digestate may be an environment more favorable to increased H2S pro- duction than manure.Further insight was pursued by evaluating H2S production from the GFF digester at different stages of manureTable 1Sulfate concentrations and abundance of SRBs by qPCR in manure and digestate samplesa Below the detection level or sensitivity of the assayfermentation using an in vitro approach.

Unexpectedly only low to nondetectable levels of H2S were produced by digestate collected from a manure biogas plant documented to have persistently high concentrations of H2S in its biogas 2000- 3000 ppm.

Indeed if the SRBs re- sponsible for generating H2S require a nutrient that is not present in sufficient amounts in the environment where they are predom- inant that nutrient may be abundant in the other thus becoming available when mixing of manure and digestate occurs.A critical starting point will be the identification of SRB-- nutrient combinations responsible for elevated H2S produc- tion.

However if that is the case then this activity would not be expected to generate elevated productionof H2S since only low to undetectable levels of H2S were mea- sured in biogas from digestate cultures.

Thus further characteri- zation of both manure and digestate SRBs through isolation culturing and genome sequencing will be required to gain further insights into their contribution to H2S production in manure digesters.Anaerobic manure digesters host complex and uncultured microbial environmentsSince SRBs have been shown to depend on other microorgan- isms to provide them with substrates the composition of their bacterial community could influence their potential for H2S production.

Wright2Received 21 December 2016  Revised 21 March 2017  Accepted 23 March 2017  Published online 7 April 2017 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017Abstract Biogas produced from the anaerobic digestion of an- imal slurry consists mainly of methane CH4 and carbon dioxide CO2 but also includes other minor gases such as hydrogen sulfide H2S.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria SRBs have been identified as the main biological source of H2S in a number of natural biological and human-made habitats and thus represent likely candidate microorganisms responsible for the production of H2S in anaer- obic manure digesters.

However such remediation ap- proaches typically require additional expenses necessary to either maintain prolonged chemical treatment or install spe- cialized equipment.As their mode of action is to lower H2S concentrations rather than decrease its production current remediation tech- nologies thus treat symptoms rather than target the microbial agents that synthesize H2S.
