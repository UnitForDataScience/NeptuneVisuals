More importantly when FFA levels were compared among HC and SLE subjects stratified by microbial clusters it was noted that HC grouping within the cluster II exhibited similar FFA serum levels as SLE patients  thus reinforcing the relevance of the microbiota composition on the FFA serum levels.Overall our findings disclose a strong association between FFA levels in serum and specific groups of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals but not in lupus patients where a profound intestinal dysbiosis was registered.scFa and FFa levelsOur results point to a relationship between the gut microbiota and the host metabolism at the systemic level but the actual media- tors are unclear.

However SCFA and FFA levels did not remain associated after stratifying the whole population by the clusters hence suggesting the involvement of additional factors such as the clinical condition to explain the connection between gut microbiota composition SCFA and serum FFA levels.All these results highlight a role for the gut microbiota in the maintenance of serum FFA levels SCFA having a potential role orchestrating this interaction.

Thus gut microbiota seems to quantitatively and qualitatively impact the FFA serum pool.FFa and serum Biomarkers in sle PatientsSince some associations between gut microbiota and specific FFA PCA scores were observed we aimed to evaluate whether theseTaBle 7  specific free fatty acids FFa in healthy controls hc and systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients.The differences in specific FFA serum levels between control and patients were assessed by Mann-Withney U tests.

Therefore FB ratio was found to be the main predictor of FFA serum levels in HC whereas this effect was not seen in lupus patients hallmarked by a decreased FB ratio and elevated FFA levels.Since some heterogeneity within groups in the FFA levels was observed and in order to gain more insight into the connections between gut microbiota and serum FFA further analyses were performed.

Therefore parameters other than those indicated may explain the altered serum FFA levels registered in SLE.Then we wondered whether gut microbial composition may account for the increased FFA serum levels in SLE.

Statistical analyses with a p-value below 0.050 are highlighted in bold.and an altered gut microbiota composition leads to a dysregulated SCFA production the associations between fecal SCFA levels and those of serum FFA were analyzed.On the one hand higher levels of all SCFA studied were observed in lupus patients compared to HC .

Indeed altered gut microbiota composition found in SLE patients was linked to an altered SCFA produc- tion and increased FFA levels in serum thus supporting this hypothesis.FFa Profiling in sle PatientsAlthough elevated FFA levels were found in SLE whether a global increaseinall FFAspeciesunderliesthisfinding orif somespecific FFA were altered was not clear.

To this aim total and specific serum FFA levels fecal SCFA levels and gut microbiota composition were determined in 21 SLE patients and 25 healthy individuals.

Additionally basic serum blood lipid analyses were carried out on fresh samples at the time of sampling by standardized procedures.Quantification of Total FFa serum levelsTotal FFA serum levels were analyzed by a colorimetric enzymatic assay using a commercial kit NEFA kit half-microtest Roche LifeSciences Penzberg Germany following the instructions from the manufacturer.
