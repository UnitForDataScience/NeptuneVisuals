more importantly when ffa levels were compared among hc and sle subjects stratified by microbial clusters it was noted that hc grouping within the cluster ii exhibited similar ffa serum levels as sle patients  thus reinforcing the relevance of the microbiota composition on the ffa serum levels.overall our findings disclose a strong association between ffa levels in serum and specific groups of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals but not in lupus patients where a profound intestinal dysbiosis was registered.scfa and ffa levelsour results point to a relationship between the gut microbiota and the host metabolism at the systemic level but the actual media- tors are unclear.

however scfa and ffa levels did not remain associated after stratifying the whole population by the clusters hence suggesting the involvement of additional factors such as the clinical condition to explain the connection between gut microbiota composition scfa and serum ffa levels.all these results highlight a role for the gut microbiota in the maintenance of serum ffa levels scfa having a potential role orchestrating this interaction.

hence these findings support a functional rather than structural relationship of ffa.table 6  analysis of fecal short-chain fatty acids scfa levels and their correlation with serum-free fatty acids ffa levels in healthy controls hc and systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients.the differences between fecal scfa levels found in lupus patients and those in hc were analyzed by mann-withney u tests whereas the correlation analyses were performed by spearman rank's tests.

to this aim total and specific serum ffa levels fecal scfa levels and gut microbiota composition were determined in 21 sle patients and 25 healthy individuals.

therefore fb ratio was found to be the main predictor of ffa serum levels in hc whereas this effect was not seen in lupus patients hallmarked by a decreased fb ratio and elevated ffa levels.since some heterogeneity within groups in the ffa levels was observed and in order to gain more insight into the connections between gut microbiota and serum ffa further analyses were performed.

hc r2 model  0.762 sle r2 model  0.426. statistical analyses with a p-value below 0.050 are highlighted in bold.and an altered gut microbiota composition leads to a dysregulated scfa production the associations between fecal scfa levels and those of serum ffa were analyzed.on the one hand higher levels of all scfa studied were observed in lupus patients compared to hc .

indeed altered gut microbiota composition found in sle patients was linked to an altered scfa produc- tion and increased ffa levels in serum thus supporting this hypothesis.ffa profiling in sle patientsalthough elevated ffa levels were found in sle whether a global increaseinall ffaspeciesunderliesthisfinding orif somespecific ffa were altered was not clear.

this hypothesis is in line with current evidence in this field   and stresses the underestimated significance of ffa as key media- tors for the human health.due to the lack of direct mechanistic data in our approach these results pose the question on whether the microbiota com- position is responsible of the altered ffa levels or if alternatively increased ffa levels may lead to changes in the gut ecology.

thus gut microbiota seems to quantitatively and qualitatively impact the ffa serum pool.ffa and serum biomarkers in sle patientssince some associations between gut microbiota and specific ffa pca scores were observed we aimed to evaluate whether thesetable 7  specific free fatty acids ffa in healthy controls hc and systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients.the differences in specific ffa serum levels between control and patients were assessed by mann-withney u tests.

notably stronger associations were found in hc when only bacteroidetes abundance was considered propionate r  0.653 p  0.001 and butyrate r  0.623 p  0.002.in order to gain further insight into the relevance of the intesti-nal microbiota andthe scfa productionandserum ffa levels we performed additional analyses by stratifying subjects according to the clusters obtained from the microbiota analysis  instead of their clinical condition.

differences between groups in the levels of ffa remained significant after adjusting for age and gender p  0.024. moreover no associations were found with demographical parameters cholesterol and triglycer- ides levels and dietary intakes .

therefore parameters other than those indicated may explain the altered serum ffa levels registered in sle.then we wondered whether gut microbial composition may account for the increased ffa serum levels in sle.

since scfa may affect the human metabolismtable 5  firmicutesbacteroidetes fb ratio is the main predictor of ffa levels in healthy controls hc but not in systemic lupus erythematosus sle patients.the association between fb ratio and ffa serum levels in hc was studied by multiple lineal regression analysis including demographical parameters and nutritional intakes as potential confounders.

therefore it is feasible that factors related to energy intake and expenditure may underlie altered ffa levels and thus metabolic disorders.a mounting body of evidence shows that the gut microbiota can influence the host metabolism as well as the energy harvest and storage -.
