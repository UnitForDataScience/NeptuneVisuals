The posterior probabilities assigned by LDA were for 4 of these samples weakly in favour of the wrong class see supplementary figure S10 for details.To compare our experimental data with a large data set of pure bodysamples we assignedourreadstothe OTUs basedon 2465 HMP samples.

PCA plot with both the experimental data and HMP data zoomed in on experimental data.

The first principal components will contain the largest data variations most likely the systematic differences between taxonomic profiles.

Large data repositories specifically devoted to 16S rRNA gene data exist e.g.

This was performed by using PCA on the training data first and then truncated the data to 6 principal components using these scores when training the LDA classifier.

We also tested various ways of sample collection and PCR amplification and compared the obtained profiles to those in the public data sets from the HMP.Microbiota raw data qualityIt is reasonable to expect that it is more difficult to collect sufficient quantities of microbial DNA from a deposited trace compared to a sample taken directly from a body fluid.

Thus for now read-counts as low as 100 gave similar results to much higher numbers of reads but larger data sets should be investigated to verify that such low read-counts could be used for body fluid prediction in casework.There are a number of other factors that we did not investigate and that might influence the data quality for the intended purpose.

However the low level of bacterial background from skin see  is an advantage for recognizing a deposited body fluid.When comparing the experimental data to HMP data there is an obvious bias for both sample types see  but the skin samples show a lower degree of similarity than the saliva samples.

The tests are fast and easy to use but have high error rates as the target enzyme is also present in low quantities in other body fluids .

The European DNA Profiling Group EDNAP has performed collaborative studies on mRNA tests for blood  saliva and semen menstrual blood and vaginal secretion and finally on skin .
