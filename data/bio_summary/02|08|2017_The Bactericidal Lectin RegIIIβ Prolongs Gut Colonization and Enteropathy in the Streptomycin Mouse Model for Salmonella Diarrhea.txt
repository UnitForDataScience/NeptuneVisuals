In the gut lumen RegIIIb kills not only certain enteropathogens but also some commensal bacteria thus RegIIIb is also thought to be an innate immune effector shaping microbiota composition and establishing in- testinal homeostasis.

We found that this lectin affects the composition of the micro- biota community the gut luminal metabolite profile and disease kinetics.RESULTSPathogen Clearance and Remission Are Accelerated in RegIIIb-- Mice in the Streptomycin Mouse Model for Salmonella DiarrheaWe first investigated whether RegIIIb is required for induction of acute colitis in the streptomycin-treated murine Salmonella diar- rhea model .

These results sug- gest that RegIIIb either directly or indirectly promotes sustained gut luminal colonization by S. Tm and that deficiency of RegIIIb accelerates S. Tm clearance from the gut.S.

However the causal link between RegIIIb deficiency reduced pathogen loads and the reduced inflammation remains to be established.Induced Expression of RegIIIb Alters the Composition of Microbiota in the Inflamed GutThe composition and density of the microbiota play a critical role inS.

In contrast 2 days after infection the proportion of Bacteroidetes was markedly higher in RegIIIb-- mice than in the WT mice A. Interest- ingly the proportion of Bacteroidetes remained higher in the RegIIIb-- mice than in the WT controls until the end of the exper- iment at day 10 p.i.

This provided a first hint that one or more of these microbiota members may contribute to the accelerated disease resolution and pathogen elimination from the gut lumen of RegIIIb-- mice.RegIIIb Can Kill Bacteroides spp.We speculated that RegIIIb may affect Bacteroides MIB orE. rectale in vivo.
