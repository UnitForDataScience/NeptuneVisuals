All potential variables p  0.05 were entered into the analysis.resUlTscharacteristics of T2DM Patients in nil8 and Wil8 groupsThere were significant differences in age BMI urine pH urine white blood cells urine leukocyte esterase urine protein urine glucose and urine nitrite between T2DM patients with detectable IL-8 in their urine WIL8 and those without detectable urine IL-8 NIL8 p  0.05 .sequencing Data and concentrations of Urinary il-8Briefly we obtained 3981519 reads for microbiota analysis which accounted for 76.93 of the valid reads.

Specifically those patients with Bacteroides HCs group Klebsiella HCs group Pseudomonas HCs group and Akkermansia HCs group had higher concentrations of urinary IL-8 while those patients with Lactobacillus HCs group Megamonas HCs group and Microbacterium HCs group had higher levels of IL-8 .Multiple regression analysis showed that the genera Ruminococcus Limnohabitans Cytophaga Providencia Anaerotruncus Giesbergeria Solitalea Actinomyces Meiothermus Luteibacter Flavisolibacter Dysgonomonas Ureaplasma Exiguobacterium Zoogloea Cloacibacterium Lactobacillus and Dokdonella significantly affected urinary microbiota in T2DM patients and explained 95.60 of the total variance of urinary microbiota in this population .

Sequence data from this study are deposited in the GenBank Sequence Read Archive with accession number SRP 087709.groupingFrom the concentration of urinary IL-8 the T2DM patients were separated into with IL-8 WIL8 group indicating there was detectable IL-8 in their urine and no IL-8 NIL8 group indicating there was no detectable IL-8 in their urine.

Written informed consent based on the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from each patient before enrollment and all patients were given informed consent.collection of Urinary specimens and Dna sequencingA modified four-tube midstream urine collection technique was used for the first urine of the day which guaranteed thatthe real midstream urine was collected.

In our present study the WIL8 group had a higher level of urine white blood cells more leukocyte esterase and urine nitrite-positive cases which indicated an inflammatory reaction was present in the urinary tract system although no UTI was diagnosed currently.

After obtaining the results of differences in relative abundance ofbacterial genera in urine between the HCs and T2DM patients p  0.05  the patients were divided into two groups HCs group indicating relative abundance of bacterial genera were not less than the HCs and HCs group indicating the relative abundance of bacterial genera were less than the HCs.

Moreover patients with the Lactobacillus HCs group had lower levels of IL-8 than the HCs group which also demonstrated that Lactobacillus contributed to inhibit the inflammatory process in the bladder.In total 18 bacterial genera contributed to the presence of IL-8 in the urine of T2DM patients.

Bifidobacteriaceae Shuttleworthia Thermus Thermales and Thermaceae could be used as potential distinguishing biomarkers between the WIL8 and NIL8 groups.associations between Urinary Microbiota and il-8At the phylum level Proteobacteria was significantly higher in the WIL8 group than the NIL8 group while Bacteroidetes was dramatically decreased in the WIL8 group p  0.05 .

In addition the Lactobacillus species including Lactobacillus mucosae and Lactobacillus reuteri showed a trend increase in the WIL8 group whereas Lactobacillus ruminis showed a trend decrease but these species did not reach statistical differences Figure S3 in Supplementary Material.Interestingly 17 bacterial genera were enriched in the HCs group while 16 genera were enriched in the HCs group.

A modified four-tube midstream urine technique was used to collect urine specimens from 70 female T2DM patients and 70 matched healthy controls HCs.
