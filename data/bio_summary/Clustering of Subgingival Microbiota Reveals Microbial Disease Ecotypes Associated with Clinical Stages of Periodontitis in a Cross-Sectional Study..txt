Therefore the microbial disease ecotypes observed in our population can lead to an establishment of an early microbial risk profile for clinically healthy patients.Keywords periodontitis microbiome subgingival plaque microbial ecology polymicrobial infectionsINTRODUCTIONPeriodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a dysbiosis of the oral microbiota     and by the host response to these alterations   .

However most of the actual studies focus on extremes of the disease mostly healthy versus severe disease.

The evolution of the abundance of the known pathogens involved in the disease as well as the increase of the severity parameters AL PD and BOP along the four ecotypes tend to prove a gradual change of microbiota during disease.

The global burden of periodontal disease towards integration with chronic disease prevention and control.

The aim of this study was to link microbial differences to disease's prevalence and severity.

Those sub-ecotypes differed with respect to the frequency of diseased patients and displayed a gradual change in distinct subgingival microbiota that goes along with clinical disease symptoms.

In ecotype 2 the subgroup with no clinical signs of disease was linked to an increase of F. nucleatum vincentii but also several other species while only in end-stage dysbiosis classical red complex bacteria gained overweight.

One model for pathogenesis of periodontitis suggests that periodontal microbial communities can be clustered into complexes that are associated with disease severity   .

Cluster analysis with such a pre-selection could result in a bias neglecting intermediate states of disease.

As a consequence of the randomized selection of the sampling site the chosen site did not necessarily reflect the disease state of the host.
