The remaining 18 of all proteins identified 104 lower and 7 higher for CRS individuals in this study were of great interest and will be discussed further in terms of disease status the associated bacterial communities and possible clinical implications.Proteins Associated with Sinus DiseaseOf the seven elevated proteins identified in this study only one protein S100-A9 has been previously reported as being elevated in CRS patients Casado et al.

Moreover it is highly likely that proteins present within the mucus have specific protective functions that when altered could play an important role in the pathophysiology of CRS Al Badaai et al.

The majority of proteins found in these studies related to innate and acquired immunity while only two of these studies were able to demonstrate significant differences in protein expression levels between CRS and healthy patients Upton et al.

The loss of epithelial barrier integrity or reduced expression of tight junction proteins has been argued as a central component in the pathogenesis of CRS Soyka et al.

The associated genes for these two proteins are over expressed in bladder and colorectal cancers respectively Huang et al.

It is possible that this group of proteins if expressed before the onset of CRS symptoms could serve as a biomarker for CRS to help for diagnostic purposes Das et al.

The results from this study and previous research support the use of proteins as targets for drug therapy or for assessing treatment outcomes in CRS patients.The results from this study are consistent with those of other studies in CRS which suggest that this disease is likely to be a result of multiple pathogenic processes Benninger et al.

Proteins identified as associated with CRS could be new targets for drug therapies and biomarkers for assessment of treatment efficacy.Keywords proteomics bacterial 16S rRNA gene inflammatory cells biomarkers PRRC2C RAB14INTRODUCTIONChronic rhinosinusitis CRS is defined by inflammation of the sinonasal cavities persisting for 3 months and occurs in 5 of the general population Gliklich and Metson 1995 Bhattacharyya 2009 Fokkens et al.

The heterogeneous nature of this disease all forms of which manifest with similar symptoms and the complex combination of host genetics immune response and sinonasal microbiota has made it difficult for researchers to elucidate the pathophysiology of CRS Hoggard et al.

Furthermore proteomics is an ideal approach for studying complex diseases such as CRS in that this technique may identify potential biomarkers to help standardize the diagnosis of CRS subtypes and lead to more effective treatment for patients Das et al.
