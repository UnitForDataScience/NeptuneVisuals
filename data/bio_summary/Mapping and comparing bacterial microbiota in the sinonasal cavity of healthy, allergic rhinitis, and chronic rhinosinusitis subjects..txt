The samples studied were from 8 healthy subjects n 6 MM n 2 IM 11 AR subjects n 7 MM n 4 IMand 46 CRS patients 25 CRSwNP n 13 MM n 12 IM and 21 CRSsNP n 10 MM n 11 IM.The MM microbiota of CRSsNP patients exhibited lower diversity than those of controls healthy and AR sub- jects or CRSwNP patients p  0.05 nonparametric t test Faith's phylogenetic diversity Shannon diversity Fig.

When separated by clin- ical group healthy AR CRSsNP and CRSwNP subjects we found increasing microbiota heterogeneity in patients with rhinologic disease CRSwNP CRSsNP and AR than in the healthy subjects p0.003 permutational t test Fig.

Taken together these findings indicate that the composition samples within patients are more alike than when compared to the composition of any given sample between patients.Differences in Shannon diversity richness and evenness or phylogenetic diversity were not observed between MM and IM associated microbiota in healthy AR or CRSwNP subjects Fig.

In a study of patients with AR and healthy controls bacterial diversity was increased and correlated with nasal eosinophils in AR patients compared to controls during allergy season.39 In this study we were unable to reproduce the findings of increased variety and diversity in AR patients compared to controls likely due to smaller sample size and not timing specimen collection to specific allergy season.

We compared the micro- biota of the middle meatus MM and inferior meatus IM in healthy allergic rhinitis AR and chronic rhinosinusitis CRS subjects to characterize intrasubject intersubject and intergroup differences.Methods Subjects were recruited in the office and charac- terized into healthy AR and CRS groups.

However these studies need validation in broader cohorts of CRS patients.Inflammation of the middle meatus MM is a common association in CRS2 irrespective of whether this is causative or reflective of the CRS diseased state.3-5 10 11 In contrast the anterior nares and the inferior meatus IM are usu- ally considered to be uninvolved.2 By studying patterns of the MM microbiota vs IM in healthy and CRS subjects one may gain insightful information into dysbiosis associ- ated with or causative to CRS.

also enriched in CRSwNP have been de- tected in the sinuses of CRS and healthy controls36 37 and co-colonization with Staphylococcus Streptococcus and anaerobic taxa in the maxillary sinuses of CRS patients has been reported.38 While co-colonization may play an impor- tant role in bacterial behavior modification whether and how this organism contributes to sinus inflammation is still unknown.The findings from this study can be placed in the con- text of microbiome studies of the airways in patients with asthma and AR which may have some overlapping fea- tures with CRS.

Although CRSwNP patients' SNOT-22 scores were also elevated compared to healthy and AR subjects this did not reach statistical significance p 0.153 Wilcoxon rank sum.

In contrast to healthy AR and CRSwNP subjects CRSsNP MM samples exhibited decreased microbiome di- versity and anaerobic enrichment.

While initial studies have reported that variability between sinuses within the single CRS patient to be significantly less than variability across different patients5 12 they also demonstrate high intrap- atient microbiota variability in a subset of patients that could not be explained due to small sample size a common limitation in CRS microbiome studies.In the current study we surveyed the sinonasal micro- biota of healthy allergic rhinitis AR and CRS subjects.
