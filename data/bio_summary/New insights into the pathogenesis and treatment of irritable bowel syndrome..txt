even in patients with normal mucosa biopsies are recommended to exclude microscopic colitis or other chronic low-grade inflammation especially in patients with diarrhoea .the faecal calprotectin is a noninvasive screening tool for intestinal mucosal inflammation and it appears to be superior to standard testing such as c-reactive protein .

it has been demonstrated that theexpression of nerve growth factor ifn-g toll-like receptor 4tlr4 pre-haptoglobin-2 were seriously increased in patients with ibs in comparison to control group and markedly lower than patients with ulcerative colitis .in conclusion the correct diagnosis is based on four key elements medical history physical examination minimal labora- tory tests and in some cases colonoscopy or other appropriate tests.the severity of ibs may be simply assessed using question- naires.

the relationship between depression and ibs may result both from greater probability of ibs in patients with a history of depression and be also due to secondary development of depression in patients with the already diagnosed fgid .

although the severity of symptoms of ibs was significantly higher in patients with lsss than ll genotype the frequencies of 5httlpr genotypes in overall ibs patients as well as upon stratification in c-ibs and d-ibs were not significantly different from healthy controls.

interestingly patients with ibs-m show increased expression of tlr  which may partly explain the relationship between ibs and psychiatricdisturbances.gut microbiota alterations may induce changes in tlr receptors expression and modulate inflammatory and pain responses colonic motility and sensitivity .the metabolic profile of the gut microbiota in patients with ibs is altered.

therefore it is suggested that not lactose but rather milk-specific components are involved in ibs and reducing milk and dairy products intake may be recommended in these patients .dietary fibre deficiency is an essential factor for ibs-c symptoms although some patients can paradoxically complain of exacerbation of symptoms after consumption of a greater amount of water-insoluble fibre.

patients with celiac disease may develop symptoms suggesting ibs whereas ibs patients may show gluten intolerance .

patients with ncgs as compared to ibs more frequently have extra-intestinal symptoms fatigue headaches anxiety numbness myalgia weight loss and even autism or hallucinations .infectionsin some patients especially with ibs-d the diagnosis can be associated with past history of acute gastrointestinal infection which meets at least two out of the following criteria fever diarrhoea vomiting or the presence of pathogenic bacteria in faeces .

determination of faecal calprotectin concentration is regardedas the best non-invasive screen tool for intestinal mucosal inflammation in these patients .pharmacological treatment of ibsthe treatment should be individualized for each patients and focused on normalizing gastrointestinal motility and leading symptoms improvement .

twelve weeks after the study termination patients reported alleviation of pain and bloating and normalization of bowel motion rhythm by 10 as compared to the placebo receiving patients statistically significant differences .until now distant side effects of rifaximin have not been found nor have been the effects of long-term or repeated rifaximin therapy.

a randomized clinical study conducted in patients with non-constipation ibs showed that a 4-week therapy with this probiotic alleviated patients' complaints especially abdominal pains and bloating .

a randomized double- blind study revealed a favourable effect of the synbiotic containing lactobacillus sporogenes 15 x 107 also called bacillus coagulans and fructooligosaccharide 100 mg which demonstrated reduc- tion of abdominal pains in ibs patients .antidepressantssome patients with ibs also suffer from psychiatric disorders - depressions and anxiety.

the use of three-ring antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris reduced visceral hypersensitivity and alleviated ibs symptoms in 58 and 55 of patients .the tricyclic antidepressants mainly amitriptyline relieve abdominal pains and diarrhoea and improve overall wellbeing of patients which has been confirmed by randomized double-blind studies .the ssris are recommended in ibs-c .

nutrition- al limitations should be individually tailored due to diverse reactions in patients with even the same ibs type.psychotherapyit has been demonstrated that psychotherapy can cause improvement even in 25 of patients with ibs whereas hypnosis and coping with stress techniques result in clinical improvement in 52 and 67 respectively .

recent studies have suggested that visceral hypersensitivity in patients with ibs may be secondary to the activation of the immune cells and low- grade inflammation.
