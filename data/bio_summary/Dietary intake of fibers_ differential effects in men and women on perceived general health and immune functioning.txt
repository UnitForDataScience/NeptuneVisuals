They also exhibit several anti-inflammatory effects and appear to have a role in the regulation of timing of immune responses as well as in the resolution of inflammation.The increasing number of studies supporting the association between dietary intake of fibers the micro- biome and health and immune parameters opens up new approaches in understanding and treating immune related diseases.

This number was significantly higher compared to the male population who reported reduced immunity in 21.3 of the cases p  0.018.Associations between dietary intake and perceived health and immune rate and show the relationship between daily fiber intake and perceived health and immune status.

No significant relationship was found between dietary fiber intake and perceived health and immune rate in women.Daily intake of cereals and grain products correlated significantly with perceived immune functioning r  0.110 p  0.14 but not with general health ratings.

The cutoff values were based on values used previously.Health- and immune statusData on perceived health and immune status was col- lected using 1-item scores ranging from bad to excel- lent on a scale from 0 to 10.

Combining subjec- tive measurements with laboratory assessments including objective analyses of microbial composition and immune parameters are necessary to further explore the impact of fiber intake on health and immune status.AcknowledgementsWe would like thank Liselot Ribbert Leontine Lensvelt Annick de With and Laure Goede for the their help with collecting the data.Disclosure statementJoris Verster has received grantsresearch support from the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment Janssen Nutricia Red Bull and Takeda and has acted as a consultant for the Canadian Beverage Association Centraal Bureau Drogisterijbedrijven Coleman Frost Danone Deenox Eisai Janssen Jazz Purdue Red Bull Sanofi- Aventis Sen-Jam Pharmaceutical Sepracor Takeda Transcept Trimbos Institute and Vital Beverages.

The partial correlation between fiber intake and general health remained significant r  0.151 p  0.002 after controlling for total caloric intake.In men dietary fiber intake correlated significantly with perceived general health status r  0.320 p  0.0001 and immune functioning r  0.281 p  0.002.

Furthermore the cohorts were large enough to achieve sufficient power to be confident about the study outcome despite the gender ratio.Although it is important to have objective assess- ments of immune functioning people are often judging their health based on perceived health status.

Additionally immune function and susceptibility to immune related disease differ between the genders.

Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate potential gender differences in the association between dietary fiber intake and per- ceived general health and immune functioning in healthy young adults.MethodsParticipantsThis study was conducted among Dutch university students.
