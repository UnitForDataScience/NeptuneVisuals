The unique bacterial OTUs in heather and bilberry roots belonged most often to Gammaproteobacteria in lingonberry roots to Alphaproteobacteria and pine roots to Sphingobacteriia 21 29 38 and 25 of all different OTUs with class status data not shown.

a. Pine roots contained the highest 2210 OTUs and bilberry roots the lowest 1685 OTUs numbers of OTUs.

Of the 429 root specific bacterial OTUs only 7 were shared by all roots and pine roots contained the highest numbers of unique OTUs Fig.

Based on this pretesting OTUs which consisted of at least 1 of the total amount of normalized 16S rRNA sequences abun- dant OTUs did not separate bacterial communities of eri- coid and pine roots as well as mycospheres as well asOTUs with less than 1 of sequences rare OTUs.

b Of the less abundant OTUs 70 of the root sequences each including less than 1 of the total amount of normalized sequences only those which characterized groups best or were shared mainly by two groups species scores for LD1 were less than -6.1 and more than 13.6 and for LD2less than -4.5 or more than 2.8 are shown group specific OTUs blackletters shared OTUs gray lettersrRNA gene copy numbers in roots could be due to chem- ical substances causing either biological or technical inhi- bition.

The rarer bacterial OTUs in the various samples were often typical to particular sample type whereas the most abundant OTUs containing 30 of all sequences were common to all soil types regardless of fungal colonization.Thirty-eight percent 1939 OTUs of soil OTUs could be detected from both uncolonized soil and all mycospheres as- sociated with different plant species Fig.

Similar results were reported fromTable 1Shannon H' diversity indices of 16S rRNA gene sequences and their standard deviationsAll soil OTUs 5.43 0.14All root OTUs 4.89 0.14All soil-specific OTUs 5.76 0.20All root-specific OTUs 3.41 0.44P  0.05 significant difference in global Kruskal-Wallis test P  0.01 very significant difference in global Kruskal-Wallis testoak forest .

It is more likely that heather contained more antibacterial or PCR inhibitory substances than lingonberry and the differences in bacterial 16SACaulobacterBradyrhizobiumChitinophagaceaeHeather Bilberry Lingonberry PineAcidobacteriarRNA gene copy numbers found in roots were in the same range as commonly observed in roots .Mycosphere soils contained significantly higher numbers of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies than mycorrhizal roots per gram dry weight.

Nevertheless the bacterial diversities of roots differed significantly P  0.05 only when the OTUs only found in roots were analyzed.DiscussionThis is to our knowledge the first study focusing on the bacteria in the ericoid mycorrhizospheres.

Soil samples contained 5128 OTUs whereas roots of heather bilberry ling- onberry and pine contained together only 2823 OTUs.Alphaproteobacteria appeared to be the most prevalent in all sample types according to both percentages of different Alphaproteobacteria OTUs as well as relative abundance of sequences belonging to the class Fig.
