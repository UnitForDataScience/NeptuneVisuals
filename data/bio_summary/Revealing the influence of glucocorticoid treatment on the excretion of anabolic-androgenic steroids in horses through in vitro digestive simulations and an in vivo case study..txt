This was in line with previously obtained results by  who noted that following intra-articular injection of 1 mL of Celestone Chronodoser into both radial carpal joints of both front knee joints betamethasone could be detected in urine and plasma for three days and one day respectively and no betamethasone acetate could be detected in either urine or plasma .Higher initial glucocorticoid doses than the dose used in this study are however quite common in veterinary medicine.

These results suggest a correlation between the increase in AAS excretion and the endogenous glucocorticoid overshoot after exoge- nous glucocorticoid suppression.In general the analysis of post-treatment urine samples revealed that an influence of the treatment undoubtedly could be measured up to several weeks after betamethasone intra-articular infiltration.

The anti-inflammatory activity of betamethasone has proven 25 times higher than the relative activity of the endogenous corticoid cortisol.Material and methodsIn vivo experimental set-upTo elucidate the in vivo effects of a glucocorticoid treatment on a horse's urinary AAS excretion profile urine samples were collected from a gelding with mild bone spavin treated with 1 mL Chronodose Celestoner in each hock 11.4 mg betamethasone in total.

Given the fact that glucocorticosteroids play an important role in worldwide anti-in- flammatory therapy especially in sport horses it stands clear that further research is needed to elucidate the exact correlation with the excretion of anabolic-androgenic steroids to avoid possibleinadvertent doping results for AAS following glucocorticoid treatment.ConclusionsIn general the analysis of post-treatment urine samples revealed that the influence of glucocorticoid treatment could be measured up to several weeks post-treatment.

Chemical structures of A betamethasone synthetic glucocorticoid and B cortisol endogenous glucocorticoid.

Proper investi- gation on the origin of these AAS is required to guarantee adequate dop- ing policies in the future.Earlier studies have shown that dietary contaminants in feed can cause a positive doping result in urine analysis 0034-5288c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.is it possible for an intra-articular glucocorticoid treatment to change the excretion of AAS in urine to such an extent that the horse will test positive during anti-doping analysis and 2 if so are the micro-organisms of the horse hindgut the key to this process by direct transformation of glucocorticoids to AASFig.

Significant increases of the different compounds are indicated with a letter a testosterone b ADD cd cortisol and cortisone and highlighted in a square in the respective colour.dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy should be kept as low as possible.As betamethasone was being eliminated and betamethasone effect decreased the regulatory positive feedback loop was activated.

Additionally the detection of AAS b-Bol AED andor ADD in urine of horses that were not treated with AAS often coincided with an anti-inflammatory analgesic glucocorticoid therapy in the weeks or months before sampling  .

By esterification a depot effect is created out of which betamethasone is slowly released over time whereas betamethasone- disodiumphosphate renders the glucocorticoid activity on the short term.Urinary samples were collected and analysed on a regular basis to monitor the excretion of AAS and endogenous glucocorticoids over time.

ADD or boldione for instance was not found before treatment but could be found for weeks after treatment with concen- trations up to 4 - 1 ng mL.In vitro digestion biotransformation of glucocorticoidsIn vitro digestion simulations were set up according to a previously validated protocol with different glucocorticoid precursors being sub- mitted to the digestive fermentation reactions cortisol betamethasone cortisone and prednisolone.
