Despite these promising results Vyas et al.

These authors also draw the attention to the study limitations for example the absence of blinding regarding data collection and the low number of in- cluded patients Additionally Vyas et al.

Depending on the applied HIV test a newly infected faeces donor might be missed or the faeces donor might get infected in the period between HIV testing and faeces donation hence yielding a serious risk to the patient transplanted with the faeces After the first randomized controlled trial as performedby van Nood et al.

additional randomized controlled studies have been published -A brief discussion of the randomized controlled trials regarding C. difficile infec- tion treatment via faecal microbiota transplantation that followed van Nood et al.
