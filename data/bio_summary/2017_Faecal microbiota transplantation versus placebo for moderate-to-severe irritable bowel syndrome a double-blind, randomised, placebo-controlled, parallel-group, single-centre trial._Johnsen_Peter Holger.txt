a third participant in the placebo group discontinued loperamide during the trial without any change in severity score.36 65 of 55 participants receiving active treatment versus 12 43 of 28 receiving the placebo showed a response of a decrease in ibssss of more than 75 points at 3 months after fmt p0049 31 56 of55 participants receiving active treatment versus ten 36 of 28 receiving placebo had a similar degree of response at 12 months after fmt p0075.a posthoc analysis of ibssss scores during the whole study using a repeated measures anova with treatment group ibs subtype and presence of other functional disorders as predictors in a fullfactorial model optimised by removing nonsignificant terms showed that of the potential confounding factors none of the variables examined sex age psychiatric comorbidity antibiotics use of loperamide or change in fodmap intake had a significant effect by itself appendix p 2.a further posthoc analysis comparing participants who received fresh transplants those who received frozen transplants and those who received placebo unadjusted for other functional comorbidities suggested that participants who received frozen fmt had loweribssss scores throughout followup than did those who received fresh fmt despite a higher mean baseline and that participants who received fresh fmt showed no response compared with those in the placebo figure 2a.

to account for use of antibiotics that could affect the engraftment process and thereby the outcome we asked if antibiotics were used during the followup period when each participant completed the trial.we also collected patientreported outcome question naires to assess the effect of fmt on fatigue assessed before fmt and at 3 6 and 12 months after fmt and quality of life assessed before fmt and at 6 and12 months after fmt the results for these will be reported elsewhere.outcomesthe primary endpoint was symptom relief of more than 75 points assessed by ibssss 3 months after fmt.

ibs is a very common disease with a global prevalence of at least 112.1 the quality of life for patients with ibs is significantly impaired and the disease imposes asubstantial economic burden on society by increased healthcare expenditures.23 pharmacological treatment options are limited and dietary interventions can be cumbersome to maintain.45 alterations in the intestinal microbiota are gaining increasing interest as a cause for ibs and a dysbiosis of the gut flora is thought to be part of the pathophysiology of ibs.67faecal microbiota transplantation fmt has been suggested as a possible treatment option for restoring normal gut microbiota8-10 but no randomised trials haveresearch in context evidence before this studywe searched pubmed for manuscripts published in english from inception and until oct 20 2015 with the terms irritable bowel syndrome in combination with faecal transplantation faecal bacterio therapy randomized controlled trial dysbiosis or microbiota.

the principle of normalisation of dysbiotic microbiota could be applied in ibs to induce symptom relief or potentially even remission of disease.added value of the studywe interpret our data as a proof of concept that the pathophysiology of ibs might be closely related to changes in the gut microbiota.implications of all the available evidencein combination with the evidence from systematic reviews the results of the trial show that fmt is feasible for patients with ibs and presents as an affordable and effective treatment for a syndrome with limited treatment options.

ibs presents as one of three pheno types ibs with diarrhoea ibs with constipation and ibsmixed ie ibs with diarrhoea and constipation.

we aimed to compare faecal microbiota transplantation fmt with placebo in patients with ibs.methods in this double-blind randomised placebo-controlled parallel-group single-centre study we enrolled patients with ibs with diarrhoea or with diarrhoea and constipation excluding dominating constipation defined by the rome iii criteria scored as moderate to severe according to the ibs severity scoring system ibs-sss a score of175.

in a posthoc analysis adjusting for associated functional disorder comorbidity we found similar effects for both fresh and frozen fmt formulations figure 2.previous findings of symptom relief from a diet low in fodmaps which are fermented by colonic microbiota4 suggest a functional pathogenic effect of the dysbiotic microbiota.23 the present data support this hypothesis and further suggest that fmt might be a way to correct this underlying cause of ibs.

when treating c difficile with fmt the proportion of patients cured has been shown to increase with repeated treatment using an alternative donor.27 repeated treatment for participants who relapse and for nonresponders with fmt from a different donor might yield similar results in ibs.

eligible participants aged 18-75 years were then referred to sjokanten legesenter a centre for general practice physicians where they were reassessed with a questionnaire from the rome foundation for ibs with diarrhoea or mixed ibs according to the rome iii criteria.11participants with mixed ibs were only eligible if constipation was not the dominating symptom.

lastly our initial power calculation used a low placebo response of 10. in hindsight this was unrealistic and the observed statistical power of the study is therefore somewhat lower than we estimated.in conclusion to the best of our knowledge we have done the first randomised controlled trial on the effects of fmt in ibs.

the trial has been extended with an open-labelled study treating the placebo group with frozen fmt for further exploratory studies.findings between jan 1 and oct 30 2015 we recruited 90 participants and randomly assigned them to active treatment n60 or placebo n30.

the randomisation key was revealed to researchers when all participants completed the 12month followup.proceduresall participants underwent fmt at the university hospital of north norway harstad harstad norway within 2-4 weeks of the assessment at the assessment centre.placebo and active transplants were prepared as follows 50-80 g of freshly delivered faeces were mixed with 200 ml of isotonic saline and 50 ml of 85 glycerol homogenised in a blender for 60 s filtered through a 05 mm mesh steel strainer drawn on 50 ml sterile luer lock syringes and sealed.participants' own faeces served as placebo placebo transplants from each participant were prepared 2-4 weeks before intervention and stored at -40degc.

the placebo effect in ibs is known to be high but the effect might be less than 20 for trials running for 3 months or longer.19 higher placebo response is associated with longer duration of treatment and a greater number of office visits.14 in this trial there was only one treatment procedure and no office visits during followup.

by then performing the remaining blocks with frozen to placebo in the ratio 21 we could do post hoc analysis with fresh frozen and placebo in the ratio 111. investigators were aware of the active to placebo ratio of 21 in each block and that the blocks with fresh transplant as active treatment were the first to be done.

fmt is superior to drugs for treating c difficile infection and a restoration of a healthy gut flora is seen after fmt treatment.
