The trial has been extended with an open-labelled study treating the placebo group with frozen FMT for further exploratory studies.Findings Between Jan 1 and Oct 30 2015 we recruited 90 participants and randomly assigned them to active treatment n60 or placebo n30.

By then performing the remaining blocks with frozen to placebo in the ratio 21 we could do post hoc analysis with fresh frozen and placebo in the ratio 111.

The randomisation key was revealed to researchers when all participants completed the 12month followup.ProceduresAll participants underwent FMT at the University Hospital of North Norway Harstad Harstad Norway within 2-4 weeks of the assessment at the assessment centre.Placebo and active transplants were prepared as follows 50-80 g of freshly delivered faeces were mixed with 200 mL of isotonic saline and 50 mL of 85 glycerol homogenised in a blender for 60 s filtered through a 05 mm mesh steel strainer drawn on 50 mL sterile Luer lock syringes and sealed.Participants' own faeces served as placebo placebo transplants from each participant were prepared 2-4 weeks before intervention and stored at -40degC.

The placebo effect in IBS is known to be high but the effect might be less than 20 for trials running for 3 months or longer.19 Higher placebo response is associated with longer duration of treatment and a greater number of office visits.14 In this trial there was only one treatment procedure and no office visits during followup.

ArticlesFaecal microbiota transplantation versus placebo for moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndromea double-blind randomised placebo-controlled parallel-group single-centre trialPeter Holger Johnsen Frank Hilpusch Jorunn Pauline Cavanagh Ingrid Sande Leikanger Caroline Kolstad Per Christian Valle Rasmus GollSummaryBackground Irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a common condition characterised by abdominal pain bloating and poor quality of life.

We aimed to compare faecal microbiota transplantation FMT with placebo in patients with IBS.Methods In this double-blind randomised placebo-controlled parallel-group single-centre study we enrolled patients with IBS with diarrhoea or with diarrhoea and constipation excluding dominating constipation defined by the ROME III criteria scored as moderate to severe according to the IBS severity scoring system IBS-SSS a score of175.

We randomly assigned participants 21 in blocks of six to active or placebo FMT.

Non-study personnel performed the final allocation and standardised the active and placebo transplants to make them identical in appearance and temperature.

The faeces were freshly processed and were used the same day fresh transplant or were stored in a freezer for later use frozen transplant participants' own faeces served as placebo.
