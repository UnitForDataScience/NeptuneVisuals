In conclusion our results demonstrated IDF from pear pomace could prevent high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats mainly by improving the structure of the gut microbiota.Keywords Insoluble dietary fiber anti-obesity gut microbiota amplicon sequencingIntroductionThe long-term intake of a high-fat diet seriously affects human health and results in metabolic disorders and chronic diseases such as overweight fatty liver cardiovascular disease hypertension hypercholesteremia insulin resistance and leptin resistance 1.

Further analysis of the gut microbiota by high-throughput amplicon sequencing showed IDF from pear pomace obviously improved the structure of the gut microbiota.

After finding the potential effect of IDF on the gut microbiota the change in pattern of the gut microbiota was further analyzed by high- throughput amplicon sequencing.

Further analysis of the gut microbiota by high-throughput amplicon sequencing showed that IDF from pear pomace obviously improved the structure of the gut microbiota.

Our results suggested IDF from pear pomace could prevent high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats mainly by improving the structure of the gut microbiota.Materials and MethodsAnimal ModelEight-week-old specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Vital River Laboratories China license number SCXK Beijing 2012-0001.

The rats were then randomly divided into four groups 8 rats per group according to average body weight and the groups were fed with a normal chow diet NCD a high dietary fiber diet HD containing 8 fiber supplement in total a high-fatdiet HF that provided 45 of its energy from fat or a high-fat and dietary fiber diet HFD.

In contrast the HFD rats with fiber supplement in the exhibited a significantly lower AUC p  0.05 and HOMA-IR index p  0.05 compared with the HF rats.

The gut microbiota key lipometabolism gene expression and satiety hormone secretion in these rats were determined by real-time PCR and ELISA.

The physico- chemical properties of dietary fibre determine metabolic responses short-chain fatty acid profiles and gut microbiota composition in rats fed low- and high-fat diets.

Response of gut microbiota and inflammatory status to bitter melon Momordica charantia L. in high fat diet induced obese rats.
