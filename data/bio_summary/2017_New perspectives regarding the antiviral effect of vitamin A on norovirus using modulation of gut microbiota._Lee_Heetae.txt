moreover ifn-g increased significantly in norovirus- associated diarrhea specimens and ifn-l determined the persistence of murine norovirus infection.in addition rig-1 signaling was mediated by antiviral immune responses stimulated by vitamin a against murine norovirus but the antiviral effect of lactobacillus sp was not rig-1-dependent.modulation of gut microbiota by vitamin a and murine norovirusrecent studies have indicated that norovirus replica- tion was related to the intestinal environment includ- ing gut microbiota.

various beneficial effects of supple- mentation with lactobacillus have been reported in clinical settings.the genus lactobacillus currently contains over 180 species and the effect of lactobacillus sp is likely to be strain-dependent.among them certain lactoba- cillus sp have demonstrated antiviral effects against other viral infections such as rotavirus and human papillomavirus.although we did no clearly identi- fied lactobacillus sp in fecal material the development of potential lactobacillus probiotics to prevent norovi- ral infection needs to be studied further with the inclusion of clinical trials.further studyfirstly the mechanism by which the abundance of lactobacillus sp in gut microbiota is modulated by vitamin a should be identified to understand the inhibition of murine norovirus by vitamin a. we showed a correlation between lactobacillus sp vita- min a and murine norovirus that supports the anti-noroviral effect of modulating gut microbiota via vitamin a administration.

although activation of ifns by rig-1 and mda5 signaling plays a key role in antiviral effects against a variety of different viruses an increase in expression levels of those genes was not observed during inhibition of murine norovirus by lactobacillus sptherefore we could also investigate whether specific chemokines such as chemokine c-c motif ligand 2 ccl2 and interleukin 8 il-8 arefigure 1. model of murine norovirus inhibition by vitamin a. in this study the abundance of lactobacillus sp was considered to inhibit the murine norovirus proliferation via the upregulation of ifn-b ra administration increased their abundance levels.involved in the immune response against murine nor- ovirus infection.finally murine norovirus was used as a surrogate for human norovirus due to the lack of a cell culture infection model for human norovirus.

these results strongly support our results that the modula- tion of gut microbiota is related to the inhibition of murine norovirus.in our study we characterized the gut microbiome by vitamin a administration and murine norovirus infection 103 genera of bacteria were identified in the murine norovirus-infected mouse group during vita- min a administration and 75 were also found in other groups.

fecal microbiota transplantation using gut microbiota modulated by vitamin a could provide useful information to elucidate the antiviral effect of murine norovirus inhibition.secondly we could investigate the antiviral effect of vitamin a on murine norovirus independently of the modulation of gut microbiota.

therefore the activation of ifns by vitamin a and increased proportion of lactobacillus sp plays a crucial role in the antiviral immune response against murine norovirus infection.putative probiotic candidates using modulation of gut microbiotaa recent study reported an antiviral effect on murine norovirus replication using lactobacillus paracasei harboring nucleic acid-hydrolyzing 3d8 scfv.in ourstudy lactobacillus sp were suggested as preventive probiotics against murine norovirus.

our findings provide new perspectives on how vitamin a exerts an antiviral effect against norovirusc 2017 taylor  francisand indicate a novel therapeutic strategy for the devel- opment of antiviral agents through gut microbiota modulation.inhibitory effect of vitamin a on murine norovirus replicationvitamin a administration was considered to prevent norovirus infection and improve the clinical symp- toms.however there has been no further study to evaluate the antiviral mechanism of vitamin a related to the control of norovirus infection.

in our study we showed that vitamin a effectively inhibited murine norovirus murine norovirus 1 replication in vitro and in vivo providing evidence of the antiviral effect of vitamin a on norovirus.

therefore we expected that the abun- dance of certain bacterial taxa play an important role in the antiviral effect of vitamin a against murine nor- ovirus infection.the composition of the gut microbiome was changed significantly with murine norovirus infection in icr mice unlike the situation with swiss webster and inbred c57bl6 mice.

recently there has been the remarkable research development of the replication of human norovirus using stem cell-derived human enteroids.therefore the antiviral effect of vitamin a via modulation of gut microbiota could be better validated using this model for human norovirus in further studies.concluding remarkswe first identified that vitamin a administration effectively inhibited murine norovirus replication in vitro and in vivo.

moreover vitamin a modulated the composition of gut microbiota the increase in the relative abundance of lactobacillus sp was remarkable after murine norovirus infection during vitamin a administration.

previous studies have revealed that mda5- and stat-1-deficient mice had a defect in their immune response to murine norovirus.in the current study we investigated the possibility that gut microbiota modulated by vitamin a during norovirus infection could have a potential role in the treatment of and preventive measures against norovi- rus.

based on koch's postulates lactobacillus sp isolated from the modu- lated gut microbiota after vitamin a administration should be tested for inhibition of murine norovirus.
