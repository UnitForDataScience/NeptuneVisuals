Moreover IFN-g increased significantly in norovirus- associated diarrhea specimens and IFN-l determined the persistence of murine norovirus infection.In addition RIG-1 signaling was mediated by antiviral immune responses stimulated by vitamin A against murine norovirus but the antiviral effect of Lactobacillus sp was not RIG-1-dependent.Modulation of gut microbiota by vitamin A and murine norovirusRecent studies have indicated that norovirus replica- tion was related to the intestinal environment includ- ing gut microbiota.

These results strongly support our results that the modula- tion of gut microbiota is related to the inhibition of murine norovirus.In our study we characterized the gut microbiome by vitamin A administration and murine norovirus infection 103 genera of bacteria were identified in the murine norovirus-infected mouse group during vita- min A administration and 75 were also found in other groups.

Therefore the activation of IFNs by vitamin A and increased proportion of Lactobacillus sp plays a crucial role in the antiviral immune response against murine norovirus infection.Putative probiotic candidates using modulation of gut microbiotaA recent study reported an antiviral effect on murine norovirus replication using Lactobacillus paracasei harboring nucleic acid-hydrolyzing 3D8 scFv.In ourstudy Lactobacillus sp were suggested as preventive probiotics against murine norovirus.

In this study the abundance of Lactobacillus sp was considered to inhibit the murine norovirus proliferation via the upregulation of IFN-b RA administration increased their abundance levels.involved in the immune response against murine nor- ovirus infection.Finally murine norovirus was used as a surrogate for human norovirus due to the lack of a cell culture infection model for human norovirus.

Therefore we expected that the abun- dance of certain bacterial taxa play an important role in the antiviral effect of vitamin A against murine nor- ovirus infection.The composition of the gut microbiome was changed significantly with murine norovirus infection in ICR mice unlike the situation with Swiss Webster and inbred C57BL6 mice.

Fecal microbiota transplantation using gut microbiota modulated by vitamin A could provide useful information to elucidate the antiviral effect of murine norovirus inhibition.Secondly we could investigate the antiviral effect of vitamin A on murine norovirus independently of the modulation of gut microbiota.

Previous studies have revealed that MDA5- and STAT-1-deficient mice had a defect in their immune response to murine norovirus.In the current study we investigated the possibility that gut microbiota modulated by vitamin A during norovirus infection could have a potential role in the treatment of and preventive measures against norovi- rus.

Our findings provide new perspectives on how vitamin A exerts an antiviral effect against norovirusc 2017 Taylor  Francisand indicate a novel therapeutic strategy for the devel- opment of antiviral agents through gut microbiota modulation.Inhibitory effect of vitamin A on murine norovirus replicationVitamin A administration was considered to prevent norovirus infection and improve the clinical symp- toms.However there has been no further study to evaluate the antiviral mechanism of vitamin A related to the control of norovirus infection.

In our study we showed that vitamin A effectively inhibited murine norovirus Murine norovirus 1 replication in vitro and in vivo providing evidence of the antiviral effect of vitamin A on norovirus.

suggested that murine norovirus can replace the beneficial function of bacterial microbiota.
