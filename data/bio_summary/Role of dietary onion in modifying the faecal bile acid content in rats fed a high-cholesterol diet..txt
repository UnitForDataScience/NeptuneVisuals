in high cholesterol diet fed rats evi- denced increases in the excretion of bile acids and sterols.9On the other hand the consumptions of onion and onion powder have been shown to exert a direct impact on the modu- lation of biliary cholesterol which influence the cholesterol nucleation and contribute to their anti-lithogenic poten- tial1011 the lipid profile under conditions of metabolic dis- orders and diseases12 and the hepatic conversion of chole- sterol into bile acids exerting hepatoprotection.13 In this regard the hepatoprotective effect of both dietary onion and some of its principal bioactive components has consistently been shown through the enhancement of the antioxidant capa- bility and the activities of the enzyme systems.14 In addition a recent study by our group evidenced the preventive effect of an onion ingredient in both hepatic markers and inflammatory responses in hypercholesterolemic Wistar rats.

Some studies have suggested that taurine-conjugated BA may help prevent the development of NAFLD.32-34 Recently a new study suggested that the development of NAFLD was partlyassociated with a decrease in the levels of taurine-conjugated BA and butyrate-producing microbiota.35 In this sense the fer- mentation of onion products has also demonstrated that the presence of fructans increases the production of total short fatty acids including propionate acetate and butyrate in the caecum of rats.36Therefore supplementation with onion might contribute to reduced BA deconjugation which usually counts as a risk factor for worsening NAFLD.ConclusionsA HPLC-MSMS method for the measurement of BA in faecal samples has allowed the description of the shifts produced over 7 weeks of HC feeding and the supplementation with an onion ingredient.

For the acclimatisation to metabolic cages animals were nourish a control diet based on the AIN-93 M semi-purified rodent diet15 whose composition is specified in ESI Table 1.The three experimental semi-synthetic diets were prepared and given according to 1 the control C diet composed of a homogeneous mixture of 100 rodent diet 2 the high-chole- sterol HC diet composed of the control diet with 2 chole- sterol and 0.5 cholic acid and 3 the high-cholesterol enriched with onion HCO diet identical to the HC diet but with 10 onion powder balancing the dietary fibre with cell- ulose powder.

Thus evidence suggests that the changes in faecal bile acids observed in this study should be interpreted in an inte- grated way where faeces reflect the changes in BA produced in response to HC-feeding and act as a determinant of enzymes nuclear receptors and modify the gut microbiota and its metab- olites and subsequently the quantity of BA excreted.3.2 Effect of the onion ingredient on the bile acid profile of high-cholesterol fed ratsThe effects of onion supplementation on lipid metabolism and its role in preventing hepatic impairments have been the objective of several studies.

4.The consumption of garlic onion powder and some of their components such S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide has beenreported to induce enhancement of faecal sterol excretion and up-regulation of LXRa and CYP7A1 under hypercholesterole- mic conditions.92728 Amelioration of cholesterol levels in response to onion consumption usually provokes an increase in its synthesis that is compensated by an increase in the excretion of cholesterol and BA.

The objective of this study was to describe the shifts in faecal bile acid BA composition induced by feeding a high-cholesterolcholic acid diet HC over 7 weeks of experimental feeding in Wistar rats and to evaluate the effect of onion included as a functional ingredient HCO.

HCO feeding indicated significant changes in specific primary and secondary BA in both the unconjugated and conjugated forms caused by the addition of the onion ingredient to the diet.

by supplementation with onion.

Therefore the present study had a double purpose of describing the changes induced by feeding a HC diet in the faecal BA composition during a 7-week experiment and asses-sing the effect of supplementation with an onion ingredienton the excretion of BA thus evaluating its concentration in faeces with a chronological perspective.Materials and methodsExperimental designTwenty-four male Wistar rats with a body weight of approxi- mately 250 g at the outset were obtained from Harlan Laboratories Models Harlan SL Barcelona Spain.
