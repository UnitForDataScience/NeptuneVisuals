nevertheless the particular conse- quences of a hc diet evaluated in parallel with the effect ofonion on ba excretion have not been established until this study.the supplementation of a hc diet with the onion ingredi- ent caused significant changes in the composition of specific ba found in the faeces table 2. the general trend found in the hco group was similar to that of the hc group.

for the acclimatisation to metabolic cages animals were nourish a control diet based on the ain-93 m semi-purified rodent diet15 whose composition is specified in esi table 1.the three experimental semi-synthetic diets were prepared and given according to 1 the control c diet composed of a homogeneous mixture of 100 rodent diet 2 the high-chole- sterol hc diet composed of the control diet with 2 chole- sterol and 0.5 cholic acid and 3 the high-cholesterol enriched with onion hco diet identical to the hc diet but with 10 onion powder balancing the dietary fibre with cell- ulose powder.

some studies have suggested that taurine-conjugated ba may help prevent the development of nafld.32-34 recently a new study suggested that the development of nafld was partlyassociated with a decrease in the levels of taurine-conjugated ba and butyrate-producing microbiota.35 in this sense the fer- mentation of onion products has also demonstrated that the presence of fructans increases the production of total short fatty acids including propionate acetate and butyrate in the caecum of rats.36therefore supplementation with onion might contribute to reduced ba deconjugation which usually counts as a risk factor for worsening nafld.conclusionsa hplc-msms method for the measurement of ba in faecal samples has allowed the description of the shifts produced over 7 weeks of hc feeding and the supplementation with an onion ingredient.

in high cholesterol diet fed rats evi- denced increases in the excretion of bile acids and sterols.9on the other hand the consumptions of onion and onion powder have been shown to exert a direct impact on the modu- lation of biliary cholesterol which influence the cholesterol nucleation and contribute to their anti-lithogenic poten- tial1011 the lipid profile under conditions of metabolic dis- orders and diseases12 and the hepatic conversion of chole- sterol into bile acids exerting hepatoprotection.13 in this regard the hepatoprotective effect of both dietary onion and some of its principal bioactive components has consistently been shown through the enhancement of the antioxidant capa- bility and the activities of the enzyme systems.14 in addition a recent study by our group evidenced the preventive effect of an onion ingredient in both hepatic markers and inflammatory responses in hypercholesterolemic wistar rats.

the amount of maize starch in the hc and hco diets was adjusted to compensate for the addition of chole- sterol and cholic acid in the hc diet and onion powder in the hco diet esi table 2. the experimental period lasted for 7 weeks during which water and food were provided ad libitum.

b compounds tentatively identified by using databases.a high-cholesterol hc diet containing cholic acid ca has been classically considered as potentially atherogenic20 and diverse findings also established a clear relationship with hepatic damage which is characterized by steatosis inflam- mation and fibrosis.2021 feeding the animals with a hc diet modified the faecal ba by increasing its subsequent excretiontable 2. muricholic acids mca hyodeoxycholic acids hdca and deoxycholic acid dca were the main ba found at the beginning of the experiment in all groups and remained dominant throughout the experiment in the c group.

red and green arrows show the comparison of hc vs. c and hco vs. hc groups respectively.

5 outlines the modifications found in faecal ba within each group after 7 weeks of hc and hco-feeding.in addition the gut microbiota is responsible for convert- ing primary ba to secondary ba and affects the ratio of conju- gated forms.31 at the end of the experiment the hco group showed a tendency to augment the concentration of conju- gated forms compared with the hc group which could indi- cate an amelioration over the negative impact of hc-feeding.

the objective of this study was to describe the shifts in faecal bile acid ba composition induced by feeding a high-cholesterolcholic acid diet hc over 7 weeks of experimental feeding in wistar rats and to evaluate the effect of onion included as a functional ingredient hco.

therefore the present study had a double purpose of describing the changes induced by feeding a hc diet in the faecal ba composition during a 7-week experiment and asses-sing the effect of supplementation with an onion ingredienton the excretion of ba thus evaluating its concentration in faeces with a chronological perspective.materials and methodsexperimental designtwenty-four male wistar rats with a body weight of approxi- mately 250 g at the outset were obtained from harlan laboratories models harlan sl barcelona spain.
