In conclusion PACAP deficiency is accompanied by distinct changes in fecal microbiota composition with virtually absent bifidobacteria as a major hallmark that might be linked to increased susceptibility to disease.Keywords intestinal microbiota dynamics pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide PACAP bifidobacteria intestinal ecology gut-brain axis predisposition to immunopathology probiotic immunomodulationIntroductionPituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide PACAP was initially identified as a neuropeptide in the hypothalamus stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in the pituitary gland 1.

In the present study we therefore addressed whether PACAP deficiency was associated with qualitative andor quantita- tive differences in the gut microbiota repertoire that in turn may be linked to the phenotypes and increased susceptibil- ity to immunopatholocal conditions observed in PACAP gene-deficient mice.

To accomplish this we performed a comprehensive kinetic survey of the intestinal microbiota composition in PACAP-- and corresponding WT mice starting 2 weeks postpartum until 18 months of age apply- ing culture-independent molecular techniques.MethodsMicePACAP gene-deficient PACAP-- mice and correspond- ing WT counterparts were raised and maintained in open cages within an experimental semi-barrier accessible only with laboratory coat overshoes caps and sterile gloves under standard conditions 22-24 degC room temperature55 - 15 humidity 12 h light12 dark cycle in the ani- mal facilities of the University of Pecs Pecs Hungary.

9B.Genotype-dependent differences in fecal microbiota of PACAP-- and WT mice at defined time points postpartumWhen comparing total eubacterial gene numbers in fecal samples derived from WT and PACAP-- mice at defined time points postpartum no differences could be observed n.s.

Potential pertubations of the intestinal microbiota in PACAP-- mice however have not been addressed so far.

For the first time we performed a comprehensive survey of the intestinal microbiota composition in PACAP-- and wildtype WT mice starting 2 weeks postpartum until 18 months of age applying quantitative culture-independent techniques.

Fecal enterobacteria and enterococci were lower in PACAP-- than WT mice aged 1 month and 6 months respectively.
