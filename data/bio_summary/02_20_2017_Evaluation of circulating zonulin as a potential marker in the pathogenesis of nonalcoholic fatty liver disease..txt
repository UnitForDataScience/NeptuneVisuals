who established the interrelation between theinflammatory markers haptoglobin IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor receptors TNFRs added to bacterial cell counts and serum zonulin in the obese people 23.Consequently the current study was designed to find the possible role of circulating zonulin in NAFLD adult patients either with simple steatosis or with NASH and its relation to liver status bio- chemical parameters and inflammatory cytokine IL-6.The stepwise increase in serum zonulin levels in NAFLD patients than healthy individuals and in NASH patients than those with simple steatosis had reflected a substantial role of serum zonulin in NAFLD pathogenesis and progression to NASH in adultery cohort as proved in this study.The documented positive linkage between serum zonulin levels with the clinical biochemical and histopathological markers of NAFLD BMI ALT triglycerides fasting insulin HOMA-IR and IL-6 had validated their role in adultery NASH provi- sion as previously reported in children by Pacifico et al.

The diagnosis of NAFLD was based on magnetic resonance imaging MRI with high hepatic fat fraction HFF  5 4 which was confirmed by liver biopsy as recommended by the AASLD guidelines of NAFLD diagnosis in addi- tion to the absence of competing or co-existing etiologies for hepatic steatosis significant alcohol consumption hepatitis C medications parenteral nutrition Wilson's disease and severe malnutrition 15.Exclusion criteriaSubjects with the history of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2 diabetes other causes of chronic liver diseaseincluding hepatic viral infections hepatitis A B C and other viruses that cause viral hepatitis cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus autoimmune hepatitis meta- bolic liver disease a-1-antitrypsin deficiency cystic fibro- sis Wilson's disease hemochromatosis and celiac disease were excluded from the study.

As NAFLD is the most prevailing cause of chronic liver injury in urbanized countries a lot of authenticated research had been prospectively exerted 3.Starting from hepatic steatosis - a two-sided con- dition - it can resolve spontaneously andor can progress to a necroinflammatory condition named nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH then to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis with high susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma 4.Received 8 January 2016.

2008 had highlighted on IL-6 production proinflammatory cytokine and NASH development as well as in systemic insulin resistance and diabetes 14.However the theoretical connection between cir- culating zonulin and inflammatory cytokines and their role in pathogenesis of NAFLD in adults yet had to be concealed.AIM OF THE STUDYThis study was designed to assess the relationship between serum zonulin levels correlated with the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and metabolic and biochemical parameters along with the histopatho- logical features of liver injury in NAFLD patients.PATIENTS AND METHODSThe study included 56 adult subjects 22 males and 34 females age range 29-46 years with chronically elevated aminotransferase levels at least 6 months who presented to the outpatient clinics of the Hepatology Department of the National Liver Institute Menofia University.

Also those sub- jects with renal disease smoking or alcohol consump- tion and use of anti-inflammatory drugs antibiotics and any other hepatotoxic drugs were excluded from the study.Twenty healthy subjects 12 females and 8 males matched for age gender BMI of the patients were enrolled in the study as the control group they were selected from potential group of liver donors they also have the same exclusion criteria as the patient group.The research protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee NLI Menofia University and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects who participated in the study.Patients and controls were subjected tofull history taking along with thorough clinical exami- nationabdominal ultrasonographyliver biopsy to assess the presence of NASH and degree of fibrosis.

The main histologic features of NAFLD were scored according to the scoring system developed by the NASH Clinical Research Network CNR 16 steatosis grade 0 5 macrovesicular fat grade 1 mild  5-33 grade 2 moder- ate  34-66 and grade 3 severe  66 portal inflammation 0-2 lobular inflammation 0-3 bal- looning degeneration 0-2 and fibrosis stage 0-4.Laboratory investigationsBlood samples were taken from each subject after an overnight fast for estimation of glucose insulin C pep- tide lipid profile total cholesterol high-density lipopro- tein cholesterol HDL-C low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C and triglycerides liver function tests alanine aminotransferase ALT aspartate aminotrans- ferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase GGT.
