the high regulation on the synthesis of bacterial cds along with the presence of cysteine efflux systems in bacteria suggests the necessity for cysteine homeostasis in bacteria to prevent cytotoxic effects .sulfonates and the production of sulfite from taurinethe preferred sulfur sources for the intestinal microbiota are sulfate sulfite sulfide and cysteine while sulfonates and sulfate esters function as alternate sulfur sources .

various bacteria are attached to the outer mucous layer forming a biofilm which excludes pathogens and promotes fermentative bacteria to convert mucin glycans to butyrate which is important energy source for the colonocytes.in healthy tissue the first step in sulfide oxidation is catalyzed by sqr sulfide quinone reductase with the formation of a protein-bound persulfide and electrons from the oxidation of sulfur are diverted to ubiquinone in the mitochondrial electron transport scheme  .sqr s-s th h2s  sqr-ssh dsqr oxidationth sqr-ssh th so sqr-sh th s2odthiosulfate sulfur transferase or rhodanesethsqr-ssh th o2 th h2o  so2- th sqr-shth 2hthdsulfur dioxygenasethso2- th 05o2  so2-dsulfite oxidasethas h2s diffuses from the lumen to the colonocytes low levels of hydrogen sulfide stimulate oxygen consumption by mitochondrial respiration but at 20 lm h2s mito- chondrial cytochrome oxidase in colonocytes is inhibited .

found that bacteria exposed to hydrogen peroxide or ampicillin that were lacking h2s enzymes had more dna breaks than cells capable of producing h2s or had exogenous h2s supplementation suggesting that h2s protects chromosomal dna.

dsrab genes are also present in some bacteria that are unable to use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor including sulfite-reducing bacteria desulfito- bacterium and desulfitibacter  sulfur-disproportion- ating bacteria desulfocapsa sulfoexigens  and bacteria metabolizing organosulfonates to internally pro- duce sulfite for respiration such as bilophila wadsworthia  .

while hydrogen sulfide in the intestinal biosystem may be beneficial to bacteria by increasing resistance to antibiotics and protecting them from reactive oxygen species hydrogen sulfide at elevated concentrations may become toxic to the host.keywords sulfide production  sulfate-reducing bacteria gut bacteria  antibiotic resistanceintroductionhydrogen sulfide h2s biomedical research is a burgeon- ing field with a number of recent reviews -.

while both cbs and cse have broad substrate capabilities  cse is capable of producing hydrogen sulfide from five different reactions involving cysteine or homocysteine  .in bacteria cysteine desulfhydrase cd accounts for the hydrolysis of cysteine with the release of pyruvate ammonia and hydrogen sulfide see fig.

one enzyme is cse which releases hydrogen sulfide and serine from cysteine another appears to be a ''l-cysteine lyase'' perhaps similar to a cse in that it combines two cysteine residues with the production of lanthionine and hydrogen sulfide and two distinct proteins that have cysteine desulfhydrase activity .although the quantity of d-cysteine in the intestine is considered to be small d-cysteine can interfere with metabolism of l-cysteine and several bacteria have the capability to metabolize d-cysteine.

due to the substantial evidence that h2s acts as a cytoprotectant for bacterial cells in the presence of antimicrobials it is imperative for future studies to look into routes of h2s production inhibition or h2s inactivation to improve the efficacy of antibiotics.the thiosulfate shunt and recycling of hydrogen sulfidethere are several bacterial processes that may result in production of h2s in the colon fig.

some h2s is released by flatulence and feces while a significant quantity of h2s is oxidized by colonocytes to thiosulfate and tetrathionate.the presence of thiosulfate in cecal venus blood  not only reflects the detoxification of h2s but also the recy- cling of h2s.

are inhibited by 4-7 mm hydrogen sulfide .thus it appears that sulfidogenic enzymes of srb are less subject to regulation than intestinal bacteria relying on an organic sulfur mole- cule for sulfide production.srb are not always the key bacteria in contributing to ulcerative colitis because there are instances where the production of hydrogen sulfide in the gut by heterotrophic bacteria exceeds that of dissimilatory sulfate reducers .

while sulfate-reducing bacteria are considered as the principal agents for hydrogen sulfide production the enzymatic desulfhydration of cysteine by heterotrophic bacteria also contributes to production of hydrogen sulfide.

this brings up the possibility that some species of bacteria at the oxic- anoxic interface in the intestinal tract could oxidize h2s to sulfite or thiosulfate using an aerobic electron transport system.it is relevant here to discuss the metabolic capability of microaerophilic bacteria in the human gut as related to sulfur metabolism.

along with the development of new onset crohn's disease was a diminished population of bacteria that produced butyrate which is an energy source for colonocytes and an increase in sulfidogenic bacteria .h2s antibiotic resistance and glutathionethere is evidence that h2s is a bacterial cytoprotectant molecule against antimicrobials and oxidative stress.

since cysteine is an important substrate for many of these sulfide-generating enzymes cysteine homeostasis in the bacteria is also an issue.

an added dimension is that the homeostatic levels of cysteine within bacterial cells are not the same as indicated by the tolerance of pantoea ananatis to cysteine which is markedly greater than for escherichia coli .from the stand point of enzymology the enzymes with cd activity in bacteria have important roles in cellular metabolism other than hydrogen sulfide production and enzyme regulation would be to address their primary physiological activity.
