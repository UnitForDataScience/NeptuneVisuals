In this study we compared the in- cidence of feline calicivirus FCV infection in cats with FORL FCGS and unaffected controls in order to determine whether FCV could be one of the initiating causes of FORL.A total of 90 cats were recruited to the study from the Nestle Purina PetCare facility St. Joseph MO USA 40 cats with FORL 25 cats with FCGS and 25 unaffected control cats with no signs of oral disease.

Fisher's exact test indicated statistically significant differences in their FCV sta- tus between the three groups p b 0.05 and principally between the FORL and FCGS groups p b 0.05.Our data confirms earlier studies which show a strong association of FCV with FCGS.

The incidence of FCV was as follows 6 24.0 of 24 control cats 9 22.5 of 40 cats with FORL and 15 60.0 of 25 cats with FCGS were positive for FCV.

However significant differences were observed in the incidence of FCV between control and FCGS p  0.010 and between FORL and FCGS p  0.006.

It is concluded that although FCV may be associated with FCGS it appears unlikely to play a role in FORL.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion FORL and feline chronic gingivostomatitis FCGS are two of the most common oro-dental dis- eases of cats.

Of the 40 FORL cats only 9 22.5 were positive for FCV while in the FCGS group 15 60.0 cats were positive for FCV .

However when the control group was compared with the FCGS group a significant difference in the incidence of FCV was observed p  0.010 and when FORL was compared with FCGS a significant dif- ference was also observed p  0.006 .

showed that FCV shedding in a cat with FCGS ceased following an 11-month treatment regime to treat FCGS with thalidomide and lactoferrin.

Feline calicivirus FCV has been associated with the presence of FCGS and is thought to play a role in the initiation of this disease.

In this study the incidence of FCV was investigated in cats with FORL and FCGS and compared to unaffected con- trols.
