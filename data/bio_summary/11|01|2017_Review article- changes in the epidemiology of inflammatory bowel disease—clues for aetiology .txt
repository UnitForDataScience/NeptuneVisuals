The relative risk of Crohn's disease in current smokers compared with those who had never smoked was 1.33 95 CI 0.7 2.6 in men and 4.99 95 CI 2.7 9.2 in women the corresponding results for ulcerative colitis were 0.96 95 CI 0.5 1.8 in men and 0.72 95 CI 0.4 1.4 inwomen.47 In a meta analysis of 13 studies examining the relationship between ulcerative colitis and smoking and of nine examining the relationship between Crohn's disease and smoking there was an association between current smoking and Crohn's disease OR 1.76 95 CI 1.40-2.22 and former smoking and ulcerative colitis OR 1.79 95 CI 1.37-2.34.48 Current smoking had a protective effect on the development of ulcerative colitis when compared with con-mice were compared after a smoke exposure of 24 weeks.

Yet Dethlefson et al has shown that short courses of ciprofloxacin in healthy humans can have long- lasting effects on some gut microbial taxa.4445 Using the University of Manitoba IBD Epidemiology Database we have shown that adultswith IBD were 1.5 times more likely to have been prescribed antibi- otics up to 5 years prior to disease diagnosis than matched con- trols.46 In the Ungaro et al meta-analysis of antibiotic use prior to diagnosis adults with Crohn's disease had an odds ratio of antece- dent antibiotic use beyond 1 year from their diagnosis of 1.43 95 CI 1.12 1.83 but there was no increased risk of developing ulcera- tive colitis OR  1.06 95 CI 0.91-1.27.22 SMOKING AND IBDOne factor that has long been associated with Crohn's disease has been smoking although there is still a knowledge gap as to how smoking might trigger the onset of Crohn's disease or how it may lead to a more aggressive disease course.

It is noteworthy that countries with the highest rates of Crohn's dis- ease have among the lowest rates of adult male smoking while coun- tries with low rates of Crohn's disease have among the highest rates of adult male smokers.56 ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES A meta-analysis of nearly 14 studies published in 2008 showed that current use of oral contraceptives is associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease relative risk RR 1.46 95 CI 1.26-1.70.57 In ulcerative colitis after accounting for smoking the risk conferred by oral contraceptives use was less RR 1.28 95 CI 1.06-1.54.

In the Nurses' Health Study current use of oral contraceptives was associ- ated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease HR 2.82 95 CI 1.65-4.82 but not ulcerative colitis HR 1.22 95 CI 0.74-2.07.58In a nationwide Swedish study long-term use of oral contraceptives particularly the combination type was associated with an increased risk of surgery among women with established Crohn's disease.59 Hence like with smoking that oral contraceptives could worsen out- comes in Crohn's disease suggests a potential role in the pathobiol- ogy of the disease.

In one of the few prospective study the Nurses' Health Study the multi- variate HR of Crohn's disease was 1.90 95 CI 1.42-2.53 among current smokers and 1.35 95 CI 1.05-1.73 among former smok- ers.49 Increasing pack-years was associated with increasing risk of Crohn's disease Ptrend  .0001 whereas smoking cessation was attenuated the risk.

The trends of theGenerale de l'Education Nationale cohort of women living in France aged 40-65 years high total protein intake specifically animal pro- tein was associated with a significantly increased risk of IBD third vs first tertile hazard ratio HR for total protein  3.31 95 CI 1.41-7.77 and HR for animal protein  3.03 95 CI 1.45-6.34.32 The large EPIC study that included approximately 200000 Euro- peans from six countries reported that persons with the highest intake of omega-6 fatty acids compared with omega-3 fatty acids were more likely to present as adults with ulcerative colitis OR2.49 95 CI 1.23 to 5.07.33 In the Nurse's Health Study diet- ary fish fruit fibre potassium and zinc were shown to be protective against developing Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis34-37 while a high intake of omega-3 fatty acids was protective against developing ulcerative colitis.38 Vitamin D has also been studied and both by geographic inference southern latitudes within the US hav- ing lower incidence rates and by direct serological measurements the Nurse's Health Study has suggested that higher vitamin D levels can be protective against developing IBD.

Ungaro undertook a meta-analysis of studies assessing antibiotic use in children and found consistent results across most studies and an odds ratio OR of 2.75 95 CI 1.72 4.38 for children with Crohn's disease having used antibiotics compared to controls.22 Although antibiotic use was not associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis OR  1.11 95 CI 0.77-1.60.

Even childhood diets limited to milk lead to different faecal microbiota depending on the type of milk including when breast milk is mixed with formula milk.27 The most recent meta-analysis also reported that ever being breastfed was associated with a lower risk of Crohn's disease OR 0.71 95 CI 0.59-0.85 and ulcerative colitis OR 0.78 95 CI 0.67-0.91.28 These researchers went two steps further with the data.

They also reported that the strongest decrease in risk was for breastfeeding for at least 12 months for Crohn's disease OR 0.20 95 CI 0.08-0.50 and ulcerative colitis OR 0.21 95 CI 0.10-0.43 as compared to 3 or 6 months.Prospective studies exploring breastfeeding exclusivity and dura- tion in relation to other feeding types and their association with IBD are much needed.
