This increase was likely attributable to microbial activity since PREY th AMPICILLIN set-ups yielded the lowest increments in ammonium.Soluble protein DA595 accumulated in pitcher fluids with time in all treatments perhaps due to the gradual release of oligopeptides by the action of fluid enzymes on insoluble prey proteins c. This occurred fastest in the presence of dipteran larvae with the most rapid protein accumulation taking place in the early phase of the experiment possibly because E. schuitemakeri greatly fragmented prey carcasses while feeding increasing the exposed surface areas and exoske- leton breakages in prey carcasses for the access of fluid proteolytic enzymes.

Anand and Hugh Tiang Wah TanDepartment of Biological Sciences National University of Singapore 14 Science Drive 4 Singapore 117543 Republic of SingaporeWNL KYC HTWT IntroductionCarnivorous pitcher plants of the genus Nepenthes produce modified water- holding leaf structures that capture and digest animal prey to supplement their nutrient requirements Some organisms have adapted to living in the aquatic habitats provided by pitchers and may even be entirely dependent on Nepenthes for their survival Dipteran larvae are key components of such communities and are thought to facilitate pitcher nitrogen sequestration by converting insolu- ble protease-inaccessible prey protein into inorganic nitrogen which is then absorbed by pitcher glands The idea of digestive mutualism is certainly not restricted to the genus Nepenthes and has been demonstrated variously across many unrelated carnivorous plant taxa  Dipteran larvae inhabiting pitchers of the functionally similar North American Sarracenia purpurea facilitate the conversion of protein into inorganic nitrogen which is then absorbed by the plant providing an energetically efficient nitrogen sequestration mechanism for their host Scharmann et al.

Using dipteran larvae prey and fluid volumes mimicking in situ N. gracilis pitcherconditions we con- ducted in vitro digestion experiments and measured changes in available fluid nitrogen in response to dipteran larvae and microbe presence.

Many researchers believe that microbes benefit the pitcher by assist- ing in prey decomposition and nitrogen sequestration  or even prevent prey escape by reducing the surface tension of pitcher fluid .

DOD600 was highest in PREY ONLY and lowest in CULICIDS 2.DiscussionWe showed that the presence of dipteran larvae resulted in significantly higher and faster releases of ammonium and sol- uble protein into the fluids of the artificial pitchers and that the presence of fluid microbes did likewise for ammonium suggesting that both dipteran larvae and microbes facilitate nutrient sequestration in N. gracilis pitchers.

Online version in colour.large-bodied prey species such as O. smaragdina can remain locked away from pitchers in the absence of dipteran larvae or microbes.While it is possible that the plant-dipteran larva mutual- ism breaks down at higher larval densities we demonstrated here using the 75 - 80th percentile of in situ dipteran larva num- bers that the facilitative relationship between N. gracilis and its most common inhabitants is likely to hold most of the time for the plant2dipteran larva relationship.

Larvae of the phorid E. schuitemakeri were observed to fragment prey carcasses extensively while feeding on them but they did not appear to consume fluid microbes .

Tripteroides larvae on the other hand appeared only to graze on the surfaces of prey carcasses but strongly suppressed fluid microbe levels .

By contrast a growing number of studies in more recent years have shown that pitcher secretions are anti-microbial an obser- vation that seems to point in the direction of an antagonistic relationship between plant and fluid microbes - .In this study we examined the hypothesis of digestive mutualism between N. gracilis pitchers and both dipteran larvae and microbes.
