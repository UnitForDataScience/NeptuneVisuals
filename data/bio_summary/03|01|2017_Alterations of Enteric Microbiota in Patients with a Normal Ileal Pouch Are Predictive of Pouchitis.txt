It is speculated that the enteric microbiota can contribute to gut health through the production of beneficial metabolites such as butyrate that can enhance the epithelial barrier function induce regulatory T cells and ameliorate the immune response.However increased microbial diversity by itself may also contribute to micro- bial stability possibly by improving resilience against colonization by pathogenic bacteria and it may help to maintain a healthy enteric microbial ecology.The current long-term 40-month prospective study that included meticulous clinical endoscopic and microbial composition assess- ments demonstrated that decreased microbial diversity per se predicts pouch inflammation.

These findings may aid in risk stratification of those patients.Key Words Pouchitis inflammation microbiota inflammatory bowel disease microbial diversitySignificance of this studyWhat is already known on this subjectIleal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical procedure of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis who suffer from refractory dis- ease or dyplasiacancer.Up to 60 of pouch patients develop pouchitis.A decrease in enteric microbial diversity and changes in micro- bial composition have been associated with pouchitis.What are the new findingsDecreased faecal microbial diversity in ileal pouch patients may be predictive of pouch inflammation up to 1 year before inflam- mation occurs.Copyright c 2016 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation ECCO.

In addition multiple fac- tors that may affect enteric microbial composition and diversity were not completely accounted for for instance diet that may affaect microbial composition as well as diversity.Medications other than antibiotics such as proton pump inhibitorsand other medications may also alter the enteric microbiota and should be accounted for in larger prospective studies.The findings of this study demonstrate that reduced pouch microbial diversity and possibly also reductions in specific bacte- rial groups may predispose patients who underwent ileal pouch anal-anastomosis to develop pouchitis.

Recently faecal microbial transplantation has demonstrated significant efficacy in increasing microbial diversity in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.Potentially this therapy may be tested in patients with a pouch and evidence for decreased microbial diversity in order to reduce the considerable morbidity associated with pouchitis.FundingThis study was supported by a grant from the Leona M. and Harry B.

Interestingly a 3-year follow-up post pouch surgery of these patients demonstrated a steady increase in microbial diversity n  4  becoming more similar to that of the Normal Pouch-sustained patients.DiscussionThe results of this prospective study demonstrated that microbial diversity in an ileal pouch may be predictive of pouch inflammation up to 1 year before inflammation becomes apparent clinically.

Having demonstrated that microbial diversity was significantly reduced during the first post- surgical year we omitted that group of patients from our analysisAlterations of Enteric Microbiota Predict Pouchitis319assuming that the microbiota profile during that time was not stable possibly due to perioperative antibiotic therapy or due to the time it takes for the ileal pouch mucosa to be colonized by colon-like bacteria.Interestingly the patients who did not develop pouchitis during that year increased their microbial diversity over time i.e.

Microbial diversity was significantly reduced in Pre-Pouchitis patients n  7 compared with Normal Pouch-sustained n  13 patients assessed by A an alpha rarefaction curve and B by the Shannon diversity index.Microbial diversityMicrobial diversity a-diversity assessed through rarefaction curves and the Shannon diversity index was significantly increased in the Normal Pouch-sustained group compared with the Pre-Pouchitis group p  0.01 .

The linear discriminant analysis with effect size estimation algorithm revealed that Lachnospira and Coprococcus genera were also decreased among Pre-Pouchitis patients compared with Normal Pouch-sustained patients 0.6 vs 1.95 and 2.1 vs 4 respectively.Conclusions Patients with a normal mature pouch may be predisposed to acute pouchitis when faecal microbial diversity and certain microbial groups are decreased.

It is plausible to assume that low microbial diversity predisposes to microbial alterations that may result in inflammation.
