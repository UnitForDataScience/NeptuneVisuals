it is speculated that the enteric microbiota can contribute to gut health through the production of beneficial metabolites such as butyrate that can enhance the epithelial barrier function induce regulatory t cells and ameliorate the immune response.however increased microbial diversity by itself may also contribute to micro- bial stability possibly by improving resilience against colonization by pathogenic bacteria and it may help to maintain a healthy enteric microbial ecology.the current long-term 40-month prospective study that included meticulous clinical endoscopic and microbial composition assess- ments demonstrated that decreased microbial diversity per se predicts pouch inflammation.

a among the normal pouch-sustained patients microbial diversity was significantly lower with a pouch age  1 year n  5 compared with patients with a pouch age  1 year n  13. b microbial diversity steadily increased during a 3-year follow-up after surgery in patients with a pouch age  1 year n  4.microbial groups in the pre-pouchitis patients they had significantly decreased microbial diversity at t1 compared with patients who remained pouchitis-free.

in addition multiple fac- tors that may affect enteric microbial composition and diversity were not completely accounted for for instance diet that may affaect microbial composition as well as diversity.medications other than antibiotics such as proton pump inhibitorsand other medications may also alter the enteric microbiota and should be accounted for in larger prospective studies.the findings of this study demonstrate that reduced pouch microbial diversity and possibly also reductions in specific bacte- rial groups may predispose patients who underwent ileal pouch anal-anastomosis to develop pouchitis.

recently faecal microbial transplantation has demonstrated significant efficacy in increasing microbial diversity in patients with recurrent clostridium difficile infection.potentially this therapy may be tested in patients with a pouch and evidence for decreased microbial diversity in order to reduce the considerable morbidity associated with pouchitis.fundingthis study was supported by a grant from the leona m. and harry b. helmsley charitable trust.conflict of interestthe authors of this manuscript report no conflict of interest.acknowledgmentsto esther eshkol for her assistance with the professional english editing of this manuscript.author contributionsid and ht recruited patients for this study.

interestingly a 3-year follow-up post pouch surgery of these patients demonstrated a steady increase in microbial diversity n  4  becoming more similar to that of the normal pouch-sustained patients.discussionthe results of this prospective study demonstrated that microbial diversity in an ileal pouch may be predictive of pouch inflammation up to 1 year before inflammation becomes apparent clinically.

having demonstrated that microbial diversity was significantly reduced during the first post- surgical year we omitted that group of patients from our analysisalterations of enteric microbiota predict pouchitis319assuming that the microbiota profile during that time was not stable possibly due to perioperative antibiotic therapy or due to the time it takes for the ileal pouch mucosa to be colonized by colon-like bacteria.interestingly the patients who did not develop pouchitis during that year increased their microbial diversity over time i.e.

the genus ruminococcus was significantly decreased in the pre-pouchitis patients' samples compared with those of the normal pouch-sustained patients 0.19 vs 0.78 respectively false discovery rate fdr  0.05. the linear discriminant analysis with effect size estimation algorithm revealed that lachnospira and coprococcus genera were also decreased among pre-pouchitis patients compared with normal pouch-sustained patients 0.6 vs 1.95 and 2.1 vs 4 respectively.conclusions patients with a normal mature pouch may be predisposed to acute pouchitis when faecal microbial diversity and certain microbial groups are decreased.

it is plausible to assume that low microbial diversity predisposes to microbial alterations that may result in inflammation.

escherichia.intestinal inflammation is associated with alterations in the com- position of the enteric microbial population and with a reduction in microbial diversity.

seven patients developed pouchitis during follow-up within 265 - 93.6 days and they were assigned to the pre-pouchitis group at t1 they had a decreased microbial diversity at t1 compared with the normal pouch-sustained patients n  13. the shannon diversity index for the pre-pouchitis patients was 3.4 vs 4.23 for the normal pouch-sustained patients p  0.011. there were no substantial group differences in high taxonomic levels order or above.

given that decreased diversity is associated with inflammation this may provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for the development of pouchitis immediately after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery.despite a prominent decrease in diversity there were minor differences in microbial groups between the pre-pouchitis and the normal pouch-sustained patients.

however it is still unclear whether alterations in microbial composition are the cause or the result of inflammation.we considered that longitudinal follow-up of patients who have a pouch may provide a source for detecting microbial alterations that had occurred and that may drive pouch inflammation.
