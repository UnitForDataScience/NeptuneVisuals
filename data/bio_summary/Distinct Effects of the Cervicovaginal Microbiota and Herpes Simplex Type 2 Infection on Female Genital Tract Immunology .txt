While this reduces our ability to defini- tively demonstrate the lack of association between the vaginal microbiota and cervical HIV target cells the fact that we still see strong cellular associations with HSV-2 infection clearly demonstrates that a vaginal microbiota association with gen- ital target cells if it exists must be less robust.

Whether cervical T cells in women with a vaginal CST-IV demonstrate altered function is an interesting question that will require future study.In summary we found that the cervicovaginal microbiota in ACB women from Toronto was predominated by CSTs asso- ciated with genital inflammation.

The prevalence of clinical conditions was BV 13.7 751 Nugent score 7 intermediate vaginal flora 29.4Nugent score 4-6 1551 HSV-1 infection 90.2 4651 HSV-2 seropositivity 60.8 3151 any vaginal human pap- illomavirus infection 33.3 1751 and yeast infection 13.7 751.The Vaginal Microbiota Diversity Bacterial Load and Clinical Validation Participant genital microbiota grouped into 4 distinct com- munity state types CSTs Figure 1 13.7 751 CST-I most often dominated by L. crispatus 3.9 251 CST-II L. gas- seri 43.1 2251 CST-III L. iners and 39.2 2051CST-IV characterized by a paucity of Lactobacillus and a diver- sity of anaerobes and strict anaerobes.

Cervical T-cell populations were not associated with other demographic variables data not shown.Endocervical Dendritic Cell PopulationsAssociations were assessed between the cervicovaginal micro- biota and monocyte-derived dendritic cells mDCs mono- cytes plasmacytoid dendritic cells pDCs and Langerhans cells LCs.

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1a and TNF-a are produced after stimulation of innate immune receptors on both epithelial cells and local dendritic cells 35 and directly disrupt mucosal epithelial barrier function both in vitro and in vivo potentially facilitating HIV entry 7 36 furthermore inflam- mation is associated with an influx of activated CD4 T cells that fuels local HIV replication 8.

Two PCA models were run the first incorporated the Shannon diversity score as a marker of microbial diversity inthe vaginal microbiota log10-transformed cervicovaginal cyto- kine levels n  14 and cervical CD4 T-cell numbers eithertotal CD4 cells or CCR5CD4 cells per cytobrush the sec- ond model included log10-transformed cytokine levels cervical CD4 T-cell numbers and 2 binary variables HSV-2 infection and presence of CST-IV.As expected Shannon diversity was much lower in par- ticipants with CST-III and CST-III than with CST-IV 0.73 and 0.66 vs 2.37 P  .0001.

However while vaginal proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with increased mucosal CD4 T-cell numbers 6 7 a direct association between the vaginal microbiome and cervi- cal CD4 T cells has not been shown 6.Limitations to our study include a modest sample size of just over 50 participants.
