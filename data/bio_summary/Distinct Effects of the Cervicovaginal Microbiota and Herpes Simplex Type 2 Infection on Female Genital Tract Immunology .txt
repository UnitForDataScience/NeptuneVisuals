while this reduces our ability to defini- tively demonstrate the lack of association between the vaginal microbiota and cervical hiv target cells the fact that we still see strong cellular associations with hsv-2 infection clearly demonstrates that a vaginal microbiota association with gen- ital target cells if it exists must be less robust.

however hsv-2 infection was associated with increases in mucosal cd4 t-cell subsets without alter- ations in local proinflammatory cytokines while some cytokines amps were associated with increased cd4 t cells mip-3a il-6 il-8 ll-37 and hnp1-3 these were generally distinct to cytokines associated with cst-iv.

together these results suggestthat hsv-2 and vaginal cst-iv enhance hiv susceptibility through independent mucosal immune mechanisms.these findings have clear relevance for the acb community where hsv-2 prevalence is high 38 and vaginal csts associ- ated with inflammation are more common 6 38. over 92 of our study participants 4852 were either hsv-2 seroposi- tive or had a cst-iiiiv vaginal microbiota and 50 2652 demonstrated both.

proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1a and tnf-a are produced after stimulation of innate immune receptors on both epithelial cells and local dendritic cells 35 and directly disrupt mucosal epithelial barrier function both in vitro and in vivo potentially facilitating hiv entry 7 36 furthermore inflam- mation is associated with an influx of activated cd4 t cells that fuels local hiv replication 8. our analyses now suggest that these 2 mechanisms can operate independently of each other.
