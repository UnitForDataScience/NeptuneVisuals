CST groups were not associated with differences in AMP levels although total vaginal bacterial load and Shannon diversity index correlated with levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor r  0.520 P  .001 and r  -0.312 P  .031 respectively and HBD-2 r  0.373 P  .008 and r  -0.302 P  .037.In terms of individual bacterial phylotypes genital inflam- mation was associated with a decreased relative abundance ofL.

Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1a and TNF-a are produced after stimulation of innate immune receptors on both epithelial cells and local dendritic cells 35 and directly disrupt mucosal epithelial barrier function both in vitro and in vivo potentially facilitating HIV entry 7 36 furthermore inflam- mation is associated with an influx of activated CD4 T cells that fuels local HIV replication 8.

However HSV-2 infection was associated with increases in mucosal CD4 T-cell subsets without alter- ations in local proinflammatory cytokines while some cytokines AMPs were associated with increased CD4 T cells MIP-3a IL-6 IL-8 LL-37 and HNP1-3 these were generally distinct to cytokines associated with CST-IV.

However while vaginal proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with increased mucosal CD4 T-cell numbers 6 7 a direct association between the vaginal microbiome and cervi- cal CD4 T cells has not been shown 6.Limitations to our study include a modest sample size of just over 50 participants.

While this reduces our ability to defini- tively demonstrate the lack of association between the vaginal microbiota and cervical HIV target cells the fact that we still see strong cellular associations with HSV-2 infection clearly demonstrates that a vaginal microbiota association with gen- ital target cells if it exists must be less robust.

No other demographic factors assessed were associ- ated with bacterial load CST or Shannon diversity index all P  .05 data not shown.Effects of the Cervicovaginal Microbiota and HSV-2 on Female Genital Immunology  JID 2017215 1 May  1369The Cervicovaginal Microbiota and Soluble Genital Immune FactorsOf the 14 genital cytokines assayed 3 were detectable in all participants IL-1a IL-8 MCP-1 and others in a subset GM-CSF 2559 MIG 5759 MIP-3a 4659 RANTES 4959 IL-10 1859 IL-17 3959 IL-1b 5759 IL-6 5159 IP-10 4659 MIP-1b 3259 and TNF-a 1559.Our primary analysis assessed the relationship of the genital microbiota with the presence or absence of genital inflamma- tion predefined based on cytokine levels 7.
