However the pH values of the colonic luminal content collected from piglets in the BFLD group were significantly lower than the pH values of the colonic luminal content collected from piglets in the BCPD group P  0.05.The jejunal luminal content collected from the BFLD group had significantly higher lactic acid and lithocholicacid LCA concentrations P  0.01 and significantly lower cholic acid CA concentrations P  0.05 than that collected from the BFLD group.

Data on OTU and alpha diversity of the microorganism communi- ties in different dietary treatment groups are listed in The OTU number Chao 1 and Shannon values of bacterial communities in the jejunal luminal content of weaned piglets from the Bacillus subtilis fermented liquid diet BFLD group were lower P  0.05 than those of weaned piglets from the Bacillus subtilis-supplemented commercial pellet diet BCPD group.

In contrast the OTU numbers and Chao 1 values of bacterial communi- ties in the colonic luminal content of weaned piglets from the BFLD group were higher P  0.05 than those of weaned piglets from the BCPD group which did not hold true for the Shannon value.

The Chao 1 values of the fungal community were lower P  0.05 in the jejunal luminal content but were higher P  0.05 in the colonic luminal content of weaned piglets from the BFLD group than those of weaned piglets from the BCPD group.

Compared with weaned piglets from the BCPD group weaned piglets from the BFLD group had a higher P  0.05 relative abundance of Firmicutes in the jejunal and colonic luminal contents a lower P  0.05 relative abundance of Ascomycota in the jejunal luminal content and a higher P  0.05 relative abundance of Ascomycota in the colonic luminal content.

The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were lower P  0.05 in the jejunal and colonic luminal contents of weaned piglets from the BFLD group compared with those from the BCPD group.

The relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the jejunal and colonic luminal contents of weaned piglets from the BFLD group was higher P  0.05 than that of weaned piglets from the BCPD group.

Weaned piglets from the BFLD group had a lower P  0.05 relative abundance of Kazachstania in the jejunal luminal content and a higher P  0.05 relative abundance of Kazachstania in the colonic luminal content compared with weaned piglets from the BCPD group.

Piglets from the BFLD group had higher P  0.05 relative levels of 3-hydroxypropionic acid and orotic acid in their jejunal luminal content and higher P  0.05 relative levels of stigmasterol in their colonic luminal content than piglets from the BCPD group.

Piglets from the BFLD group had sig- nificantly higher serum interleukin-6 IL-6 levels P  0.01 than piglets from the BCPD group T6.
