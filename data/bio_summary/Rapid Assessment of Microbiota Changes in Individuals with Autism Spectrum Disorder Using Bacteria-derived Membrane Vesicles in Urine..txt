Considering these results ASD groups with decreased EV levelsof gBifidobacterium might have benefits by probiotic treatment withgBifidobacterium.Bacterial EVs in urine are useful for rapid assessment of bodily microbiota profiles in ASDThe microbiota profile assessed from urine EVs might reflect a large part of the gut microbiota.

Considering that bacteria- derived EV indicates the metabolically or pathologically activated microbiota 25 27 urine EV may be more representative of the host's microbiota activities than stool bacteria.To the best of our knowledge this is the first report character-izing microbiota in ASD individuals on the basis of urine EVs.

When bacterial EVs were intraperitoneally in- jected in mice EVs were rapidly distributed throughout the bodybiota 25 26 and indicate the microbiota that are metabolically or pathologically active 25 27.In the present study we investigated bodily microbiota represent- ed by bacterial EVs in the urine of ASD individuals.

The results of the present study identify markedly altered microbiota profiles in ASD relative to non-ASD healthy controls and suggest that bacte- rial EVs in urine can be served as a useful tool for the evaluation of microbiota composition in ASD.MATERIALS AND METHODSSubjects and urine sample preparationIndividuals who were enrolled at the Ewha Special Education Research Institute Seoul Republic of Korea or Ewha Womans University MokDong Hospital Seoul Republic of Korea were diagnosed according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria by a child and adolescent psychiatrist followed by characterization using the Korean Childhood Autism Rating Scale K-CARS as described previously 32.

2.DISCUSSIONMetagenome analysis of bacterial EVs in urine identifies altered microbiota profiles in ASDIn the present study we demonstrated that bacteria-derived EVs in urine were useful for the rapid assessment of microbiota profiles in ASD.

The altered microbiota compositions identified from urine EVs of ASD were partially consistent with microbiota compositions assessed from fecal samples reported in recent stud- ies.

Summary and comparison of microbiota characterized in the present study with those identified from fecal samples in previous studiesThe microbiota whose percent composition were significantly different in ASD subjects as characterized in the present study were compared with those identified from fecal samples in previous studies.

Nonetheless we do believe that the microbiota profile assessed from urine EVs is not likely a sim- ple alternative for microbiota profile assessed from stool.

Generally speaking microbiota in stool represents the intestinal compartment whereas microbiota in urine or blood reflects the whole body including the intestinal compartments oral system respiratory system and urinary system.

Con- sidering the general difficulties in repeated sampling microbiota sources from ASD individuals particularly low functioning indi- viduals with ASD or toddlers with ASD using urine as a sample source would be a great advantage for rapid and repeated assess- ments of microbiota changes under varying physiological contexts compared to the use of blood and feces.
