SuMedical Faculty Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming Yunnan ChinaAltered gut microbiota in RA implications for treatmentIntroductionRheumatoid arthritis RA is a relatively common autoimmune disease character- ized by progressive joint disorder signif- icant pain and functional disability.

Elevated levels of anti- bodies against gut bacteria and food havebeen observed in people with a wide va- riety of forms of inflammatory arthritis  .

Thus certain Lactobacillus species may induce arthritis .

Other research has suggested that the peptidoglycan struc- ture of cell walls of L. casei plays a key role in inducing arthritis .

Furthermore col- lagen-induced arthritis-susceptible hu- man leukocyte antigen HLA-DQ8 mice treated with Collinsella aerofaciens revealed the ability of C. aerofaciens to induce arthritis with enhanced incidence and severity.

Further re- search showed that cell wall fragments from Eubacterium aerofaciens strains in- duced chronic arthritis in rats sharing several histopathological features with RA  .
