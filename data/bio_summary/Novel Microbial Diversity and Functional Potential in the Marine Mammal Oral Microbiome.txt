To compare the dolphin Cas9 protein sequences against previously sequenced Cas9 proteins we down- loaded all Cas9 proteins from the RefSeq database  and confirmed whether they were genuine Cas9 proteins using the same HMM search pipeline.

Unusual Predicted Cas9 Protein Sequences in the Dolphin Oral SamplesLength distribution of 1799 complete Cas9 proteins from the RefSeq database  light blue and 53 complete Cas9 proteins from the dolphin datasets dark blue.

The longest Cas9 protein in the RefSeq database  is 1669 amino acids long whereas the longest Cas9 proteins in the dolphin datasets are 1794 and 1895 amino acids long.Insertions and deletions in the three dolphin-associated Cas9 pro- teins DolZOral12495334 DolZOral124196762 and DolZOral1242662 compared to the reference Cas9 protein AnaCas9.

To evaluate the dis- tribution of Cas9 protein lengths we aligned all RefSeq and dolphin metagenome Cas9 proteins with the well-characterized AnaCas9 and SpyCas9 proteins using MUSCLE  and removed partial sequences that did not span the domains present in AnaCas9 and SpyCas9.

We uncovered a rich diversity of pre- dicted Cas9 proteins including the two longest pre- dicted Cas9 proteins to date.

Although the two complete Saccharibac-teria Cas9 proteins are affiliated with a single clade of type II-C Cas9 proteins Figure S6 neither of the CRISPR-Cas loci en- codes a Cas4 protein as would be expected for a type II-C system.The ability to identify phages that infect CPR bacteria is important to understanding CPR bacterial evolution and the con- straints that they face in their natural settings.

We then aligned all dolphin metagenome Cas9 proteins Cas9 proteins classified into subtypes by Makarova et al.

We aligned all three novel Cas9 amino acid sequences against AnaCas9 from Actinomyces naeslundii B. AnaCas9 was selected as a reference because it has a resolved crystal structure and it is a type II-C Cas9 as are the three novel predicted proteins in the present study Figure S6 Data S1.

Regions where both proteins have a residue although not necessarily the same one are shown in gray regions where the dolphin Cas9 has an insertion are shown in red and regions where the dolphin Cas9 has a deletion are shown in blue.

was based on output from antiSMASH which was modified using Inkscape .Identification and classification of CRISPR-Cas systems and predicted Cas9 proteinsTo search for Cas9 protein sequences we performed an HMM search with HMMER suite version 3.1b2  using the Cas9 HMMs from Makarova et al.
