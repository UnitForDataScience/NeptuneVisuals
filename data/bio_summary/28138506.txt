Shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.Kazan Russian FederationData accessibility The data is deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive project ID PRJEB18265 URL .Value of the dataThe data can be used to assess the antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis in a cultivation-independent manner via the changes in the relative abundance of microbial taxa and genes.Using the metagenomic datasets corresponding to three consequent time points - before imme- diately after and 1 month after the end of the treatment - it is possible to analyze the temporal dynamics and resilience of gut microbial ecosystem.By calculating the relative abundance of the genes conferring antibiotic resistance from the data researchers can evaluate the resistome of gut microbiota and its changes during and after the antibiotic intake.Identification of specific changes in gut microbiota composition as the result of H. pylori eradication using the presented data opens the way to designing new approaches to the alleviation of the side effects of the treatment.DataThe presented dataset contains 10 shotgun human gut metagenomes assessed from stool samples from the patients with Helicobacter pylori infection.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on HiSeq 2500 platform Illumina USA according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the followingreagent kits HiSeq Rapid PE Cluster Kit v2 HiSeq Rapid SBS Kit v2 500 cycles HiSeq Rapid PE FlowCell v2.

The changes in taxonomic and functional composition of microbiota in patients can be assessed using shotgun metagenomic sequencing.

Ten stool samples were collected from 4 patients with Helicobacter pylori infection before and directly after the H. pylori eradication course.

One of the diseases for which the treatment scheme commonly included anti- biotic intake is Helicobacter pylori infection.

The patients for whom the samples were collected at three time points include P3 and P4.Patients inclusion and exclusion criteriaGeneral inclusion criteria males and females age 18-75 years with performed upper GI endo- scopy and H. pylori-positive status 1 month prior to the inclusion into the study according to any of the H. pylori detection methods.
