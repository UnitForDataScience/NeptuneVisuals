By identi- fying both abiotic macroenvironmentaland biotic microenvironmental filtering we recommend a framework for better measuring environmental filtering and its consequences for trait-environment relationships.The core idea of environmental filtering stems from using it as an ecological ana- log to natural selection.

When the concept of environmental filter- ing was developed  the discipline of microbial ecology was still relatively young and the term is thus a 'relic' of a time when microbial ecology was not well inte- grated with ecological theory.Environmental filtering is a concept that has been developed and applied with macrobial systems in mind.

The framework also includes the microbial interactions that shape microbial community structure before the arrival of any host in a given environment.

Thus measuring an environmen- tal filter in microbial systems is not only achievable but advances our under- standing of microbial community assem- bly.

Environ- mental filtering has been defined as the set of abiotic environmental conditions that select for the establishment of a group of species in a given habitat .

Specifically Cadotte and Tucker argue that the criteria to determine environmental filtering should include the covariation of traits and demographic parameters along abiotic gradientsexpanding on previous work that nar- rowed the criteria exclusively to mortality rates .

Here we want to use the momentum created by the Cadotte and Tucker piece to expand and update the concept and use of environmental filtering in community ecology.We completely agree with Cadotte and Tucker that correlations of demographic parameters of macroorganisms should be studied along environmental gra- dients.

fungi bacteria archaea protozoa are constant and 'omnipresent' in all habitats and can- not be separated from the abiotic envi- ronment .For example experimental measures of demographic parameters like mortality rates or intrinsic population growth in the absence of competitors are consid- ered the strongest evidence for the detec- tion of environmental filtering .

At this point higher trophic interactions or disturbances can further influence the community composition.showcases that microorganisms cannot be separated from their host and are inherently present when they interact with their environment.Community Assembly Should Focus on Biotic Filters Modified by an Environmental Background Although Cadotte and Tucker briefly men- tion that pathogens or mutualists can also give rise to patterns consistent with envi- ronmental filtering trying to separate thesemicroorganism interactions from the envi- ronment is an unrealistic goal.
