For diversity metrics both shell live and shell only treatments described previously were combined to form the shell microbiome for prin- ciple coordinate analysis PCoA shell live and shell only microbiomes were analyzed sepa- rately to determine shell microbiome structure similarity.To conduct phylotype and denitrification gene inference analyses using paprica a custom- ized paprica database was constructed with 5445 complete and 222 draft bacterial genomes and Tables.

Quantified relative abundances based on qPCR of nosZI gene copy numbers relative to 16S gene copy numbers.would need to be conducted to see if mere proximity to an oyster or oyster reef influences the shell microbiome or if once an oyster's shell microbiome is established the microbiome remains after the animal has expired.

Like oyster reef sediments the shell microbiome is exposed to increased C and N from biodeposits and excretions which may enhance denitrification.Both the gut and shell microbiomes are likely important contributors to oyster denitrifica- tion however no previous studies have identified denitrifying taxa or genes in the oyster microbiome.Studies investigating the composition of oyster microbiomes are also limited compared to those regarding sediment microbiomes.

For all phylotype analyses resulting taxonomic relative abundances from triplicate microbiome samples were averaged together with oyster shells from live oysters shell live and collected paired shells shell only combined together to from the oyster shell microbiome.

phylotype comparisons between the shell live and shell only microbiomes were similar in taxonomy and relative abundance and were thus combined together to form the shell microbiome.

For comparisons between the oyster shell and sediment microbiomes relative abundances of the digestive gland microbiome and shell live micro- biome were combined to form the oyster microbiome.

Both shell and sediment microbiomes had relatively similar overall abundances of nir only genes yet nirK only was significantly more abundant in the shell microbiome while nirS only was significantly more abundant in the sediment microbiome.

Between the shell and sediment microbiomes the shell microbiome had a significantly higher relative abundance of bacteria carrying the nirK only gene unpaired t-test t5  6.48 p  2.6x10-5 while the sediment had a significantly higher abundance of the nirS only unpaired t-test t7  8.75 p  2.6x10-5 and a higher but not significant abundance of nosZ only unpaired t-test t7  2.74 p0.05 genes.

A one-tailed paired t-test was used to determine differences between nosZI and nosZII within the shell and sediment microbiomes and a one-tailed Welch's t-test was used to compare gene abundances between the shell and sediment microbiomes.

There were no differences between the shell microbiomes whether the shell came Summary statistics of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing for oyster-related microbiomes.All metrics are based on subsamples of n  66687.a OTUs are based on 97 sequence identity using Mothur's average neighbor clustering algorithmPrincipal coordinate analysis PCoA of oyster-related microbiomes.
