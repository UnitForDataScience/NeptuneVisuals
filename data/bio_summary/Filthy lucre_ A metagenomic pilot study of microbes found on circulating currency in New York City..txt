For bacterial reads the opposite was true with Winter bills yielding a higher proportion than Summer .Money microbial communities are largely derived from human skin and oral commensalsA total of 397 bacterial species representing more than 20 bacterial phyla were identified across aggregate samples though nearly all sequences at least 97 of each bacterial dataset belonged to just three phyla the Actinobacteria Firmicutes and Proteobacteria taxa that are representa- tive of human skin communities and have previously been shown to dominate other urban surfaces including the subways of Boston  and New York  and ATM keypads in New York .

The assembled data identified far fewer bacterial taxa at the species level 2115 unique species with at least one hit than the unassembled data 7580 unique spe- cies with at least one hit however the difference shrinks 385 vs. 512 after abundance filter- ing to 2 0.005 81 of total bacterial reads in each method with 270 species 43.1 overlapping .

The prevalence of human-associated taxa on paper money is unsurprising as many previous studies have shown that the microbial communities of com- mon surfaces closely resemble those of the human body parts that contact them   .We also observed high abundances of oral- and food-associated bacterial taxa on bills at both time points further suggesting that actions performed before and during handling such as face-touching eating or finger-licking prior to counting may influence community composition.As no DNA was detected on new bills that we procured or on the Winter and Summer bills re-swabbed six months later paper money most likely acquires these communities during human-mediated exchange of bills.

morphological identification  .Number and overlap of bacterial species identified on money by the sequence-based experiments Winter and Summer vs. bacterial species cultured then sequenced from LB media Culture 1 and Culture 2.

The higher occurrence of these species on money in Summer could reflect a seasonal increase in these activities many of which take place outdoors during warmer months while bills collected in Winter show higher levels of common indoor fungi.Although the majority of sequences identified were eukaryotic our 1 bill microbiome also included more than twenty bacterial phyla across aggregate samples with the majority of sequences representing Actinobacteria Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla that dominate Comparison of bacteria identified in this study proportional abundance of each species to those cultured in four previous studies pub- lished during 1975-2009.Bold numbers indicate a proportional abundance 2 0.005 bold taxa have 2 0.005 in all four datasets.Used to represent nonpathogenic Cornynebacteria.the microbiomes of human skin  and oral cavities .

Host DNA or human reads presumably from individuals that handled the money were identified by aligning against the human genome GenBank build hg19 with Bowtie2  and removed from the analysis.

Our sequence-based experiments generally identified a greater diversity of bacterial species than the culture-based experiments probably because DNA sequencing techniques can detect organisms that cannot be cultured the culture results only represent those bacteria capable of growing on LB-agar plates at 37C and the dif- ferent environmental conditions at the time of each collection could influence the type and amount of microbes present on the bills.The present study aimed solely to characterize the microbial diversity found on 1 bills and we had no way of assessing transitory vs. resident taxa aside from the obvious metazoan species.

As expected based on the distribution of the BLAST results  many more bacterial taxa were present in Winter 385 species total than in Summer 149 species total with 137 found in both.Similar bacteria dominated the two time points including eleven of the most abundant bac- terial species .

After abundance filtering we identified 102 bacterial species in Culture 1 and 212 species in Culture 2 far less than the Winter sequence-based characterization 385 species.

Those species marked with a  indicate species present in the most abundant of both time points.We compared our monetary microbiome results to those of four previous culture-based studies from 1975-2009 which used morphological techniques to identify bacterial species.
