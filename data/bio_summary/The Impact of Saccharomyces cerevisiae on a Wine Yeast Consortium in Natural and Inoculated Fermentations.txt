The findings suggest that the complex modulation of the yeast ecosystem by S. cerevisiae will influence the outcome of wine fermentation by selectively changing the contribution of non-Saccharomyces species.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains and Culture ConditionsSixteen yeast isolates obtained from the culture collection of the Institute for Wine Biotechnology IWBT and two commercial yeast species S. cerevisiae Lalvin EC1118 Lallemand Canada and Torulaspora delbrueckii BIODIVA Lallemand Canada were used in this study .

The data showed that in the absence of S. cerevisiae some non- Saccharomyces species such as M. pulcherrima and C. parapsilosis experienced a decline from the onset of fermentation whereas species such as S. bacillaris P. terricola and L. thermotolerans experienced a moderate increase followed by a steady decline in the absolute numbers by the middle of fermentation.

Such an interaction is perhaps not coincidental since other studies have shown that in nutrient- rich conditions co-fermentations using strains of these two species often reflect a significant contribution of H. vineae to wine aroma and flavor   .Based on our current findings we can infer that the mutualism S. cerevisiae and H. vineae and antagonism S. cerevisiae andW.

Our data suggest that inoculation with S. cerevisiae favors the persistence of some non-Saccharomyces species in wine fermentation whereas it clearly suppresses the growth and contribution of other non- Saccharomyces species.The dynamics of the wine ecosystem is driven by a multitude of positive and negative yeast-yeast interactions.
