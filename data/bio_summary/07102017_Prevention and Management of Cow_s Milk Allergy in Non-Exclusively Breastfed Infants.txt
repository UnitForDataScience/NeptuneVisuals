Partial hydrolysates with clinical proof of efficacy are recommended in some guidelines in the prevention of CMA and allergic disease in at risk infants and may be considered as an option as protein source in starter infant formula.Keywords cow milk allergy hydrolysate infant formula functional gastrointestinal disorder prevention treatmentIntroductionThis manuscript discusses the prevention and management of cow's milk allergy CMA in non-exclusively breastfed infants.

The WAO guideline panel suggests i using probiotics in pregnant women at high risk for having an allergic child ii using probiotics in women who breastfeed infants at high risk of developing allergy andiii using probiotics in infants at high risk of developing allergy .

This is only partially confirmed by the recent Cochrane review reported that in infants at high risk of allergy not exclusively breast fed very low-quality evidence suggests that prolonged hydrolysed formula feeding compared with CMF feeding reduces infant allergy and infant CMA  -Cochrane review withdrawn.

Studies have found no difference in childhood allergy and no difference in specific allergy including infant and childhood asthma eczema and rhinitis and infant food allergy .

Immunotherapy for food allergy is still not ready for the clinic but current and upcoming studies are dedicated to collect enough evidence for the possible implementation of allergen-SIT as a standard treatment for food allergy .Gut MicrobiotaThe role of the GI microbiota in food allergy has been a topic of major interest since many years.

Qualitative and quantitative differences in the composition of the gut microbiota between infants who will and infants who will not develop allergy are demonstrable before the development of any clinical manifestations of atopy .

These findings may prove innovative in the therapeutic approach to treating infants with CMA by accelerating the acquisition of tolerance .Consumption of probiotic milk products was related to a reduced incidence of atopic eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis but not associated to the incidence of asthma by 36 months of age .Most tolerant infants showed a significant increase in fecal butyrate levels and those taxa that were significantly enriched in these samples  exhibited specific strain-level demarcations between tolerant and allergic infants.

Breastfeeding is the first choice feeding for infants and allergic and functional gastrointestinal disorders occur more often in non-exclusively breastfed than in breastfed infants.

Recent evidence suggests that low blood vitamin D level is a risk factor for food allergy vitamin D deficiency predisposes to GI infections which may promote the development of food allergy.

There is no evidence that supplementation of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in infancy has an effect on infant or childhood allergy asthma dermatitiseczema or food allergy .
