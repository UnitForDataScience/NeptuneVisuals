therefore the aim ofthis study was 1 to assess and determine the safety of the traditional and the recently recommended first cfs in regards to ros generation and inflammation 2 to determine if the presence of antioxidant fruit in the iron fortified cereal reduces the oxidative effect of iron in the intestinal tract 3 and to determine the impact of different recommended cfs on infant gut microbiota.methodseighty-seven full term healthy exclusively breastfed ebf infants were randomly assigned to one of three study foods iron-fortified cereal cer iron-fortified cereal with fruit cer  fr or meat m. the random allocation sequence for the three feeding groups was generated using computer generated random numbers.

a previous study conducted on three healthy adults who received daily 120 mg of oral iron for 7 days showed that two of the subjects had a two-fold increase in urinary f2-isopros- tanes from the baseline  among the few studies that report normal f2-isoprostanes levels in healthy children there was an inverse association between age and the concentration of urinary f2-isoprostanes b coeffi- cient -0.14 p  0.0001 in the current study the levels of urinary f2-isoprostanes increased after the addition of the cfs but these values remained in the normal range of urinary f2-isoprostanes our results are in keeping with those reported in a previous study conducted by orozco et al.

although the current study found that fecal calprotectin concentrations have increased after the introduction of cfs these elevations remained within the suggested normal values of calprotectin for this age group - in a previous study conducted on 74 39 ebf and 35 formula-fed term italian in- fants it was reported that the median fecal calprotec- tin was higher in ebf infants than in formula fed infant p  0.001 .

another study had also indicated that calprotectin is higher in ebf infants than in mixed fed infants fecal microbiotain agreement with previous studies we found that gut microbiota richness increased after the intro- duction of cfs.

however some mothers reported feeding their infants other foods or formula 10. other limitations of the current study were the variability in the time of the intro- duction of cfs between the infants at parents' discretion and the short feeding duration.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.available evidence suggests an association between excessive iron exposure in the intestinal tract and initi- ation of the inflammatory process by reactive oxygen species ros generation with such a high amount of iron in fortified cereals and low absorption rates concerns have been raised about the possibility of the unabsorbed excess iron in these cfs causing ros generation and inflammation in the large intestine of infants cumulative evidence indicates that anti-oxidant rich foods such as fruits prevent ros generation inflam- mation and disease initiation a study by orozco et al.

animal studies suggest that iron supplementation may alter composition of the gut microbiota but only two human studies have addressed this potential association in infants to date no studies have considered the safety of iron- fortified cereal traditional and meat from the ros gen- eration and inflammatory perspective and few studies have assessed the effect of iron fortification on the gut microbiome of breastfed infants.

three infants were excluded and the remaining 87 were enrolled in the study between december 2012 and may 2014 25 in cer group 28 in cer  fr group and 34 in m group.

carbohydrate intake was significantly lower in the m group p  0.04. there were no significant differ- ences in most of vitamins and minerals intake within the groups over time or between the groups.growththere were no significant differences in growth rates between male infants and female infants.

an additional difference between the adult study by orozco et al and the current study is the form of the iron administered which was a single supplement for the adults vs a poorly absorbed elemental iron fortificant in the infant cf.
