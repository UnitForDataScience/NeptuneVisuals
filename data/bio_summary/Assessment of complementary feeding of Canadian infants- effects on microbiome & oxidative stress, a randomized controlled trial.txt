Trends were discussed at p  0.1.ResultsA total of 82 infants completed the study 5 withdrew did not receive allocated intervention due to the fol- lowing reasons mothers refused to comply with the assigned study food n  3 moved to a different province n  1 or failed to respond to study com- munications n  1.

A previous study conducted on three healthy adults who received daily 120 mg of oral iron for 7 days showed that two of the subjects had a two-fold increase in urinary F2-Isopros- tanes from the baseline  Among the few studies that report normal F2-Isoprostanes levels in healthy children there was an inverse association between age and the concentration of urinary F2-Isoprostanes b coeffi- cient -0.14 p  0.0001 In the current study the levels of urinary F2-Isoprostanes increased after the addition of the CFs but these values remained in the normal range of urinary F2-Isoprostanes Our results are in keeping with those reported in a previous study conducted by Orozco et al.

Therefore the aim ofthis study was 1 to assess and determine the safety of the traditional and the recently recommended first CFs in regards to ROS generation and inflammation 2 to determine if the presence of antioxidant fruit in the iron fortified cereal reduces the oxidative effect of iron in the intestinal tract 3 and to determine the impact of different recommended CFs on infant gut microbiota.MethodsEighty-seven full term healthy exclusively breastfed EBF infants were randomly assigned to one of three study foods iron-fortified cereal Cer iron-fortified cereal with fruit Cer  Fr or meat M. The random allocation sequence for the three feeding groups was generated using computer generated random numbers.

There was also a feeding group effect p  0.001 with lower fecal iron levels in the M group p  0.001 vs. Cer and p  0.014 vs. Cer  Fr.Table 3 Summary of biomarker measures of infants in the three study groups P  0.05 by repeated measures ANOVATable 4 Dietary iron intake before and after introduction of complementary foods CFs in the three study groupsDietary Iron intake data from the 3-day food records was calculated using the nutritional analysis software FoodFocusc Winnipeg MB Canada values superscript letters are significantly different intake within groups over time p  0.05 by repeated measures ANOVA values superscript letters are significantly different between the groups p  0.05 by repeated measures ANOVAFecal reactive oxygen species generationIn total 66 fecal samples Cer n  16 Cer  Fr n  21 M n  29 were analyzed for formation of hydroxylated products indicating the production of ROS Fig.

Although the current study found that fecal calprotectin concentrations have increased after the introduction of CFs these elevations remained within the suggested normal values of calprotectin for this age group - In a previous study conducted on 74 39 EBF and 35 formula-fed term Italian in- fants it was reported that the median fecal calprotec- tin was higher in EBF infants than in formula fed infant p  0.001 .

For each minute an estimated amount of 12.5 ml was given and up to 125 ml for full feeding lasting 10 min or longer GrowthThe growth of the infants weight height and head circumference was measured using standard techniques.Nutritional composition was calculated using the nutritional analysis software FoodFocus Winnipeg MB Canada and from food labelsNE niacin equivalent ND no data provided tbs table spoonThree measurements were taken for each variable and the values were averaged.Laboratory methodsSample collectionUrine samples were collected by the infants' caregivers using the pediatric urine collector Kendall pediatric urine collector Covidien Mansfield MA USA provided by the study team along with instructions.

Table summarizes the biomarker measures of infants in the study groups.Dietary iron intakeThe dietary iron intakes of the infants Cer n  22 Cer  Fr n  28 M n  32 are reported in Table There was an increase in iron intake after the introduction of the CFs in all groups p  0.05.Breast milk and nutrient intakeAfter the introduction of CF the amount of breast milk intake decreased significantly within groups over time.

Another study had also indicated that calprotectin is higher in EBF infants than in mixed fed infants Fecal microbiotaIn agreement with previous studies we found that gut microbiota richness increased after the intro- duction of CFs.

An additional difference between the adult study by Orozco et al and the current study is the form of the iron administered which was a single supplement for the adults vs a poorly absorbed elemental iron fortificant in the infant CF.
