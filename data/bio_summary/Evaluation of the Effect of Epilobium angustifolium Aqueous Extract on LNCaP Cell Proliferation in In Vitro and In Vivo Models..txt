The three other groups were supplemented once a day with Epilobium extract EA as follows 50 mgkg b. w. n  8 III 100 mgkg b. w. n  8 IV 200 mgkg b.w n  8 V. The rats were supplemented with the extract suspended in watermL daily via gavage from 70 days until 150 days of age sacri- fice time by decapitation.

The aim of the study was also to fill the gap between the OeB in vitro activities and the in vivo effects on prostate cancer cell proliferation of orally admin- istered Epilobium extract.Results and DiscussionThe phytochemical analysis of the extract of E. angustifolium EA using the HPLC-DAD-MSMS method confirmed all previous stud- ies about the presence of hydrolysable tannins dimeric and tri- meric ellagitannins flavonol derivatives quercetin-3-O-glucuro- nide and other glycosides and phenolic acids caffeoylquinic ac- ids and the significant domination of OeB 15-19.

We have thus focused our attention on a complex comparative investigation of the in vitro and in vivo activities of phytochemically characterized Epilobium angustifolium aqueous extract and oenothein B on prostate cancer cells pro- liferation.Incubation of different cell lines with E. angustifolium aqueous extract resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation of PZ-HPV-7 and LNCaP cells which was partly associated with antiandrogenic activity.

Oenothein B was not detected in the urine and feces of the E. angustifolium aqueous extract-treated group however conjugates of nasu- tins gut microbiota metabolites of ellagitannins were de- tected in the urine while in human volunteers supplemented with Epilobium tea only urolithin conjugates were present.Despite observing significant and consistent effects in vitro and in vivo we were unable to point out unequivocally the fac- tors contributing to the observed E. angustifolium aqueous ex- tract activity facing the problems of an unknown metabolic fate of oenothein B and interspecies differences in E. angusti- folium aqueous extract gut microbiota metabolism.IntroductionInfusions of Epilobium sp.

The infusion prepared from commercial tea showed a similar HPLC pattern as the EA extract.

The purity of compounds base on HPLC and NMR analysis was 95 .Plant material extract preparation and characterizationAerial parts of E. angustifolium L. were collected in a natural state in northeast Poland near Gietrzwald in the period of blooming.

For assays cells were seeded 2-4x 104well in 24-well plates in culture medium and allowed to at- tach for 24 h. Subsequently cells were incubated with the tested compounds for 72 h. The EA extract and OeB were dissolved inPBS while other compounds were dissolved in DMSO.
