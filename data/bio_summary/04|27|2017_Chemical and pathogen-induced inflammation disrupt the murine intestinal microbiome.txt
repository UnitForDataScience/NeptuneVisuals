Additionally to begin to separate the microbiome response to inflamma- tion alone rather than inflammation and the pathogen we compare the pathogen-induced inflammation to chemically induced inflammation caused by dextran so- dium sulfate DSS.

Our findings suggest it is the amount low not high of inflammation not the source that dictates Akkermansia and S24-7 relative abundance findings which may explain the lack of congruence be- tween inflammation and Akkermansia in the literature today -.Another interesting finding from our study is that pro- pionate concentrations increased in both the low- inflammation treatments.

Concurrent with controls experimental inflammation treatments DSSdextran sulfate sodium abiotic inflammation and Sal- monella biotic inflammation were run for 16 days.

These data were correlated to the inflammation marker lipocalin-2 and short-chain fatty acid concentrations.Results We demonstrated that inflammation chemically or biologically induced restructures the chemical and microbial environment of the gut over a 16-day period.

These findings may re- veal new therapeutic strategies for prebiotics or probio- tics for maintaining or restoring the microbiota in response to Salmonella perturbation - Further- more examining responses of the commensal micro- biota and chemical environment to inflammation has broader ramifications to other gastrointestinal diseases including ulcerative colitis Crohn's disease and colon cancer -ResultsExperimental design and 16S rRNA gene sequencingTo investigate the impacts of inflammation on the gut microbial community we performed 16S rRNA gene profiling on the microbiota of chemically inflamed and Salmonella-inflamed mice.

Additional file Fecal lipocalin-2 levels provide a sensitive and broadly dy- namic method to monitor inflammation specifically for low levels of inflammation .

This indicates that inflammation level correlated to treatment group micro- bial communities.Microbially produced short-chain fatty acids SCFA maintain the gut barrier participate in host signaling and contribute to host energy so we were interested in the impacts of inflammation on cecal SCFA concen- trations.

This re- sult suggests that these taxa respond positively to low levels of inflammation but are decreased when Salmon- ella relative abundance or inflammation is high.

To our knowledge this is the first study to directly compare and contrast DSS-induced chemical inflammation with Salmonella-induced inflammation.

Our principle findings are the following 1 the extent of Salmonella colonization in the mouse gastrointes- tinal tract is variable 2 gut microbial community membership is congruent with Salmonella relative abundance and inflammation level 3 commensal Alis- tipes and Lachnospiraceae taxa decrease along an in- flammation gradient 4 low levels of inflammation regardless of source increase the relative abundance of Akkermansia and S24-7 and 5 Lactobacilli andmembers of the Enterobacteriaceae are co-enriched with Salmonella.Mice have differential Salmonella susceptibilityHere we report infected mice have a large range in Salmonella colonization relative abundance 1 to 71 with three of the ten mice classified as high 46 re- sponders.
