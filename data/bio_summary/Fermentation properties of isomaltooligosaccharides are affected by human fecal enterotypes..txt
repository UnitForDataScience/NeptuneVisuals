The concentrations of propionic acid were significantly higher in the Prevotella-type than that in the non-Pre- votella-type despite that the chain length was short or long C. As for butyric acid production Prevotella-type showed a high level just in the long chain IMOs fermentation comparing to the non-Pre- votella-type D. However the fermentation of the short chain IMOs caused a lower level of acetic acids in Prevotella-type than that in the non-Prevotella-type B. Comprehensively the Prevotella- type exhibited a stronger production of the total SCFAs A than the non-Prevotella-type in the long chain IMOs fermentation.

For Lactobacillus no significant difference was found between the two groups B which was consistent with the LEfSe result that Lactobacillus was not identified as the unique genus of either Prevotella-type or non- Prevotella-type.Effects of short and long chain IMOs on microbiome community compositionAs mentioned in 3.2 the degradation of the short chain IMOs were observed in all eleven fecal samples while the long chain IMOs was significantly degraded by only three samples suggesting the effect of DP of IMOs on the utilization by fecal bacteria.

In general the short chain inulin-like fructans are rapidly fer- mented in the left side of colon while long chain fructans are associated with slow fermentation rates often allowing for activity to reach the right side colon or the rectum .Isomaltooligosaccharides IMOs are natural oligosaccharidesthat are found in various fermented foods such as miso sake and soy sauce .

S4B the band profiles from the short chain IMOs were clustered together but separated from the band profiles of the long chain IMOs suggesting that the DP of oligosaccharides significantly affected the bacterial community structures.For the analysis of sequencing data alpha diversity of the fermentation microbiome was compared among the five IMOs Fig.

Six of eleven fecal samples showed their microbiome communities of the short chain IMOs clustered together after fermentation which were separated from those cultured with the long chain IMOs.

For example long chain inulin-like fructans can ameliorate type I diabetes symptoms in mice in contrast to short chain fruc- tans .

The copy number of Bifido- bacterium amplicons was 5.81 x 107 at 0.2 ngmL and 5.99 x 109 at 20 ngmL for Lactobacillus .Short chain fatty acids analysisThe concentration of short chain fatty acids SCFAs was deter- mined by gas chromatography GC .

Therefore IMO-H2 and IMO-H3 were regarded as the long chain IMOs DP 8e16 while IMO-S IMO-B and IMO-H1 were considered as the short chain IMOs DP less than 7.Based on the TLC analysis of each individual Fig.

These results suggested that the bacteria in the Prevotella-type metabolized IMOs in a manner differently from the bacteria of the non-Prevotella- type especially for the long chain IMOs.Modulation of microbiome community by IMOs was depended on the enterotypesIn order to understand the influence of IMO chain length on theFig.
