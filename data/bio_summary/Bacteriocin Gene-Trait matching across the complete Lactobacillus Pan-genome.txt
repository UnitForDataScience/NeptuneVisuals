l. gallinarum dsm 10532 l. crispatus dsm 20584 and p. cellicola dsm 17757 were all found to harbour a nisc homolog despite not being identified by bagel.

in our study l. crispatus dsm 20584 l. intesti- nalis dsm 6629 and oenococcus kitaharae dsm 17330 were identified by bagel as encoding homologs of the sagbcd gene cluster.

whilst the operons in o. kitaharae dsm 17330 and l. intestinalis dsm 6629 appear to be complete the l. crispatus dsm 20584 tomm operon appears to lack a structural gene however the structural gene for similar operons has been found to be some distance from the sagbcd homologs previously.

originally identified as two separate class iic bacteriocins gassericin a l. gas- seri la39 and reutericin 6 l. reuteri la6 have now been shown to be identical .

intestinalis dsm 6629 was shown to produce one of these helveticin homologs with four potential struc- tural genes found within the genome ranging from 38 to 67 amino acid identity to helveticin j. l. kitasatonis dsm16761 also produced a helveticin like peptide the strain encodes two such proteins displaying 35 and 41 identity to helveticin j. two l. amylovorus strains dsm 16698 and dsm 20531 were shown to produce a helveticin homolog.

l. kalixensis dsm 16043 also produces a helveticin-like protein with 3 homologs encoded within the genome displaying 34 49 and 50 amino acid identity to helveticin j.bagel also identified a helveticin homolog 77 identity to helveticin j from l. crispatus dsm20584.

it is notable that the production of these unique bacteriocins is in fact restricted to 16 different species.visualisation of the distribution of bacteriocins throughout the lactobacillus genus complex shows that there is a clear clustering of helveticin-like operons amongst the l. acidophilus branch of species indicating that such genes have been retained from a common ancestor fig.

of the 18 strains in the l. acidophilus group 36 helveticin homologs were distributed amongst 16 of these strains.
