L. gallinarum DSM 10532 L. crispatus DSM 20584 and P. cellicola DSM 17757 were all found to harbour a NisC homolog despite not being identified by BAGEL.

In our study L. crispatus DSM 20584 L. intesti- nalis DSM 6629 and Oenococcus kitaharae DSM 17330 were identified by BAGEL as encoding homologs of the SagBCD gene cluster.

Whilst the operons in O. kitaharae DSM 17330 and L. intestinalis DSM 6629 appear to be complete the L. crispatus DSM 20584 TOMM operon appears to lack a structural gene however the structural gene for similar operons has been found to be some distance from the SagBCD homologs previously.

Originally identified as two separate class IIc bacteriocins Gassericin A L. gas- seri LA39 and reutericin 6 L. reuteri LA6 have now been shown to be identical .

L. kalixensis DSM 16043 also produces a helveticin-like protein with 3 homologs encoded within the genome displaying 34 49 and 50 amino acid identity to helveticin J.BAGEL also identified a helveticin homolog 77 identity to helveticin J from L. crispatus DSM20584.
