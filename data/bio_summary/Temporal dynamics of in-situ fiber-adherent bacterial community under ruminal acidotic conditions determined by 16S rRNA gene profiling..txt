The lowest pH P  0.001 and greatest time spent below pH 5.8 P  0.01 was determined for the INT sampling pH  5.96 time below pH 5.8  425 min .Microbial diversity and phylogenetic analysisThe estimated measures of richness and diversity for rumen fiber associated microbes between forage-only and high grain diets in two SARA challenge models as well as at 24h and 48h of ruminal incubation are shown in .

During the SARA challenge any orts of concentrate were delivered via the cannula 2.48 - 3.66 kg DMday to ensure an equal dietary forage to concentrate ratio for all cows.Rumen pH in situ incubation and sample collectionAt the beginning of the experiment each cow received wireless ruminal pH sensors smaX- tec1 Graz Austria which were introduced directly through the rumen cannula to examine daily ruminal pH and temperature dynamics.

Statistical analysis of DMI mean pH and time spend under pH 5.8 min all showed a significant effect of treatment P S 0.01.

Sequence analysis of 0-h in situ bags soaked in water but not ruminally incubated showed a bacterial community predominated by Proteobacteria and therefore data were not normalized for the time 0 h population.Pearson correlation of OTUs representing a percent relative abundance of 0.5 or greater were analyzed with relation to the environmental parameters DMI mean pH and the duration of time spend under pH 5.8 as a reference point for environmental effects on rumen cellulo- lytic populations .

Two OTUs correlated to all three environmental parameters OTU 38 and OTU 47 in a similar pattern with a nega- tive correlation to DMI and duration of time below pH 5.8 and a positive correlation to mean pH.

with mean pH indicating that as mean pH decreased the rela- tive abundance of this OTU increased.
