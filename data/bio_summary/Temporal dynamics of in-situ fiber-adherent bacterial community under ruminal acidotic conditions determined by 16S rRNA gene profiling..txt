sequence analysis of 0-h in situ bags soaked in water but not ruminally incubated showed a bacterial community predominated by proteobacteria and therefore data were not normalized for the time 0 h population.pearson correlation of otus representing a percent relative abundance of 0.5 or greater were analyzed with relation to the environmental parameters dmi mean ph and the duration of time spend under ph 5.8 as a reference point for environmental effects on rumen cellulo- lytic populations .

correlations shown are those which had a pearson correlation coefficient of greater than 0.50. two otus correlated to all three environmental parameters otu 38 and otu 47 in a similar pattern with a nega- tive correlation to dmi and duration of time below ph 5.8 and a positive correlation to mean ph.

with mean ph indicating that as mean ph decreased the rela- tive abundance of this otu increased.

therefore the similarities found would tend to indicate a highly conserved fiber-adherent microbial community within ruminants as part of the core microbiome as previously published .correlation of significant otus representing a relative abundance of 2 0.5 to rumen environmental parameters of dmi mean ph and the duration of time spend under ph 5.8 was performed to determine those fiber-adherent otus which were most likely impacted by changes to the in situ bag ecosystem .

the two otus which correlated to all three environmental parameters showed a negative correlation to dmi and the duration of time below ph 5.8 and a positive correlation to mean ph.

conversely to the cellulolytic bacteria the highest negative correlation determined r  -0.73 was for otu 21 succiniclasticum genus with mean ph indicating that as mean ph decreased the relative abundance of this otu increased.

a decrease in the relative expression of this pathway as mean ph increases indicates a potential shift to this pre- dicted function under low ph conditions.

the majority of these otus correlated to dmi mean ruminal ph and the duration of time spent under ph 5.8 as an indicator of sara.
