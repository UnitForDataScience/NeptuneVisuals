Consumption of more whole grains has been suggested as an excellent way for Americans to bridge the fiber gap because many palatability studies have shown that in moderate proportions substituting whole grains for refined grains does not change the liking of grain based foods .Consumption of whole grains is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and major chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and may even decrease the risk for some types of cancers such as colorectal cancer .

Another potential mechanism that may explain the persistence of decreased glucose levels with increased consumption of whole grains even after an overnight fast is that the increase infiber from whole grains may alter metabolism in the microbiota increasing the production of short chain fatty acids SCFA like propionate and acetate due to continued exposure to fiber from the whole grains.

Fasting glucose has been shown to decrease with acute interventions of wheat bran in mice  and with acute interventions of whole wheat whole oats and whole barley in rats .

There was also a trend towards increased bowel movement frequency observed in the refined grain intervention thus the validity of the increase should be interpreted with caution.MicrobiotaIncreasing intake of whole grain wheat maize and barley have all been shown to alter the human gut microbiota potentially through increasing the availability of fiber but possibly due to other functional components in the whole grains such as polyphenols .However in this study no significant changes in microbial community composition were detected with consumption of the whole or refined grain market baskets.

Then recommendations could be further refined to include not only the total quantity of whole grains but also more specifically for the types of grains consumed based on the potential health benefit.It is likely that the improvements seen from increasing whole grain consumption come from the increases in fiber consumption but future research is necessary to confirm this assertion and determine if other functional components of the whole grains contribute to health benefits.

Increasing consumption of WGs can alter parameters of health but more research is needed to better elucidate the relationship between the amount consumed and the health-related outcome.Keywords whole grains maize brown rice whole wheat fasting glucose fasting blood lipids microbiota bowel movement frequency gastrointestinal symptomsIntroductionGrains are a staple of the average American diet and therefore changes to grain products especially the level of refinement can have a notable effect on Americans' consumption of fiber minerals and vitamins .

The topic of whole grains has come to wider public attention since the publication of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans which recommends half of one's daily grain intake 3-5 servings or 48-80 g for adults should be in the form of whole grains .

However there is still a huge disparity between the recommended level of whole grain consumption and the actual amount of consumption in the US with most adults only consuming on average 9.76 g of whole grains daily as reported by the 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES .Botanically grains are defined as the caryopsis or dried fruit also called corn of a cereal plant .

We also found that bowel movement frequency was significantly improved relative to percent consumption of the whole grains and blood glucose tended to decrease as well with increased percent consumption of whole grains.

They had to be low whole grain consumers consuming not more than 1 serving of whole grainswhole grain products per day on average.
