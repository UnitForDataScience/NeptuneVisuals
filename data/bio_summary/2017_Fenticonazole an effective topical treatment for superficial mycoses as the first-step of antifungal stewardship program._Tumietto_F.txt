Overall similar results were reported in other studies on patients with vulvovaginal can- didiasis293132 with fenticonazole resulting in an improvement of the signs erythema edema and symptoms itching burning within a couple of days since the first administration and complete resolution of some or all of symptoms in 52-100 of patients within one week.Fenticonazole has also an antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and an antiparasit- ic action against Trichomonas vaginalis1516.In three studies conducted in patients with vaginal trichomoniasis fenticonazole vaginal capsules 600 mg or 1000 mg administered as a single dose with34 or without vaginal wash for 5 days or daily for 2 days without vaginal wash eradicated all organisms in 28-65 of patients at 7 days eradication of Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida spp was seen in 100 of patients at dayA single dose of fenticonazole 1000 mg was significantly more effective on Trichomonas than 600 mg single dose p0.014041.In the case of mixed infections two open-label studies 600 mg as a single dose or 1000 mg on days 1 and 3 demonstrated the complete eradica- tion in 45 of patients after 7-8 days3839.

Overall clinical evidence shows that the different formulations of fenticonazole are effective in the treatment of cutaneous fungal infection and that the side effects are rare and of mild severity.A study conducted in 198723 on 30 patients with candidiasis tinea versicolor and epider- momycoses treated with fenticonazole once daily has documented a clinical and microbio- logical response in all patients after 28 days of therapy in the case of candidiasis and pityri- asis and after 32 days in 8 out of 10 patients with epidermomycoses.One large clinical trial conducted in 198824 was a multi-center open-label trial in which fen- ticonazole cream spray or powder were applied once or twice daily in 760 patients with super- ficial mycoses.

Four studies compared fenticonazole with clotrimazole26293032 and one fenticonazole with fluconazole36.Nine studies were conducted on ovule formu- lations27293032-3436-38 two studies with the combi- nation of cream with ovules2734 and one study on the combination of ovules and vaginal lavage39.In more details vaginal capsules 600 mg or 1 g as a single dose or 200 mgday for three days 2 cream for 3 or 7 days or a combination of capsules with cream or vaginal lavage were ef- fective in the treatment of infections in 75-100 of patients and allowed the eradication of Candida spp.

Follow-up data showed that among patients cured or greatly improved at the end of treatment only 1 patient 3.2 on fenticonazole and 2 patients 6.3 on naftifine experienced mycological relapse.Clinical Studies in GynaecologyIn the gynaecological setting fenticonazole was studied in the treatment of Candida vulvo- vaginitis26-36 and mixed infections3437-39.In all studies the diagnosis was based on clin- ical history and presentation direct mycological examinations and cultures.

Clinical response was observed in 16 out of 20 patients 80 in the group treated with fenticonazole versus 1420 patients 70 in the group treated with miconazole.A multi-center double-blind study2 was con- ducted on 100 patients with cutaneous fungal in- fections in order to compare the efficacy and tol- erability of spray formulations of fenticonazole 2 and naftifine 1.

At 30 days after treatment 3240 patients 80 in fenticonazole group and 3140 patients 77.5 in the fluco- nazole group were cured.

Vulvovaginal pruritus was reduced in a lower time in patients assigned to fenticonazole than in those receiving fluco- nazole 2.3 days vs. 4.5 days p0.047.In a multicenter prospective open-label study39 fenticonazole 1 g vaginal suppositories once daily on days 1 and 3 was used for the treatment of mixed vulvovaginal infections with Candida albicans Trichomonas vaginalis and or Gardnerella vaginalis.

Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of two different dosages of fenticonazole vaginal ovules 600 mg and 1000 mg in patients with vaginal trichomoniasis a con- trolled double-blind randomized clinical trial ver- sus placebo.

This outbreak was likely associated with inappropriate use of oral azoles for the treatment of non-complicated candidiasis such as vulvo- vaginal candidiasis or Candida dermatitis.In this setting fenticonazole may represent an effective topical drug for the treatment of mycot- ic infections of skin and mucosa.

Fenticonazole 600 mg or 1 g as a single dose or 200 mgday for three days has shown a similar efficacy profile27.In a study on 417 women with vaginal candidi- asis published in 201232 the efficacy and tolera- bility of treatment with a vaginal capsule of 600 mg of fenticonazole were evaluated.
