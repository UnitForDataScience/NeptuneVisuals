Our patient had a history of recurrent C difficile infec- tion that cleared with a fecal microbiota transplant.Although the initial success rates for the use of fecal microbiota transplant were anecdotal and based on case series a recent randomized placebo- controlled trial revealed the superiority of fecal microbiota transplant in managing recurrent C diffi- cile infection compared with placebo in nonpregnant adult patients with recurrent C difficile.8 Patients with recurrent C difficile infection have a marked dysbiosis with decreased microbiome bacterial diversity and deficiency of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.

Changes in fecal microbiota struc- ture after fecal microbiota transplant have shown increased relative abundance of Bacteroides species and increased diversity within 2 weeks postproce- dure.9 Overall the success of fecal microbiota trans- plant has led to its incorporation into medical guidelines for the management of recurrent and refractory C difficile.4 Cost-effective analysis also sug- gests that fecal microbiota transplant is more cost- effective than vancomycin for treatment of recurrent C difficile.10 Short-term minor adverse events include abdominal bloating flatulence diarrhea and consti- pation.11 Short-term serious adverse events include potentials risks related to endoscopic procedures such as perforation and aspiration and risk of transmission of enteric pathogens which have been reported in rare cases in nonpregnant adults undergoing fecal microbiota transplant.12 Theoretical risks associated508 Saeedi et alFecal Transplant in PregnancyOBSTETRICS  GYNECOLOGYwith invasive procedures including colonoscopy are a concern in pregnant patients.

Follow-up 4 monthsafter the delivery indicated that the infant was developing normally and the patient has had no further recurrence of C difficile infection.DISCUSSIONClostridium difficile in pregnancy is a significant concern with reports of septic shock toxic megacolon and death resulting from the infection.1 Over the past decade increased reports of C difficile infection in pregnant and peripartum patients have been seen alongside an increased incidence of C difficile infection in the general population.7 The use of antibiotics in the peripartum period potential breakdown of infection control meas- ures in hospitals rise in number of infections as a result of the hypervirulent NAP1B1027 C difficile strain and an increased incidence of community-acquired cases of C difficile infection may potentially account for this rise.

Refrac- tory C difficile infection is defined by failure of improvement in symptoms with vancomycin or fidax- omicin after 5 days.3 Fecal microbiota transplant has become the standard for treatment of recurrent and refractory C difficile infection.

The use of fecal micro- biota transplant is indicated in those who have had two or more recurrences of C difficile infection with failure of vancomycin taper at least two episodes of C difficile infection with one episode leading to hospi- talization and significant morbidity or refractory C difficile infection.4 The low adverse event profile and high efficacy rates reaching above 90 for fecal microbiota transplant in nonpregnant adults provide support for the expansion of its use.5 However little data exist on its use in certain populations including pregnant patients.

She no longer required antibiotics for the remainder of her pregnancy to treat C difficile and had a term vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation.CONCLUSION Our pregnant patient tolerated and responded to a fecal microbiota transplant for treatment of recurrent C difficile infection.

We present the case of a young pregnant woman who underwent a successful fecal microbiota transplant for treatment of recurrent C dif- ficile infection.CASEThe patient is a pregnant 28-year-old white woman gravida 1 para 0 with a medical history of hypothyroid- ism and polycystic ovary syndrome who presented to the outpatient gastroenterology clinic at 16 weeks of gesta- tion with recurrent C difficile infection.

Although our report of a fecal microbiota transplant in a pregnant patient provides some support for its use in treatment of recurrent C difficile infection in this population careful consid- eration and discussion with patients of risks compared with benefits should be made before offering this ther- apy to similar patients.REFERENCESRouphael NG O'Donnell JA Bhatnagar J Lewis F Polgreen PM Beekmann S et al.
