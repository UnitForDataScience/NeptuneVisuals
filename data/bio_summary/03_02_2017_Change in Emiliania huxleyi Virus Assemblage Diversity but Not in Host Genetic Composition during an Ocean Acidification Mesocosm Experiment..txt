In this study we have no evidence to support the hypothesis that higher pCO2 conditions might benefit certain E. huxleyi genotypes we could detect no restructuring of the E. huxleyi population in the different pCO2 treatments.Contradictory results are constant features of experiments to investigate the effect of pCO2pH change on coccolithophores.

Early experiments suggested negative effects of higher pCO2 on production and calcification in E. huxleyi  but other studies have indicated that the effect of increased pCO2 is minimal for other coccolithophore species .

E. huxleyi growth rate was not affected by the different pCO2 treatments but the burst size of EhV-99B1 was lower in present-day compared with higher and lower pre-industrial pCO2.

Alternatively other unknown factors that are not related to pCO2 cannot be dismissed and might be the cause of the different coccolithophore response in enclosure M3.Our study demonstrates the need for further investigations on the effects of elevated pCO2 on the E. huxleyi EhV system since there are ecological impacts of virus competition on biogeochemical cycles.

The relationship between pCO2pH change and success or otherwise of cocccolithophores remains confusing and requires clearer examination of mechanisms that might lead to phytoplankton changes in the future ocean.Given that the coccolithophores numbers in enclosure M3 were very different from the other two high pCO2 treatments and yet the E. huxleyi genetic diversity was very similar in all three enclosures could viral infection by EhV be a contributing factor to explain the observed variations within and between treatments In the three ambient-pCO2 enclosures the EhV population followed a pattern that has been seen in other mesocosm experiments--high variability during the early stages of phytoplankton bloom development with a smaller number of genotypes coming to dominate as the E. huxleyi numbers increase .

huxleyi bloom.How might reduced EhV diversity in M3 have resulted in higher coccolithophore numbers developing than in the two other high pCO2 treatments where growth was curtailed One explanation would be that the EhVs that lead to rapid termination of E. huxleyi growth  were not present in sufficient numbers in M3 to suppress growth of the E. huxleyi population in this enclosure.

Thus studies that aim to explain the effect of elevated pCO2 must incorporate into their experimental design ways to distinguish between a direct effect on external virus particles or on E. huxleyi cells or on EhVs that have already infected E. huxleyi cells.

DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit Qiagen Valencia CA USA according to the manufacturer's instructions.Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis DGGE of E. huxleyi and EhV PopulationsPCRDGGE analyses of extracted DNA from the 6 mesocosms were carried out according to the protocol for E. huxleyi and E. huxleyi viruses EhV as detailed in Schroeder et al.

In this study the response of a population of E. huxleyi to increased pCO2 at the early stages of a phytoplankton bloom in a mesocosm experiment has been investigated.

In this study the aim was to understand how pCO2 change might influence E. huxleyi and EhV population structure and the diversity of host and virus.
