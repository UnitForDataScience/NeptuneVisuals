This method is similar to open-reference clustering except that in our approach all sequences are subjected to de novo clustering following classification whereas in open-reference clustering only those sequences that cannot be classified are subjected to de novo clustering.

We evaluated the quality of the sequence clustering the reproducibility of the clustering the speed of clustering and the amount of memory required to complete the clustering.

Using the four natural community data sets doubling the number of sequences in a data set would increase the time required to cluster the data by 4- to 8-fold and increase the RAM required by 4-fold.

Here we described a new clustering method that seeks to optimize clustering based on an objective criterion that measures clustering quality in real time.

The computational resources required to complete the averageTABLE 1 Description of data sets used to evaluate the OptiClust algorithm and compare its performance to other algorithmsaaEach data set contains sequences from the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

The even and staggered data sets were generated by extracting the V4 region from full- length reference sequences and the data sets from the natural communities were generated by sequencing the V4 region using an Illumina MiSeq with paired reads of either 150 or 250 nt.

The USEARCH- based methods were unable to cluster the human data using the 32-bit free version ofFIG 1 Comparison of de novo clustering algorithms.

The first three columns of each panel contain the results of clustering the data sets i seeding the algorithm with one sequence per OTU and allowing the algorithm to proceed until the MCC value no longer changed ii seeding the algorithm with one sequence per OTU and allowing the algorithm to proceed until the MCC changed by less than 0.0001 and iii seeding the algorithm with all of the sequences in one OTU and allowing the algorithm to proceed until the MCC value no longer changed.

The median from 10 reorderings of the data is presented for each method and data set.

The justification for allowing incomplete conver- gence was based on the observation that numerous iterations are performed that extend the time required to complete the clustering with minimal improvement in clustering Fig.
