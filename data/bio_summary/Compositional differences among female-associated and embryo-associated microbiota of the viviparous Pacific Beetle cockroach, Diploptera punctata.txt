However important aspects of the gut microbial ecology of D. punctata such as differences between male and female gut- associated microbiota gravid and non-gravid females gut micro- biota and gravid females and embryo-associated microbiota re- main to be investigated.In this study we characterized for the first time the micro- biota associated with developing embryos of D. punctata and the gut microbiota of associated laboratory-reared females.

Wings and appendages of females were removed and the body surface-sterilized by rinsing once in 70 ethanol and 10 bleach solution for 30 s and twice in Milli-Q water for 30 s. Upon dissection intact clusters of associated developing embryos usually 10-12 per cluster were removed without rup- turing the digestive tract of the female and rinsed once in 1x phosphate buffered saline PBS pH  7.4 0.1M and placed into1.5 ml tubes for DNA extraction.

Contamination of embryo sam- ples by bacteria from female guts during dissection was avoided since the location and structure of the brood sac enabled thesterile removal of embryos without injury to the digestive tract.

Additionally the entire digestive tract of three non-gravid females from the same colony and three or- phan embryo samples obtained from females from the same colony but not included in this study were also processed for DNA extraction.Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit Hilden Germany according to the manufac- turer's protocol following homogenization of female alimentary tracts and embryo samples using sterile Bio Plas plastic pestles BioPlas Inc San Rafael CA USA in 1x PBS.

Overall eight em- bryonic and eight female gut DNA samples were obtained.

The resulting taxonomic information was subsequently appended to the orig- inal OTU table for downstream analyses.Analyses of community structureSignificant differences in OTU abundances among female and embryo samples were examined in QIIME using the group significance.py command and the default non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance ANOVA in QIIME.
