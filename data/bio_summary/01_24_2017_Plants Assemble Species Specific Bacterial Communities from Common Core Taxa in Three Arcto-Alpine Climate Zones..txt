The endosphere communities from all three regions being relatively similar to each other tended to diverge based on plant species O. digyna or S. oppositifolia on the first two axes in the PCoA ordination Figure 5C while we did not observe plant species specific clustering in the PCoA of the corresponding rhizosphere communities data not shown.On the basis of the above analyses we found partial support for our hypothesis that plant species strongly shape the plant-associated bacterial communities as this factor emerged as the major albeit not the only significant driver of the endosphere bacterial community structures over multiple sites and several regions climate zones.

Clearly even though the bulk soil bacterial communities were influenced by region and sampling site which may relate to soil edaphic factors the plant endospheres shared similar bacterial endophytes across the three regions.This points to a strong and specific filtering effect of the two pioneering plants that were studied allowing similar bacteria to colonize plants from the widely divergent soils in different regions.As a token of the plant-incited filtering effect members of the Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominated the endosphere bacterial communities.

We focused on the root endophytic bacteria and also examined the bacterial communities in the relevant rhizosphere and bulk soil samples.We hypothesized that 1 geographic region related to climate zone determines the diversity and community structure of the soil bacterial communities in the selected habitats and 2 plants strongly shape the plant-associated communities resulting in plant species specificity regardless of the geographic region.

They also explained the differences between the endosphere and the soil bacterial communities and those between the endosphere communities in the different geographical regions Table 4.

In addition to the shared bacterial taxa 162 OTUs 1749 reads 1.1 of the total endosphere reads and 57 OTUs 879 reads 0.6 were observed only in O. digyna and S. oppositifolia respectively Figure 6A.TABLE 4  Twenty key OTUs shaping the endosphere communities in O. digyna and S. oppositifolia in the three regions identified by SIMPER Contributions of variables to similarity analysis.Numerical values indicate  contribution of the respective OTUs in determining the difference in community composition between endosphere and rhizosphere between O. digyna andS.

This suggests that a plant-incited protective or nutritional effect on bacterial communities becomes increasingly more important in soils in which conditions are challenging.Specific OTUs Determine the Divergence of the Soil Bacteriomes across Three RegionsIn this study we detected only few endemic bacterial OTUs as the great majority of the bacterial taxa was found in all three geographically distant regions.

oppositifolia had similar SR and SI indices in the rhizo- as well as the endosphere communities.Also the community structures of the endosphere bacterial communities differed clearly from those of the bulk and rhizosphere soil ones across all three regions as demonstrated by PCoA Figure 5A.

Alternatively their absence from the previous data sets might be due to different 16S rRNA targeting primers used in the different studies.TABLE 5  Highly conserved core OTUs of O. digyna and S. oppositifolia endospheres.OTU PhylaClassOrderFamilyGenusSpecies ADDITIONAL CORE OTUS OF S. OPPOSITIFOLIAOTUs present in minimum of three endosphere samples out of four in all sampling sites in all regions per plant species are included.Compartment is the Primary Driver of Bacterial Community StructuresA striking observation was that both O. digyna and S. oppositifolia sampled in any of the three regions exhibited quite similar endosphere bacterial communities.

Here we hypothesized that the bacterial communities associated with pioneer plants in these regions have major roles in plant health support and this is reflected in the formation of climate and host plant specific endophytic communities.

Of the 13 core OTUs 11 were predominantly present in the plant associated compartments as over 75 of their reads were detected in the endosphere and over 80 in the endo- or rhizosphere Figure 7.DISCUSSIONFactors Shaping the Bacterial Diversity in Soils across Three Climatic RegionsIn this study we examined the bacterial communities in three regions spanning over 3000 km in distance i.e.
