It is also evidenced that genera Pre- votella and Bacteroides are the major contributors of CAZymes in HF cross whilst genus Clostridium contributes a larger percentage of CAZymes in Angus Jersey and termite metagenomes Mining of CAZymes across large herbivore metagenomesA Venn diagram was used to illustrate the common and distinct classes of CAZymes belonging to three CAZy families GHs CBMs and CEs in each metagenome and the results are shown in The Venn diagram clearly depicts the exclusivity and uniqueness of three classes of CAZymes in HF crossbreds Angus cross Jersey cow and termites.

Blue color indicates low and high abundance.For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article.families of CAZymes are shared by any two of the microbiomes considered for comparative analysis 4 families by HF cross and Angus 21familiesby HF cross and Jersey 5 families by HF cross and termite 0 families by Angus and Jersey 2 families by Jersey and termite 1family by Angus and termite.

Similarly 23 CAZyme fam- ilies were shared by any three microbiomes 3 families by HF cross Angus and termite 8 families by HF cross Angus and Jersey 9 families by HF cross Jersey and termite.DiscussionThe rumen harbors a conglomerate of microorganisms includ- ing bacteria archaea fungi and protozoa which play a critical role in the bioconversion of plant lignocellulosic biomass.

The natu- ral capability of rumen microbiota to produce an array of potential enzymes that hydrolyzes the rigid lignocellulosic biomass has been successfully employed to treat different systems like agricultural residues and straw waste The application of different arti- ficial rumen systems for organic waste conversion was also being extensively studied.Comparative metagenomicsCAT analysis of HF rumen metagenome unraveled a reper- toire of CAZymes and comparative analysis with other rumen metagenomes and termite gut has also confirmed that HF cross rumen accounts for a wide range of enzymes belonging to differ- ent GH families Supplementary file 5.

The objective of our study was to provide a detailed account of the metabolic poten-tial of CAZymes that hydrolyze the plant cell wall polysaccharides in HF cross rumen and to identify the microbial communities in cattle rumen that significantly act as the major source of these enzymes.Mining CAZymes from cattle rumen metagenomeThe CAZy database  can be inferred as the bibliotheca for all the information pertaining to the diverse group of enzymes that play a chief role in the catabolism of com- plex and simple carbohydrates A manually curated database information is archived with respect to all CAZyme families glycoside hydrolases glycosyltransferases polysaccharide lyases carbohydrate esterases carbohydrate binding modules and auxil- iary activities it now allows one to examine all known families and enzymes involved in cellulolysis hemicellulolysis and pec- tienolysis.

CAT analysis also detected the presence of nineteen families of CBMs ten families of CEs two fam- ilies of PLs and five families of AAs in HF cross rumen metagenome Supplementary file 3.Microbial community analysis of putative CAZyme contigsAll 17164 putative CAZyme encoding regions from HF cross metagenome coding for GHs 7574 GTs 5185 CBMs 2418 CEs 1516 PLs 434 and AAs 37 were analyzed separately in order to determine their phylogenetic origin.

STAMP analysis helped in unraveling the comparative abundance of statistically sig- nificant genera among HF cross rumen and termite metagenome as given in Taxonomic affiliation of orfs encoding CAZymes by M5NR database at genus level revealed that Prevotella Bac- teroides Clostridium Fibrobacter Ruminococcus Parabacteroides Eubacterium Bacillus Butyrivibrio and Flavobacterium contribute a significant proportion of putative CAZymes in the HF cross rumen metagenome.

The top ten CAZyme encoding genera was selected from HF cross metagenome 4698396 and the abundance of these selected genera was compared with Jersey cow 4698399 Termite gut 4698398 and Angus cross 4698397 and represented graphically.ing bacterial communities inhabiting the HF cross cattle rumen is basically similar to other ruminants.

The high rate of formation of VFA by microbial enzymes is an added advantage since VFA can meet up almost 80 of energy requirements for the host The role of these enzymes in fiber digestion has to be studied further to understand the novel pathways involved in fiber digestion inside the cattle rumen.The Comparative analysis of CAZyme families as revealed in thefour metagenomes indicates that there are 37 unique families of CAZymes in HF steers.

Out of the 135 reported GH families in the CAZy database 78 families were represented in HF rumen metagenome where 708 putative sequences were affiliated to GH3 family alone which may encode -glucosidase xylan14--xylosidase and -glucosylceramidase.The second most prominent group of CAZymes in HF cattlerumen were the putative enzymes belonging to functional class GTs represented by 32 different families.
