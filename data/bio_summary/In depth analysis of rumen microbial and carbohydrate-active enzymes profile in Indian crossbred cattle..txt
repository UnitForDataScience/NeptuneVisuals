it is also evidenced that genera pre- votella and bacteroides are the major contributors of cazymes in hf cross whilst genus clostridium contributes a larger percentage of cazymes in angus jersey and termite metagenomes mining of cazymes across large herbivore metagenomesa venn diagram was used to illustrate the common and distinct classes of cazymes belonging to three cazy families ghs cbms and ces in each metagenome and the results are shown in the venn diagram clearly depicts the exclusivity and uniqueness of three classes of cazymes in hf crossbreds angus cross jersey cow and termites.

blue color indicates low and high abundance.for interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article.families of cazymes are shared by any two of the microbiomes considered for comparative analysis 4 families by hf cross and angus 21familiesby hf cross and jersey 5 families by hf cross and termite 0 families by angus and jersey 2 families by jersey and termite 1family by angus and termite.

anal- ysis of the assembled sequences by pfam-based carbohydrate-active enzyme analysis toolkit identified 17164 putative protein-encoding cazymes belonging to different families of glycoside hydrolases 7574 glycosyltransferases 5185 carbohydrate-binding modules 2418 carbohydrate esterases 1516 aux- iliary activities 434 and polysaccharide lyases 37. phylogenetic analysis of putative cazymes revealed that a significant proportion of cazymes were contributed by bacteria belonging to the phylum bac- teroidetes 40 firmicutes 30 and proteobacteria 10. the comparative analysis of hf cross rumen metagenome with other herbivore metagenomes indicated that indian crossbred cattle rumen is endowed with a battery of cazymes that may play a central role in lignocellulose deconstruction.

stamp analysis helped in unraveling the comparative abundance of statistically sig- nificant genera among hf cross rumen and termite metagenome as given in taxonomic affiliation of orfs encoding cazymes by m5nr database at genus level revealed that prevotella bac- teroides clostridium fibrobacter ruminococcus parabacteroides eubacterium bacillus butyrivibrio and flavobacterium contribute a significant proportion of putative cazymes in the hf cross rumen metagenome.

the natu- ral capability of rumen microbiota to produce an array of potential enzymes that hydrolyzes the rigid lignocellulosic biomass has been successfully employed to treat different systems like agricultural residues and straw waste the application of different arti- ficial rumen systems for organic waste conversion was also being extensively studied.comparative metagenomicscat analysis of hf rumen metagenome unraveled a reper- toire of cazymes and comparative analysis with other rumen metagenomes and termite gut has also confirmed that hf cross rumen accounts for a wide range of enzymes belonging to differ- ent gh families supplementary file 5. the relative proportions of major cellulases endo-hemicellulases oligosaccharide degrading enzymes and other predicted gh families are also diverse among other ruminant metagenomes and termite gut supplemen- tary file 5. hf cross rumen metagenome had the maximum number of debranching enzymes 15.84 compared to angus jersey and termite metagenomes and a large number of oligosaccharide degrading enzymes 51.59 than termite and jersey were also identified the presence of high amount of both debranch- ing and oligosaccharide degrading enzymes naturally results in the accumulation of simple sugars and thereby production of volatile fatty acids vfa from plant polymers.

similarly 23 cazyme fam- ilies were shared by any three microbiomes 3 families by hf cross angus and termite 8 families by hf cross angus and jersey 9 families by hf cross jersey and termite.discussionthe rumen harbors a conglomerate of microorganisms includ- ing bacteria archaea fungi and protozoa which play a critical role in the bioconversion of plant lignocellulosic biomass.

features with a q value of 0.05 were considered statistically significant.comparison of cazymes across large herbivorous metagenomesa venn diagram was constructed taking into consideration the published data from angus cross jersey cow and termite gut along with the data generated in our study using jvenn  a total of 107 cazyme fam- ilies belonging to three different classes of cazymes gh cbm  ce were identified using cat analysis from hf cross rumen.

the top ten cazyme encoding genera was selected from hf cross metagenome 4698396 and the abundance of these selected genera was compared with jersey cow 4698399 termite gut 4698398 and angus cross 4698397 and represented graphically.ing bacterial communities inhabiting the hf cross cattle rumen is basically similar to other ruminants.

the objective of our study was to provide a detailed account of the metabolic poten-tial of cazymes that hydrolyze the plant cell wall polysaccharides in hf cross rumen and to identify the microbial communities in cattle rumen that significantly act as the major source of these enzymes.mining cazymes from cattle rumen metagenomethe cazy database  can be inferred as the bibliotheca for all the information pertaining to the diverse group of enzymes that play a chief role in the catabolism of com- plex and simple carbohydrates a manually curated database information is archived with respect to all cazyme families glycoside hydrolases glycosyltransferases polysaccharide lyases carbohydrate esterases carbohydrate binding modules and auxil- iary activities it now allows one to examine all known families and enzymes involved in cellulolysis hemicellulolysis and pec- tienolysis.

the percentages contributions of cazymes of these ten genera were estimated in angus cross jersey cow and termites metagenomes and compared with that of hf cross.

the percentage contribution of top cazyme encod- ing genera from hf rumen was compared with the other three metagenomes and the results indicate that 49 cazymes belong to these ten genera in hf cross rumen.

however the genus level comparative analysis of major cazyme contributing microbiota in hf cattle rumen with two other published rumen metagenome data sets indicates that the top ten cazyme producers in hf cross rumen contribute significantly less number of cazymes in jersey 36 and angus 36 metagenomes.

cat analysis also detected the presence of nineteen families of cbms ten families of ces two fam- ilies of pls and five families of aas in hf cross rumen metagenome supplementary file 3.microbial community analysis of putative cazyme contigsall 17164 putative cazyme encoding regions from hf cross metagenome coding for ghs 7574 gts 5185 cbms 2418 ces 1516 pls 434 and aas 37 were analyzed separately in order to determine their phylogenetic origin.

this study was under- taken with the objectives of deciphering cazymes diversity and to determine the microbes contributing to this diversity of enzymes in hf cross cattle fed finger millet straw along with para grass and concentrate mixture.

the chart shows the predominance cazymes encoding putative glycoside hydrolases in the hf cross metagenome followed by glyco- syltransferses and carbohydrate binding modules.
