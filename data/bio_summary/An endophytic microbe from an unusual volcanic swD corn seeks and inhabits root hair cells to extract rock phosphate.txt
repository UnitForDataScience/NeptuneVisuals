IJ Representative confocal microscopy images showing colonization of GFP-tagged 3F11 cells on annual ryegrass root systems 7 days following seed- inoculation and growth on either I rock P or J soluble P showing the difference in the extent of colonization.As the confocal images suggested that root systems colonized by endophyte 3F11 had unusually long root hairs root hair length and density were quantified.

Localization of endophyte 3F11 on the surface and inside root hairs of annual ryegrass along with evidence that 3F11 promotes root hair growth.

Here we demonstrated that a bacterial endophyte strain 3F11 from a unique maize that grows in swamps on volcanic rock in Nicaragua has the ability to help a P hyperaccumulating grass grow on rock P. In a P-insoluble rhizosphere 3F11 colonizes epidermal sur- faces targets root hairs for intracellular habitation promotes root hair growth and acidifies the rhizosphere.

Furthermore our results demonstrate that strain 3F11 has the ability to maintain its targeting ability in two evo- lutionary divergent hosts corn and annual ryegrass suggesting that the host recognition machinery is conserved.Endophyte 3F11 targets root hair cells.

The plates were visualized for acid production colour change and in par- allel imaged under UV to visualize GFP tagged endophyte cells.To test whether acid production by 3F11 was affected by the bioavailability of P in growth medium 3F11 coated seeds were grown on rock P and soluble P containing media described earlier.

To confirm colonization of 3F11 into plant roots roots that germinated from annual ryegrass seeds inoculated with GFP-tagged 3F11 were incubated onto LB agar plates supplemented with kanamycin 25 ugml for 24 h and then plates were imaged under UV using a UV macroscope Illuminatool LT9900 Epifluorescent System Lightools Montreal Canada.

Here we describe a bacterialendophyte 3F11 from Zea nicaraguensis a wild corn discovered in a Nicaraguan swamp above rock-P lava flowing from the San Cristobal volcano.

After 4-5 weeks one endophyte 3F11 showed significantly increased root biomass in 4 independent trials p  0.005 0.003 0.1 0.04 respectively Fig.

Strain 3F11 did not consistently increase shoot biomass or the rootshoot biomass ratio on rock P Supplementary Fig.

To identify endophyte 3F11 taxonomically its 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified using universal 16S primers then sequenced.
