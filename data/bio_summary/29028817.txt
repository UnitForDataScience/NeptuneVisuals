For exam- ple dysfunction in enterocytes carbohydrate transportation  inflammation that is not fully consistent with a classic GI disorder   and imbalances in the enteric microbiome - have all been reported.As discussed in our recent review the connection between GI symptoms and ASD through mitochondrial dysfunction is compelling since ASD is strongly associated with both GI symp- toms and mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction is strongly associated with GI symptoms .

To understand if mitochondrial abnormalities are unique to children with ASD we compared measurement of mitochondrial function in children with ASD to two groups of children without ASD those with Crohn's disease and those with non-specific GI complaints.Children's Research Institute Little Rock AR for analysis.

To control for individual variability in mitochondrial function we com- pared mitochondrial function in the cecum to mitochondrial function in the rectum less com- monly a site of GI pathology in children with ASD and an area of the GI tract where the microbiota is not metabolically active .Material and methodsThe Institutional Review Board of the Massachusetts General Hospital Boston MA approved the collection and storage of participant samples for later analysis.

Indeed SCFA can disrupt cellular physiology in order to cause lower GI tract symptoms associated with ASD such as non-specific inflammation and dysmo- tility   .To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to GI symptoms in chil- dren with ASD we directly measured mitochondrial function in GI mucosa of children with ASD See .

Overall these findings suggest that the mitochondrial physiology of the GI tract in children with ASD is different than neuro- typical children with some change in mitochondrial function particularly prominent in the cecum.

Citrate synthase and ETC Complex IV activity was not sig- nificantly different across Areas Cecum vs Rectum or Group .DiscussionIn this study mitochondrial function in the GI tract was tested in the cecum and rectal mucosa and blindly compared between children with ASD to neurotypical children with Crohn's dis- ease and those with non-specific GI symptoms.

Furthermore other measures of mitochondrial function on the biopsy tissue would help validate our findings but given the limited availability and quantity of GI biopsy tissue in the ASD population we have attempted to optimize the assays performed.ConclusionsThis study has demonstrated abnormalities in mitochondrial activity in the lower GI tract of children with ASD particularly in the cecum.

We hypothesized that not only would we find mitochondrial dysfunction in the GI tract of children with ASD but also that mitochondrial dysfunction would be specific to an area of the GI tract where the microbiome is most metabolically active.

Understanding the connection between mito- chondrial dysfunction and GI abnormalities can help clarify the association between behav- ioral manifestations and GI pathology the resistance of children with ASD to standard GI treatment and the GI pathology associated with ASD.Supporting informationS1 Table.

Differences in mitochondrial function were found in children with ASD as compared to the other control groups across several ETC com- plexes suggesting a difference in overall mitochondrial function rather than a change in one specific mitochondrial enzyme.
