Also we found that AP inhib- ited the goblet cell hyperplasia in HFD-fed rats mainly through the down-regulation of the protein expression of Relm but not NF- KB and the expression of apoptosis associated proteins and D. More recent studies suggested an important role for Relm on the composition of gut microbiota In addition Relm has been correlated with Th2 cytokine-induced immune activation inducing goblet cell hyperplasia and up-regulating MUC2 expression which is in agreement with our results that up-regulation of Relm in HFD-fed rats was associated with goblet cell hyperplasia and up-regulation of MUC2 induced by HFD and C. Notably MUC2 expression was upregulated in HFD-fed rats which contra- dicts the fact that the mucus layer thickness was decreased.

A growing body of evidence indicates that MUC2 expression is regulated either at transcriptional or epigenetic level Acti- vation of transcription factor NF-KB upregulates MUC2 expression via MAPK pathway in colon epithelial cells while PGE2 induces MUC2 expression through the activation of transcription factors CREBATF1 mediated by MAPK and P38 pathways In addi- tion recent studies have shown that MUC2 expression is regulated by another goblet cell product resistin-like molecule RELM which regulates macrophage and adaptive T cell responses during inflammation and induces goblet cell hyperplasia Given the important function of autophagy in numerous secretory path- ways a recent study showed that autophagic process was also required for the secretion of MUC2 granules from goblet cells Overall the alteration of MUC2 can lead to the destruc- tive colon barrier which allows the translocation of microbiota and microbial products and systemic chronic inflammation.

However 5 AP and 10AP significantly induced the autophagy of goblet cells P  0.05 A. Immunofluorescence staining of LC-3AB further showed the defect in autophagy of goblet cells in HFD-fed rats which could be reversed by AP and demonstrated that the autophagy mainly localized within goblet cells B.DiscussionThe protective effect of apples was partially due to the phytochemicals containing quercetin catechin phloridzin and chlorogenic acid all of which are strong antioxidants Intrigu- ingly we extracted apple polysaccharide from Fuji apples and our preliminary results showed that apple polysaccharide AP sup- pressed chronic colon carcinogenesis in Azoxymethanedextran sodium sulfate AOMDSS-treated mice in vivo.

Notably autophagy has been illustrated to be critical for secretory path- ways in a variety of secretory cells To confirm the effect of AP on reducing gut permeability was due to inducing the autophagy of goblet cells we assessed the expression of a series of marker proteins for autophagosomes.

To further define this observed phenomenon in goblet cells the expression of NF-KB P65 IKB-a Relm that have defined roles in goblet hyperplasia was further assessed.

Firstly there is no doubt that the structure and composition of intestinal microbiota are altered in numerous chronic maladies and growing evidence suggests that these alterations play impor- tant roles in disease onset and progression Secondly SCFAs as the microbial product exerting important effects on the intestinal barrier integrity and function are decreased in chronic dysbiosis Thirdly alterations in the microbiota may dis- rupt the balance of the host immune system leading to a chronic state of low-level inflammation and impaired metabolic activities Finally changes in gut flora composition often correlate with disruptions in the epithelial and mucosal barrier allowing the translocation of microbial product lipopolysaccharide LPS and pathogenic bacteria from the intestinal lumen into circulation Of note the function of goblet cells directly manages the gut permeability because of the principal component of the intestinal mucus layer Mucin2 MUC2 which is mainly produced by goblet cells.

It was demonstrated that the expression of MUC2 was significantly up-regulated by HFD but reduced after the treatment of AP C. Paradoxi- cally these results suggested that HFD-fed rats exhibited reduced mucus layer thickness and elevated expression of MUC2.

B AP treatment shows no effect on the expression of NF-kBp65 and its inhibitor phosphor-IKB-a however 10 AP reduces the expression of Relm in colonic tissue of HFD fed rats.

Similarly the expression of tight junction protein Occludin was inhibited in HFD-fed rats C. However AP significantly decreased intestinal permeability with elevated level of serum LBP and increased expression of Occludin.

Autophagy is thought to be crucial in numerous secretory cells including paneth cells and osteoclasts It is likely that AP increasing the mucosal layer thickness in HFD-fed rats is due to the improved autophagic processes that required for the secretion of mucus granules.
