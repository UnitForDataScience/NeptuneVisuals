although pro- biotics have been shown to be effective in the treatment of gastroin- testinal diseases5 clinical trials to determine their effect on improvement of metabolic disorders have had mixed results.6 the few clinical trials of probiotics that have been conducted specifically in people with type 2 diabetes mostly tested blends of probiotic gen- era rather than individual strains.78 furthermore recent meta- analyses of such trials concluded that although probiotics had a mod- erate effect on fasting blood glucose levels findings on glycated hemoglobin hba1c the gold standard measure of chronic glycae- mia were inconsistent.78it has been suggested that probiotics achieve their beneficial effect though modulation of the gut microbiota9 and compelling evi- dence indeed indicates that alterations in the gut microbiota compo- sition are associated with type 2 diabetes in humans1011 however although lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains can alter the gut microbiota composition in animal models probiotic-induced microbial changes in humans are less evident.9 other potential mechanisms for the beneficial effects of probiotics include modulation of immunologi- cal responses and altered production of intestinal-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids9 and secondary bile acids.12 to date no studies have investigated the relationship between the effect of probiotics on metabolic markers the gut microbiota composition and bile acids specifically in people with type 2 diabetes.we performed a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the metabolic effects of supplementation with l. reuteri dsm 17938 in participants with type 2 diabetes who were receiving insulin therapy.

introduction type 2 diabetes is considered a lifestyle disease in genetically suscep- tible individuals and is characterized by high blood glucose insulin resistance and relative lack of insulin.1 treatment of the disease is based on alleviation of insulin resistance by lifestyle changes andmedication according to specific algorithms and guidelines.2 good metabolic control is hard to achieve however and alternative strate- gies to normalize blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes are required.3probiotics are defined by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and world health organization as livemicroorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.4 the most common probiotics are strains of the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.

in addition many of the participants were receiving metformin which is known to affect the gut microbiota composition and to be an important confounder of metagenomic studies in patients with type 2 diabetes38 however an important aim of the present study was to determine if probiotics could be beneficial in people with established diabetes as indicated by their relatively long diabetes duration and requirement for insulin therapy and oral hypoglycaemic agents.

dexa mrs and mri were repeated at visit 6 week 11. at visit 7 week 12 blood urine and faeces samples were collected and the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp procedure was repeated.participants were also requested to collect urine samples on the 2 consecutive days before and in the morning of each of the studyvisits 3 4 5 and 7. body weight height waist circumference and blood pressure were measured at each visit.

the first participant was recruited on may 21 2012 and the final visit of the overall study was on july 12 2013. diet and lifestyle informationquestionnaires and diaries were used to determine total caloric intake.
