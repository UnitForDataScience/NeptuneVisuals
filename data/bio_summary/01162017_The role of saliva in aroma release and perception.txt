In both studies human saliva had a stronger effect than artificial saliva possibly due to specific interactions between tannins and proteins in real saliva as these proteins are not included in artificial saliva.

It also considers the indirect impact of saliva such as changes of aroma diffusion through modification of the physicochemical properties of the food matrix.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In an in vivo experiment aiming at determining the relative contribution of the main food oral pro- cessing events in aroma release during cheese consumption it was found that aroma release was poorly linked to the composition of resting saliva but it was explained by the characteristics of stim- ulated saliva  emphasizing the importance of saliva composition and flow.

The authors proposed thatprotein-protein interactions could preclude the access to a part of the binding sites of the proteins modifying the total number of binding sites available for aroma molecules  .Regarding differences between artificial and human saliva did not observe any significant difference on aldehyde release from rehydrated diced bell peppers in pres- ence of whole human saliva or artificial saliva  .

However proteomic investigations did not report the presence of aldose reductase in human saliva .Thiols have been also reported to be sensitive to degradation in the presence of non-denatured human saliva while they are not affected by heated saliva suggesting that they are degraded by salivary enzymatic activity .

While these studies suggest an effect of saliva on aroma release using a dynamic mouth model system and monitoring aroma release in the few seconds after saliva addition did not observe any effect of artificial saliva on initial flavour release from solutions .

Among the different physiological parame- ters involved the literature reports that saliva has various effects on VOCs and therefore appears as a major actor impacting the perception of aroma.This article reviews how saliva takes part in aroma release considering both in vitro and in vivo approaches and how it may affect perception.

Inter-individual variability of saliva impacts both the flow and the composition of saliva.

Finally we will review how saliva can influence aroma release from food matrices through dilution or modification of the matrix or food bolus properties.Interactions between saliva components and aroma moleculesBinding of aroma molecules to salivary proteinsProteins have demonstrated their ability to interact with aroma compounds and consequently to modify aroma release and per- ception .

In contrast demonstrated a stronger effect of human whole saliva than artificial saliva on ester release.
