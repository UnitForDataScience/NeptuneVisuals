Lactobacillus farraginis the phylogenetically closest validated species of strain P4006 was first isolated in 2007 from distilled shochu residue shochu is a Japanese spirit made from rice sweet potato barley or other starchy materials but was never isolated from humans .Because the 16S rRNA gene sequence was in the range of 98.7 to define a new species  strain Marseille P4006 wasNew Microbe and New Infect 2018 21 20- 22c 2017 The Authors.

Phylogenetic tree showing positioning of 'Lactobacillus raoultii' strain Marseille P4006 relative to its phylogenetically closest bacterial species with standing in nomenclature.

Thus we propose that strain Marseille P4006 may be the putative representative of a novel species named 'Lactobacillus raoultii' ra.oul'ti.i N.L.

Strain Marseille P4006T is the type strain of the new species 'Lactobacillus raoultii' sp.

Thus 16S rRNA sequencing was performed with fD1-rP2 primers as previously described Eurogentec Seraing Belgium using a 3130-XL sequencer Applied Biosciences Saint Aubin France .16S rRNA gene sequence-based identification of strain Marseille P4006 exhibited a 98.1 sequence similarity with Lactobacillus farraginis strain JCM8627 GenBank accession no.
