IL-23 is released by several immune cells including Th17 hence interaction of IL-23 with its corresponding receptor on Th17 leads to production of IL-17A in an autocrine manner .

It appears that Th17 development in the gut mucosa is more dependent on GM than interaction with other immune cells including Th1 Th2 and Treg and GM-derived lipolopysachardie LPS plays key roles in pro- gression of Th17 lineage  .

In direct man- ner the SFB-derived antigens participate in the development of Th17 lineage while in indirect format SFB induces expres- sion of damage-associated molecular patterns DAMPs such as serum amyloid A SAA which influence Th17 cell differ- entiation  .

In the case of increased number of GM Th17 are increased and fight against GM and decrease them which in itself results in decreased number of Th17 lineage.

Interestingly another study demonstrated that depletion of Th17 lineage using specific anti-GM Th17 cells is associated with severe graft versus host disease GVHD following stem cell transplant recipients .

Th17 including ab and gd Th cells and macrophages are the main cells which produce IL-17A in response to several inducers including IL-23  .

IL-23 is a cytokine which is essential for maintenance of Th17 the main IL-17A producing cell .

IL-23 receptor IL-23R on the Th17 and macrophages consists of two sub- units including beta 1 which interacts with IL-12p40 subunit and IL23-specific subunit which interacts with IL-23A .

RORgt and RORa play essential roles in Th17 differentiation from Th0 cells and also expression of IL- 17A by the cells .

Accordingly the patterns of IL- 17A in response to GM may be a key mechanism to regulate incidence of autoimmune disorders.IL-17A and Gut MicrobiotaBased on the investigations regarding the roles played by IL- 17A in response to GM three main categories have been designed for IL-17A 1 physiological roles of IL-17A 2 the roles played by IL-17A to induce production of antimicro- bial peptides and 3 pathological roles of IL-17A.Physiological Roles of IL-17A in the FightAgainst Microbes and Also Improvement of Diseases in Gut Microbiota-Dependent MannerRecent evidences have demonstrated that development of Th17 cells in the gut mucosa follows a different format when compared to other tissues.
