il-23 is released by several immune cells including th17 hence interaction of il-23 with its corresponding receptor on th17 leads to production of il-17a in an autocrine manner .

it appears that th17 development in the gut mucosa is more dependent on gm than interaction with other immune cells including th1 th2 and treg and gm-derived lipolopysachardie lps plays key roles in pro- gression of th17 lineage  .

in direct man- ner the sfb-derived antigens participate in the development of th17 lineage while in indirect format sfb induces expres- sion of damage-associated molecular patterns damps such as serum amyloid a saa which influence th17 cell differ- entiation  .

in the case of increased number of gm th17 are increased and fight against gm and decrease them which in itself results in decreased number of th17 lineage.

interestingly another study demonstrated that depletion of th17 lineage using specific anti-gm th17 cells is associated with severe graft versus host disease gvhd following stem cell transplant recipients .
