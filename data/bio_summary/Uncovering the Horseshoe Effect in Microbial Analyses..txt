But as far as Euclidean distance is concerned sample 10 is just as dissimilar to sample 1 as sample 20 just because there are no common bacteria shared between these samples.

The overlap of the first sample in the band table and sample 10 and beyond disappears and the distance between these samples is maximized.

This can yield unintuitive properties sample 10 could be less dissimilar to sample 1 than sample 20.

For instance sample 10 could represent a medium-pH environment sample 1 could represent a low-pH environment and sample 20 could represent a high-pH environment.

Therefore even if two samples are not overlapping samples closer together have a smaller distance value than samples further apart in the gradient.

All analyses can be found under .The mean gradient used for the 2 case studies was calculated as followsgN g xi 1x  l i lD xi1j1 jwhere xi is the proportion of OTU x in sample i g x is the mean gradient of OTU x and gi is the sample gradient at sample i.

Here we propose a rationale for the observed horseshoe effect from multiple dimensionality reduction techniques applied to simulations soil samples and samples from post- mortem mice.

Sample 20 is expected to be more different from sample 1 than sample 10 since it contains very different microbes that thrive in high-pH environments.
