approx- imately 58 of these otus occurred in at least two mosquito species but only three otus gluconobacter otu 1 propionibacterium otu 9 and staphylococcus otu 31 occurred in all 12 mosquito species.

individuals of different mosquito species shared similar gut micro- biota and it was common for individuals of the same species from the same study site and collection date to harbor different gut microbiota.

albopictus differed significantly from all other mosquitoes species and was primarily driven by the dominance of wolbachia.conclusion and significancethese findings expand the range of mosquito species whose gut microbiota has been char- acterized and sets the foundation for further studies to determine the influence of these microbiota on vector susceptibility to pathogens.introductionmosquitoes transmit a wide range of pathogens that cause diseases in humans and other ani- mals.

as such additional studies comparing the microbial communities of different mosquito species can further improve our understanding of mosquito microbiota and propel identifica- tion of specific microbes that may be harnessed for disease control.in this study we characterized the microbiota of 12 mosquito species collected from cham- paign county illinois.

alpha diversity metrics including shannon diversity index ob- served species chao1 and evenness were generated in qiime  and analysis of variance with tukey adjustments was used to test whether there were any significant differences in these indices among mosquito species.

analysis of similarities anosim using the vegan package in r was used to test whether microbial communities from samples of each mosquito species were more similar than those of different mosquito species .

similar- ity percentage simper analysis was used to identify otus that were primarily responsible for observed differences between mosquito species past version 3.14 software .resultsbacterial species composition across mosquito speciesmiseq sequencing of the v3-v5 region of 16s rrna gene amplicons from 264 mosquito sam- ples generated a total of 1804366 sequences mean - se  6834.72 - 460.75 per mosquito midgut sample.

it was also common for some individuals of a given mosquito species from the same study site and collec- tion date to harbor different gut microbiota.the top 9 otus accounted for 69.2 of the total sequences and their relative abundance varied markedly between mosquito species .
