We further hypothesized that the AD-A LCLs would have a greater enhancement of immune pathways since this is a more severe ASD phenotype and since optimal mito- chondrial function is required for appropriate immune function and response .Exposure to PPA for either 24 or 48 h resulted in upregulation in genes associated with immune system activation in AD-A LCLs particularly genes involved in immunoglobulin produc- tion.

When the effect of PPA on ASD LCLs were compared to the CNT LCLs both ASD groups demonstrated immune pathway activation although the AD-A LCLs demonstrate a wider activation of immune genes.

Given the connection between metabolism and immune system  we hypothesize that the AD-A LCLs will demonstrate a greater activation of immune genes with PPA exposure as compared to the control and AD-N LCLs.MaTerials anD MeThODs lcls and culture conditionsLymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from white males diagnosed with AD chosen from pedigrees with at least other 1 affected male sibling i.e.

Panther analysis demonstrated no overrepresentation of immune genes associated with PPA exposure in CNT LCLs.Exposure of AD-N LCLs to PPA for 24 h demonstrated no upregulated genes and downregulation of several immune genes including two major histocompatibility complex genes.

Panther analysis demonstrated overrepresenta- tion of many immune processes and proteins as result of PPA exposure to AD-A LCLs for 24 and 48 h demonstrating that PPA did significantly activate immune processes for AD-A LCLs .comparison of PPa effect on asD lcls as compared to control lclsTo better understand how PPA exposure affects ASD LCLs differ- ently than control LCLs gene expression was compared between CNT LCLs and each ASD LCL group independently.

We examined two types of LCLs derived from children with ASD those with mitochondrial dysfunction AD-A and those found to have mitochondrial function similar to controls AD-N. We hypothesized that PPA would activate immune pathways in ASD LCLs since the PPA animal model ofNumbers represent number of genes associated with the identified biological process.ASD demonstrates neuroinflammation and immune activation including increased GFAP immunoreactivity in the hippocam- pus increased activation of microglia and increased interleukin IL-6 24  31.

Several models of ASD demonstrate immune dysregulation including prenatal exposure to immune challenges  .

Nonetheless this study provides insight into thedemonstrated activation of immune pathways the AD-A LCLs demonstrated a wider range of genes and processes involved in immune pathways.
