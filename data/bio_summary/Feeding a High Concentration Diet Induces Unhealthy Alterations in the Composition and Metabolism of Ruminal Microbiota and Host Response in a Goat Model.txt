The rumen was opened from the dorsal side and rumen fluid was collected and strained throughfour layers of cheesecloth and kept on ice until processing.

The rumen tissue was then washed by PBS collected and threw into liquid nitrogen immediately then stored at 80C until next process.The rumen fluid samples were briefly centrifuged at 10000 g for 45 min at 4C and the supernatant was aspirated gently to prevent its mixing with the pellet and passed through adisposable 0.22 um LPS-free filter.

In this study a combination of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics techniques 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA genes and RT-PCR was applied to evaluate the changes of ruminal microbiota composition ruminal metabolites and related genes expression in rumen epithelial cells of lactating goats received either a 35 concentrate diet or a 65 concentrate diet for 4 or 19 weeks respectively.

The correlation was made by the corrplot package of the R software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAlteration of VFAs and Abnormal Fermented Products after Feeding a HC DietFeeding a HC diet to lactating goats induced abnormal fermentation in rumen.

The above results indicate that these microbes may be affected by phenylacetate or collaboratively synthesize phenylacetate.Feeding a HC diet to dairy goats dramatically reduced the level of D-glucose and D-turanose which are both utilized by microbesin rumen  .
