The best explanation to the distinc- tions between the two studies could be that there were smallsample sizes five adult animalsstudy as well as differences in diet.In our study at the genus level in the two juvenile giraffes the most predominant genus was Bacteroides detected at 20.2 of the sequences in Lily and Acinetobacter detected at 22.5 of the sequences in Forrest.

There was no statistically significant differ- ence found between the adult and juvenile giraffes eitherTable 2 The fungal community composition at the phylum levelaRelative proportion percentage of sequences  Standard error of the meanBold indicates the most predominant phylumphyla.

No significantly higher levels of OTUs Shannon or Chao1 indices were seen between the adult and juvenile giraffes.The predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes for both adult and juvenile giraffes ranging from 38.0 to 60.6 of the sequences Table .

For bacteria a total of 747 223 sequences were analyzed for all animal samples with 640 700 quality sequences ranging from 64168 to 123063 sequences.

For fungi a total of 991 751 sequences were analyzed for all animals with 961 961 quality sequences ranging from 61560 to 283111 sequences.

The diets of the five adult giraffes consisted of alfalfa and a mixture of Mazuri grain Wild herbivore diet ADF 16 herbivore diet and Wild herbivore Plus diet.

The number of OTUs per animal ranged from 694 to 909 the Chao1 index ranged from 968 to 1113 and the Shannon index ranged from 3.09 to 4.01 Table S3.There were small differences in the bacterial diversity between the adult and the juvenile giraffes.

The average number of OTUs for adult giraffes is 2802 - 67 SEM which is a significantly higher level p  0.05 compared to the 2054 - 25 SEM for juvenile giraffes.

The Chao1 index shows a similar num- ber of species for both the adult and juvenile giraffes with values 1049 - 62 SEM and 1053 - 85 SEM respectively.
