Due to the limited sample size power calculation the power values for BMI waist circumference testosterone level and fasting insulin level were 99.0 96.9 89.5 and 70.4 respectively a 0.0083 and the observation of association but not causality further studies are needed to enlarge sample size and explore the potential causal mechanisms between gut microbiota and PCOS such as the metabolites produced by gut microbiota and fecal microbiota transplantation.Taken together our work suggested an altered composition of gut microbiota represented by the reduction of alpha diversity the increase of LPS-producing bacteria and the decrease of spore- forming species.

The shifts of gut microbiota had been observed in the letrozole-induced PCOS mouse models     and fecal microbiota transplantation from the letrozole-induced PCOS mice to germ- free mice indicated that gut microbiota also has a close relationship with its host's sex hormone levels estruscycles and ovarian morphological changes  .

But the experimental evidence of the relationship between gut microbiota mediators of the brain-gut axis and metabolic phenotypes of PCOS in human is still absent.In order to study the association of gut microbiota with obesity and non-obesity in relation to PCOS we recruited non-obese or obese women with or without PCOS.

We investigated the composition of gut microbiota in PCOS and how the changes of gut microbiota correlated with the sex-hormones brain-gut peptides and various other metabolic parameters.

Regardless according to existing evidences regulating the mediators of the brain-gut axis might be one of the pathways for gut microbiota to effect on PCOS.This cross-sectional study revealed the association between gut microbiota and PCOS.

Thus the overall composition of the gut microbiota was disrupted in PCOS.We then used RDA to identify the gut bacteria responding to PCOS and obesity.

In this study we observed an altered gut microbial pattern in both obese and non-obese women with PCOS against non- obese control individuals and found that the gut microbiota of PCOS shares similar compositional dysbiosis with that of obesity.

The previous study did not find any association of the saliva microbiota and PCOS phenotypes   indicating that the gut microbiota has a closer relationship with PCOS.

Interaction between gut microbiota and the endocrine and biochemical disturbances in PCOS still remains elusive.
