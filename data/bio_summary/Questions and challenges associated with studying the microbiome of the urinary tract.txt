Another factors which may also effect this treatment includes dampening of immune responses by commensal bacterial strains which have been effective at doing this at other mucosal sites 10.How far up the urinary tract do bacteria go and how commonly are they found in the kidneyBacteria are not typically thought to be in the kidney during times of health though it is known that some bacteria enterPage 4 of 8the blood stream and kidneys following probiotic dosing and translocation 37-39.

Optimal processing requires greater than 10 mL in our experience and bacteria should be stored separated by pelleting of the sample by centrifugation d DNA extraction kits and their reagents contain trace amounts of bacterial DNA not normally a problem in high abundance samples but potentially a menace for the urinary tract e The amount of contaminating background DNA is different depending upon the origin of the material and abundance of commensal bacteria.

a The bacterial composition in urine is altered by capture fraction and represent different parts of the urinary tract it is also effected by patient sex and age b Entry to the upper urinary tract via a open surgical procedures or even by b minimally invasive technologies still risks bacterial acquisition via the skin and top layers of dermal tissue.

The potential for bacteria to cause this is one possibility and in murine studies it was shown that the presence of calcium oxalate deposits increases pyelonephritis risk likely due to preferential aggregation of bacteria on and around calcium oxalate crystals 40.Technical challengesCorrect approaches for sampling the urogenital microbiomeMicrobiome sampling from fecal and tissue material is complicated by effective separation of bacteria from the sample matrix and removal of PCR inhibitors.

However we know little regarding the supporting roles of the non-infection-associated bacteria in these conditions yet we know for many commensal bacteria that their survival is dependent upon living within a bacterial community.

Free DNA and DNA in dead bacteria on the surface can be made unavailable by PMA treatment before tissue homogenization b kidney stones will have some human DNA and the surface can be sterilized before pulverization in a sterile bag c bacteria in urine are typically more abundant than samples from other parts of the urinary tract.

In the clinical laboratory bacterial propagation is mostly targeted towards specific bacterial pathogens that are associated with most causes of urinary tract infections Escherichia coli Staphylococcus saprophyticus Proteus mirabilis Enterococcus faecalis and others.

When isolating bacterial DNA from tissue samples mixed human and microbial DNA the human DNA competes with the bacterial DNA during the isolation procedure decreasing the amount of bacterial DNA recovered.

Urine typically contains high concentrations of salt which allows the preservation of bacteria and nucleic acids for some time though from our laboratory's perspective bacteria should be pelleted and separated from the liquid phase prior to frozen storage.

However with the more recent extended culture techniques that are being employed for urine developed by Hilt and colleagues 3-5 a higher proportion of bacteria are likely to be cultured from the urogenital tract compared to other sites though still likely to underestimate microbial complexity.
