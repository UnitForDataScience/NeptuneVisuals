Modulation of the human microbiome in order to balance the microbial populations toward a healthy situation is a promising intervention to improve human health in the framework of many diseases  .The human microbiome performs key metabolic roles such as production of vitamins short-chain fatty acids and other essential compounds digestion of several components of the diet such as fibers gut homeostasis maintenance and modulation of the host immune response  .

These results strongly suggest the combined use of bioinformatics and in vitro tools as a first stage in the screening of bioactive peptides encrypted in the human gut metaproteome.Keywords bacterial peptides Th17 response CD4 cytokines flow cytometry microbiome gut metaproteomeINTRODUCTIONThe composition of the human microbiome has revealed strong associations with human health.

Prediction of the potential bioactivity of the products encoded by the human gut microbiome or metaproteome is the first step for identifying proteins responsible for the molecular interaction between microorganisms and the immune system.
