No significant differences in these vari-arch we observed plaques in external carotid arteries innomi- nate arteries and subclavian arteries Figure 2A C and E. The stenosis rate of these arteries in the HFD LC oral group was more severe and more than twofold greater than that in the HFD and HFD LC sub groups p  0.001 Figure 2B D and F.Representative images of Oil Red Ohaematoxylin-stained aor- tic sinuses and aortic trees from all groups are shown in Fig- ure 2G and I. Quantification of atherosclerotic plaques in aor- tic sinuses and aortic trees from the HFD LC oral group revealed approximately a doubling of the disease burden in the HFD group or HFD LC sub group which was consistent with the ultrasonic evaluation results p  0.001.

There were no sig- nificant differences between the HFD group and HFD LC sub group p  0.05.Concentrations of LC g BB and TMAO in Plasma and their Relationship with AtherosclerosisAfter 12 weeks of treatment the level of plasma LC in the HFD LC sub group was 10.9 11.1 12.3 mm which was sig- nificantly higher than that in the HFD or HFD LC oral groups 3.60 3.33 4.01 mm vs 4.25 5.01 7.09 mm p  0.001.

Spearman's correlation analysis showed no correlation between plasma LC levels and atheroscle- rosis Figure 3A-F.The g BB levels in the HFD LC oral group demonstrated an almost 70-fold increase compared to the HFD or HFD LC sub groups 25.1 20.3 33.2 mm vs 0.387 0.337 0.410 mm vs0.380 0.335 0.420 mm p  0.001. g BB was positively correlated with aortic tree lesions aortic sinus lesions carotid artery steno- sis rate innominate artery stenosis rate and subclavian artery stenosis rate r 0.5321 r 0.6750 r 0.5821 r 0.7286 and r 0.5750 respectively p  0.05 Figure 3G-L.The TMAO concentration in the HFDLC oral group was25.6 21.1 27.0 mm which was significantly higher than that in the HFD or HFD LC sub group 2.55 2.25 2.90 mm vs2.60 2.19 2.86 mm p  0.001.

All mice were fed a high-fat diet HFD Nantong China and were randomly di- vided into an HFD group an HFD LC oral group 1.3 LC Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis USA in drinking water and an HFD - LC sub group similar dose of LC was administered subcutaneously n  15 in each group.

Plasma levels of triglycerides cholesterol and ox-LDL.ables were noted between the HFD and HFD - LC sub groups Figure 1.Triglycerides mmol L-1Cholesterol mmol L-1ox-LDL mg L-1HDLmmol L-1In B-mode images of the left common carotid artery cross- section of the aortic arch and longitudinal section of the aorticHFD373 - 19.1 1.34 - 0.0763 3.29 3.24 3.32 0.430 - 0.113HFD  LC sub 422 - 24.2 1.43 - 0.0876 3.27 3.25 3.29 0.477 - 0.106HFD  LC oral 370 - 22.8 1.34 - 0.0919 3.30 3.27 3.33 0.382 - 0.102aValues are shown as the mean - SD or median Q25 Q75.a p  0.05 versus the HFD - LC sub group.sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform Illumina San Diego CA USA.The Trimmomatic version 0.33 and Mothur programs ver- sion 1.34.0 were used for the analysis merging and quality filtering of the raw data sequences.

How- ever the proportion of Ly6Chi monocytes was clearly higher in the HFD LC oral group compared with the HFD and HFD LC sub groups after 12 weeks of treatment 85.5 1.29 vs 77.1 0.79 vs 78.7 1.52 p  0.001.

Firmicutes were most abundant in the HFD and HFD LC sub groups fol- lowed by Bacteroidetes whereas in the HFD LC oral group the proportions of Firmicutes were decreased and those of Bac- teroidetes were increased and most abundant.

However the levels of triglycerides cholesterol and ox-LDL were not different in ApoE-- female mice fed normal chow versus those fed a diet supplemented with 1.3 LC moreover dietary administration of LC contributed to the development of atherosclerosis.1115 We measured plasma lipid levels in ApoE-- male mice in the HFD HFD LC oral and HFD LC sub groups and obtained similar results.
