however the levels of triglycerides cholesterol and ox-ldl were not different in apoe-- female mice fed normal chow versus those fed a diet supplemented with 1.3 lc moreover dietary administration of lc contributed to the development of atherosclerosis.1115 we measured plasma lipid levels in apoe-- male mice in the hfd hfd lc oral and hfd lc sub groups and obtained similar results.
