The Shannon diversity index entropy score of the intestinal microbiota was significantly lower in patients with severe AGE than in normal controls P  0.017 and patients with mild-to-moderate AGE P  0.011.The average severity score of the 5 patients with rotavirus infection was 13.8 range 11-15 which is sig- nificantly higher than that of the 15 patients with norovirus infection mean 10.3 range 8-11 P  0.03.

The entropy score of patients with rotavirus infection was 0.05 0.02-0.35 which was significantly lower than that of patients with norovirus infection P  0.048 1B.The intestinal microbiota composition at the phylum level of normal controls and patients withmild-to-moderate and severe AGE is shown in The microbiota composition in patients with rotavi- rus or norovirus infection and the associated disease severity classification are shown in .

Greater richness in Campylobacteraceae P  0.0003 Neisseriaceae P  0.0115 Methylobacteriaceae P  0.0004 Sphingomonadaceae P  0.0221 and Enterobacteriaceae P  0.0451 was found in patients with complicated AGE compared with normalcontrols.

The statistical analyses showed a significantly decreased Shannon diversity index entropy score of the intestinal microbiota in patients with severe AGE compared with normal controls P  0.017 and patients with mild-to-moderate AGE P  0.011.

At the genus level patients with abdominal pain had greater richness in Prevotella P  0.013 TM7 P  0.013 Staphylococcus P  0.013 and Atopobium P  0.017.

Patients with complicated AGE had greater abundance of Campylobacteraceae P  0.0003 Neisseriaceae P  0.0115 Methylobacteriaceae P  0.0004 Sphingomonadaceae P  0.0221 and Enterobacteriaceae P  0.0451 than healthy children.

Finally patients with complicated AGE had greater Pasteurellaceae richness P  0.0071 than patients with AGE without complications.DiscussionThe intestinal microbiota diversity was less in patients with severe viral AGE compared with healthy controls and those with mild-to-moderate AGE suggesting the counterpoise of microbiota being changed or disrupted into some overgrowing bacterial species.

The feces of normal controls exhibited significant abundance of Rikenellaceae P  0.043 and Porphyromonadaceae P  0.02 at the family level and Alistipes P  0.038 and Parabacteroides P  0.019 at the genus level compared with any severity of AGE patients.Clinical correlation.

At the family level patients with abdominal pain exhibited greater abundance of Prevotellaceae P  0.013 Staphylococcaceae P  0.013 and Coriobacteriaceae P  0.015.

Uncomplicated AGE was associated with a decrease in the abundance of Desulfovibrionaceae P  0.0198 Ruminococcaceae P  0.0125 Veillonellaceae P  0.0199 and increase in Carnobacteriaceae P  0.0124.
