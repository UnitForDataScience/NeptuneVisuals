the statistical analyses showed a significantly decreased shannon diversity index entropy score of the intestinal microbiota in patients with severe age compared with normal controls p  0.017 and patients with mild-to-moderate age p  0.011. the intestinal microbiota score of the 5 patients with rotavirus age was significantly lower than that of those with norovirus infection p  0.048. greater richness in campylobacteraceae p  0.0003 neisseriaceae p  0.0115 methylobacteriaceae p  0.0004 sphingomonadaceae p  0.0221 and enterobacteriaceae p  0.0451 was found in patients with complicated age compared with normalcontrols.

at the genus level patients with abdominal pain had greater richness in prevotella p  0.013 tm7 p  0.013 staphylococcus p  0.013 and atopobium p  0.017. patients with convulsion showed absence of haemophilus p  0.045 and with substantially decreased genus of faecalibacterium p  0.059.we also analyzed the intestinal microbiota composition of 3 patients with complicated age comprising1 patient with necrotizing enterocolitis after norovirus infection 1 with rotavirus infection with convulsions and 1 with norovirus infection and renal failure supplementary fig.

patients with complicated age had greater abundance of campylobacteraceae p  0.0003 neisseriaceae p  0.0115 methylobacteriaceae p  0.0004 sphingomonadaceae p  0.0221 and enterobacteriaceae p  0.0451 than healthy children.

uncomplicated age was associated with a decrease in the abundance of desulfovibrionaceae p  0.0198 ruminococcaceae p  0.0125 veillonellaceae p  0.0199 and increase in carnobacteriaceae p  0.0124. finally patients with complicated age had greater pasteurellaceae richness p  0.0071 than patients with age without complications.discussionthe intestinal microbiota diversity was less in patients with severe viral age compared with healthy controls and those with mild-to-moderate age suggesting the counterpoise of microbiota being changed or disrupted into some overgrowing bacterial species.

the feces of normal controls exhibited significant abundance of rikenellaceae p  0.043 and porphyromonadaceae p  0.02 at the family level and alistipes p  0.038 and parabacteroides p  0.019 at the genus level compared with any severity of age patients.clinical correlation.

at the family level patients with abdominal pain exhibited greater abundance of prevotellaceae p  0.013 staphylococcaceae p  0.013 and coriobacteriaceae p  0.015. veillonellaceae p  0.048 abundance was lower in patients hospitalized for longer than 7 days.

statistical analysis showed significantly decreased shannon diversity entropy score of intestinal microbiota in severe viral age when compared to normal controls p  0.017 and to patients with mild to moderate severity p  0.011 a. the entropy score of the rotavirus infection was 0.05 0.02-0.35 that was significantly lower than norovirus infection group p  0.048 b.infection including 15 with severe age vesikari score 10and 5 with mild-to-moderate age vesikari score  10. the 15 complication presentations comprised 10 age with convulsion 7 norovirus 3 rotavi- rus infections 2 necrotizing enterocolitis norovirus infections 2 gastroenteritis with renal failure or severeelectrolyte imbalance norovirus infections and 1 gastroenteritis with chronic diarrhea of prolonged duration 3 weeks and malnutrition norovirus infection.

the shannon diversity index entropy score of the intestinal microbiota was significantly lower in patients with severe age than in normal controls p  0.017 and patients with mild-to-moderate age p  0.011.the average severity score of the 5 patients with rotavirus infection was 13.8 range 11-15 which is sig- nificantly higher than that of the 15 patients with norovirus infection mean 10.3 range 8-11 p  0.03. the entropy score in patients with norovirus infection was 0.65 0.2-0.75 and was not significantly different com- pared with that of the normal controls.

the abundance of micrococcaceae p  0.011 and campylobacteraceae p  0.05 was lower in patients with extraintestinal manifestations of viral infection.

the overall differences in healthy children and those with non-complicated and complicated age were in the richness of porphyromonadaceae in healthy children p  0.035 and streptococcaceae in uncomplicated age p  0.035 shown by the com- position of fecal bacteria.

the entropy score of patients with rotavirus infection was 0.05 0.02-0.35 which was significantly lower than that of patients with norovirus infection p  0.048 1b.the intestinal microbiota composition at the phylum level of normal controls and patients withmild-to-moderate and severe age is shown in the microbiota composition in patients with rotavi- rus or norovirus infection and the associated disease severity classification are shown in .

a value of p  0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signif-icance.
