Sequence distribution is uneven within the different samples with an overwhelm- ing representation of ciliates which constitute the predomi- nant group in the aerobic basin 55.8 of total OTUs the anoxic basin 61.9 of total OTUs the clarifier 33.4 of total OTUs Table  and the Metazoa represent the sec- ond dominant group representing 25.6 16.6 and 27.8 of total OTUs in the aerobic the anoxic basin and in the clari- fier respectively.

Therefore we compare the protozoan community structure present in an aerobic and an anoxic basin a clarifier and an anaerobic digester of a WWTP.

This study repre- sents a first step toward designing fast reliable and repro- ducible molecular tools for monitoring wastewater depollu- tion and for studying phylogenetic relationships among the eukaryotic components of this ecosystem.Materials and methodsStudy site and samplingActivated sludge samples were collected from an aerobic and an anoxic basin a clarifier and an anaerobic mesophilic digester of the wastewater treatment plant 250000 popu- lation equivalents of Evry France a town located in the southeast peripheral suburb of Paris agglomeration about 15 km south of Paris the plant flow is about 60000 m3 day and is representative of a middle sized plant mainly supplied with urban sewer effluents.

The recovered sequences were unequally distributed in the different samples from 507 to 561 in the aerobic and the anoxic basin respectively to 248 in the clar- ifier and 202 in the anaerobic digester reflecting in part the abundance of eukaryotes in those different environments.

Forty three 42 54 and 21 OTUs were identified from the aerobic basin the anoxic basin the clarifier and the digester respectively.

Diversity values given by Shannon indexes show that the clarifier is the most diversified sample in comparison to the aerobic and anoxic basins and the digester Table .The most abundant taxonomic groups according to sam- ple's origin are presented in Table .

Most of these sequences belong to the Peritrichia subclass of Oligohy- menophorea representing 30.2 40.5 20.4 and 4.8 of all OTUs of the aerobic anoxic basin the clarifier and the digester respectively.

Epistylis represent 66.3 82.6 45.7 and 98.0 of total ciliate sequences which rep- resent 25 30.8 27.8 and 25 of Ciliates OTUs recovered from the aerobic and the anoxic basin the clarifier and the anaerobic digester samples respectively.Novel phylotypes clearly appear inside the phyloge- netic clusters.
