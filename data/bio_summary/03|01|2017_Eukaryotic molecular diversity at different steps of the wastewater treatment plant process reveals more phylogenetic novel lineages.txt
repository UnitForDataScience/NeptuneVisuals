.the third group of ciliates is represented by litostoma- tea species in the aerobic basin the anoxic basin and the clarifier at least 5.9 4.3 and 0.8 of total sequences from the aerobic the anoxic basin and the clarifier respectively representing 5 otus 11.6 of the total otus from the aerobic basin 2 otus 4.9 of the total otus from the anoxic basin and 1 otu 1.9 of the total otus from the clarifier are affiliated with hemiophrys macrostoma fig.

sequence distribution is uneven within the different samples with an overwhelm- ing representation of ciliates which constitute the predomi- nant group in the aerobic basin 55.8 of total otus the anoxic basin 61.9 of total otus the clarifier 33.4 of total otus table  and the metazoa represent the sec- ond dominant group representing 25.6 16.6 and 27.8 of total otus in the aerobic the anoxic basin and in the clari- fier respectively.

therefore we compare the protozoan community structure present in an aerobic and an anoxic basin a clarifier and an anaerobic digester of a wwtp.

this study repre- sents a first step toward designing fast reliable and repro- ducible molecular tools for monitoring wastewater depollu- tion and for studying phylogenetic relationships among the eukaryotic components of this ecosystem.materials and methodsstudy site and samplingactivated sludge samples were collected from an aerobic and an anoxic basin a clarifier and an anaerobic mesophilic digester of the wastewater treatment plant 250000 popu- lation equivalents of evry france a town located in the southeast peripheral suburb of paris agglomeration about 15 km south of paris the plant flow is about 60000 m3 day and is representative of a middle sized plant mainly supplied with urban sewer effluents.

forty three 42 54 and 21 otus were identified from the aerobic basin the anoxic basin the clarifier and the digester respectively.

diversity values given by shannon indexes show that the clarifier is the most diversified sample in comparison to the aerobic and anoxic basins and the digester table .the most abundant taxonomic groups according to sam- ple's origin are presented in table .

most of these sequences belong to the peritrichia subclass of oligohy- menophorea representing 30.2 40.5 20.4 and 4.8 of all otus of the aerobic anoxic basin the clarifier and the digester respectively.

epistylis represent 66.3 82.6 45.7 and 98.0 of total ciliate sequences which rep- resent 25 30.8 27.8 and 25 of ciliates otus recovered from the aerobic and the anoxic basin the clarifier and the anaerobic digester samples respectively.novel phylotypes clearly appear inside the phyloge- netic clusters.

in fact 26.3 7.4 44.2 and 1.3 of the ciliatesequences representing 58.3 50 44.4 and 50 otus show97 sequence similarity with any sequence in the aerobic and the anoxic basin the clarifier and the digester respec- tively hence contributing to expanding the phylogenetic diversity of peritrichia.the second major group of ciliate sequences is affiliated with the phyllopharyngea class and most sequences clus- tering within suctoria subclass.

lkm11 is represented by 2.3 2.4 5.6 and 14.2 of all otus found in the aerobic basin the anoxic basin the clarifier and the anaerobic digester respectively whereas lkm118 are represented by 2.3 2.4 7.3 and 47.5 of all otus found in the same basins respectively.lkm11 deeply branching within the fungi lara et al.

one other otu represented by sequence qcca1ze091 has uncertain affiliation at the base of the basidiomycota.discussionthe eukaryotic biodiversity was evaluated in four differ- ent locations of the wwtp process aerobic and anoxic basins clarifier and anaerobic digester.

sequences named qcbv and qcbq came from the aerobic basin qcbr and qcca came from the anoxic basin qccc and qcbt came from the clarifier and qccb came from the anaeroboc digesterdigester and organic matter concentration which is particu- larly high in the anaerobic digester.

in the present study we investigated eukaryotic diversity at the different steps of the treatment process of a wastewater treatment plant aerobic anaero- bic clarifier basins and anaerobic digester using the 18s rrna gene sequencing approach.

and they also prevent clouds of waste matter like sludge bulking fialkowska and pajdak-stos  this idea is reinforced in our study as they were mainly and specifi- cally retrieved from the aerobic basin and the clarifier but not from the digester.
