indeed since the publication of this meta-analysis the large-scale multicenter placebo- controlled interventional nourish trial including older malnourished adults hospitalized for congestive heart failure acute myocardial infarction pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was published that found a significant lower mortality in patients when a high-protein oral nutritional supplement containing beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate was added to standard-of- nutritional-care .remarkably therefore basic questions such as what is the optimal amount of calories and protein for med- ical inpatients which medical inpatients have the most benefit from nutritional interventions and what type of nutrition if any is beneficial for the medical inpatient remain largely unanswered  further from an evolutionary perspective it remains unclear whether nutritional interventions should indeed be used in patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract and low appetite.

although the use of nutritional therapy is a common intervention in medical inpatients there is no strong current scientific evidence of its efficacy or standard algorithms for its use in medical inpatients.

association of nutritional risk and adverse medical outcomes across different medical inpatient populations.

while observational research has reported strong associations of malnutrition and adverse out- comes and suggested benefit from nutritional interven- tion in the medical inpatient setting only randomized trials can prove that such interventions truly work.

a recent meta-analysis focusing on randomized trials in the medical inpatient setting that compared patients receiving nutritional interventions with patients not re- ceiving such an intervention found that nutritional therapy increases caloric and protein intake as well as weight regarding clinical outcomes unplanned hospital readmission rates were significantly improved by the intervention as well as lengths of stay in the subgroup of patients with established malnutrition.

specific biomarkers may be helpful to select populations in which nutritional inter- ventions will have the best effects and those which would experience negative outcomes in the acute care medical setting - outside critical care- malnutrition remains an increasing problem affecting as much as 30-50 of patients undoubtedly there is a strong association between malnutrition and adverse clinical outcomes including higher mortality and mor- bidity and increased lengths of hospital stay these associations tempt us to believe that improvement in nutritional status by the use of nutritional interventions also leads to improvements in patient outcomes.

third a retrospective analysis of controlled trials found positive effects of nutritional support if patients had either impaired nutritional status or an increase in nutritional requirements resulting from high severity disease or both fourth the above mentioned meta-analysis as well as the very recent nourish trial found some positive effects of nutritional support on readmission and mortality in medical inpatients.conclusionsdespite strong associations between malnutrition and adverse outcomes causal inferences remain largely un- proven.

additionally whether provision of nutritional therapy in the acute phase of a medical illness has the potential to reverse the adverse effects associated with malnutrition in the non-critical care inpatient setting re- mains unclear.

given the magnitude of morbidity caused by malnutrition and the high number of patients affected by this condition it is surprising how little the medical community has invested in recent years to better under- stand ways to improve this condition in an evidence- based manner.

this may be explained by difficulties in standardization blinding and patient compliance in nutritional trials and insufficient industry-funding due to low product margins among other issues still considering recent high-quality evidence from critical care demon- strating the negative effects of nutritional therapy a reappraisal of how nutritional support should be imple- mented in the medical inpatient setting is now re- quired.

instead of pragmatic- ally using nutritional interventions based on few rigor- ous randomized trials we should return to james lind's research of 1747 and perform the large and well con- ducted trials needed to truly understand the potential of nutritional therapy to positively influence recovery from disease in the medical inpatient population.acknowledgementsthe author would like to thank dr. jeffrey greenwald boston for helpful discussions regarding the content of this article.fundingno financial support or other potential conflict of interest relevant to this article were reported.
