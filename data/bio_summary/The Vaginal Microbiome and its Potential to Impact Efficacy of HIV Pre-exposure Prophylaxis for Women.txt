another recentkey points  1 tfv gel with an on-demand dosing schedule is not efficacious in women with non-lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiomes but has efficacy estimated at 61 95 ci 11-84 in women with lactobacillius dominant microbiota.efficacy of oral prep is not modulated by bacterial vaginosis.the modulation of prep efficacy by vaginal dysbiosis may be specific to prep drug formulation and delivery mechanism.in settings with high rates of bacterial vaginosisvaginal dysbiosis and high hiv burden efficacy trials of novel prep products are well posi- tioned to consider the interaction of vaginal dysbiosis with product efficacy.this article is part of the topical collection on the science of preventionanalysis comparing oral tenofovir-based prep efficacy among women with and without bacterial vaginosis in the partners prep study found that oral prep efficacy is not modified by bacterial vaginosis.

doi 10.1007s11904-017-0362-zthe vaginal microbiome and its potential to impact efficacy of hiv pre-exposure prophylaxis for womenjennifer velloza12  renee heffron123published online 15 august 2017 springer sciencebusiness media llc 2017abstractpurpose of review this review describes existing evidence addressing the potential modulation of pre-exposure prophy- laxis prep products specifically 1 tenofovir tfv gel and oral tenofovir-based prep by vaginal dysbiosis and discusses future considerations for delivering novel long-acting prep products to women at high risk for vaginal dysbiosis and hiv.

given that vaginal dysbiosis ap- pears to modulate efficacy for 1 tfv gel but not for oral tenofovir-based prep vaginal dysbiosis is potentially less consequential to hiv protection from tfv in the context of systemic drug delivery and high product adherence.summary vaginal dysbiosis may undermine the efficacy of 1 tfv gel to protect women from hiv but not the efficacy of oral prep.

this article summarizes the existing data from two analyses on the interaction between the vaginal microbiome and estimat- ed prep efficacy provides commentary about hypothesized relationships and suggests directions for future prep develop- ment and implementation research in conjunction with vaginal microbiome investigations.text of reviewpotential for vaginal dysbiosis to modulate efficacy of hiv prevention productsthe caprisa-004 randomized controlled trial demonstrated proof-of-concept that topically applied 1 tfv gel was effica- cious in preventing hivamong a sample of 889 hiv-uninfectedwomen in south africa .

when restricting the sample towomen with  50 adherence n  416 again the gel was efficacious in preventing hiv for women with lactobacillus dominant microbiota efficacy 78 95 ci 29-95 but did not significantly reduce hiv incidence in the presence of non-lactobacillus dominated microbiota efficacy 26 95 ci -98 to 73 .a secondary analysis from the partners prep study a randomized placebo-controlled prep efficacy trial deter- mined whether vaginal microbiota modified the efficacy of oral tenofovir-based prep either ftctdf or single agent tdf .

two analyses have since been conducted using data from topical gel and oral prep trials to explore the potential association between vaginal dysbiosis and prep efficacy table .a secondary analysis with 688 women from the caprisa-004 study used mass spectrometry-based proteo- mics to classify women as having either lactobacillus domi- nant or non-lactobacillus dominant vaginal microbiota at baseline .

additionally the tfv gel was shown to alter local microbial communities in the vagina making women using these products more susceptible to bacterial dysbiosis and hivacquisition through inflammatory pathways and it will be important to explore similar associations for other topically applied hiv prevention products   .future studies exploring the relationship between vaginal dysbiosis and prep efficacy among women will need to con- sider several factors that are likely to influence findings includ- ing characteristics of the prep drug adherence to prep and measurement of confounding variables.

oral prep remains a critical biomedical hiv prevention strategy for women with symptomatic or asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis who are protected from hivacquisition when adherence to the daily pills is high and there remains a need to improve oral prep access for women regardless of their bacterial vaginosis status .conclusionrecent evidence suggests that vaginal dysbiosis can reduce the efficacy of tfv-based gel prep formulations through altered drug metabolism.

specifically vaginal dysbiosis can result in higher vaginal ph due to lower concen- trations of lactobacillus species and increased activated ccr5 cd4 t cells in vaginal mucosa and pro-inflammatory cyto- kines in cervical secretions      .

these results suggest that vaginal microbiota are un- likely to moderate the efficacy of oral prep which is sys- temically distributed and has greater tfv detection in plas- ma than topically applied tfv gel  .hypothesized mechanisms for association between vaginal dysbiosis and prep efficacymultiple mechanisms could lie at the interface of vaginal mi- crobiota and efficacy of different prep products fig.

in addition co-infections such as herpes simplex virus-2 hsv-2 and chlamydia can increase risk of both vaginal dysbiosis and hiv infection and obscure the true relationship between vaginal dysbiosis and prep efficacy .

pharmacokinetic studies of oral prep have shown that tfv-dp has more difficulty reaching protective concentrations in the female genital tract than in colorectal tissue and higher levels of adherence about 6-7 dosesweek are thought to be required to provide effective hiv prevention for people having vaginal exposure to hiv  .
