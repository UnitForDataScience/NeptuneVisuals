significantly increased.Arsenic-treated males had an increase in Dorea spp.In females arsenic-induced gut microbiome changes correlated with metabolic pathways involved in metal resistance including mercury resistance operon zinc resistance and the mdtABCD multidrug resistance cluster and cell transport system such as glutathione-regulated potassium-efflux system ATP-dependent efflux pump transporter Ybh general secretion pathway and iron acquisition in Streptococcus.In treated males the gut microbiome changes were associated with nitrogen carbon and sulfate metabolism.Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the offspring gut microbiome were inversely associated with maternal Pb exposure.ContinuedTABLE 1  ContinuedPublicationAnimal modelDosing regimenMajor gut microbiome and host findingsBreton et al.

The Human Microbiome Project which has been a useful tool in understanding how gut microbiome changes effect health and disease in humans Human Microbiome Project Consortium 2012ab could serve as a template for creation of such a database devoted specifically to gut microbiome changes induced by environmental chemical exposures in humans and animal model studies.One of the other limitations of the current studies is that the gut microbiome changes are examined after exposure to one or two environmental chemicals.

2009 Cryan and Dinan 2012.Herein I will consider the evidence to date that environmental chemicals can lead to gut microbiome disruptions otherwise termed gut dysbiosis in various animal species.

To elucidate whether the gut microbiome changes precede host pathophysiological responses or vice versa repeated assessments of the gut flora and host metabolic state and other responses are essential.

Evenwith these caveats the studies below provide evidence that exposure to environmental chemicals can alter the compositon of the gut microbiota.EFFECTS OF HEAVY METALS AND PARTICULATE MATTER ON THE GUT MICROBIOMETo date exposures to heavy metals have been shown to elicit significant effects on the gut microbiome.

Four weeks of arsenic treatment 10 ppm in the drinking water to wild-type and IL10-- mice who can develop colitis depending on the resident gut microbiota resulted in genetic-dependent gut microbiome changes with an increase in Bacteroidetes but a decrease in Firmicutes in arsenic-treated IL10-- mice Lu et al.

The studies below testing the effects of Pb on the gut microbiome in rodent models may thus all be considered physiologically and environmentally relevant.Non-agouti aa offspring derived from Avya male mice bred to aa female mice exposed from gestation through lactation to Pb 32 ppm in the drinking water undergo shifts in gut microbiota populations with Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes inversely associated with maternal Pb exposure.

Another study that exposed adult C57Bl6 female mice to 10 ppm PbCl2 in the drinking water for 13 weeks for a concentration of 2 mgkg body weightday revealed that this chemical altered the gut microbiome trajectory and phylogenetic diversity gut metabolic disruptions were also determined when fecal samples were assessed at 4 and 13 weeks post-exposureGao et al.

In moving forward it would be helpful if agencies funding environmental chemical studies such as the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences NIEHS provide funding for creation of a bioinformatics workflow managementTABLE 1  Studies linking environmental chemical exposure and gut microbiome changes.PublicationAnimal modelDosing regimenMajor gut microbiome and host findings HEAVY METALS AND PARTICULATE MATTERLu et al.

decreased in treated mice.Metabolic pathways involving vitamin E bile acids nitrogen metabolism energy metabolism oxidative stress and defensedetoxification were disrupted in PbCl2-exposed mice.Toads in the BY area had an overabundance of Bacteroidetes.Tenericutes were over-represented in those from LJX.In the BY toads the ratio of FirmicutesBacteroidetes and the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the gut microbiome were decreased relative to LJX toads.Species diversity and proportion of OTUs were also reduced in the toads subjected to heavy metal pollution.WT mice exposed to PM10 had alterations in immune gene expression enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion into the small intestine increased gut leakiness permeability and hyporesponsiveness in splenocytes to the PM.IL10-- mice exposed to PM10 had increased pro-inflammatory cytokineexpression in the colon and significant changes in the relative amounts ofBacteroidetes spp.
