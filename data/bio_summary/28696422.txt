It was in overall agreement with the 16S rRNA gene tree regarding the phylogenetic place- ment of the bins containing this gene and further- more provides placement for the three bins missing the 16S rRNA gene.Sponge symbiont genomes are enriched in defense and in matrix interactionsIn order to identify the gene functions that are enriched in the genomes of sponge symbionts we compared the pool of symbiont genomes against thepool of selected reference genomes.

For these reasons all downstream analyses were carried out with the genomes binned from the PacBio-Illumina hybrid assembly.Thirty-seven high-quality sponge symbiont genomes representing 13 bacterial phylaThe 37 binned genomes belonged to 11 bacterial phyla and 2 candidate phyla which are representa- tive of the sponge symbiont consortium Proteobac- teria Alpha Gamma and Delta Chloroflexi Acidobacteria Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes Gem- matimonadetes Deinococcus-Thermus Nitrospirae Nitrospinae Cyanobacteria Spirochaetes and the candidate phyla Poribacteria and SBR1093 2.

Statistical comparison of symbiont genomes with selected reference genomes revealed a significant enrichment of genes related to bacterial defense restriction-modification systems toxin-antitoxin systems as well as genes involved in host colonization and extracellular matrix utilization in sponge symbionts.

Close taxonomic relatedness to the sym- biont genomes closed genomes as well as marine or at least aquatic environments were preferably selected.

Marine sources were preferred over other sources.To discover statistically significant differences between the sponge symbiont genomes and reference genomes Welch's t-test was performed in STAMP2.0.9 with Storey FDR and a q-value cutoff of 0.01.

Overall the sponge symbionts had genomes of high GC-content which are as follows 13 were between 50 and 60 17 of symbiont genomes comprised 460 of GC-bases.

Significant differences were identified between the symbiont genomes and reference genomes on the level of COG classes.

It also improves the quality of binned genomes and eases often newly enables phylogenetic classification of the binned genomes.

The statistical comparison revealed an enrichment of genes related to RM and TA systems in most symbiont genomes over the reference genomes.

The most dominant symbiont groups belong to the phyla Proteobacteria mainly gamma- and alphaproteobacteria Actinobacteria Chloro- flexi Nitrospirae Cyanobacteria candidatus phylum Poribacteria and Thaumarchaea .Comparisons of sponge-associated and seawater microbial consortia have identified a number of genomic features that seem to facilitate bacterial adaptation to a symbiotic existence within sponges for example transposable elements defense mechanisms and eukaryote-like proteins   Studies on individual clades of2466Marine sponge symbionts united in defense but specialized in metabolismBM Slaby et althe microbial consortium have revealed specific features of sponge symbionts such as adaptations of the lipopolysaccharide by the cyanobacterium 'Candidatus Synechococcus spongiarum' presum- ably to avoid host phagocytosis  and specific patterns for carbon degradation by Poribacteria  PacBio long-read sequencing is widely used in isolate genomics as a stand-alone tool or in combination with Illumina short-read sequencing for example  The error- prone PacBio reads need to be corrected either with themselves--if sufficient sequencing depth is pro- vided--or with Illumina reads of far lower error-rate KThe combina- tion of PacBio and Illumina sequencing data in hybrid assemblies enables the closure of assembly gaps for example by spanning over long repeats to merge contigs and thereby to reconstruct the genome architecture  In meta- genomics the Illumina-PacBio hybrid assembly approach has recently been shown to improve the quality of assemblies  Although the improvements in targeted binning of the dominant members of the micro- biomes in these studies have been demonstrated un-targeted binning and performance for less abundant mem- bers of the microbial communities have not been evaluated.Even though considerable metagenomic informa- tion from sponge microbiomes has been accrued only few symbiont genomes have been recon- structed by single-cell genomics or binning Therefore correlations between phylogeny and function have only rarely been possible.
