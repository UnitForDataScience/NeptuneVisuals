2016.Although there is evidence to support pro-synbiotics use in reducing SSIs for patients undergoing a surgical procedure strong scientific evidence to support specific uses of pro-synbiotics for most health conditions is lacking.

The impact of product format on pro-synbiotics function has yet to be explored in depth.The timing for the colonization and proliferation of the gut by the probiotics is also important.
