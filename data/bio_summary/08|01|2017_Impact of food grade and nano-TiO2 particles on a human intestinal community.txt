at the low concentrations used neither the tio2 food additives nor control tio2 nps had an impact on gas production and only a minor effect on fatty acids profiles c1600 c1800 151 w5c 181 w9c and 181 w9c p  0.05. dna profiles and phylogenetic distributions confirmed limited effects on the bacterial community with a modest decrease in the relative abundance of the dominant bacteroides ovatus in favor of clostridium cocleatum -13 and th14 respectively p  0.05. such minor shifts in the treated consortia suggest that food grade and nano-tio2 particles do not have a major effect on human gut microbiota when tested in vitro at relevant low concentrations.

whatever the kind of food the addition of tio2 is limited to 1 of the overall food weight in the united states  and it is used at quantum satis levels in europe which means that although no maximum level is specified it is to be used at levels not higher than necessary to achieve the intended purpose  .global per capita tio2 ingestion depends on geography with the population of the usa and the uk consuming 0.2e0.7 mg and1 mg tio2kg body weight bw per day respectively  .

these results further suggest that tio2-containing food additives could be of lesser concern for consumers since these two conditions are found in the human gut.although these results on food grade tio2 should be greeted as good news for consumers these studies must be validated in vivo as there may be different effects.

published by elsevier ltd. this is an open access article under the cc by-nc-ndlicense .introductiontitanium dioxide tio2 is a white metal oxide commonly used as whitening or brightening agents in various applications such as paints cosmetics and food products.

as a food additive tio2 is referred to as e171 in europe and ins171 in north america.

however recent assessments indicate that food grade tio2 can be composed of up to 44 nanoparticles nps  .

since changes to this microbiota can be asso- ciated with disease states such as obesity diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease   it is important and timely to assess the impact of food grade tio2 on the human gut consortia.

however its complexity and the variability in species composition between in- dividuals means that assessment of the impact of food additives on this ecosystem is problematic and difficult to interpret.

here the same system has been employed to assess the impact of two commercial food grade tio2 additives using a suite of physiological biochemical and molecular assays to test for toxicity.materials and methodstio2 sample preparationfood-grade tio2 e171-1 and e171-6a from two european suppliers and tio2 nps degussa p25 essen germany 100 nps with a reported diameter of 25 nm were employed.

briefly e171-1 was chosen as a representative sample of food grade tio2 since it contains 17 nps and is composed of 100 anatase tio2 as determined by transmission electron microscopy hitachi h-9000 nar and by x-ray diffraction bruker axs d8 advance.

e171-6a 21 nps was chosen as an alternative tio2 food additive since it showed a different surface chemistry from the other e171 batcheswith a lower isoelectric point of 2.2 attributed to the presence of silica at its surface as detected by x-ray photoelectrons spectros- copy axis nova kratos analytical company.

particle sterility was interrogated by inoculation of the food addi- tives and the tio2 nps 5 mg each into sterile 10 tryptic soyculture medium incubation at 37 oc for 2 days and subsequentplating 100 ml on 10 tsa tryptic soy agar at 37 oc.

a mixture of food grade tio2 e171- 1 100e250 ppm and 50 mgml porcine pancreas a-amylase 37.5 uml sigma aldrich was included in one experimental set of bottles in order to model the additional presence of a starch- digesting enzyme as would be seen in the digestive tract.
