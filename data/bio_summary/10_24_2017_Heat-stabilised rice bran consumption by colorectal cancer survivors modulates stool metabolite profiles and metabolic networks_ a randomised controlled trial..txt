Results from this study have important dietary implications for prevention of primary and secondary CRC recurrence in adults.Brown et al.Page 3MethodsStudy population and stool sample collectionCRC survivors were recruited and enrolled in a parallel randomised controlled dietary intervention trial NCT01929122 as previously described21.

RB was extracted with 80  methanol as previously described and analysed by GC-MS and ultra-performance liquidBrown et al.Page 4chromatography-MS UPLC-MSMS in the positive and negative ionisation mode platforms23.Stool extractions for metabolomicsStool samples were extracted for metabolite profile evaluation by Metabolon Inc. as previously described24.

Each metabolite was represented by a closed coloured node extending from a sub-metabolic pathway node via pathway enrichmentBrown et al.Page 5score which connect to a super-metabolic pathway hexagonal node.

4d displays the urea cycle arginine and proline metabolism pathways and significantly decreased homocitrulline N-methylproline and citrulline metabolites.Brown et al.Page 7Metabolite profile and pathway distinctions between control and rice bran consumersCompared with control diet thirty-nine stool metabolites sixteen of which had higher expression in RB consumers were significantly different in the RB group after 4 weeks of consumption.

Additional details on the RB metabolome can be found in Zarei et al.28.Overlap between the stool and rice bran food metabolomesThe thirty-nine significantly changed stool metabolites from RB consumers that were also present in the RB food metabolome are shown in Fig.

These included N6-Brown et al.Page 8carboxymethyllysine an AGE which decreased by 2-fold in RB consumers' stool over 4 weeks.
