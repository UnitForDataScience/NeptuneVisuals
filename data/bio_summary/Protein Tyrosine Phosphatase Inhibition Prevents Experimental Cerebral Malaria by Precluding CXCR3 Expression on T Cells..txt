control wt and il-10ko mice were analyzed 7 days post-infection upon the onset of neurological symptoms in both groups and the bpvphen-treated wt and il-10ko mice were evaluated on day 10 post-infection when the il-10ko mice began to develop weakness pallor and hypothermia.

following the determination of tr1 cells as the dominant source of il-10 induced by bpvphen treatment during p. berghei anka infection we examined whether il-10 contributed to the protection afforded by ptp inhibition.depletion of the il-10 receptorand il-10 deficiencyin c57bl6 mice were previously shown to have little to no effect on the incidence of ecm and we observed that the control il-10ko mice were not significantly protected compared to the control wt mice.

furthermore the non-symptomatic control wt mice and the bpvphen-treated wt mice had a similar parasite burden even though the non-symptomatic control wt mice had increased liver damage.

depletion of il-10 in resistant balbc mice was shown to increase the incidence of ecm and exogenous il-10 decreased neuropathology in susceptible cbaj mice.

n  36 for control mice and n  40 for bpvphen-treated mice.

while 100 of the control mice succumbed to ecm the bpvphen-treated mice were markedly protected with an overall ecm incidence of less than 13 fig.

furthermore the parasitemia of the control and bpvphen-treated mice was similar until the control mice suc- cumbed to the infection indicating that the protective effect of ptp inhibition did not rely on the increased clearance of parasites fig.

however tregs only accounted for approximately 10 of the total il-10cd4 t cells in the uninfected mice and slightly more than 15 of the total il-10cd4 t cells in the infected mice congruous with an infection-dependent increase in il-10 production by foxp3cd4 t cells see supplementary fig.
