Control WT and IL-10KO mice were analyzed 7 days post-infection upon the onset of neurological symptoms in both groups and the bpVphen-treated WT and IL-10KO mice were evaluated on day 10 post-infection when the IL-10KO mice began to develop weakness pallor and hypothermia.

Following the determination of Tr1 cells as the dominant source of IL-10 induced by bpVphen treatment during P. berghei ANKA infection we examined whether IL-10 contributed to the protection afforded by PTP inhibition.Depletion of the IL-10 receptorand IL-10 deficiencyin C57BL6 mice were previously shown to have little to no effect on the incidence of ECM and we observed that the control IL-10KO mice were not significantly protected compared to the control WT mice.

Furthermore the non-symptomatic control WT mice and the bpVphen-treated WT mice had a similar parasite burden even though the non-symptomatic control WT mice had increased liver damage.
