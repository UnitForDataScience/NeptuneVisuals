.however less attention has been given thus far to the specific relationship between the microbial community and working conditions especially vermifilter depth which is very important for identifying the specific roles that mi- croorganisms play in a biological treatment system at the microlevel to promote the vf process performance.therefore the present study was conducted with the fol- lowing objectives 1 exploring the relationship betweensludge treatment and earthworm reproduction as well as mi- crobial community structure and its function 2 investigating the microbial community structure and diversity at different filter depths by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr-dgge and 3 analyzing the char- acteristics of microbial respiration at different filter depths.materials and methodsvermifilter system and operationfigur e sho ws t h e sc he matic dia gra m of a vermifiltration system used to evaluate the effectiveness of filter depth on microbial community characteristics.

moreover microbial struc- ture varied with the vf depth while dominant bacteria stayed the same.effects of filter depth on microbial respirationto clarify the effects of the vermifilter depth on microbial com- munity structure at a macrolevel table was decided statistically by fig.

whattable 3 the types of microbial respiration along the filter depth in the vf detectedis more the species of anaerobic bacteria in the biofilm at differ- ent filter depths changed gently showing that there was no bio- film blocking in the filter media and filter operation was relative- ly stable.generally speaking the dominance of aerobic bacteria in the vf slightly varied as the depth increased.

b suggesting that microbial diversity in d-1 greatly dif- fered from that in d-234 due to the fact that some microbial species of the inlet sludge gradually were selected by vf.additionally there was a high similarity 0.86 between the mi- crobial diversity in d-3 and d-4 implying that microbial diver- sity changed evenly when the filter depth increased from 75 to 100 cm.

explored the microbial diversity along the filter depth of vf and bf and sug- gested that vf had more richness in microbial commu- nity than bf.

there was a decrease from 2.73 to 2.37 in microbial diversity index h' along the filter depth bringing into correspondence with the change of the sludge reduction efficiency the earthworm distribution and the microbial bio- mass.

.different from the vf microbial diversity along the filter depth in bf changed more smoothly implying that introduc- ing earthworms significantly altered the microbial community diversity in vf xu et al.

this further confirmed that vf with the depth of 75 cm was recommended to efficiently and economi- cally achieve the required standard for sewage sludge reduction and stabilization.although the dominant bacteria changed evenly with the filter depth the specific microbial community composition differed among the four stages fig.

the results indicated that when the filter depth exceeded 75 cm though the fourth stage can further advance the sludge reduc- tion its contribution for the total sludge reduction was lower than 10 while the aerobic bacteria especially the dominant bacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes kept a high sim- ilarity as the filter depth varied.

unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma dendrograms cal- culated using the dice coefficient were also applied to find similarities of the band patterns.results and discussioneffects of filter depth on the process performance of the vfto explore the relationship between the filter depth and steady sludge treatment performance ss and vss at different stages of the vf were determined.

in addition the ss and vss average removal rate at a depth of 75 cm were 43.3 and 52.1 respectively while they only increased by 3 when the filter depth reached 100 cm failing to make the most of the bottom filter media.

after about 15 days the system was operated continu- ously and steadily for 6 months at room temperature at the hydraulic load of 4 m3m2d.samplingat the end of the experiment ceramic pellet samples with attached biofilms were taken randomly from differ- ent filter stages at depths of 12.5 37.5 62.5 and87.5 cm to evaluate the filter performance and the spa- tial microbial community in the vf.

moreover there was a similar relationship between filter depth and the distribution of microbial biomass roughly reflected by vss adhere to ceramic pellets lazarova and manem  fig.
