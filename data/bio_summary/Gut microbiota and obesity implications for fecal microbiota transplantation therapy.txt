in this review we summarize the recent literature as an aid to better understanding how the alteration of gut microbiota composition contributes to obesity while evaluating the therapeutic effect of fmt in the treatment of obesity based on previous publications.gut microbiota definitionthe intestinal epithelium mucosal immune system and microflora constitute a morphofunctional system in dynamic equilibrium that is responsible for the maintenance of gut integrity and systemic barrier function.5 the human intestine harbors a large diversity of microbial communities which are collectively termed the gut microbiota.

complex microbial communities play a crucial role in the health of the human organism and these highly evolved lineages have evolved with humans over the eons.10 the gastrointestinal tract is essentially sterile at birth and is subsequently colonized by microbes acquired from the mother and the surrounding environment.11 the gut microbiota also undergoes substantial alterations at the extremes of life that is in infants and in older people.12 however adult gut microbiota has been shown to be comparatively steady over time13 and is relatively alike between individuals even when there are drastic changes in diet and in levels of physical activity during pregnancy and with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.1415the gut microbiota digest nutrients synthesize vitamins butyric acid and biotin and degrade bile acid and short- chain fatty acids scfas including acetate propionate and butyrate.16 specifically in addition to their important role as fuel for intestinal epithelial cells scfas are thought to have immunomodulatory effects in that they reduce intestinal permeability.17 scfas also regulate different processes of the gastrointestinal gi tract e.g.

certain gut microbial strains have been shown to inhibit or attenuate immune responses related to chronic inflammation in experimental models suggesting that specific species among gut microbiota may play either a protective or a pathogenic role in the progression of obesity.

on the other hand though still a relatively nascent field of research evidence to date suggests that the gut microbiome may represent fertile targets for prevention or management of obesity with the result that the development of therapeutics based on gut microbiota modulation has gained considerable momentum.

an ecologic unit harboring 1014 bacteria6 it consists of 6-10 major phyla and 3000-5000 species weighing 1-2kg.6 the dominant phyla in the gut are firmicutes 60-65 bacteroidetes 20-25 proteobacteria 5-10 and actinobacteria 3 which together constitute over 97 of the gut microbe population.7 its very diversity sheds light on the role of these different bacterial species in the maintenance of health and the development of disease.

meanwhile a large amount of recent research has convincingly demonstrated that the stability and diversification of gut microbia is essential for the hosting of metabolic and immune pathways.26 the gut is a crucial immune organ besides its function in metabolism while it contains the largest lymphoid tissue mass27 which might not be surprising considering its intestinal bacterial load.

butyrate as a short-chain fatty acid is known to be associated withobesity and pain sensation and plays an important role in colonic function.57-60figure 2. possible mechanisms underlying the relationship between fecal microbiota transplantation fmt and obesity are as follows fmt manipulates the composition of gut microbiota and thus bacterial bile salt hydrolase bsh enzymes in the gut influence host physiological processes by decreasing the abundance of tbmca tauro-b-muricholic acid a potent antagonist of the host bile receptor farnesoid x receptor fxr causing a decrease of body weight gain plasma cholesterol levels and liver triglycerides.

in this review we summarize the cutting-edge research being done into fmt treatment of obesity current issues in fmt treatment and the future of fmt and microbial therapeutics.keywordsfecal microbiota transplantation gut microbiota metabolic syndrome obesityintroductionobesity today a huge public health issue1 is mainly a disequilibrium in energy balance with energy intake exceeding energy expenditure a condition characterized by a state of chronic inflammation.

at the same time obesity-related disorders are also on the rise worldwide.however changes in energy balance alone cannot explain the increased incidence of obesity.4 recent studies in animal models and human subjects have revealed that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is also associated with the development of obesity.

change in the abundance of certain gut microbial strains has been shown to inhibit or attenuate immune responses giving rise to chronic inflammation in experimental models these strains may be biomarkers in obesity prevention and treatment.

water absorption and electrolytes.18 gut microbiota can impact intestinal immune function through scfas and these fatty acids act on leukocytes and endothelial cells via two mechanisms 1 by activating g protein coupled receptors gpcrs gpr41 and gpr43 and 2 by inhibiting histone deacetylase hdac.19 scfas not only modulate several leukocyte functions including production of chemokines such as cinc-2 and mcp-1 eicosanoids and cytokines e.g.

il-10 il-6 il-2 and tnf-a20 but also affect the ability of leukocytes to migrate to the foci of inflammation and to destroy microbial pathogens.1821 furthermore scfas can also lead to apoptosis of neutrophils22 macrophages23 and lymphocytes.2425 the effect may come about as the result of the inflammatory process and the immune response to gut microbiota which produce scfas thesecapable of exerting an anti-inflammatory action.

thus in addition to contributing to host metabolism the gut microbiota provides critical signals for the development of host immunity.
