In this review we summarize the recent literature as an aid to better understanding how the alteration of gut microbiota composition contributes to obesity while evaluating the therapeutic effect of FMT in the treatment of obesity based on previous publications.GUT MICROBIOTA DEFINITIONThe intestinal epithelium mucosal immune system and microflora constitute a morphofunctional system in dynamic equilibrium that is responsible for the maintenance of gut integrity and systemic barrier function.5 The human intestine harbors a large diversity of microbial communities which are collectively termed the gut microbiota.

Complex microbial communities play a crucial role in the health of the human organism and these highly evolved lineages have evolved with humans over the eons.10 The gastrointestinal tract is essentially sterile at birth and is subsequently colonized by microbes acquired from the mother and the surrounding environment.11 The gut microbiota also undergoes substantial alterations at the extremes of life that is in infants and in older people.12 However adult gut microbiota has been shown to be comparatively steady over time13 and is relatively alike between individuals even when there are drastic changes in diet and in levels of physical activity during pregnancy and with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.1415The gut microbiota digest nutrients synthesize vitamins butyric acid and biotin and degrade bile acid and short- chain fatty acids SCFAs including acetate propionate and butyrate.16 Specifically in addition to their important role as fuel for intestinal epithelial cells SCFAs are thought to have immunomodulatory effects in that they reduce intestinal permeability.17 SCFAs also regulate different processes of the gastrointestinal GI tract e.g.

Brit J Nutr 80Suppl 1 S147-S171.Tsai F Coyle WJ 2009 The microbiome and obesity is obesity linked to our gut flora Curr Gastroen Rep 11 307-313.Backhed F Ding H Wang T et al 2004 The gut microbiota as an environmental factor that regulates fat storage.

Certain gut microbial strains have been shown to inhibit or attenuate immune responses related to chronic inflammation in experimental models suggesting that specific species among gut microbiota may play either a protective or a pathogenic role in the progression of obesity.

On the other hand though still a relatively nascent field of research evidence to date suggests that the gut microbiome may represent fertile targets for prevention or management of obesity with the result that the development of therapeutics based on gut microbiota modulation has gained considerable momentum.

An ecologic unit harboring 1014 bacteria6 it consists of 6-10 major phyla and 3000-5000 species weighing 1-2kg.6 The dominant phyla in the gut are Firmicutes 60-65 Bacteroidetes 20-25 Proteobacteria 5-10 and Actinobacteria 3 which together constitute over 97 of the gut microbe population.7 Its very diversity sheds light on the role of these different bacterial species in the maintenance of health and the development of disease.

Meanwhile a large amount of recent research has convincingly demonstrated that the stability and diversification of gut microbia is essential for the hosting of metabolic and immune pathways.26 The gut is a crucial immune organ besides its function in metabolism while it contains the largest lymphoid tissue mass27 which might not be surprising considering its intestinal bacterial load.

Possible mechanisms underlying the relationship between fecal microbiota transplantation FMT and obesity are as follows FMT manipulates the composition of gut microbiota and thus bacterial bile salt hydrolase BSH enzymes in the gut influence host physiological processes by decreasing the abundance of TbMCA tauro-b-muricholic acid a potent antagonist of the host bile receptor farnesoid X receptor FXR causing a decrease of body weight gain plasma cholesterol levels and liver triglycerides.

In conclusion the above data demonstrate that commensal bacteria are involved in systemic inflammation through the LPSCD14 system.35Obesity has further been shown to be related to altered gut microbial abundance and composition in human subjects3738 and mice.32 Most3138 but not all39 studies reported on the diversity of the microbiota and particularly underlined the decrease in fractional proportion of Bacteroidetes species relative to Firmicutes in obese compared with lean individuals.3138-40 Meanwhile weight loss was shown to increase the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes species and microbial diversity.3741 Similarly diversity of the genes was decreased in obese compared with lean individuals38 and was increased by dietary weight loss.4243 Recently Le Chatelier et al44 also found that obese subjects had an increase of the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes a decrease of Akkermansia muciniphila anti-inflammatory bacteria and an increase of pathogens e.g.

Numerous studies have shown that RYGB can change the composition of gut microbiota Figure 3.466364 Recently Liou et al65 demonstrated that alterations of intestinal bacteria can contribute to reducing host weight and adiposity after RYGB surgery in mice.
