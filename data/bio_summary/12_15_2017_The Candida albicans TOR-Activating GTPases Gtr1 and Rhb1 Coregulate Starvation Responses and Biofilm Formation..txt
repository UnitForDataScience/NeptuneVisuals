This study demonstrates that starvation responses and biofilm formation are coregulated by GTR1 and suggests that these responses are linked to compete with the microbiome for space and nutrients.KEYWORDS Candida albicans TOR biofilm virulencef the clinically relevant Candida species Candida albicans is responsible for the vast majority of human infections .

The homozygous gtr1gtr1 mutant exhibited enhanced flocculation phenotypes and similar to the rhb1rhb1 mutant exhibited enhanced biofilm forma- tion on plastic surfaces.

b The gtr1gtr1 mutant Dgtr exhibits more rapid flocculation in Spider medium following static incubation than the rhb1rhb1 mutant Drhb1.

The star indicates a significant difference between the WT strain and the PENO-GTR1 and PENO-TOR1 strains t test P  0.05. f Quantitative analysis of the numbers of nonflocculating free yeast cells in cultures of the gtr1gtr1 mutant Dgtr the rhb1rhb1 mutant Drhb1 and the complemented derivatives in YEPD supplemented with 10 volvol serum.

These differences were greatest in the gtr1gtr1 mutant and were significant in both mutants at 4 h gtr1gtr1 P  0.038 rhb1rhb1 P  0.05.FIG 4 Transcript profiling of the gtr1gtr1 mutant in liquid YEPD at 37degC.

Categories in orange were upregulated in the gtr1gtr1 mutant but downregulated in the rhb1rhb1 mutant.

The rhb1rhb1 mutant exhibited increased susceptibility to both agents whereas the gtr1gtr1 mutant exhibited WT levels of susceptibility Fig.
