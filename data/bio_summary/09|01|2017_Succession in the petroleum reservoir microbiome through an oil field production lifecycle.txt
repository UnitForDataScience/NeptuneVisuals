The injection fluid for secondary production in Halfdan was nitrate-amended sea- water whereas in MHGC it was either produced water or a mix of produced water and effluent from a municipal sewage works Moreover in the present study produced water samples provided a systematic representation of parts of the field that had been under production for different periods of time over a 15 year period.Multiple microbiomes in a single oil fieldAlthough we do not present a conventional long- itudinal study in that a single well was not sampled over time to assess succession in the microbial communities we have used the sampling of wells from the same field that have been in production for different periods as a proxy for time.

Water and on the produced water composition which is strongly influenced by the formation water type -- different colored water sample labels correspond to different formation water types.

Thus not only did formation water composition affect the microbial community composition but the microbial commu- nities also influenced formation water composition by fermentation of organic carbon and generation of volatile fatty acids.By contrast the bacterial communities in 'pristine' wells from the second oil accumulation in the field FWB higher salinity sulfate and metallic ions concentrations were dominated by Petrotoga and Desulfotomaculum species.

The average temperature is 80 degC and the field harbors two oil accumulations each with distinct formation waters that is undis- turbed water naturally associated with the geological formation formation water A FWA in the North and formation water B FWB in the South East and West of the field.

In these producing wells statistical analyses RDA Pearson correlations and hierarchical clustering indicated that microbial community composition and metabolic potential was shaped by the produced water composition c which is strongly influenced by the formation water composition.

Contribution of make-up water to the microbial community in an oilfield from which oil is produced by produced water re-injection.

Therefore to better under- stand this deep subsurface ecosystem we wanted to answer several important practical and fundamental questions which are significant in the context of anthropogenic perturbation of deep subsurface sedi- ment environments are community composition and metabolic profiles from a single well represen- tative of an entire oil reservoir Which environ- mental factors shape the oil reservoir microbial community composition Are there systematic changes in microbial community composition and ecological function driven by oil production prac- tices for example secondary oil recovery by sea- water injection and what are the likely drivers of these shifts The answers to these questions have important implications not only for petroleum production but for any process where geological resources from deep subsurface environments are exploited.

This finding has serious implications for microbial monitoring and control practices for field operators.Formation water chemistry is reflected in the indigenous microbial community compositionIn producing wells where produced fluids contained o10 seawater recently drilled wells andor with long retention time influence of the seawater injection appears to be negligible and the micro- organisms identified could be considered primarily as indigenous to the oil field.

Peptides and sugars are components of microbial biomass and marine detrital particles suggesting that the bacterial food chain in petroleum reservoirs with higher salinity can also be supported by degradation of indigenous microbial necromass or by the accumulation of marine organic matter in the formation water and sediments originating from the marine shelf depositional system where the Halfdan field was formed .

Therefore monitoring produced water microbial community composition and meta- bolic potential is essential for an accurate evaluation of the potential for development of production associated problems and development of an effective oil field microbial control program.
