Of all these shared OTUs G. lemaneiformis cultivation caused an increase in relative abun- dances of 20 OTUs and a decrease of two OTUs in the surface water an increase of 23 OTUs and decrease of seven OTUs in the bottom water and an increase of 12 OTUs and a decrease of 69 OTUs in the sed- iment b.

Among 2705 OTUs detected from 12 water samples 1472 54.4 were shared by GZ and CZ and 1233 unique OTUs were detected with 639 OTUs at GZ 23.6 and 594 OTUs at CZ 22.0.

The Shannon index OTU richness observed numbers of OTU and Chao1 diversity estimator and evenness were lowest P b 0.05 in the sediment samples at GZ compared with surface water at GZ and sedi- ment at CZ .To determine the differences in microbial community structure be-tween GZ and CZ in response to G. lemaneiformis cultivation dissimilar- ity test were performed using PERMANOVA adonis across different layers at both GZ and CZ.

lemaneiformis cultivation zone com- pared to the control zone in both water and sediment environments.Seaweed-associated microbial groupssuch as Arenibacter Croceitalea Glaciecola Leucothrix and Maribacter were enriched in the cultivation zone.A conceptual model is proposed to sum-marize major results in this study and guide future studies on relationships among G. lemaneiformis microbial com- munities and their environments in this cultivation ecosystem.G R A P H I C A L A B S T R A C Ta r t i c l ei n f o Article historyReceived 5 October 2016Received in revised form 25 March 2017Accepted 25 March 2017Available online 22 April 2017 Editor D.

Such a divergence in abundant genera could be ex- plained by different environmental properties such as lower nutrientsand higher algal polysaccharide at GZ implying a healthier community composition at the seaweed cultivation zone.With the respect to those enriched OTUs at GZ their affiliated micro- organisms were isolated from seaweed or have the ability to digest algal polysaccharides of seaweed such as genera Polaribacter Crocinitomix  Litorimonas  Arenibacter and Maribacter .

The OTUs in sediment affiliated with Arenibacter Glaciecola Leisingera Sulfitobacter and Peredibacter had higher abundance P b 0.05 at GZ than at CZ while lower abundant OTUs in sediment were associated with Desulfobulbus Thiohalomonas and unclassified-Gammaproteobacteria at GZ compared to CZ Fig.

S3c.To demonstrate the effects of G. lemaneiformis cultivation on micro- bial community composition further analyses were performed to iden- tify the significantly changed shared OTUs and unique OTUs in the water and sediment samples at GZ and CZ a.

For those unique OTUs c higher abundances of OTU-17 and OTU-56 associated with Sulfurimonas OTU-2071 associated with Desulfovibrio and N 10 OTUs af- filiated with genus Lewinella were observed at GZ while for unique OTUs at CZ many of them were associated with Alcanivorax OTU- 146 Idiomarina OTU-146 Thiohalophilus OTU-1301 OTU-2930 OTU-1697 and OTU-3412 and Desulfopila OTU-1937 Table S1.The response ratio analysis further indicated the effect ofG.

Therefore it is important to understand the microbial community diversity composition struc- ture and function in G. lemaneiformis cultivation systems and their relationships with environmental changes and ecosystem function- ing .In this study we aimed to understand the impact of seaweed cultiva-tion on water and sediment microbial communities as well as microbial responses to seaweed cultivation and we hypothesized that i changes in environmental properties such as decreased nutrients and increased dissolved oxygen resulting from seaweed cultivation would shift the di- versity composition and structure of water and sediment microbial communities and ii certain microbial groups would be enriched in the seaweed cultivation ecosystem.
