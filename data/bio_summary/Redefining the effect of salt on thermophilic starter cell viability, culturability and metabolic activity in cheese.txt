Cheese manufactured with combined starters and brined at 18 had significantly lower levels of cell viability in the outside compared to the inside layer P  0.05 of the cheeses throughout ripening and similarly but to a lesser de- gree for the cheeses brined at 22.Streptococcus thermophilusFor cheese manufactured with S. thermophilus mean viable bacterial counts reached 108.5 cfug-1 before brining in ST STLH 22 and STLH 18 cheeses and remained at those counts after the 66 h s of brining in the outside layer of cheeses.

This trend appears to be in agree- ment with the microbial lysis data showing larger release of intracellular enzymes in the inner compared to the outer cheese layers  but failed to explain the discrepancy with the plate counts indicating higher bacterial survival in the core of the cheeses A and B.Effect of salt on morphology of starter bacteriaIn this study brining was found to significantly impact the morphology of the microbiota located in the outer layers of the cheeses as a reduction in cell size after 18 h P  0.01 and 48 h P  0.001 of brining compared to pre-brine values was observed B. Temporal analysis of the median FSC values revealed that the microbiota residing in the cheeses outer layers experienced a continuous and significant decrease P  0.01 in cell size upon brining and across the first 26 d of ripening whereas the size of the microorganisms located in the cheese cores remained substantially unaltered P  0.05 A and C. When confronted with osmotic shifts bacteria are capable of activating channels and transporters to rapidly adjust the intracellular osmolyte pools in proportion to the osmotic stress.

This study challenges the current thinking on how salt controls microbial activity in ripening cheese especially in cheeses which are brine salted as local variations in biochemical ripening indices can differ significantly from the outside to the inside of a ripening cheese.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionSalt has been used as a food preservative since prehistoric times and has worked especially well combined with fermentation and dehydration as is the case with cheese production  .

Values presented are the means ofthree replicate trials.found that in cheese with a salt concentration of 4 NaCl there was no significant difference in S. thermophilus viability over the first 30 days of ripening indicating that S. thermophilus is capable of maintaining high viability counts during the early stages of ripening in high salt conditions similar to that observed in this study.NSLABNSLAB are adventitious microbiota which contribute a large portion of the overall microbiota in most ripening cheeses.

The high level of SM observed in the outside layer for this study at 0 d of ripening 11 rapidly declines to much lower levels of 7 by 11 d of ripening suggesting inhibition of intracellular enzymes throughout ripening due to salt levels alone is unlikely.The highest levels of LDH activity were observed in the inside layer of cheeses made using a combination of S. thermophilus andL.

High salt concentration resulted in reduced primary and secondary proteolysis in the outside layer of cheeses which could significantly impact on ripening homogeneity in brine salted cheeses resulting in varied amino acid profiles and volatile components through the cheese block.Analysis by FC showed microbial cell shrinkage in the cheese outer layers which was not observed in the cheese core and which supported the hypothesis that starter bacteria may undergo membrane physiological changes to survive the high saline envi- ronment possibly resulting in a more rigid bacterial cell mem- brane and potentially promoting loss of culturability.The detection of larger levels of ROS in the microbiota of the cheese outer layer reflected a probable higher oxidative stress due to the high salt environment and consequently to a larger potential for accumulated ROS to cause cell death.

Application of a split plot design to determine the effects of sample location salt gradient ripening time and their interaction on the various parameters were performed as reported by  .Results and discussionChemical compositionManufacture of the cheeses using starters in combination or using each starter individually did not significantly affect cheese protein moisture MNFS fat FDM salt or SM contents .Table 1Chemical composition and pH 7 d of ripening of experimental cheeses.a-bMeans within a column with different superscripts differ P  0.05.

A significant accumulation P  0.01 of ROS molecules was detected in the cheeses made with only L. helveticus and with both starters from 11 d of ripening on- wards whereas the cheese made with only S. thermophilus showed a significant rise P  0.01 in ROS levels only after 18 d of ripening.

It also poses questions as to ways of exploiting this new information in order to influence ripening patterns or to increase ripening intensity and the possibility of creating high quality reduced sodium cheeses via brine salting and starter strainFig.

Wilkinson J.J. Sheehan.uptake is gradual and salt equilibrium occurs over a period of days weeksmonths  unlike dry salted cheeses where salt is relatively evenly distributed during the salting process  .The diffusion coefficient D of salt in brine salted cheeses has been investigated previously   with the D generally estimated at 0.2 cm2day but ranges from 0.1 to0.45 cm2day depending on curd temperature and moisture composition and brining conditions.
