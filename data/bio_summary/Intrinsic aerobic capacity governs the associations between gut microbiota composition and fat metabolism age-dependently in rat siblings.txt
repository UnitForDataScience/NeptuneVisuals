However contrary to our findings in rats a study in humans did not report associations between these bacterial taxa and cardiorespiratory fitness 13.The gut microbiota composition of young rats differed significantly from old rats.

Several taxa in young adult rats hereafter young linked to inherited aerobic capacity while in older adult hereafter old rats most of the differences between the lines associ- ated with body weight.

Proteobacte- ria in turn have been linked to improved inflammatory pro- files which is line with their negative association with TLR4 in old HCR and CD45 in young HCR 47.In conclusion several microbial taxa in young rats werelinked to inherited aerobic capacity while in older rats most of the differences between the lines may be influenced by body weight.

Compared with each other LCR rats gain more weight and have higher adiposity while HCR rats have higher oxidative metabolism capacity and are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance 19 48.In this study we aimed to find out whether male rats with dissimilar intrinsic aerobic capacities also differ in their gut microbiota composition.

Phylum-level abundance of gut microbiota in young and old high-capacity running HCR and low-capacity running LCR rats.

Genus-level abundance of gut microbiota in young and old HCR and LCR rats.

The young HCR rats measured higher for serum glycerol P  0.043 and FFA P  0.0001 and lower for total cholesterol P  0.008 HDL P  0.002 LDL P  0.0001 and triglycerides P  0.017 than the young LCR rats Table 2.

Among the young rats' microbial community a total of nine phyla 13 families and 17 genera and in old rats eight phyla 19 families and 26 genera were identified Figs.

Several microbial taxa in young rats were linked to inherited aerobic capacity while in old adult rats most of the differences between the lines may be influenced by body weight.

We included 9 young HCR 10 young LCR 12 old HCR and 10 old LCR in the 16S rDNA sequencing.
