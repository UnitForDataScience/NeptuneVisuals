comparablesex-specific associations of gut microbiota with health despite similar dietary background matched age and body mass index have been previously described in humans 16. in addition a study in 89 inbred mice lines showed that several taxa exhib- ited significant sex-specific differences in the microbiota com- position 32. however contrary to our findings in rats a study in humans did not report associations between these bacterial taxa and cardiorespiratory fitness 13.the gut microbiota composition of young rats differed significantly from old rats.

however whether treponema plays a role in physical fitness and healthy metab- olism remains to be determined.interestingly despite the lack of body weight differencebetween the young rat lines young lcr rats had more acti- nobacteria veillonellaceae coriobacteriaceae phascolarcto- bacterium and ruminococcus which all have been previously linked to obesity 17 23 41 42. this raises a question whether the gut microbiota contributes to the later development of obesity in lcr rats.

as gut microbiota composition is sug- gested to be a polygenic trait 3 the polygenic hcrlcr rats were the most suitable model in which to study the influence of inherited aerobic capacity on the microbial taxa.gut microbiota composition is highly associated with body weight 42. the young hcr and lcr rats did not differ in body weight but an abundance of gut microbiome taxa did differ between the young representatives of the two rat lines.

in old lcr il1b correlated with bacteroidetes r  -0.893 p  0.007 adipoq associated in old hcr with the unknown family and genus of clostridiales r  -0.857 p  0.014 for both and clostridiaceae family r  -0.893 p  0.007 and in lcrwith ruminococcaceae family r  0.762 p  0.028 and an unidentified genus of the family r  0.857 p  0.007. in hcr tlr4 correlated with proteobacteria r  -0.811 p  0.027 and clostridiaceae family r  -0.929 p  0.003. no correlations were found for cd45 in hcr while in lcr it correlated with the abundance of firmicutes r  0.714 p  0.047 ruminococcaceae r  0.786 p  0.021 prevotella of the paraprevotellaceae family r  0.805 p  0.016 unidentified genus of ruminococcaceae r  0.833 p  0.01 and coprococcus r  0.843 p  0.009. tlr5 associated with deferribacteres deferribacteriaceae mucispirillum r  0.786 p  0.036 for all unknown family and genus of bacteroidales r  -0.810 p  0.015 and phascolarctobac- terium r  -0.805 p  0.029 in old hcr and in old lcr with elusimicrobia r  -0.782 p  0.038 unknown genus of elusimicrobiaceae r  -0.831 p  0.011 and unknown family and genus of clostridiales r  -0.810 p  0.015.fig.

we included 9 young hcr 10 young lcr 12 old hcr and 10 old lcr in the 16s rdna sequencing.

specifically adiponectin expression levels were higher in young lcr than hcr rats and were associated in lcr positively with several gram-positive bacteria while nega- tively with gram-negative bacteroidetes in lcr and cyano- bacteria in hcr.

a number of studies in mice have shown that exercise results in a variety of modulations in microbial communities 7. yet it seems that the effects of exercise may depend on the metabolic state of the host as the gut microbiota of diabetic vs. healthy animals responds differently to exercise 22. in addition to animal experiments cross-sectional studies in humans have shown that the gut microbiota of professional athletes is more diverse than those of sedentary controls 9 and that cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with the microbial diversity 13.besides lifestyle and environment a genetic influence gov- erns the gut microbiota composition in the host and thus the microbiota that offspring inherit from their parents could pre- dispose them to a certain risk phenotype 25 42 43. studies in twins have suggested that genetics determines the gut microbiota composition of an individual and that siblings' microbiotas resemble each other more than those of unrelated individuals 25 42 43. several recent reports have shown that host genetic factors critically affect the gut microbiome and its functions.

compared with each other lcr rats gain more weight and have higher adiposity while hcr rats have higher oxidative metabolism capacity and are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance 19 48.in this study we aimed to find out whether male rats with dissimilar intrinsic aerobic capacities also differ in their gut microbiota composition.

1. phylum-level abundance of gut microbiota in young and old high-capacity running hcr and low-capacity running lcr rats.

3. genus-level abundance of gut microbiota in young and old hcr and lcr rats.

the young hcr rats measured higher for serum glycerol p  0.043 and ffa p  0.0001 and lower for total cholesterol p  0.008 hdl p  0.002 ldl p  0.0001 and triglycerides p  0.017 than the young lcr rats table 2. no differences were found in body weight or serum glucose between the younger lines.

aging-related differences were detected in the abundance of almost all taxa between young and old hcr as well as young and old lcr.
