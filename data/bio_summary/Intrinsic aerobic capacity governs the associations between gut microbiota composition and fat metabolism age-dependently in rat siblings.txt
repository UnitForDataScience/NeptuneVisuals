We included 9 young HCR 10 young LCR 12 old HCR and 10 old LCR in the 16S rDNA sequencing.

We in- cluded 9 young HCR 10 young LCR 12 old HCR and 10 old LCR in the 16S rDNA se- quencing.

We included 9 young HCR 10 young LCR 12 old HCR and 10 old LCR in the 16S rDNA sequencing.

Aging-related differences were detected in the abundance of almost all taxa between young and old HCR as well as young and old LCR.

Several taxa in young adult rats hereafter young linked to inherited aerobic capacity while in older adult hereafter old rats most of the differences between the lines associ- ated with body weight.

Proteobacte- ria in turn have been linked to improved inflammatory pro- files which is line with their negative association with TLR4 in old HCR and CD45 in young HCR 47.In conclusion several microbial taxa in young rats werelinked to inherited aerobic capacity while in older rats most of the differences between the lines may be influenced by body weight.

In young adult hereafter young rats the microbiotas of 10 HCR mean age 7.90 - 0.27 wk mean weight 177.8 - 25.4 g and 10 LCR mean age 7.77 - 0.29 wk mean weight 183.4 - 23.4 g were ana- lyzed.

The young HCR had less Veillonellaceae and Corio- bacteriaceae than young LCR.

The young HCR harbored less Phascolarctobacte- rium and Ruminococcus and more genus Lac- tobacillus than the young LCR.
