the number of rrn copies ranges between 1 and 15 on bacterial genomes and determines the number of ribosomes that a cell can produce simulta- neously.- several studies showed that the number of rrn copies correlates with cellular processes including growth rate lag time sporulation efficiency and motility.there is evidence that bacteria with few rrn copies grow slow but efficiently in terms of resource use whereas those with higher rrn copy numbers grow rapidly but inefficiently.the distribution of rrn copy numbers is also indicative of genome streamlining.-this not only refers to genome size reduction of bacteria successfully adapted to oligotrophic habitats but also to small cell size and apreference for a few broad-specificity transporters over specific energy-intensive transporters.- such trade-offs select for habitat preferences under contrasting regimes of resource availability and ultimately ecological lifestyles can be related to their genomic underpinnings and may explain temporal and spatial population dynamics.we analyzed the succession of rrn copy numbers in biofilms grown in stream microcosms and containing hundreds of bacterial taxa.we hypothesized that the distribution of rrn copy numbers in natural biofilms reflects trade-offs between resource use efficiency and growth rate during biofilm formation.

these latter figure among the most dynamic and extreme stream ecosystems on earth and yet biofilms thrive in there.-we postulate that high environmental fluctuations in these streams favor ecological lifestyles with rapid growth despite resource scarcity.results and discussionrrn copy number distribution during biofilm successionwe explored rrn copy numbers of published bacterial sequences n  2.060.595 from laboratory experiments where we grew biofilms under various trophic and hydraulic conditionsand from various streamssee methods section.

the relationships between community-level growth dynamics and rrn copy numbers that we found were generated by lumping otus at genus level for which rrn copy numbers are available through the rrndb database.thisfig.

the average rrn copy number from these random samples was compared with the average rrn copy number during biofilm formation to exclude a statistical bias through the rrn distribution of the pool of potential migrants supplementary discussion.

in stream ecosystems biofilms dominate microbial life regulate critical ecosystem processes and biogeochemical fluxes that are even of global relevance.the assembly of thousands of bacterial taxa into these complex biofilms and their biodiversity dynamics have been uncovered over the last years.- however the genomic determinants that possibly underlie the formation of complex biofilms and their evolutionary success are not understood.the availability of cultivation-independent estimates of rrn copy numbers has recently reinvigorated interests in the genomic underpinning of metabolic trade-offs of diverse bacterial commu- nities.- this is a major step forward to understand how community-aggregated functional traits give rise to ecological strategies driving adaptations to natural environments.-genes encoding the 5s 16s and 23s ribosomal rna are organized into an operon rrn on bacterial genomes.

after assignment of rrn copy numbers see methods section we retained operational taxonomic units otus n  9.676 belonging to 182 genera common to all samples supplementary figure 1. we considered these genera as typical biofilm formers in streams.

biofilms grown in oligotrophic systems had extended lag phases and lower growth rates compared to those in eutrophic systems.these growth patterns were reflected by the relative distribution of rrn copy numbers assupported by significant relationships between the average ratio of hcn to lcn and l and u  respectively figs.
