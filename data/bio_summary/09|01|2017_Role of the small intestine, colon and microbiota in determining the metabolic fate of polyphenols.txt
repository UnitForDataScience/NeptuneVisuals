Many of the catabolites are well absorbed from the colon and appear in the plasma either similarly conjugated or as glycine conjugates or in some cases unchanged.Although many polyphenol catabolites have been identified in human plasma andor urine the exact pathways from substrate to final microbial catabolite and the species of bacteria and enzymes involved are still scarcely reported.

The second group are those substrates associated with unique catabolites and the third group consists of some structurally diverse substrates that never- theless yield essentially the same set of catabolites this latter group predominating see  .

Many of these unique catabolites have received considerable attention but their precursors are minor components of the diet albeit with some considerable variation between subgroups  depending upon whether they consume significant amounts of oranges  olive oil  soya beans  nuts pomegranates strawberries and raspberries  whole grains  wine and peanuts or oats  respectively.The predominant catabolites generated by the microbiota frompolyphenols are the aromatic and phenolic acids with zero to three aromatic hydroxyls or their mono- or di-methoxy analogues possessing also a sidechain of one to five carbons which might bear an aliphatic hydroxyl .

Such binding would extend the period during which the micro- biota could attack such substrates potentially increasing the yield of catabolites and the area under the concentration-time curve for these catabolites in plasma.Volunteer studies of typical real world repeated consumption would if available circumvent the lack of data for intravenous dos- ing but in their absence we performed a simple additive modelling using real data from a single dose study in order to obtain an indi- cation of the potential concentrations that might be attained.

This result confirmed earlier studies by this research group which showed increases in bifidobacteria and excretion of anthocyanin catabolites syringic p-coumaric gallic acids and pyrogallol and flavanol catabolites hydrox- yphenylvalerolactones .

It has been suggested that analysis of gut microbiota catabolites in urine collected over 24-h expressed relative to creatinine can be used as a compliance monitor  but unless the supplement generates a unique catabolite there is a possibility that the consumption of for example coffee or tea whether approved or not can invalidate the compliance assess- ment by yielding the same catabolites.

Note however that at least some of these catabolites including protocatechuic and vanillic acids bind to human serum albumin  and this might affect their potencyin vivo.There has been limited investigation of mixtures of polyphe- nolic catabolites.

equol urolithins and nasutins mammalian lignans hydroxyanthranilic acid certain catabolites are common to many of the major substrates implying that the spectrum of catabolites produced is less complex and qualitatively less variable than theTable 1Comparison of plasma and colon catabolite concentrations in volunteers compared to concentrations shown to be effective in in vitro.Notes aDose given equivalent to ca two cups of coffee.

Some catabolites have been recorded in plasma of volunteers at concentrations similar to those shown to be effective in in vitro studies suggesting that some benefit may be achieved in vivo by diets yield- ing such catabolites.c 2017 Elsevier Inc.
