many of the catabolites are well absorbed from the colon and appear in the plasma either similarly conjugated or as glycine conjugates or in some cases unchanged.although many polyphenol catabolites have been identified in human plasma andor urine the exact pathways from substrate to final microbial catabolite and the species of bacteria and enzymes involved are still scarcely reported.

the second group are those substrates associated with unique catabolites and the third group consists of some structurally diverse substrates that never- theless yield essentially the same set of catabolites this latter group predominating see  .

many of these unique catabolites have received considerable attention but their precursors are minor components of the diet albeit with some considerable variation between subgroups  depending upon whether they consume significant amounts of oranges  olive oil  soya beans  nuts pomegranates strawberries and raspberries  whole grains  wine and peanuts or oats  respectively.the predominant catabolites generated by the microbiota frompolyphenols are the aromatic and phenolic acids with zero to three aromatic hydroxyls or their mono- or di-methoxy analogues possessing also a sidechain of one to five carbons which might bear an aliphatic hydroxyl .

such binding would extend the period during which the micro- biota could attack such substrates potentially increasing the yield of catabolites and the area under the concentration-time curve for these catabolites in plasma.volunteer studies of typical real world repeated consumption would if available circumvent the lack of data for intravenous dos- ing but in their absence we performed a simple additive modelling using real data from a single dose study in order to obtain an indi- cation of the potential concentrations that might be attained.

this result confirmed earlier studies by this research group which showed increases in bifidobacteria and excretion of anthocyanin catabolites syringic p-coumaric gallic acids and pyrogallol and flavanol catabolites hydrox- yphenylvalerolactones .

it has been suggested that analysis of gut microbiota catabolites in urine collected over 24-h expressed relative to creatinine can be used as a compliance monitor  but unless the supplement generates a unique catabolite there is a possibility that the consumption of for example coffee or tea whether approved or not can invalidate the compliance assess- ment by yielding the same catabolites.

note however that at least some of these catabolites including protocatechuic and vanillic acids bind to human serum albumin  and this might affect their potencyin vivo.there has been limited investigation of mixtures of polyphe- nolic catabolites.

equol urolithins and nasutins mammalian lignans hydroxyanthranilic acid certain catabolites are common to many of the major substrates implying that the spectrum of catabolites produced is less complex and qualitatively less variable than thetable 1comparison of plasma and colon catabolite concentrations in volunteers compared to concentrations shown to be effective in in vitro.notes adose given equivalent to ca two cups of coffee.

some catabolites have been recorded in plasma of volunteers at concentrations similar to those shown to be effective in in vitro studies suggesting that some benefit may be achieved in vivo by diets yield- ing such catabolites.c 2017 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.contentspolyphenols covered and main classes24absorption into the bloodstream25conversion of polyphenols by the gut microbiota27pharmacokinetic consequences of multiple doses28prebiotic effects30effects of catabolites33summary conclusions and recommendations for future research33acknowledgements35references35polyphenols covered and main classespolyphenols are a large group of compounds synthesised by plants for a variety of functions such as protection against uv corresponding author.e-mail address g. williamson.radiation mechanical damage and microbial infection .

some unab- sorbed substrate and catabolites are voided in the faeces.

in rats 80 of the microbiota-catalysed catabolites of radiolabelled procyanidin b2 were absorbed .conversion of polyphenols by the gut microbiotain the last decade there have been major advances in defining the composition of the gut microbiota with greatly increased use of methods based on the detection and sequencing of 16s rdna and maldi-tof ms replacing conventional culture methods but these diverse approaches remain complementary with more tradi- tional methods required to determine microbiota functionality .

the avenan- thramides of oats n-cinnamoyl conjugates of anthranilic acids yield some unique catabolites e.g.

there are several catabolites for example some mandelic and phenylhydracrylic acids for which the origin remains uncertain.although the microbiota-mediated transformation of dietary polyphenols is generally considered to occur in the colon studies in vitro using ileostomy fluid establish that some transformation can be expected to occur in the small intestine .

the concentration of microbiota catabolites are often much higher than the parent compounds.

relative quantification is based on peak area corrected for the internal standard.few data on the human pharmacokinetics of intravenous doses particularly for the gut flora catabolites which are needed for such modelling.
