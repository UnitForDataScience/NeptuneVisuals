To determine the species in the blue-shaded lattice top a species in the black shaded area underneath is randomly selected with probability p. A new additional species joins with probability 1-p.intestine.

For example when we assumed that the probability of proliferation of 197 of the species was half that of the other 3 species in the initial 200 species in the simulation the CRADs obtained under this simulation had much shallower gradient than those in the simulation with a uniform growth rate and were similar to the values observed for the antibiotic-treated mouse gut microbiome .

The solid line and the dashed line represent the simulation results for p  1.0 with 100 initial species and p  0.999 with 200 initial species respectively.

Our model indicated that the CRAD may be determined by the ratio of emerging to pre-existing species during non-uniform spatially competitive proliferation independent of species composition.Computer Science Laboratories Inc. provided support in the form of salary for author H.T.

For the immigration probability 1-p we considered that a new additional species also immigrated to the lattice point simultaneous with the existing species.

These data imply that species that are sensitive and tolerant to antibiotics have different growth rates under an antibiotic treatment resulting in the altered proliferation in which only limited or biased species participated which may differ from the proliferation process for the samples of the human infant feces and mouse small intestines with small b values.

Black boxplots represent the CRADs in the simulation with p  1 where the growth rate of 197 of the 200 species was set to half that of the other 3 species.

This property of our model would generate a random change in the ranking of the resulting abundant species even if similar species are involved in the initial stages of proliferation which is concordant with the high interindividual variability observed in the gut microbiome even for monozygotic twins .

The structure of the gut microbiome is influenced by individual lifestyle including dietary habits and host physiology including disease resulting in a high degree of interindividual variability in species richness and abundance -.

The figures show cumulative distribution plots of relative abundance which is equivalent to the rank-frequency plot by exchanging the vertical and hor- izontal axes as the rank is given by the product of the total number of species and the cumula- tive distribution value.
