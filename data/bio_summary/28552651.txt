More- over changes in food preferences and in the desire to eat are often reported after bariatric surgery which generally comprise a shift toward less energy-dense foods .Taxonomic and functional alterations in the gut microbiota associated with bariatric surgeryWhether in humans or in murine models it has been widely demonstrated that bariatric surgical procedures are associated with major changes in the composition of the gut microbiota   changes were observed as soon as 3 months after surgery and were sustained for up to 1 year .

However long-term follow-up studies con- sistently report that bariatric surgery rather diminishes the risk for major adverse cardiac events  strongly suggesting that the protective outcomes of bariatric surgery outweigh any potential det- rimental effect arising from increased circulating TMAO.Another important microbial function that has been reported to increase after bariatric surgery is putrescine transport  which reflects changes in the ability of the gut bacteria to break down amino acids to yield polyamines .

Similarly looking at the intestinal physiol- ogy of patients after bariatric surgery may give us insights into novel treatments against IBDs because both conditions are associated with major increases in Proteobacteria in the gut microbiota whereas no debilitating gut inflammation is seen in patients after bariatric surgery.

To date Tremaroli et al have reported the only comparison between the gut microbiota-related effects of RYGB and LSG which exposes the need for more studies compar- ing RYGB LSG and biliopancreatic diversion in order to better under- stand the gut microbial contribution to the beneficial effects of these bariatric surgery techniques.Taxonomic changesTwo groups reported increased bacterial species richness in the gut microbiota of subjects post-RYGB versus obese controls a finding that is consistent with an improved host metabolic profile because gut microbial diversity is a recognized biomarker of theTable 2Functional alterations in the gut microbiota after bariatric surgeryhost's health status .

This last finding seems to be at odds with the demon- stration that the FXR whole-body knockout mice are resistant to the beneficial effects of LSG  which exposes the need for further investigation using tissue-specific knockout models and the analy- sis of the FXR pathway in humans after bariatric surgery.ResultsLimitations in the methods applied to assess the impact of bariatric surgery on gut microbiotaThe studies described in and used methodolo- gies based on taxa-targeted qPCR or metagenomics 16S rRNA gene- based analysis or shotgun sequencing from genomic DNA from stool samples which enables a more comprehensive understanding of shifts occurring in the structure and function of gut microbial com- munities after surgery.

Because bariatric surgery is based on drastic physiologic and anatomic changes in the gastrointestinal tract which include major shifts in gut microbial communities there is a growing interest in understanding which changes in the gut microbiota could underpin the benefits of meta- bolic surgery and lead to improved glycemic control and fat-mass loss.

For instance although E. coli Nissle 1917 is a strain used as a probiotic  the abun- dance of E. coli has been shown to be positively correlated with weight loss after bariatric surgery .Bariatric Surgery and Glycemic ControlFollowing RYGB surgery complete remission of type 2 diabe- tes is seen in approximately 80 of patients whereas another 15 have a substantial improvement but still need antidiabetes drugs to improve glycemic control .

This is evidenced by the fact that many of the metabolic benefits of RYGB are achieved by diverting bile secretion to the lower bowel and that in FXR knockout mice the ability of metabolic surgery to reduce body weight and improve glucose tolerance was consider- ably compromised .Alteration in BA flow is certainly a driver for the changes in micro- bial population after bariatric surgery however the nature of these BA-related microbial changes remains largely unknown.

and methanogenic Archae in stool samples after gastric bypass are inconsistent so it remains unclear whether the presence of these microbial species which are generally regarded as beneficial is increased or decreased by bariatric surgical procedures.Glutathione metabolismglutathione synthesis fromglutamateABC transporters in special lysinearginineornithine and histidinemicrobial amino acid uptakerhamnose D-allose and L-arabinosehhFunctional changesOnly a few reports were dedicated to evaluating functional altera- tions in the intestinal microbiome and in the meta- metabolome associated with bariatric surgery .
