The antibiotic susceptibility of the gut-isolated strains and the type strains was assessed in a broth microdilution assay green indicates gut strain less susceptible than type strain red indicates gut strain more susceptible than type strainisolated strain and more resistant to chloramphenicol kanamycin and rifampicin.

terrigena type strain was more resistant than the gut strain to chlorampheni- col and more susceptible than the gut strain to kanamy- cin and tetracycline.There were no differences in potato leaf extract suscep- tibility between the gut isolates and type strains of En.

The St. epidermidis gut-isolated strain was more resistant to ampicillin and less resistant to kanamycin than the type strain and the St. warneri gut-isolated strain was moreTable 3 The susceptibility of the bacteria isolated from insect guts and corresponding type strains to the plant extractsInsect speciesFood plantBacterial speciesZone of inhibition mmCrude leafCrude flowerCrude rootHPLC fractionThe values were obtained in a disc diffusion assay the discs carried 10 mg dried extract the assay was repeated three timesresistant to ciprofloxacin than the type strain.

Secondly the gut-isolated strain can be more resistant than the type strain and finally the type strain can be more antibiotic-resistant than the gut strain.

The large number of cases where the type strain was more antibiotic- resistant than the gut-isolated strain was unexpected.There were no differences in ragwort extract suscepti- bility between the gut-isolated strain and type strain of Ba.

asburiae type strain is a clinical isolate and it was the only type strain tested that was more resistant than the gut strain to every antibiotic in the panel.

The St. epidermidis insect strain was more resistant to lavender flower extract than the type strain and the M. foliorum type strain was more resistant to lavender leaf extract than the insect-isolated strain.Generally only a low level of antibacterial activity was detected in lavender and the flower extract tended to be more active than the leaf extract.

multivorum was more susceptible to tetra- cycline than the type strain perhaps unsurprisingly as the type strain is a clinical isolate.We assessed the extract from eucalyptus leaves for its ability to inhibit the growth of the three bacterial species isolated from the gut of individual number 1 Table No differences in plant extract susceptibility were ob- served for Ba.

The strains obtained were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ATCC 23350 Bacillus aquimaris DSM 16205 Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580 Bacillus vietnamensis DSM 18898 Burkholderia fungorum CIP 107096 T Enterobacter asburiae ATCC 35953 Kocuria rhizophila ATCC BAA-50 Microbacter- ium foliorum DSM 12966 Microbacterium gubbeenense DSM 15944 Microbacterium oxydans DSM 20578 Microbacterium paraoxydans DSM 15019 Pantoea agglomerans ATCC 27155 Pseudomonas putida ATCC 12633 Raoultella terrigena ATCC 33257 Rhizobium pusense DSM 22668 Rhodococcus erythropolis ATCC 4277 Sanguibacter keddieii ATCC 51767 Sphingobacter- ium multivorum ATCC 33613 Staphylococcus epidermi- dis ATCC 14990 and Staphylococcus warneri ATCC 27836 the origin of each strain is given in Additional file Table S1.Antibiotic susceptibility testingAssayThe minimal inhibitory concentrations MIC for ampicillin chloramphenicol ciprofloxacin kanamycin rifampicin and tetracycline were determined by broth microdilution for each gut-isolated strain and type strain pair.

Addition- ally the St. warneri type strain was more resistant to rifampicin and tetracycline than the gut strain.
