The gut microbiota can be considered a distinct organ with endocrine properties gut microbiota is involved through a tight molecular interplay with the host organism in the homeostasis of host organism energy and in stimulating of its immune system Clarke et al.

Graphs are displayed as mean - SEM.TABLE 1  Associations from linear models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the Aorta.TABLE 1  ContinuedIn each of the models the associations are reported as absolute difference b with 95 Confidence Intervals CI in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

Briefly CD4 and CD8 T cells were identified from the CD45 lymphocyte populations whereas to study the myeloid lineage CD11b subpopulation was further analyzed for Ly6G cells neutrophils CD11bCD11c cellsTABLE 2  Associations from linear regression models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the heart.In each of the models the associations are reported as absolute difference b with 95 Confidence Intervals CI in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

Interestingly we have identified with databankTABLE 3  Associations from linear regression models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the adipose tissue.TABLE 3  ContinuedIL-17IL-12IL-6b 95 CIb 95 CIb 95 CIIL-17IL-12IL-6 b 95 CIb 95 CIb 95 CIActinobacteria-1.6-1.6-1.9-3.4 0.1-2.9 -0.4-4.1 0.2p  0.065p  0.020p  0.071Multi-affiliation-0.8-0.6-0.7-1.8 0.2-1.5 0.3-2.1 0.7p  0.111p  0.157p  0.252R2  0.321R2  0.264R2  0.182Confidence Intervals CI in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

Therefore the most striking result of our metagenomic analyses in gut microbiota composition between the MSL and MHO mimicking diets PD and HD respectively is the preponderance of Bacteroidia and Verrucomicrobia in PD compared to HD and control ND.Association of Gut Microbiota Profile with Adaptive Immune FactorsWe then sought to explore correlation between changes in gut microbiota composition with the over-responses of the adaptive immune system in mice irrespective of the diet administered using linear regression.

Generally Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia are not abundant in the healthy gut but abundant in the gut dysbiosis of patients with type 2 diabetes or with inflammatory bowel disease IBD Larsen et al.

Our results are completely in line with the above reportsTABLE 5  Associations from linear regression models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the spleen.In each of the models the associations are reported as absolute difference b with 95 Confidence Intervals CI in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

Altered gut microbial ecosystems are associated with the metabolic syndrome occurring in most obese individuals.
