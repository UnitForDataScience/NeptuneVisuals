in this respect an immune system-gut microbiota cooperation which operates at optimal levels is instrumental for setting protective mechanisms against pathogenic agents and at the same time for keeping in check the regulatory pathways implicated in the avoidance of triggering immune responses to harmless antigens belkaid and hand 2014. this reciprocal interaction involves both innate thaiss et al.

2009. although it has been suggested that dysbiosis can cause immune dysfunctions by activating b and t cells regardless of their distance from the location of their induction honda and littman 2016 there is scarce knowledge on the relationship between distinct immune cell populations more in particular those belonging to the adaptive immunity and the heterogeneity of digestive system-residing and symbiotic bacteria.here we modeled the metabolic and clinical features of msl and mho humans in c57bl6 mice fed for 20 weeks with a chow diet a high fat obesogenic but not inflammatory diet mimicking healthy obesity or a hypercholesteraemic pro-atherogenic low fat diet paigen diet mimicking systemic inflammation andfatty liver in the lean subjects getz and reardon 2006 under the same housing environment.

in each of the models the associations between each bacterial taxa and adaptive immune system parameters were reported as absolute difference b with 95 confidence intervals ci in immune system parameters levels by  of increase in the proportion of the bacterial taxa.

graphs are displayed as mean - sem.table 1  associations from linear models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the aorta.table 1  continuedin each of the models the associations are reported as absolute difference b with 95 confidence intervals ci in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

altogether these data indicate that pd triggers prominent features of metabolic syndrome and inflammation in mice in absence of weight gain compared to obesogenic hd.dissecting diet-dependent intra-tissue adaptive immune changescells of the innate immune system in particular macrophages mediate chronic inflammation sell et al.

2012. moreover b and t lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system have been recently recognized as important modulators of glucose homeostasis indicating that antigen-driven immune responses could influence insulin resistance.

2015. moreover it is known since 1980 that t lymphocyte subsets and related cytokines are present in atherosclerotic lesions and affect their development lichtman 2013. here to analyze the changes of adaptive immunity between msl and mho we analyzed t cell populations from the blood and the spleen secondary lymphoid organ from the heart and the aorta cardiovascular tissue from the liver and from the adipose tissue metabolic and nutrient hubs of nd pd and hd-fed mice using the flow cytometry gating strategydepicted in figure 2. briefly cd4 and cd8 t cells were identified from the cd45 lymphocyte populations whereas to study the myeloid lineage cd11b subpopulation was further analyzed for ly6g cells neutrophils cd11bcd11c cellstable 2  associations from linear regression models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the heart.in each of the models the associations are reported as absolute difference b with 95 confidence intervals ci in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

interestingly we have identified with databanktable 3  associations from linear regression models between gut microbiota and alterations of adaptive immune system parameters measured in the adipose tissue.table 3  continuedil-17il-12il-6b 95 cib 95 cib 95 ciil-17il-12il-6 b 95 cib 95 cib 95 ciactinobacteria-1.6-1.6-1.9-3.4 0.1-2.9 -0.4-4.1 0.2p  0.065p  0.020p  0.071multi-affiliation-0.8-0.6-0.7-1.8 0.2-1.5 0.3-2.1 0.7p  0.111p  0.157p  0.252r2  0.321r2  0.264r2  0.182confidence intervals ci in immune system parameters levels by 1 unit increase in gut microbiota.

therefore the most striking result of our metagenomic analyses in gut microbiota composition between the msl and mho mimicking diets pd and hd respectively is the preponderance of bacteroidia and verrucomicrobia in pd compared to hd and control nd.association of gut microbiota profile with adaptive immune factorswe then sought to explore correlation between changes in gut microbiota composition with the over-responses of the adaptive immune system in mice irrespective of the diet administered using linear regression.
