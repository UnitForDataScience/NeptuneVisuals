Among all the isolates the strains Vibrio kanaloae RA1 Pseudoalteromonas distinct RA8 Pseudoalteromonas prydzensis RA15 and Staphylococcus warneri RA18 isolated from the rhizosphere of A. macrostachyum and the strains 0025-326Xc 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of bacteria isolated from the microbiome of A. macrostachyum in its metal uptake capacityand tolerance to metal excess.Material and methodsPlant and sediment sourceSeeds of A. macrostachyum and samples of the first 15 cm of sedi- ment around the plants were collected in March 2015 from the Odiel marshes 37deg15'N 6deg58'W SW Spain and subsequently transported to the laboratory.

Thus we employed a consortium with bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere CR of A. macrostachyum integrated by the strains Vibrio kanaloae RA1 Pseudoalteromonas dis- tinct RA8 Pseudoalteromonas prydzensis RA15 and Staphylococcus warneri RA18 and a consortium with four endophytic strains CE two isolated from plant phyllosphere Kushneria marisflavi EAod3 and Micrococcus aloeverae EAod10 and two from roots of A. macrostachyum Bacillus vietnamensis EAR8 and Halomonas zincidurans EAR18.

In October 2015 after four months of A. macrostachyum plant growth under glasshouse conditions described above the perlite of A. macrostachyum plants was washed off and plants were transferred to individual 250 mL plastic pots one plant per pot and each pot was placed in an individual shallow tray filled with a homogenate of Odiel sediment.

Different letters indicate means that are significantly different from each other P b 0.05.photosynthetic carbon assimilation of A. macrostachyum plants grown in bioaugmented sediments.Furthermore other physiological effect recorded in this study was the differential modulation of the antioxidant responses of A. macrostachyum plants grown in bioaugmentated sediments.

So it is possible as we previously indicat- ed that in certain degree the metals inside of roots could be sequestered by endophytic bacteria avoiding its interaction with essential metabolic processes of A. macrostachyum plants however this area deserves fur- ther research.ConclusionWe can conclude that sediment bioaugmentation with appropriate PGPB isolated from the microbiome of A. macrostachyum plants con- tribute to improve its phytoremediation efficiency.

A. macrostachyum plants were randomly assigned to three bioaugmentation treatments CE CR and without inoculation during 120 days.

Bioaugmentation with both bacterial consortia en- hanced A. macrostachyum capacity to accumulate ions in its roots while shoot ions concentration only increased with CE treatment.

These findings indicated that bacteria selected from the microbiome can be claimed to improve A. macrostachyum metal remediation efficiency.c 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
