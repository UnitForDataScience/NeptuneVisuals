Early efforts to describe microbial roles in CRS resulted in the fungal hypothesis which suggested that CRS resulted from an overexuberant host response to Alternaria fungi.40 While this theory does not explain many of the defects observed in CRS and current guidelines recommend against antifungal therapy for CRS patients there is continued research interest in the fungal microbiome.41 Recent studies using sequencing of the fungal 18S ribosomal RNA gene demonstrate a rich and diverse population of commensal fungal taxa in middle meatal lavages from healthy and CRS patients.

Restoring community function in the healthy state is a primary microbiome goal just as restoring mucociliary function has been a functional goal in the management of CRS.6A general approach to antibiotic therapy for refractory CRSCurrent guidelines for antibiotics in CRSAlthough sinonasal saline irrigation and topical corticosteroids are the mainstays of medical therapy for CRS current clinical practice guidelines do recommend the routine use of antibiotics.104 105 If purulence is present on examination in a CRS patient short-term culture directed therapy has been recommended.106 107 108 In CRSwNP patients that experience an acute exacerbation or persistent symptoms of CRS a short course of systemic corticosteroid therapy remains the standard of care with the best early and long-term improvement in polyp scores109 although doxycycline may have a role in the patients as well110 Current clinical practice guidelines recommend consideration of long-term macrolide therapy such as clarithromycin 250-500mg daily roxithromycin 150mg daily or azithromycin 500mg weekly for 3 months in patients with CRSsNP only as patients with nasal polyps did not benefit from long-term macrolide therapy when compared with placebo.111 112 104 The routine use of antibiotics in CRS when acute infection is not present has been recently called into question given the cost and potential harms of antibiotic use when the effectiveness of this therapy is not clear.113Bacteria good bad or just thereIncreasing data suggest that diverse bacterial communities are important for maintaining human health although much of our current CRS therapy is non-specific and potentially eradicates large groups of both commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

Binding of the antigen-MHC complex to the T-cell receptor activates the adaptive immune system and leads to longer lasting T-effector cells and antibody producing plasma cells.21While much attention is given to defective innate immunity in the development of CRS the adaptive immune system is crucial for developing an appropriate T-cell response and much of the CRS literature supports polarized populations of T-follicular helper cells either Th1 or Th2 in subsets of CRS.

For example decreased diversity in the gut microbiome is associated with obesity active inflammatory bowel disease and psoriatic arthritis.55-57 Although we lack data to suggest that promoting bacterial diversity within the sinonasal niche would prevent or improve CRS this may be a relevant consideration moving forwardVickery and RamakrishnanPage 7since the mainstays of CRS therapy are long-term broad spectrum antibiotics and corticosteroids which carry the potential to alter the microbiome composition.5859Are microbiome alterations a cause or by-product of diseaseRecent cross-sectional population studies have detected differences in the microbiome between CRS patients and healthy individuals but what does this really mean One possibility is that community alterations in the microbiome lead to epithelial barrier and immune dysfunction resulting in disease.

Such studies are critical to determining the role of the microbiome in disease formation chronicity severity and prognosis and response to therapies.Clinical implications and treatment considerations of bacterial pathogensPathogens often implicated in CRSTraditional culture-based study vs. molecular techniques--Many culture-based studies of sinus specimens from CRS patients identify the most common pathogens associated with CRS as S. aureus P. aeruginosa and with specialized culture techniques several species of anaerobes.61-64 The bacterial pathogens implicated in CRS are distinct from those most often identified in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis ABRS.

Just as CRS is thought to be multifactorial incidence of ABRS may be higher in the setting of particular environmental exposures allergies smoking ciliary impairment sinonasal anatomic variations and transient bacterial infections.65-67 However the most often identifiedVickery and RamakrishnanPage 8bacteria cultured in patients with ABRS are S. pneumoniae H. influenzae S. pyrogenes M. catarrhalis and S aureus.68Patients with refractory CRS often demonstrate both cellular and humoral immune dysfunction as described above69 and in these cases the most commonly isolated pathogens are S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.6364 Patients with CRS have a higher incidence of antibiotic-resistance this observation is especially notable in patients undergoing revision endoscopic sinus surgery ESS when compared to patients undergoing surgery for the first time.

To date there has been one randomized controlled trial examining the utility of probiotics in CRS which did not find any benefit.102 Murine models have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the utility of introducing competing bacteria into the sinonasal milieu of infectious CRS using S. epidermidis as a probiotic niche-occupier in S.aureus-induced CRS in mice.103 Prebiotics are non-nutritive fibers that when delivered into a bacterial community serve as substrates for bacteria and are thought to support the growth of desirable microbes within the community.

For instance CRS with nasal polyps CRSwNP often is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation and increased production of histamine IL-5 and IL-131 whereas CRS without nasal polyps CRSsNP is often considered a predominantly neutrophilic disease characterized by high levels of IL-1 IL-6 and TNFa.2 In practice however there are CRSsNP patients with high levels of eosinophils and CRSwNP patients that exhibit robust neutrophilic infiltration within the sinonasal epithelium.

In conjunction with beating cilia the enriched mucus layer promotes non-specific mucociliary clearance of microbes and irritant particles.4 Barrier dysfunction can contribute to CRS and when coupled with defects in mucociliary clearance that promote bacterial colonization bacterial invasion and further barrier disruption may occur.35 Classic genetic defects in ciliary function such as cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia are often used as examples but acquired ciliary dysfunction occurs in CRS as well.6 Poor barrier function and dysfunctional mucociliary clearance are host defects that to predispose individuals to pathogen colonization and the development of recurrent infection.7-9Sinonasal epithelial cells secrete enzymes opsonins defensins permeabolizing proteins and other endogenous antimicrobial products into the apical mucus layer.

Certainly chronic inflammatory diseases can result from direct bacterial invasion at mucosal surfaces resulting in compromised barrier function a coordinated innate and adaptive immune response and an acute inflammatory response which may evolve into prolonged inflammation leading to tissue damage remodeling and fibrosis.27 It is possible that in some patients bacterial infection initiates the inflammatory process that never resolves yet in others it may be the case that a non-infectious inciting event initiates an inflammatory response that alters the native mucosal surface bacterial niche which then propagates the disease once the original disease-causing event has concluded Figure 2.28 Earlier studies of sinonasal microbiota utilized culture-based microbiology techniques which have recently been usurped by nucleic acid-based molecular techniques that allow for more sensitive and less biased detection of microbes as well as the ability to characterize entire communities of microbes within the same sample.29 30 Without evidence to support a definitive role for bacterial infection as the etiology for CRS future studies are needed to better understand the role of bacteria in host susceptibility to disease development.The Paranasal Sinus Biome in Health and DiseaseThe microbiomeHost-microbe interactions are an established contributing factor in the formation of CRS but evidence for the presence or absence of a single microbe resulting in disease is lacking.
