enhancement in the plant's defense capability by primingis associated with defense gene expression de novo synthesis of prtable 1some early examples of successful priming of plants by beneficial microbes for isr-mediated defense mechanisms.treatmentsresponsereferences tomato roots colonized with mycorrhizal fungus glomus mossaefungus systemically safeguards plants against phytophthora parasiticacucumber plants previously inoculated with pgpf trichoderma asperellum t203 then infected with pseudomonas syringae pv.

several studies showed that chestnut and oaks are the main species affected in europe  as well as ornamental crops and nursery plants such as coniferous and broadleaf plants .

however a better understanding of the complex interaction between plants environment and pathogens is necessary for further exploration on this topic because it may easily fail if plants are already under high disease pressure .

all these biological control interactions be- tween plants and microbes occur naturally at a macroscopic and mi- croscopic level .throughout their life cycle plants are vulnerable to the variousenvironmental challenges of abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought herbivores and potentially pathogenic fungi oomycetes nematodes bacteria and viruses.

non-pathogenic rhizobacteria are capable of activating defense me- chanisms in plants in a similar way to pathogenic microorganisms in- cluding reinforcement of plant cell walls production of phytoalexins synthesis of pr proteins and primingisr .the complex isr system has been partially elucidated in several model plants including arabidopsis with three general pathways being recognized.

similar like individual plant beneficial microbes rhizosphere soil microbiomes contain a wide variety of microbes that promote plant growth through direct mechanisms by increasing the availability of nutrients to plants or by the production of various phytostimulators modulating plant hormone levels or through indirect mechanisms by acting as biocontrol agents.understanding how plants communicate will give us ideas and may help us fight diseases without the application of chemicals.

the microbiomes potentially act either as inoculants which help plants to absorb nutrients or biocontrol products that aid in protecting the plants against pests and diseases or both.

this review focusses on how biocontrol microbes modulate plant defense mechanisms deploy biocontrol actions in plants and offer new strategies to control plant pathogens.

infected plants exhibit root collar and sometimes stem ne- crosis as the primary symptoms resulting in declines and stem cankers .

the local infection with plant patho- gens can lead to systemic acquired resistance sar  but of significant interest is also the ability of beneficial non-pathogenic rhi- zobacteria to prime plants for induced systemic resistance isr against pathogens .

this priming offers a better preparedness to plants that are able to respond faster and stronger to pathogen attack.

it is one of the most attractive approaches and can be considered as an ideal method if good quality plants are adapted to the growing regions with sufficient levels of tolerance and durable resistance .

tritici using resistant wheat plants has contributed to the suppression of that disease whose infection is mainly found on stems and leaf sheaths as well as on leaf blades and glumes .

as a result every year higher costs for fungal disease control applies and higher dosages and new chemicals are introduced to protect crops and plants.
