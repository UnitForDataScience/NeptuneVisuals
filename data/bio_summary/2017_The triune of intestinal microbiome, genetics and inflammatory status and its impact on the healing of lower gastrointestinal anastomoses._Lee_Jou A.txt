A study comparing the inflammatory responses of germ-free Gf and conventional mice to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and ischaemic injury showed that Gf mice had a significantly increased lipoxin-induced production of IL-10 and a dampened inflammatory response 53.

This continues to be an area of active research but already it is emerging that genetic variation is one of the key factors in control- ling inflammatory responses to the same microbial stimulus 100 and possibly the resulting dysbiosis associated with various illnesses.The role of the host genetic make-upThe inflammatory response to injury and infection has to be carefully controlled to avoid disease states.

VIEWPOINT The triune of intestinal microbiome genetics and inflammatory status and its impact on the healing of lower gastrointestinal anastomosesJou A. Lee Timothy J.

The interaction of these three factors leads either toB healing of anastomosis with epithelial restitution resolved inflammatory responses restored mucous barriers and microbial homeostasis or to C failed healing leading to an anastomotic breakdown leakage of intestinal contents bacterial translocation and systemic sequela.

Gastroenterology 131 862-877.Souza DG Vieira AT Soares AC Pinho V Nicoli JR Vieira LQ  Teixeira MM 2004 The essential role of the intestinal microbiota in facilitating acute inflammatory responses.

This article details three aspects that we believe intertwine and therefore should be considered together in wound healing within the GIT during postsurgical recovery the microbiome the host genetic make-up and their relationship to the perioperative inflammatory status.

This can result in a range of complications such as abscesses erosion of surrounding tissues causing abnormal connections fis- tulae generalised infection of the peritoneum peri- tonitis with an accompanying systemic inflammatory response and even multiorgan failure and death.
