We investigated alterations of urinary microbiota in Chinese female T2DM patients and explored the associations between urinary microbiota and a patient's fasting blood glucose FBG urine glucose UGLU age menstrual status and body mass index BMI.

Fastidious pathogens may not lead to a UTI diagnosis because they are below the 105 CFUmL threshold but can still cause urinary disorders 4.Recent 16S rRNA sequencing results indicate that the urinary tract possesses bacteria regardless of a patient's present urinary tract symptoms 10-23.
