The level of significance was set at P o0.05 and statistical analyses were conducted using STATA SE 14.1 Houston TX USA.RESULTSThe NND compared to ADD was higher in dietary fiber 43.3 vs28.6 g10MJ higher in protein 18.1 vs 16.4 lower in fat 30.4 vs 33.8 all P o0.001 without differing in available carbohydrates 46.4 vs 45.3 P  0.081.No differences in baseline characteristics were found between individuals characterized as high and low PB all P 0.09 1.

Consequently a 2.27 kg 95 CI 0.09 4.45 P  0.041 difference in responsiveness to the diets was found between the PB groups which came from difference in response to NND P  0.04 and not ADD P  0.41 between the PB groups 2.

Among individuals with a high PB ratio the NND diet resulted in a 3.15 kg 95 CI 1.55 4.76 P o0.001 larger body fat loss compared to ADD after 26 weeks whereas no difference in body fat loss was observed between NND and ADD among individuals with low PB 0.88 kg 95 CI - 0.61 2.37 P  0.25.

The sensitivity analysis revealed larger differences 2.During the 1 year follow-up period subjects with the high PBratio changing from ADD to being recommended NND main- tained their weight -1.23 95 CI - 2.81 0.36 n  9 P  0.13 whereas subjects with the low PB ratio changing from ADD to being recommended NND regained 2.76 kg 95 CI 1.27 4.24n  11 P o0.001.

Similar differences in responsiveness to the diets were found for waist circumference 3.95 cm 95 CI 0.34 7.55 P  0.032 and were borderline significant for body weight 2.33 kg 95 CI - 0.15 4.80 P  0.065 2.

This differenceIntestinal microbial genera determine responsiveness to diets MF Hjorth et alwas 5.41 kg 95 CI 3.12 7.69 P o0.001 in the sensitivity analysis.DISCUSSIONWe identified pre-treatment PB ratio as an important biomarker associated with body fat loss in subjects consuming an ad libitum diet rich in fiber and whole grain.

This was further supported by similar findings for waist circumference and body weight.Using the entire sample of 181 subjects we have previously reported the overall weight-loss difference between the NND and ADD to be 3.2 kg.Interestingly this difference between diets could mainly be attributed to subjects with the high PB ratio and the health-promoting aspects of the NND in terms of body-weight regulation therefore mainly seems to apply in a subset of the population.Previously baseline total cholesterol has been found to be borderline higher P  0.08and LDL cholesterol to be lower among the Prevotella-driven enterotype.

Thus overweight and obese participants with high PB ratio appeared more responsive to fiber and whole grain than individuals with low PB ratio.

below the detection limit behave different than subjects in the low PB ratio group.The increased responsiveness of the high PB group to the NND rich in fruits vegetables dietary fibers and whole grains is supported by previous studies showing an association between the Prevotella-driven enterotype and a carbohydrate-based diet more typical of agrarian societies.However only two individuals switched PB ratio group during this 6-month dietary intervention with NND or ADD which is consistent with the literature581International Journal of Obesity 2018 580 - 583582Intestinal microbial genera determine responsiveness to dietsMF Hjorth et alindicating that intestinal microbial communities are resilient and difficult to change through dietary interventions unless extreme changes such as complete removal of carbohydrates from the diet are introduced.Mechanisms involved could be efficacy of energy harvest from different foodsdifferences in fiber-utilization capacitygut-brain signaling of behavior and the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones affecting appetite.Recently dietary fiber-induced improvements in post-prandial blood glucose and insulin were found to be positively associated with the abundance of Prevotella.Therefore the recent breakthrough in personalized nutrition showing the importance of pre-treatment fasting glucose and insulin to determine the optimal diet for weight managementmight also be linked to gut microbiota profiles.

However independent of the mechanisms the PB ratio may serve as a biomarker to predict future weight-loss success on specific diets.In summary we identified pre-treatment PB ratio as animportant biomarker associated with dietary body fat change on ad libitum high fiber diets.
