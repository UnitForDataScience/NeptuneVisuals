below the detection limit behave different than subjects in the low pb ratio group.the increased responsiveness of the high pb group to the nnd rich in fruits vegetables dietary fibers and whole grains is supported by previous studies showing an association between the prevotella-driven enterotype and a carbohydrate-based diet more typical of agrarian societies.however only two individuals switched pb ratio group during this 6-month dietary intervention with nnd or add which is consistent with the literature581international journal of obesity 2018 580 - 583582intestinal microbial genera determine responsiveness to dietsmf hjorth et alindicating that intestinal microbial communities are resilient and difficult to change through dietary interventions unless extreme changes such as complete removal of carbohydrates from the diet are introduced.mechanisms involved could be efficacy of energy harvest from different foodsdifferences in fiber-utilization capacitygut-brain signaling of behavior and the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones affecting appetite.recently dietary fiber-induced improvements in post-prandial blood glucose and insulin were found to be positively associated with the abundance of prevotella.therefore the recent breakthrough in personalized nutrition showing the importance of pre-treatment fasting glucose and insulin to determine the optimal diet for weight managementmight also be linked to gut microbiota profiles.

that said the enterotype of an individual has been shown to remain rather stable.a limited number of studies have related microbial enterotypes to health markers however body fat change during a randomized clinical trial is not one of them.therefore as a proxy for enterotypes we studied pre-treatment prevotella-to-bacteroides pb ratio as a prognostic marker for successful body fat loss on two diets differing greatly in dietary fiber and whole-grain content.materials and methodsin total 181 participants with increased waist circumference were randomly assigned to receive an ad libitum new nordic diet nnd or a control diet for 26 weeks of which a subgroup of 62 subjects were randomized to collect fecal samples.

the macronutrient composition of the nnd was based on nordic nutritionrecommendations whereas the control diet was designed to match the macronutrient composition of an average danish diet add.the nnd is a whole-food approach characterized by being very high in dietary fiber whole grain fruit and vegetables.for both groups food and beverages were provided from a study shop free of charge throughout the intervention period.pre-intervention fasting blood samples were drawn from where fasting glucose and insulin were analyzed.

thus individuals with a high pb ratio were more susceptible to body fat loss on a diet rich in fiber and whole grain compared to an average danish diet whereas no difference in body fat loss was observed in individuals with a low pb ratio.conflict of interestmfh yz and aa are co-inventers on a pending provisional patent application on the use of biomarkers for prediction of weight-loss responses.

microbial enterotypes inferred by the prevotella-to-bacteroides ratio remained stable during a 6-month randomized controlled diet intervention with the new nordic diet.

however independent of the mechanisms the pb ratio may serve as a biomarker to predict future weight-loss success on specific diets.in summary we identified pre-treatment pb ratio as animportant biomarker associated with dietary body fat change on ad libitum high fiber diets.

this was further supported by similar findings for waist circumference and body weight.using the entire sample of 181 subjects we have previously reported the overall weight-loss difference between the nnd and add to be 3.2 kg.interestingly this difference between diets could mainly be attributed to subjects with the high pb ratio and the health-promoting aspects of the nnd in terms of body-weight regulation therefore mainly seems to apply in a subset of the population.previously baseline total cholesterol has been found to be borderline higher p  0.08and ldl cholesterol to be lower among the prevotella-driven enterotype.

thus overweight and obese participants with high pb ratio appeared more responsive to fiber and whole grain than individuals with low pb ratio.

was associated with weight gain whereas dietary fiber intake was found partly to modify the association between microbiome diversity and weight gain.the distinction of enterotypes as discrete clusters has recently been challenged by studies suggesting that enterotype distribu- tion is continuous and that further information may be masked within these enterotype clusters.from our analysis we cannot determine specific bacterial species responsible for the dietary effects that we observe but only highlight the relative abundance of prevotella spp.

therefore it seems as if the human gut microbiota has the potential to have a pivotal role in personalized nutrition.clustering of the human gut microbiota designated entero- types was first described in 2011. the bacteroides-driven enterotype is reported to be predominant in individuals consum- ing more protein and animal fat western diet whereas the prevotella-driven enterotype appears predominant in subjects consuming more carbohydrate and fiber.

the linear mixed models included the three-way interaction between diet x time x pb group strata as well as all nested two-way interactions and main effects and comprised additional fixed effects including age gender baseline bmi baseline fasting glucose and insulin as well as random effects for subjects.
