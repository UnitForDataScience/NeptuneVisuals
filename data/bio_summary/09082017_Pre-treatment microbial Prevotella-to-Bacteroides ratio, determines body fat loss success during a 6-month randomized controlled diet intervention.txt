Thus overweight and obese participants with high PB ratio appeared more responsive to fiber and whole grain than individuals with low PB ratio.

below the detection limit behave different than subjects in the low PB ratio group.The increased responsiveness of the high PB group to the NND rich in fruits vegetables dietary fibers and whole grains is supported by previous studies showing an association between the Prevotella-driven enterotype and a carbohydrate-based diet more typical of agrarian societies.However only two individuals switched PB ratio group during this 6-month dietary intervention with NND or ADD which is consistent with the literature581International Journal of Obesity 2018 580 - 583582Intestinal microbial genera determine responsiveness to dietsMF Hjorth et alindicating that intestinal microbial communities are resilient and difficult to change through dietary interventions unless extreme changes such as complete removal of carbohydrates from the diet are introduced.Mechanisms involved could be efficacy of energy harvest from different foodsdifferences in fiber-utilization capacitygut-brain signaling of behavior and the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones affecting appetite.Recently dietary fiber-induced improvements in post-prandial blood glucose and insulin were found to be positively associated with the abundance of Prevotella.Therefore the recent breakthrough in personalized nutrition showing the importance of pre-treatment fasting glucose and insulin to determine the optimal diet for weight managementmight also be linked to gut microbiota profiles.

However independent of the mechanisms the PB ratio may serve as a biomarker to predict future weight-loss success on specific diets.In summary we identified pre-treatment PB ratio as animportant biomarker associated with dietary body fat change on ad libitum high fiber diets.

International Journal of Obesity 2018 42 580-583OPENSHORT COMMUNICATIONPre-treatment microbial Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio determines body fat loss success during a 6-month randomized controlled diet interventionMF Hjorth1 HM Roager2 TM Larsen1 SK Poulsen13 TR Licht2 MI Bahl2 Y Zohar4 and A Astrup1INTRODUCTIONThe composition of the gut microbiota in rodents has been shown to affect the efficacy of energy harvest from feedand to influence the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones affecting appetite.

That said the enterotype of an individual has been shown to remain rather stable.A limited number of studies have related microbial enterotypes to health markers however body fat change during a randomized clinical trial is not one of them.Therefore as a proxy for enterotypes we studied pre-treatment Prevotella-to-Bacteroides PB ratio as a prognostic marker for successful body fat loss on two diets differing greatly in dietary fiber and whole-grain content.MATERIALS AND METHODSIn total 181 participants with increased waist circumference were randomly assigned to receive an ad libitum New Nordic Diet NND or a control diet for 26 weeks of which a subgroup of 62 subjects were randomized to collect fecal samples.

ratio in the following designated low PB  o0.01 or high PB 40.01.

Among individuals with a high PB ratio the NND diet resulted in a 3.15 kg 95 CI 1.55 4.76 P o0.001 larger body fat loss compared to ADD after 26 weeks whereas no difference in body fat loss was observed between NND and ADD among individuals with low PB 0.88 kg 95 CI - 0.61 2.37 P  0.25.

The sensitivity analysis revealed larger differences 2.During the 1 year follow-up period subjects with the high PBratio changing from ADD to being recommended NND main- tained their weight -1.23 95 CI - 2.81 0.36 n  9 P  0.13 whereas subjects with the low PB ratio changing from ADD to being recommended NND regained 2.76 kg 95 CI 1.27 4.24n  11 P o0.001.

This differenceIntestinal microbial genera determine responsiveness to diets MF Hjorth et alwas 5.41 kg 95 CI 3.12 7.69 P o0.001 in the sensitivity analysis.DISCUSSIONWe identified pre-treatment PB ratio as an important biomarker associated with body fat loss in subjects consuming an ad libitum diet rich in fiber and whole grain.

This was further supported by similar findings for waist circumference and body weight.Using the entire sample of 181 subjects we have previously reported the overall weight-loss difference between the NND and ADD to be 3.2 kg.Interestingly this difference between diets could mainly be attributed to subjects with the high PB ratio and the health-promoting aspects of the NND in terms of body-weight regulation therefore mainly seems to apply in a subset of the population.Previously baseline total cholesterol has been found to be borderline higher P  0.08and LDL cholesterol to be lower among the Prevotella-driven enterotype.
