in this study we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of the phylum proteobacteria induced by cs disaccharides from 3.10 -2.20 sd in healthy mice to 1.03 -0.41 sd in the healthy mice supplemented with cs disaccharides absolute log10 lda value  4.096. a similar cs disaccharide-induced reduction was also observed in the stressed mice and the abundance of proteobacteria was decreased from 1.98 in the stressed mice to 1.44 in the stressed mice with cs supplementation.

for example butyrate levels were increased over 2-fold by cs disaccharides from 0.35mmog in the stressed mice to 1.16 mmolg in the stressed mice supplemented with cs disaccharides p  0.01. while the supplement also tended to increase butyrate in the feces of healthy mice the effect was less apparent.at least 10 genera known to harbor butyrate-producing bacteria anaerofustis anaerostipes anaerotruncus butyricimonas cloacibacterium clostridium coprococcus faecalibacterium megasphaera and roseburia were detected in murine fecal microbiome in our dataset.

after a 7-day acclimation period mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups healthy controls  pbs n exhaustive exercise  pbs m healthy mice supplemented with cs disaccharides cs and exhaustive exercise mice supplemented with cs disaccharides s. in the following 16 days the n and m groups were given an oral administration of normal saline pbs once a day.

intriguingly the stressed mice supplemented with cs disaccharides for 16 days had a significant increase in both villus length p  0.01 and vc ratio p  0.05. cs disaccharides supplementation was able to restore repressed villus length from 707.4 um in the stressed mice to the baseline level observed in the healthymice 1062.6 um p  0.05 suggesting that cs disaccharides may have potential to increase intestinal absorption.as fig.

another enzyme n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase ec3.5.1.28 k01447 was increased by cs disaccharides under both conditions.under healthy condition the hits assigned to amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism fructose and mannose metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism were significantly higher in the mice supplemented with cs disaccharides than the mice received pbs only.

for example the data from the mice lacking n-acetygalactosaminyltransferase i a key enzyme in cs biosynthesis demonstrate that this gene is necessary for endochondral ossification and the knockout mice recover more completely from spinal cord injury than wild type mice.
