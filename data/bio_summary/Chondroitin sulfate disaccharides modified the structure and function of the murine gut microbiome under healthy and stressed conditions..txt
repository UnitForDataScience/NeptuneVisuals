After a 7-day acclimation period mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups Healthy controls  PBS N Exhaustive exercise  PBS M Healthy mice supplemented with CS disaccharides CS and Exhaustive exercise mice supplemented with CS disaccharides S. In the following 16 days the N and M groups were given an oral administration of normal saline PBS once a day.

In this study we observed a significant reduction in the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria induced by CS disaccharides from 3.10 -2.20 sd in healthy mice to 1.03 -0.41 sd in the healthy mice supplemented with CS disaccharides absolute log10 LDA value  4.096.

For example butyrate levels were increased over 2-fold by CS disaccharides from 0.35mmog in the stressed mice to 1.16 mmolg in the stressed mice supplemented with CS disaccharides P  0.01.
