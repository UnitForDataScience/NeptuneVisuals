DOI 10.1111hel.12422EDIT ORIAL 30th anniversary of the European helicobacter  microbiota study groupIt is a big step for those who in 1987 followed the path opened by Barry Marshall and Robin Warren 5 years earlier They were young and enthusiastic enough to create a European group ded- icated to the new bacterium Helicobacter pylori.

The concept that most diseases of the stomach were indeed the consequence of an infection has really been a breakthrough and changed the paradigm in this area of Medicine.Research on H. pylori which is rich with more than 40000 published articles has also opened new fields in other areas such as taxonomy where H. pylori can be considered as the leader of the microaerophilic bacteria named Epsilonproteobacteria diag- nosis with the development for the first time of a test based on nonradioactive isotopes the urea breath test and even outside Medicine where H. pylori as a man follower is being now consid- ered as an important tool to decipher routes of migration of Homo sapiens out of Africa.Another important discovery occurring later is the role of our other bacteria which are present in the whole gut This group of billions of living organisms is now considered as an organ per se with many conse- quences on our physiology and sometimes pathology.

It was therefore logical that our group includes them in its field of investigation given that the outcome of H. pylori in the stomach as well as the impact of antibiotic therapies in the gut is indeed dependent on these bacteria.The 30th Congress of the EHMSG is back in Bordeaux where it was organized for the first time in 1988.

Our group is happy to provide you with the most significant update in the area of H. pylori infections and gut microbiota.
