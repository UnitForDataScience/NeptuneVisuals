however over the past decade studies employing high-throughput sequenc- ing methods have identified diverse microbial communities in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.34 more recent con- ceptual models of pneumonia pathogenesis postulate that over- growth of a single bacterial species within the respiratory tract is a function of complex interactions between the microbiota poten- tial pneumonia pathogens and the host immune system.4 in par- ticular the nasopharyngeal microbiota provides a barrier to colo- nization and invasion by bacterial respiratory pathogens through competition for nutrients production of inhibitory substances and modulation of the local immune response.56 thus the composi- tion of the nasopharyngeal microbiota may influence pneumonia risk and also provide insight into pneumonia pathogenesis and etiology.

a lower abundance of the commensal genus dolosigranulum may contribute to the higher pneumonia risk of hiv-infected children.key words microbiota microbial communities respiratory infections pneumonia childrenpediatr infect dis j 201736e211-e218neumonia is the leading infectious killer of children account- ing for roughly 920000 child deaths each year.1 more than 99 of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries and nearly half are in sub-saharan africa.2 historically the lower respiratory tract was believed to be sterile with pneumonia result- ing from the invasion of the lung by a single pathogen.

similarly we found that the haemophilus-dominant and staphylococcus-dominant biotypes were also more frequent in children with pneumonia consistent with culture-based studies that previously established bacteria from these genera h. influen- zae and staphylococcus aureus as common causes of pneumonia in african children.2223 in contrast the moraxella-dominant bio- type was associated with uri symptoms but not pneumonia.

thisconflicts with findings from a recent study conducted in australia in which moraxella was more strongly associated with pneumonia than uri when identified using molecular methods.6 however our results are consistent with culture-based studies that suggest that moraxella species are infrequent causes of pneumonia in african children and children from other developed countries.22-25 interest- ingly nasopharyngeal microbial diversity did not differ between healthy children and children with either pneumonia or uri symp- toms after excluding children who had received antibiotics in the preceding 7 days.

pathogens from these genera escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were common causes of pneumonia in a study of south african children and were only identified in chil- dren with hiv infection or exposure.22 in botswana oropharyn- geal colonization with gram-negative bacteria was also frequent in healthy hiv-exposed infants particularly those who were formulae216  c 2017 wolters kluwer health inc. all rights reserved.table 2. association of nasopharyngeal microbiota biotypes with disease status in multivariable modelsanalysiscrude or95 cipadjusted or95 cipchildren with pneumonia vs. healthy childrencorynebacteriumdolosigranulum- dominant1reference--1reference--children with uri symptoms vs. healthy childrencorynebacteriumdolosigranulum- dominant1reference--1reference--children with pneumonia vs. children with uri symptomscorynebacteriumdolosigranulum- dominant1reference--1reference--ors and 95 cis estimated from logistic regression models adjusting for season enrollment year age sex hiv infection or exposure current breastfeeding household use of wood as a cooking fuel pcv-13 doses antibiotic use in the prior 7 d and detection of one or more respiratory viruses.feeding.29 consistent with this observation the vast majority of hiv-infected 79 and hiv-eu 97 children in our study were formula-fed.

moreover although we observed nasopharyngeal overrepresentation of genera containing common pneumonia pathogens in children with pneumonia we were unable to definitively determine pneumonia etiology given the lack of lower respiratory tract samples.

we then used multivariable logistic regression to examine whether microbiota biotypes were associated with pneumonia and upper respiratory infection symptoms.results mean ages of children with pneumonia children with upper respiratory infection symptoms and healthy children were 8.2 11.4 and8.0 months respectively.

in children with pneumonia hiv infec- tion was associated with a lower relative abundance of dolosigranulum p  0.03.conclusions pneumonia and upper respiratory infection symptoms are associated with distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota biotypes in african children.

to date no studies investigated associations between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and respiratory infections in africanchildren.in this study we used nasopharyngeal samples from chil- dren with pneumonia children with upper respiratory infection uri symptoms and healthy children in botswana to assess whether pneumonia and uri symptoms are associated with spe- cific alterations of the nasopharyngeal microbiota.

gaborone the capital and largest city of bot- swana is located in the country's south-east district and had a population of 231626 in 2011.8study populationwe conducted prospective cohort and case-control studies of pneumonia between april 2012 and june 2016 as described elsewhere in detail.910 briefly we recruited children 1-23 months of age with pneumonia defined by the world health organization as a cough or difficult breathing with lower chest wall indraw- ing at a tertiary hospital in gaborone.11 we enrolled these children within 6 hours of the triage time in the emergency department and collected a nasopharyngeal swab at enrollment.

although we matched controls to pneumonia cases by date within 2 weeks and primary care clinic the analyses presented herein were not limited to matched case-control pairs but rather included all pneumonia cases and controls enrolled between april 2012 and april 2014 for which sufficient nasopharyngeal swab specimen was available.

we evaluated the validity of this assumption by comparing the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with pneumonia who did not receive antibiot- ics before nasopharyngeal swab collection with the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with pneumonia who were started on antibi- otics less than 12 hours before nasopharyngeal swab collection.

compared with healthy children children with pneumonia had higher relative abun- dances of haemophilus p  0.0001 streptococcus p  0.0001 escherichia p  0.03 and klebsiella p  0.02 and lower relative abundances of corynebacterium p  0.0001 and dolosigranulum p  0.0005. among children with pneumonia we observed differ- ences in nasopharyngeal microbial composition by hiv exposure status fig.

this indicates that there are changes in the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in children with pneumonia or uri symptoms that reflect the disease state and occur independent of the effect of res- piratory virus infection.we did not identify an association between nasopharyn- geal microbiota biotype and hiv infection or exposure in children with or without pneumonia.
