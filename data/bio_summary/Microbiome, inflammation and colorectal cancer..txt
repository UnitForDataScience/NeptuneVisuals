we now have evidence to suggest the following four ways by which bacteria contribute to the development of crc 1 loss of surface barrier function on colorectal tumors leads to commensal bacteria-in- duced tumor-promoting inflammation 2 pathobiotic and pathogenic bacteria promote the onset of colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis 3 bacteria that carry genotoxic markers promote accumulation of genetic lesions in intestinal epithelial cells and 4 alterations in bac- terial composition or metabolism regulate the process of colonic tumor development .

it remains unclear whether these pathobiotic bacteria also play a major tumor-promoting role after the onset of colorectal tumors or whether commensal bac- terial population as a whole contribute to this process since the lack of surface barrier on colonic tumors allows the infiltration of bacteria and their degradative products to tumor stroma regardless of the presence or absence of virulent factors.genotoxic bacteria promote the transformation of colorectal epithelial cellsenterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive intestinal commensal that produces extracellular superoxide.

induction of colorectal adenomas by pathobiotic andor geno- toxic bacteria results in the disruption of surface barrier function which allows for the influx of otherwise harmless commensal bacteria and their products into the tumor stroma and further escalates the severity of tumor-associated inflammation in what can be described as a driver passenger model of bacterial colonization to colorectal cancers primary colonizers are able to attach to and invade gut surface using bacteria toxins.

colonization of germ-free apcmin-il10-- mice with commensals of specific-pathogen free spf mice resulted in increased tumor burden demonstrating the general tumor-promoting effects of commensal bacteria in colorectal cancer .it is now clear that barrier defect resulted in colonic tumorigenesis promotes crc progression by the exacerbation of tumor-associated inflammation.

il-23 in turn promotes crc development by activating the production of il-17a il-6 and il-22 .treatment of crc-bearing mice with a cocktail of broad spectrum antibiotics results in decreased il-23 and il-17a expression and leads to a reduction in colorectal tumor load in wild type mice but not in il- 23r-deficient mice .

other potential cancer-impacting bacteria include sulfido- genic bacteria that are associated with hydrogen sulfide production and increased risk of ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer .in addition to these pathobiotic bacteria that induce tissue in-flammation and crc in an opportunistic manner pathogenic salmonella infection in humans can also be chronic and may promote colitis-as- sociated colorectal cancer development .

those mice that harbor more gram-negative bacteroides parabacteroides alistipes and akkermansia exhibited in- creased tumor development whereas gram-positive clostridiales cor- related with reduced tumor load in mice.the fact that altered microbial composition changes the course ofcrc development raises the possibility that certain probiotic bacteria in the normal microflora may serve to protect us against crc.

co-housing of aim2 knockout mice with wt mice resulted in reduced tumor loads in aim2 knockouts but increased tumorigenesis in wt mice showing transmissible dysbiosis that controls tumor development in the gut .

this speculation is further supported by the fact that transformed colonic epithelial cells fail to form an effective surface barrier against commensal gut bacteria and their degradative products allowing infiltration of gut bacteria and pamps into the tumor stroma .our current findings indicate that commensal bacteria serve as drivers of tumor-promoting inflammation in the gut when effective surface barrier function is disrupted either by environmental factors or through the colorectal tumorigenesis process itself.

in the following section we will summarize our current knowledge on the immunological me- chanisms that maintain a balanced microbial content in the gut the roles of probiotic bacteria in the prevention of crc and food intake and bacterial metabolites that impact crc development by changing the magnitude of genotoxic stress or tissue inflammation.intact and mucosal immunity maintains a balanced bacterial com- position in the gut whereas disruption of this immunological circuit either prior to or as a consequence of tumor development accelerates crc initiation and progression.

if symbiotic bacteria the onset of crc but later on infiltrate into tumor stroma and induce tumor-pro- moting inflammation treatment of current crc patients with these bacteria may not be effective against tumors in the colon.inflammatory cytokines serve as mediators of bacteria-cancer interactioncytokines are critical mediators of immune responses in health and sickness.

in the case of crc tumor invading commensal bacteria trigger the activation of innate and adaptive immune cells that infiltrate into tumor stroma and elicit the production of tumor-promoting cytokines which were originally designed to combat bacterial infection.

commensal bacteria-derived diet metabolites regulate the pro- cess of crc development by impacting tumor cell growth and survival and immune cell-mediated tumor killing.. il-10 knockout mice also develop spontaneous intestinal in- flammation and colitis-associated cancer in their gut and the latter is accelerated with aom injection .

the etiology of tumor-associated inflammation in sporadic crc has been examined and we now know that transformed colorectal epithelial cells fail to form an effective surface barrier to keep commensal bacteria and their derivative products from invading tumor stroma .

taken together chronic inflammation in the host predisposes the gut for tumor development by enriching genotoxic commensal bacteria which further accelerates crc devel- opment by creating genetic lesions in colorectal epithelial cells.
