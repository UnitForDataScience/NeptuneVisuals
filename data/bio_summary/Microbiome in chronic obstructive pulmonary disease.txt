Metagenomics and the analysis of bacterial RNA will be able to provide functional information on the respiratory microbiome detailing interactions between viruses fungi and bacteria and potentially to facilitating the design of intervention studies aimed at conserving the flora that acts as positive mutualist as opposed to the respiratory pathogens that progressively replace it when COPD progresses to advanced disease.AcknowledgementsFunding The work was partly funded by Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias - Ciberes Instituto de Salud Carlos III FIS PI1500167 AGAUR SEPAR and FUCAP.FootnoteConflicts of Interest The author has no conflicts of interest todeclare.ReferencesRosell A Monso E Soler N et al.

These severity-related changes of the respiratory microbiome found in COPD patients has been also reported in cystic fibrosis where the respiratory flora shows similarly an overrepresentation of genera which included PPMs 17-19.Most microbiome studies on COPD have used sputumas the sample representing the respiratory system due to its easy recovery and standardized processing procedureAnnals of Translational Medicine Vol 5 No 12 June 2017Page 3 of 52021.
