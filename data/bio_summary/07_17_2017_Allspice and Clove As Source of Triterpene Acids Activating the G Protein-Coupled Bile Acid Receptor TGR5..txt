Moreover the TGR5 activation of SaroE and PdioE could be pinpointed solely to TTAs.Keywords TGR5 Syzygium aromaticum Pimenta dioica Kaempferia galanga triterpene acidsINTRODUCTIONThe bile acid receptor TGR5 Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 also known as G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 GPBAR1 or membrane-type receptor for bile acids M-BAR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types including the intestine gallbladder adipocytes and immune cells and is considered to be a major regulator in metabolism.

The common monohydroxy TTAs betulinic oleanolic and ursolic acid were found to activate TGR5 with EC50 values in the range of 1-3 uM in previous studiesQuantification and TGR5 Activation of the Triterpene AcidsTo verify the assumption that the measured TGR5 activity of SaroE and PdioE can be related to the identified pentacyclic TTAs we developed a quantitative HPLC-CAD method with external standardization to determine their concentration in the tested extracts.

Identification and quantification of TTAs in these two extracts as well as comparison of their TGR5 activity with reconstituted TTA mixtures allowed the attribution of the TGR5 activity to TTAs.

This multitude of effects renders TGR5 a promising target for the treatment of metabolic diseases   .This prompted us to select and study plant extracts derived from a Tibetan herbal preparation which is used against different symptoms of metabolic diseases        .Since TGR5 is abundantly expressed in the intestine which facilitates local interactions between plant constituents and various components present in the gut we also considered the possibility of microbiota-mediated biotransformation of extract constituents.

As reference compound the well-established TGR5 agonist LCA  was used at a concentration of 10 uM which was set as 100 TGR5 activation.

However other than in the case of CDCA no significant difference in activity using the TGR5 reporter gene assay could be observed between KgalE0 and KgalEFS and PdioE0 and PdioEFS suggesting that the analytically observed biotransformation has no influence on the TGR5 activity.

Since none of these constituents have been described as TGR5 activators or are structurally similar to known TGR5 binders KgalE was fractionated by RP-18 column chromatography to further assign the observed activity to a specific compound class or constituent.

In respect of the structural similarities to oleanolic acid and ursolic acid maslinic acid and corosolic acid are likely to activate TGR5 in a similar manner.Structure-activity studies of pentacyclic TTAs identified the C3-hydroxyl and the C28-carboxylate group as being of major importance for TGR5 activation.

The pentacyclic skeleton is harbored in a hydrophobic pocket and a small polar site binds the free carboxylic acid    .The fact that the only TGR5 agonist that has been studied in humans so far SB-756050 has thus-far failed to be launched underlines the need for TGR5 activators with a favorable benefitrisk ratio.

Moreover the TGR5 activation of SaroE and PdioE could be pinpointed solely to the TTAs oleanolic acid and ursolic acid and the novel TGR5 agonists maslinic acid and corosolic acid.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSJR VD DB AL and MZ conceived and designed the experiments.
