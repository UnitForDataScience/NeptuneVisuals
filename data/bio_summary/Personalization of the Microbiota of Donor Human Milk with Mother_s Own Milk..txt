In DBM the most abundant genera were Acinetobacter unclassified Enterobacteriaceae genus and Serratia.Results of this study suggest that the optimal restoration strategy to reach a microbial content most similar to MOM was a mixture of RM-10 incubated for 4 h. Using the bacterial load and microbial content of MOM at T0 as the target we were able to successfully restore the microbiome in the RM-10 and RM-30 mixtures after 4 h of incubation whereas larger dilutions of RM-1 and RM-5 reached the target level after 8 h. Although it did not reach the microbial content of MOM RM-10 was able to reach 60 of the bacterial load of MOM.

Using MOM at time  0 T0 as the target for the restoration process this level was reached in the 10 RM-10 and 30 RM-30 mixtures after 4 h of incubation at 37C whereas the larger dilutions of 1 RM-1 and 5 RM-5 after 8 h. The diversity indexes were similar between MOM and DBM samples however different genera were prevalent in each group.

We hypothesized that fresh MOM can be mixedTABLE 1  Demographics of mothers and infants.with DBM to improve the quality of DBM by cultivating the beneficial milk microbiome to reflect MOM.

For MRS media which targets mostly lactic acid bacteria 33 of the RM-10 reached a ratio of 1 compared to MOM while 58 of RM-30 reached the same ratio after 4 h. In Nutrient agar which is a general purpose media targeting non-fastidious organisms after 4 h of incubation 42 of samples in RM-10 reached a ratio of 1 compared to MOM while 83 reached a ratio of 1 in the RM-30 samples.

The ratio was calculated for each RM sample by dividing the CFUmL in each RM sample to its corresponding MOM sample at T0 MOM  1.

The change in diversity of MOM and RM-10 or RM-30 suggests the differential growth of few bacterial species.The analysis of the bacterial richness of the RM allowed for the assessment of the expanding microbiome to determine if the RM samples over time become similar to MOM at T0.

In most cases the DBM samples remained clustered together such as MOM sample 4 5 6 7 8 10 11 and 12 shown as circles in  whereas in DBM used for MOM samples 2 and 9 has a small difference in bacterial richness over time.

In some mothers it was observed that the different RM samples migrated toward MOM at T0 suggesting that the RM sample became more similar to MOM at T0 .
