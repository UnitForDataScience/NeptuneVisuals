For the bacterial inoculation plants were placed in Falcon tubes containing 10-ml bacterial suspensions see below for 20 min ensuring proper immersion of the roots.Seven treatments were tested with six biologically independent replicates per treatment i nonin- oculated plants used as controls C ii plants inoculated with endophytic strain 29E iii plants inoculated with endophytic strain 32E iv plants inoculated with an endophytic bacterial consortium BC composed of strains 28EY and 28EW inoculum containing equal numbers of each strain v plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 44R vi plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 89R and vii plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 91R.

The experimental design included six treatments i noninoculated plants used as a control C ii noninoculated plants supplemented with NPK fertilizer NPK 6815 Phenix Italpollina used as a fertilized control FC iii plants inoculated with endophytic strain 32E Eiv plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 91R R v plants inoculated with the endophytic BC andvi plants inoculated with endophytic BC and supplied with the NPK fertilizer BCF.

strain 29E Rhizobium herbae strain 32E Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 44R Aminobacter aminovorans strain 89R Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R or bacterial consortium BC which includes Variovorax paradoxus strain 28EY and Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strain 28EW B. celtiberica plants.

Treatments noninoculated control or inoculated B. celtiberica plants Neorhizobium alkalisoli strain 29E Rhizobium herbae strain 32E Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 44R Aminobacter aminovorans strain 89R Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R or bacterial consortium BC with Variovorax paradoxus strain 28EY and Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strain 28EW.

strain 29E and Aminobacter aminovorans strain 89R treatments are the exceptions to this trend and displayed higher contents in leaves than roots.Overall in the presence of arsenic both leaves and roots had increased total content of NPTs except in the leaves of Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 44R- and Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R-treated plants .

Dots indicate whether plants were inocu- lated E with Rhizobium herbae strain 32E R with Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R BC with the bacterial consortium of Variovorax paradoxus strain 28EY and Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strain 28EW BCF with BC plus fertilizer or not C and FC for control and fertilized control respectively.

Under exposure to arsenic the content of NPTs in leaves of plants inoculated with Rhodococcus erythropolis strain 44R or Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R decreased in comparison to noninoculated plants C but showed increased levels of phytochelatin 4 PC4.

Bacterial inocula with Neorhizobium alkalisoli strain 29E Aminobacter aminovorans strain 89R or Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R would thereby oxidize this 20 of AsIII generated by plants resulting in about 100 AsV in the medium.

Four strains were selected the sidero- phore and IAA- and ACC deaminase-producing Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R As uptake in roots 700 ug  g-1 dry weight dw As uptake in leaves 10 ug  g-1 dw treatment R the siderophore and IAA-producing Rhizobium herbae strain 32E As uptake in roots 600 ug g-1 dw As uptake in leaves 15 ug g-1 dw treatment E and the endophytic BC that included the siderophore and IAA-producing strains Variovorax paradoxus strain 28EY and Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strain 28EW As uptake in roots 500 ug  g-1 dw As uptake in leaves 15 ug  g-1 dw.

Finally AsIII levels in roots were higher after inoculation with Ensifer adhaerens strain 91R Rhodo- coccus erythropolis 44R Rhizobium herbae strain 32E and with BC these treatments were also characterized by high NPT content.Field-scale evaluation of arsenic uptake by noninoculated and inoculated Betula celtiberica plants.
