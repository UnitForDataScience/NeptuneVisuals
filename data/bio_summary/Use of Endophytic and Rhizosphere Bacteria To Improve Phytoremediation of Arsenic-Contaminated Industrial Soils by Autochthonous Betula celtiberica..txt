four strains were selected the sidero- phore and iaa- and acc deaminase-producing ensifer adhaerens strain 91r as uptake in roots 700 ug  g-1 dry weight dw as uptake in leaves 10 ug  g-1 dw treatment r the siderophore and iaa-producing rhizobium herbae strain 32e as uptake in roots 600 ug g-1 dw as uptake in leaves 15 ug g-1 dw treatment e and the endophytic bc that included the siderophore and iaa-producing strains variovorax paradoxus strain 28ey and phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strain 28ew as uptake in roots 500 ug  g-1 dw as uptake in leaves 15 ug  g-1 dw.

likewise these conditions showed the highest npt values in roots at 89 and 87 nmol  g-1 fw for the two inoculations respectively.arsenic accumulation in roots correlated positively with npt content indicating that as in the form of asv introduced in the culture media was complexed in roots through enhanced synthesis of npts.

rhizosphere-containing soil defined as soil in the immediate vicinity of the roots was obtained by shaking the roots thereby collecting the soil that had been attached to the roots.

some bacterial mechanisms that enhance phytoremediation consist of plant growth by bacterial metabolites such as indole-3-acetic acid iaa metal chelation by siderophores and organic acid production soil acidification solu- bilization of metal phosphates methylation and moderation of heavy-metal stress by bacterial 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase accd  .

for the bacterial inoculation plants were placed in falcon tubes containing 10-ml bacterial suspensions see below for 20 min ensuring proper immersion of the roots.seven treatments were tested with six biologically independent replicates per treatment i nonin- oculated plants used as controls c ii plants inoculated with endophytic strain 29e iii plants inoculated with endophytic strain 32e iv plants inoculated with an endophytic bacterial consortium bc composed of strains 28ey and 28ew inoculum containing equal numbers of each strain v plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 44r vi plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 89r and vii plants inoculated with rhizospheric strain 91r.

additionally we found that as exposure caused increased npt content in roots suggesting that as was complexed in the roots through enhanced synthesis of npts .

for as the translocation from roots to shoots in most plant species is generally not very effective supporting the high as concentrations found in roots and low as translocation by b. celtiberica .

in our study soil conditions for bc treatment were ph 2.74 and 2527 mg  kg-1 as mean - sd as uptake in leaves of11.11 - 2.21 g dw and in roots of 595.15 - 52 g dw while soil characteristics for the bcf treatment were ph 3.64 and 1484 mg  kg-1 as mean - sd as uptake in leaves of 3.65 - 1.29 g dw and in roots of 302.18 - 78 g dw .

chemical as was determined in leaves and roots by icp-ms. as speciation was quantified in leaves roots and the culture medium in which the plants grew .

in the contaminated field the siderophore and indole-3-acetic acid producers of the endophytic bacterial consortium enhanced arsenic accumulation in the leaves and roots of betula celti- berica whereas the rhizosphere isolate ensifer adhaerens strain 91r mainly promoted plant growth.

furthermore plants inoculated with the rhizobium herbae strain 32e were the only ones with root as concentration and fwi above the mean.a507540305020npts gsh pc3pc4251000 150 0 150 0 1500 1500 1500 1500 150control 29e32e44r89r91rbcleavesb00 1500 1500 1500 1500 1500 150 0 150control29e32e44r89r91rbcrootsc10075asiii50asv250control29e32e44r89r91rbcfig 5 a to c effect of asv 150 um on npts gsh and pcs a and percentages of asv and asiii found in medium b and different parts of the plant leaves and roots c by icp-ms. treatments noninoculated control or inoculated b. celtiberica plants neorhizobium alkalisoli strain 29e rhizobium herbae strain 32e rhodococcus erythropolis strain 44r aminobacter aminovorans strain 89r ensifer adhaerens strain 91r or bacterial consortium bc with variovorax paradoxus strain 28ey and phyllobacterium myrsinacearum strain 28ew.

rhizosphere soils are indeed rich environments due to nutrients exuded from the roots of most plants which are accustomed to supporting bacterial growthand metabolism.

the first goal was to perform an initial analy- sis of the entire rhizosphere and endophytic bacterial communities of the above- named accumulator plant including the cultivable bacterial species.

a bar chart showing the relative abundance of major bacterial phyla over 1. b heatmap showing the distribution of bacterial order and genus level over 1.sequences redundant strains were eliminated ending up with 39 endophytes and 46 rhizobacteria table s3.

although more strains were present in the total communities than in the cultivable bacterial community the cultivated bacterial strains gave a good overview of the most dominant genera present in b. celtiberica plants.
