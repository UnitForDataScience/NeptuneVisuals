Sex-specific effects resulting from cadmium 81 and lead 7778 exposure as well as multigenerational effects from lead exposure 75 have also been reported.For future work to be comprehensive tools such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing are needed to identify DNA methylation patterns and genes that are dysregulated by exposure to cadmium or lead in cell types relevant to the genesis of obesity.

Targeted DNA methylation analysis iden- tified differential methylation at the imprinted loci of PEG3 PEG1MEST IGF2H19 and DLK1MEG3 thatis attributable to prenatal cadmium or lead exposure and associated with dysregulated growth outcomes in both mice and humans 12717374.In humans agnostic approaches using global methylation screening of Alu and LINE-1 elements demonstrated hypomethylation of LINE-1 related to increased patellar lead levels 8485.

The keys to understanding how metal exposure contributes to obesity are improved assessment of exposure and comprehensive establishment of epigenetic profiles that may serve as markers for exposures.First draft submitted 5 August 2016 Accepted for publication 19 October 2016Published online 16 December 2016Keywords cadmium  DNA methylation  epigenetics  lead  obesitySarah S Park1 David A Skaar1 Randy L Jirtle123  Cathrine Hoyo11Department of Biological Sciences Center for Human Health  the Environment North Carolina State University Raleigh NC 27695 USA 2Department of Oncology McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison WI 53705 USA3Department of Sport  Exercise Sciences Institute of Sport  Physical Activity Research University of Bedfordshire Bedford Bedfordshire UKAuthor for correspondence Approximately 17 of US children and 35 of adults are obese 1 and annual expendi- tures attributable to obesity and related care exceed US190 billion 2.

It will also be important to identify the overlap in epigenetic profiles associated with cadmium or lead exposure and those associated with obesity.Potential mechanisms by which cadmium  lead may alter obesity riskCadmium and lead have well-established roles as neurotoxins impacting neurodevelopment 86-88.

These studies utilized the 450K methylation array 2830-32 or 385K methylation array 35 and alter- native and older methods the 27K methylation array GoldenGate MassARRAY 3447485056 and global methylation 4449.

Overall the identifica- tion of epigenetic alterations in response to environ- mental exposures such as cadmium and lead exposure will elucidate mechanisms that may be involved in the genesis of obesity and cardiometabolic disease allow for exposure detection and provide a new means for reducing obesity incidence and its severity.Open accessThis work is licensed under the Attribution-NonCommercial- NoDerivatives 4.0 Unported License.

In this report we discuss the current research examining the epigenetic alterations associated with childhood obesity developmental exposure to cadmium or lead potential mechanisms at play and the potential role that cadmium- or lead- induced epigenetic dysregulation has on obesity and cardiometabolic outcomes.Childhood obesity  epigeneticsThe evidence is mounting that DNA methylation alterations at regulatory regions contribute to early onset obesity 21-24.

If informative epigenetic marks are identified these marks could serve as a predictive tool for identifying children at risk for obesity or cardiovascular diseases in later life.A PubMed literature search using keywords 'child epigenetics or methylation and lead exposure or cad- mium' generated 35 results of which five were primary research articles.

In addition PLAGL1 found to be involved in neocortical development 99 had a positive association between its methylation and lead exposure 76 while its reduced expression is associated with obesity 27.
