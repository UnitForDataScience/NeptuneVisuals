Furthermore identification of bacteria enriched by agavins opens opportunities to explore new probiotics.Keywords agavins prebiotics microbiota overweight body weight loss short chain fatty acidsIntroductionAgavins are branched neo-fructans found in Agave plants which contain a mixture of b2-1 and b2-6 linkages .

Plants from two to four years old have a high content of agavins with low DP and simpler chemical structures while plants from five to seven years old contain a large proportion of high-DP agavins and highly-complex chemical structures .Agavins act as prebiotics inducing benefits to host health by providing specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gut microbiota .

In addition SCFA increment through agavins fermentation in both cecum and gut induces a pH drop which might change the intestinal microbiota structure .On the other hand earlier investigations showed that mice fed with standard or high-fat diets with agavins of low DP led to body weight loss -.

Linear discriminant analysis showing the differentially-overrepresented genera between overweight mice fed with a high-fat diet and the diet shift A the diet shift and agavins supplement B the diet shift and oligofructose supplement C and agavins and oligofructose supplements D. LDA effect size 3.0-fold was used to determine the significant biomarkers.Moreover the diet shift led HF-ST10 mice to recover the biochemical environment and microbiota activity in the cecum displaying similar SCFA concentration and pH values in relation to the standard diet ST-ST10 group t test p  0.05 Table .Table 2.

Alpha bacterial diversity was not significantly different between mice fed agavins branched fructans or oligofructose linear fructans.

In addition the cecal microbiota of the agavins-supplemented diet group HF-ST  A10 was more similar to the standard diet groups ST-ST10 or HF-ST10 compared to the oligofructose HF-ST  O10 weighted UniFrac distance t test p  0.05 Supplementary Figure S4CD.On the other hand the supplementation of agavins HF-ST  A10 or oligofructose HF-ST  O10 was associated with different communities in relation to HF-ST10 group agavins increased two genera Citrobacter and Klebsiella and decreased four genera Lactobacillus Ruminococcus Prevotella and Coprococcus while oligofructose increased three genera Prevotella Faecalibacterium and Allobaculum and decreased six genera Lactobacillus Enterococcus Odoribacter Adlercreutzia Desulfovibrio and Ruminococcus.

In relation to oligofructose agavins increased Citrobacter Klebsiella Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter and decreased Prevotella Bacteroides Dehalobacterium and Oscillospira LDA  3.0 Figures C and B-D.In the same way as the diet shift alone prebiotic agavins or oligofructose supplementation modified not only the cecal microbiota composition but also the microbiota activity.

However supplementation with agavins HF-ST  A10 or oligofructose HF-ST  O10 significantly increased the concentration of acetic propionic and butyric acids with a noticeable reduction of pH in the cecal content in relation to non-supplemented controls ST-ST10 and HF-ST10 Bonferroni's test p  0.1 Table .DiscussionWe previously reported that agavins supplementation to a standard diet reverted the metabolic syndrome including body weight loss induced by high-fat diet consumption .

In relation to supplementation with oligofructose agavins supplementation enriched Citrobacter Klebsiella Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter and decreased Prevotella Bacteroides Dehalobacterium and Oscillospira Figure D. Nevertheless both supplements shared the physiological response of accelerating body weight loss perhaps due to functional redundancy of the gut microbiota .ConclusionsIn conclusion diet supplementation of agavins restored microbiota diversity depleted by a high-fat diet reduced the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio enriched members of the Enterobacteriaceae and increased the SCFA concentration in cecum which could induce an accelerated weight loss in mice.

Secondly overweight mice were shifted to standard diet alone HF-ST10 or supplemented with agavins HF-ST  A10 or oligofructose HF-ST  O10 for five more weeks.
