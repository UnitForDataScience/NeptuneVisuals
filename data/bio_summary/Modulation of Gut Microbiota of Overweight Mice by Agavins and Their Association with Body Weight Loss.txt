in relation to oligofructose agavins increased citrobacter klebsiella pseudomonas and acinetobacter and decreased prevotella bacteroides dehalobacterium and oscillospira lda  3.0 figures c and b-d.in the same way as the diet shift alone prebiotic agavins or oligofructose supplementation modified not only the cecal microbiota composition but also the microbiota activity.

in relation to supplementation with oligofructose agavins supplementation enriched citrobacter klebsiella pseudomonas and acinetobacter and decreased prevotella bacteroides dehalobacterium and oscillospira figure d. nevertheless both supplements shared the physiological response of accelerating body weight loss perhaps due to functional redundancy of the gut microbiota .conclusionsin conclusion diet supplementation of agavins restored microbiota diversity depleted by a high-fat diet reduced the firmicutesbacteroidetes ratio enriched members of the enterobacteriaceae and increased the scfa concentration in cecum which could induce an accelerated weight loss in mice.

therefore the present study describes the changes in the cecal microbiota scfa production and ph values associated with body weight loss in overweight mice.high-fat diet consumption for five weeks significantly increased the body weight gain of mice and also led to a substantial decrease of bacterial diversity in the cecal microbiota figures a and a which is consistent with the effects of fat in reducing diversity as previously reported -.firmicutes and bacteroidetes are the most abundant members of the cecal microbiota however the ratio of these bacterial groups can change over time or by different factors such environment and diet especially those with a high fat content -.

on the other hand firmicutes and bacteroidetes are usually the most abundant members of the cecal microbiota however the ratio of these bacterial groups can change over time or by different factors such as age environment or diet and especially those with a high fat content -.in the present work we used agavins from four-year-old agave tequilana plants containing a high proportion of short dp fructans and studied the response on the microbiota of mice continuing our previous study on prebiotic supplementation in overweight mice .

furthermore identification of bacteria enriched by agavins opens opportunities to explore new probiotics.keywords agavins prebiotics microbiota overweight body weight loss short chain fatty acidsintroductionagavins are branched neo-fructans found in agave plants which contain a mixture of b2-1 and b2-6 linkages .

plants from two to four years old have a high content of agavins with low dp and simpler chemical structures while plants from five to seven years old contain a large proportion of high-dp agavins and highly-complex chemical structures .agavins act as prebiotics inducing benefits to host health by providing specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gut microbiota .

in addition scfa increment through agavins fermentation in both cecum and gut induces a ph drop which might change the intestinal microbiota structure .on the other hand earlier investigations showed that mice fed with standard or high-fat diets with agavins of low dp led to body weight loss -.
