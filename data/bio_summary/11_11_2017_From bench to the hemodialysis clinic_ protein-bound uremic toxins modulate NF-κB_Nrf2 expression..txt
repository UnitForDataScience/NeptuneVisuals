this was a very well-controlled protocol which allowed us to conclude that the results are considerably relevant.in conclusion the present study reports that an increase in uremic toxins as observed in maintenance dialysis may acti- vate the nf-kb mrna expression and inhibit nrf2 mrna expression in hd patients consequently contributing to inflammation and oxidative stress commonly observed in these patients.353acknowledgements this study was supported by conselho nacional de pesquisa cnpq coordenacao de aperfeicoamento de pessoal de nivel superior capes clinical research unit upc at fluminense federal university uff comite francais d'evaluation de la coope- ration universitaire avec le bresil cofecub fundacao de amparo a pesquisa do estado do rio de janeiro faperj institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale inserm and institut national des sciences appliquees de lyon insa-lyon.compliance with ethical standardsconflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.ethical approval all procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the eth- ics committee of medicine faculty of federal university fluminense and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.informed consent informed consent was obtained from all individuals participants included in the study.statement of animal studies this article does not contain any studies with animals performed by any of the authors.referencesmeijers bk evenepoel p 2011 the gut-kidney axis indoxyl sul- fate p-cresyl sulfate and ckd progression.

in our previous study  we have observed an increased nf-kb and reduced nrf2 expres- sion in hd patients however there are currently no avail- able data regarding the relationship between protein-bound uremic toxins and expression of nrf2-keap1 and nf-kb in hemodialysis hd patients.

however the observation that nf-kb expression can be stimulated and nrf2 expression reduced by these uremic toxins is novel.
