IL-7 seems to be constitutively produced in lymph nodes hence the availability of this cytokine might depend on the degradation andor consumption by IL-7 receptor IL-7R-expressing cells.Competition for and consumption of IL-7 has been discussed as a mode of regula- tion that enables a direct feedback loop between the size of the naive T cell pool and the availability of this niche-defining cytokine Mazzucchelli and Durum 2007.

2017 pro- vide evidence that IL-7 availability is regulated through a ''cytokine sink'' involving innate lymphoid cells that compete for and consume IL-7 and thereby restrict T cell homeostasis in lymphoid organs.The common g-chain cytokine inter- leukin-7 IL-7 has key functions during the development and homeostasis of lymphocytes.

Interestingly reconstituting IL-7Ra-defi- cient hosts with Rag-deficient bone marrow which does not enable T or B cell development allowed only slight pro- liferation of adoptively transferred IL-7Ra ''sensor'' T cells suggesting that IL-7Ra cells derived from Rag-deficient bone marrow might limit IL-7 availability for naive T cells.

By transferring IL-7Ra-suf- ficient T cell receptor TCR-transgenic orpolyclonal T cells into these mice the au- thors confirmed that radioresistant cells are a sufficient source of IL-7 in vivo.

Naive T cells depend on IL-7 signals for peripheral homeostatic maintenance.

2009 raising the question of which source of IL-7 is most relevant to the regulation of periph- eral T cell homeostasis.

In addi- tion it remains unclear whether cells other than naive T cells can compete for shared pools of IL-7 and potentially interact in spatiotemporally overlapping niches in vivo.In this issue of Immunity Martin et al.

2017 directly address these questions by employing the transfer of naive T cells as biosensors for the availability of IL-7.

The authors argue that measuring the ho- meostatic proliferation of these cells is a proxy for the relative availability of rele- vant IL-7 in the microanatomical locations of secondary lymphoid organs that enable the homeostatic expansion of naive T cells.
