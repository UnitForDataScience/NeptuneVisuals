2017 pro- vide evidence that IL-7 availability is regulated through a ''cytokine sink'' involving innate lymphoid cells that compete for and consume IL-7 and thereby restrict T cell homeostasis in lymphoid organs.The common g-chain cytokine inter- leukin-7 IL-7 has key functions during the development and homeostasis of lymphocytes.

IL-7 seems to be constitutively produced in lymph nodes hence the availability of this cytokine might depend on the degradation andor consumption by IL-7 receptor IL-7R-expressing cells.Competition for and consumption of IL-7 has been discussed as a mode of regula- tion that enables a direct feedback loop between the size of the naive T cell pool and the availability of this niche-defining cytokine Mazzucchelli and Durum 2007.

Naive T cells depend on IL-7 signals for peripheral homeostatic maintenance.

Upon binding to its recep- tor IL-7 activates the Jak-Stat and PI3K-AKT pathways and thereby in- creases the expression of anti-apoptotic molecules and promotes the mainte- nance of glucose-dependent cellular metabolism Mazzucchelli and Durum 2007.

Stromal cells represent a major source of IL-7 in secondary lymphoid organs as revealed by experiments using immunofluorescent microscopy and different reporter mouse strains Kim et al.

However IL-7 produc- tion by hematopoietic cells has also been suggested Guimond et al.

2009 raising the question of which source of IL-7 is most relevant to the regulation of periph- eral T cell homeostasis.

In addition to the source it remains unclear how the abun- dance of and access to IL-7 might be regulated.

In addi- tion it remains unclear whether cells other than naive T cells can compete for shared pools of IL-7 and potentially interact in spatiotemporally overlapping niches in vivo.In this issue of Immunity Martin et al.
