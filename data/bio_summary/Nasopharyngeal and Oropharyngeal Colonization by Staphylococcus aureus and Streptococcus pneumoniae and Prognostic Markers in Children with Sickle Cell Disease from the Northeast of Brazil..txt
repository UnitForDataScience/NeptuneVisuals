1996 observed nasopharyngeal colonization by s. pneumonia in 33 of children with scd who were under two years of age in 10 of children 2- 5 years of age and in 6 of children 5 years of age.

in addition the s. aureus colonization results suggest a possible role of nasopharyngeal colonization by this microorganism in scd in the children investigated in this study.

2009 who studied the epidemiology of and risk factors for colonization with s. aureus in children in massachusetts usa and concluded that colonization by methicillin-resistants.

pneumococcus was isolated from the nasopharynxoropharynx in 16 of 143 children representing a colonization rate of 11.2. one child with pneumococcal colonization was colonized by two different serogroups table 3.all children under 6 years of age used prophylactic penicillin and received pneumococcal vaccines according to the expected age.

2009.infections caused by s. pneumoniae are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide particularly in children under 5 years old and are frequent in individuals with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases and in elderly and immunocompromised individuals hausdorff et al.

the aims of the present study were to evaluate the nasopharynxoropharynx colonization in brazilian children with scd identify the penicillin sensitivity profile among s. pneumoniae-colonized patients describe the most prevalent serotypes causing invasive diseases.

2016. given the high susceptibility to pneumococcal infection children with scd are routinely immunized with pneumococcal vaccines and administered prophylactic antibiotics alongside mitchell and mitchell 2014.in the current study we observed nasopharyngealoropharynx colonization by s. pneumoniae in 11.2 of scd patients and bys.

2005 reported a prevalence of 13.3 for nasopharyngeal colonization by s. pneumoniae among brazilian children with scd in sao paulo.
