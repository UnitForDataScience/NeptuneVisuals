Early innate immune activation of DCs that produce type I IFN is critical B for the recruitment and priming of T cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes TdLNs C. T cells activated in the TdLNs must chemotactically navigate an aberrant tumor vasculature and overcome various barriers in the stroma to gain entry into the tumor bed D. Once in the tumor T cells must be able to recognize and bind to specific pMHC complexes and then begin effector functions such as IFNc secretion and killing E. The secretion of IFNc by activated T cells will trigger a series of events in the tumor including the up-regulation of PD-L1 while the development of tertiary lymphoid structures in the tumor can help promote local adaptive immunity F. Barriers at many of these steps can potentially abolish T-cell homing infiltration andor activity in the TME.receptor 3 Tim-3 interleukin 10 IL-10 and indoleamine 2-3dioxygenase-1 IDO-1 .A variety of tumor antigens can be recognized by T cells.

Finally we summarize different immunotherapies and combinatorial treatment strategies that enable the immune system to overcome barriers for enhanced tumor control and improved patient outcome.Key words T cells immunotherapy cancer tumor microenvironmentRetrospective studies of most solid tumor types have demon- strated a correlation between the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes TILs and progression-free survival as well as over- all patient survival thus pointing to a central role for T cells in tumor immunity -.

A common cause of poor tumor immunogenicity is the loss or down-regulation of HLA class I - as well as of the tumor antigen processing and pres- entation machinery in tumor cells due to either genetic or epigen- etic alterations .

Moreover DNMTi treatment of tumor cells upregulates endogenous retroviral se- quences that are sensed by the tumor cell-autonomous nucleic acid sensing machinery causing type I IFN signaling character- ized by potent cytokine and chemokine production   and leading to enhanced tumor immunogenicity.

More recently the advent of checkpoint blockade therapy with monoclonal antibodies mAbs targeting cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 CLTA-4 as well as the programmed cell death protein 1 PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 has enabled T cell-mediated tumor regression for a range of malignancies including melanoma   ovarian  lung  bladder renal-cell carcinoma  Hodgkin's lymphoma  as well as colorectal gastrointestinal and endometrial cancers hav- ing DNA mismatch repair defects .PD-1 inhibition alone leads to response rates in about 20- 30 of patients with different solid tumor types but when com- bined with CTLA-blockade which promotes T-cell priming this can increase up to 57 for advanced metastatic melanoma .

Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms leading to T-cell inflamed ver- sus noninflamed tumors forces regulating TIL function in the tumor microenvironment TME and combinatorial therapies being used to re-program the TME and enhance T-cell homing and activity.Patient and tumor intrinsic properties that govern T lymphocyte responses against T cells are educated in the thymus to distinguish self from nonself peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex pMHC molecules T cells having TCRs of either too low or too high affinity for pMHC are eliminated during positive andnegative thymic selection respectively .

In addition to the vasculature other components of the tumor stroma including its dense matrix  and cancer-associated fibroblasts  can suppress T-cell function and block their entry into the tumor bed.
