Notably the intake of 150 mg of avananthramideshighly concentrated oat extract led to detection of avenan- thramides 2c 2f and 2p at nanomolar concentrations in plasma between 0.25 and 5 h peaking at 2 h.11 While this study did not examine metabolism data from studies in animals suggest that avenanthramide 2c is metabolized to avenanthramide 2f dihy- droavenanthramide 2f and 2c four hydroxycinnamic acids and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid following oral intake.12 Furthermore intake of 94 g wholegrain wheat bread containing 87 mg of fer- ulic acid or aleurone-enriched white bread led to the appearance of ferulic acid-sulfate dihydroferulic-sulfate hippuric acid and two hydroxyhippuric acids in plasma with the former two reach- ing peak plasma concentrations of 84 nm and 9 nm at 1 and 7 h after intake respectively10 along with 12 other phenolic acid metabolites in 48 h urine suggesting that ferulic acid is subject to extensive metabolism and that some fiber-linked ferulic acid is released later during transit through the gastrointestinal tract through action of the microbiota.10The aim of our study was to examine the urinary excre- tion of avenanthramides and phenolic acids following intake of 60 g oat bran.

Figure 3 shows the oat bran induced increase in excretion of the individual 30 oat bran-derived phenolics proportional to the total excretion at 0-2 h 4-6 h and 6-8 h relative to control.

The mean percentage recovery of metabolites was lowest for the avenanthramide 2p 0.3 intermediate for hydroxycinnamic acids 6.8-10.7 and highest for hydroxybenzoic acids 14.5- 159.2 Table 2.DiscussionThe present randomized controlled trial is to our knowledge the first to have examined the excretion of phenolic metabolites fol- lowing intake of dietary amounts of oat bran as a whole food over a 48 h timeframe and complements previous studies that exam- ined the metabolism and bioavailability of phenolics following intake of an oat avenanthramide extract at a high-dose11 or fol- lowing intake of wheat.10 Oat bran intake resulted in elevated urinary excretion of 30 phenolic compounds at 0-2 h and 4-8 h with sulfate or glycine conjugated benzoic acids being the ma- jor metabolites together with ferulic acid-O-sulfate and the total amounts of phenolic compounds recovered in urine amounting to 22.9 5.0 of the ingested phenolic dose.

Isoferulic acid-O-sulfate was pre- dominant during the early 0-2 h peak vanillic acid was almost ex- clusively excreted during the late 4-8 h period while excretion of hydroxyhippuric acids and benzoic acid-O-sulfate was biphasic with early and late peaks Figure 3.

Proportions of individual oat bran-derived phenolics relative to total excretion levels at 0-2 h 4-6 h and 6-8 h. Excretion level differences between the oat and control interventions were used to calculate percentages.116 mg g-1.922-24 The relatively wide range in the reported con- tents and compositions of phenolics can be explained by the dif- ferent oat products analyzed i.e.

These phenolic compounds may originate from the relatively low amounts of phenolics consumed in white bread and pasta during the dietary restrictions21 and from the metabolism of other dietary components such as aromatic amino acids.27 De- spite this high background excretion our data indicate that intake of oat bran leads to urinary excretion of 30 phenolic acid com- pounds which peak early at 0-2 h and again later between 4-8 h Figure 2.

Indeed in fasted volunteers which was true in our study a mean mouth-to-cecum transit time can be as rapid as 2.3 h30 and in vitro fermentation of wheat bran with human microbiota shows that digestion by microbial esterase and xylanase starts within 2 h resulting in most fiber-bound phenolics being released within 6 h.31The urinary recovery of ingested phenolics was on average 22.9 5.0 in the first 8 h after the oat bran intake relative to the control Table 2.
