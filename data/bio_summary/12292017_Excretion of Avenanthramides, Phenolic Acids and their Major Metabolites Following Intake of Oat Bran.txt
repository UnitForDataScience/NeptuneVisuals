147mmol phenolics in 60 g oat bran table 1 was recov- ered in the 0-8 h urine and there was large inter-individual vari- ability in absorption that ranged from 3.7 to 41.2  table 2. the mean percentage recovery of metabolites was lowest for the avenanthramide 2p 0.3 intermediate for hydroxycinnamic acids 6.8-10.7 and highest for hydroxybenzoic acids 14.5- 159.2 table 2.discussionthe present randomized controlled trial is to our knowledge the first to have examined the excretion of phenolic metabolites fol- lowing intake of dietary amounts of oat bran as a whole food over a 48 h timeframe and complements previous studies that exam- ined the metabolism and bioavailability of phenolics following intake of an oat avenanthramide extract at a high-dose11 or fol- lowing intake of wheat.10 oat bran intake resulted in elevated urinary excretion of 30 phenolic compounds at 0-2 h and 4-8 h with sulfate or glycine conjugated benzoic acids being the ma- jor metabolites together with ferulic acid-o-sulfate and the total amounts of phenolic compounds recovered in urine amounting to 22.9 5.0 of the ingested phenolic dose.

these phenolic compounds may originate from the relatively low amounts of phenolics consumed in white bread and pasta during the dietary restrictions21 and from the metabolism of other dietary components such as aromatic amino acids.27 de- spite this high background excretion our data indicate that intake of oat bran leads to urinary excretion of 30 phenolic acid com- pounds which peak early at 0-2 h and again later between 4-8 h figure 2. the early appearance of metabolites suggests that the absorption of free phenolics from the oat bran occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract with esterified conjugates being hy- drolyzed by esterase activity in the intestinal mucosa28 followed by the transfer of free phenolics across the intestinal epithelium through passive diffusion or via transporters.29 although we hy- pothesized that phenolics in the bound fraction would appear late in the urine due to a requirement for gut microbiota to cleave co- valent linkages between phenolics and fiber the second peak of excretion was completed by 8 h suggesting that the release and absorption occurred more rapidly figure 2. this agrees with previous studies showing that bound phenolics may reach the colon and undergo microbial fermentation within 4 h of oat brantable 2.

notably the intake of 150 mg of avananthramideshighly concentrated oat extract led to detection of avenan- thramides 2c 2f and 2p at nanomolar concentrations in plasma between 0.25 and 5 h peaking at 2 h.11 while this study did not examine metabolism data from studies in animals suggest that avenanthramide 2c is metabolized to avenanthramide 2f dihy- droavenanthramide 2f and 2c four hydroxycinnamic acids and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid following oral intake.12 furthermore intake of 94 g wholegrain wheat bread containing 87 mg of fer- ulic acid or aleurone-enriched white bread led to the appearance of ferulic acid-sulfate dihydroferulic-sulfate hippuric acid and two hydroxyhippuric acids in plasma with the former two reach- ing peak plasma concentrations of 84 nm and 9 nm at 1 and 7 h after intake respectively10 along with 12 other phenolic acid metabolites in 48 h urine suggesting that ferulic acid is subject to extensive metabolism and that some fiber-linked ferulic acid is released later during transit through the gastrointestinal tract through action of the microbiota.10the aim of our study was to examine the urinary excre- tion of avenanthramides and phenolic acids following intake of 60 g oat bran.

indeed in fasted volunteers which was true in our study a mean mouth-to-cecum transit time can be as rapid as 2.3 h30 and in vitro fermentation of wheat bran with human microbiota shows that digestion by microbial esterase and xylanase starts within 2 h resulting in most fiber-bound phenolics being released within 6 h.31the urinary recovery of ingested phenolics was on average 22.9 5.0 in the first 8 h after the oat bran intake relative to the control table 2. previous non-controlled studies reported lower mean recoveries in 24 h urine of 41 82 and 31 following ingestion of phenolics in wholegrain wheat bread10 aleurone-enriched wheat bread10 or wheat bran cereals18 re- spectively but a higher mean recovery of 294 following in- gestion of phenolics in instant coffee.17 this wide variation in phenolic bioavailability may partly be explained by differences in the bioaccessibility of phenolics within the food matrix.

free forms of vanillic and isovanillic acids were the highest and seventh most highly excreted phenolics respectively being mainly excreted in the late peak between 4-8 h after oat bran in- take figure 3 and at levels totaling more than the total amount of vanillic acid that was ingested meansem recovery 159.2 53.8 table 2. these data suggest that while only a limited amount of vanillic acid is absorbed directly in the small intestinea larger proportion is absorbed following release by fermentation by the colonic microbiota with previous studies suggesting that it originated partly from the metabolism of avenanthramides and hydroxycinnamic acids.25323435 vanillic acid may be formed by b-oxidation of ferulic acid in the liver and isovanillic acid from methylation of caffeic acid to isoferulic acid followed by liver b-oxidation supporting information figure s1.25323435 4- 3- and 2-hydroxyhippuric acids were also highly excreted with their excretion following a biphasic pattern early 0-2 h and late 4-8 h after oat bran intake figure 3. while hydroxyhippuric acids are common flavonoid metabolites detected for example following intake of orange juice26 and cocoa36 results from this oat trial and a recent wheat trial10 suggest that hydroxyhippuric acids are also important metabolites derived from wholegrain.a study feeding 75-150 mg avenanthramides in an oat ex- tract to humans detected nanomolar concentrations of circulat- ing avenanthramides11 while the present study detected only traces of the ingested 2.5 mg avenanthramides in urine.

isoferulic acid-o-sulfate was pre- dominant during the early 0-2 h peak vanillic acid was almost ex- clusively excreted during the late 4-8 h period while excretion of hydroxyhippuric acids and benzoic acid-o-sulfate was biphasic with early and late peaks figure 3. ferulic acid p-coumaric acid and avenanthramides 2p i.e.

these results sug- gest that a high proportion of oat phenolics are bioavailable as a wide range of metabolites with absorption occurring both in the small intestine and then in the large intestine within eight hours of consumption.analysis of the utilized oat bran detected nine phenolic acids amounting to 434 mg g-1 and three avenanthramides amount- ing to 41 mg g-1 table 1. these levels are comparable to four previous studies that analyzed wholegrain oats or oat bran iden- tifying up to ten phenolic acids at levels ranging from 273 to 874 mg g-1 and three avenanthramides at levels ranging from 13 tofigure 3. proportions of individual oat bran-derived phenolics relative to total excretion levels at 0-2 h 4-6 h and 6-8 h. excretion level differences between the oat and control interventions were used to calculate percentages.116 mg g-1.922-24 the relatively wide range in the reported con- tents and compositions of phenolics can be explained by the dif- ferent oat products analyzed i.e.
