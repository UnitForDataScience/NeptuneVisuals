The major role of interleukin 22 and some of its target genes Reg3g and Reg3b in the response to bacterial infections suggested that CARD9-- gut microbiota might be deeply impacted.IMPACT OF THE CASPASE RECRUITMENT DOMAIN 9SS MICROBIOTA IN THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO COLITISUsing the linear discriminant analysis effect size pipe- line we observed several differences in the compo- sition of the fecal bacterial microbiota at baseline in wild type WT and CARD9-- mice including decreases in Adlercreutzia genus Allobaculum genus and Lactobacillus reuteri in CARD9-- mice 17.

two bacteria with decreased abundance in the CARD9-- mice microbiota strongly activate AhR 17 These results suggested that impaired tryptophan metabolism by the microbiota of the CARD9-- mice could be associated with or even1363-1950 Copyright c 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health Inc.

The intestinal immune system plays a crucial role in shaping the microbiota so it can be tolerated by the host.The human intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of more than 1011 microor- ganisms per gram of feces.

can metab- olize dietary tryptophan in AhR ligands that induce interleukin 22 production by ILC leading to pro- duction of antimicrobial peptides by intestinal epithelial cells which provide resistance for oppor- tunistic pathogens such as Candida albicans In correlation tryptophan-free diet in mice decreases the production of intestinal antimicrobial peptides that affects the gut microbiota composition and diversity suggesting that tryptophan metabolism by the gut microbiota play an important role in mucosal homeostasis Therefore the complex bilateral interaction between the host and its micro- biota has a crucial role in human health.

In some circumstances the tolerance toward the intestinal microbiota is broken leading to inappropriate immune response and intestinal or extraintestinal inflammation.

Recently AhR signaling has been shown to be a key player of the immune response particularly at barrier sites such as the skin and the intestinal mucosa 2021Tryptophan can be metabolized either by the gut bacteria into indole derivatives such as indole-3-acetic acid IAA or by host cells into kynurenine via indoleamine 23-diox- ygenase 1 221 Indole derivatives are AhR ligands known to promote local interleukin 22 pro- duction by immune cells 121 To determine whether the modulation of AhR activation by the intestinal microbiota is involved in the decreased interleukin 22 production in our model we deter- mined the concentration of AhR ligands in the feces of our mice.

Moreover we have recently showed that intestinal epithelial cell proliferation is reduced and apoptosis is increased after DSS-induced colitis in CARD9-- mice 17In these mice we also observed a decreased colonic expression of Reg3g and Reg3b and an alteration of the bacterial and fungal micro- biota 17.

Indeed we observed an increased susceptibility to colitis with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cell of CARD9-- germfree mice.

No association was observed among other major IBD-associated SNP including those in NOD2 17 These results suggest a connection between IBD CARD9 and the ability of the micro- biota to produce AhR agonists in humans.CONCLUSIONThese results in human should be confirmed in an independent cohort but indole derivatives or the microorganisms that produce them could be used as a supportive therapy in individuals with intestinal dysbiosis to override the defect of tryptophan metab- olism by the gut microbiota.

To address this question we colon- ized germ-free WT mice with the microbiota of WT WT germ free or CARD9-- CARD9-- germ free mice and exposed them to DSS.
