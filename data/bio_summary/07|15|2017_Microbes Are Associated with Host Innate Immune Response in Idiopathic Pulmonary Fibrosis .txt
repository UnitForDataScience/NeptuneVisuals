Baseline characteristics of subsets of COMET-IPF patientsA subset of COMET-IPF patients n68 with expression array data from PBMC 16S rRNA sequencing data from BAL and clinical demographics.A subset of COMET-IPF patients n27 with CpG-ODN mediated TLR9 response data from fibroblast and expression array data from PBMC.CPIcomposite physiological index DLCO diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide FVCforced vital capacity FEV1forced expiratory volume in 1 secondTable 2.

There are studies that have linked the microbiome to lung tissue gene expression 53 and between the PBMC expression and lung tissue expression 54 but none between the PBMC expression and microbiome directly.

The primary outcome combined endpoint for COMET-IPF was progression free survival PFS as determined by time until any of the following death acute exacerbation lung transplant or relative change in FVC liters of 10 or DLCO of 15 2.This study reports microbiome and peripheral blood mononuclear cell PMBC gene expression data on all subjects with supporting data on fibroblastCpG oligonucleotide DNA CpG-OND responsiveness and circulating leukocyte phenotypes in subset cohorts .PBMC sample collection RNA isolation microarray hybridization and data processingEDTA blood samples were collected from IPF patients enrolled in COMET cohort at study entry.

Three nodes displayed high closeness-centrality including NF-kB signaling role of osteoblasts and chondrocytes in rheumatoid arthritis and acute phase response signaling Supplemental Figure E8B.Inflammatory leukocyte phenotypes associate with microbial measures Associations between paired lung microbial data and blood leukocyte phenotypes were assessed in a subset of patients with these data n32 Supplemental Figure E1.

Whether the lung microbiome influences IPF host defense remains unknown.Objectives To explore the host immune response and microbial interaction in IPF as they relate to progression-free survival PFS fibroblast function and leukocyte phenotypes.Methods Paired microarray gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs and 16s rRNA sequencing data from bronchoalveolar lavage BAL obtained as part of the COMET-IPF study were used to conduct association pathway analyses.

A subset n27 of these 68 COMET-IPF had paired CpG-ODN response data to TLR9 stimulation in lung fibroblasts derived from transbronchial biopsies and microarray gene expression data from host PBMCs Supplemental Figure E1.

A subset n27 of them has paired CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide CpG-ODN response to TLR9 stimulation in lung fibroblasts derived from transbronchial biopsies data and microarray gene expression data from host PBMCs .Supplemental Figure E2.

Fresh medium was added to the fibroblasts every 2-3 days and the cells were passaged when they were 70-90 confluent.Data analyses and integrationPlease see the Online Data Supplement for additional details.PFS-associated host canonical signaling pathwaysMicroarray gene expression data from host PBMCs was transformed into a data matrix of Pathways-Samples using the RBioconductor package GSVA as described in theOnline Data Supplement.

We demonstrate that 1 Reduced expression of PFS-associated canonical pathways in PBMCs was associated with a worse outcome Table 2 2 Down- regulation of immune response relevant pathways is associated with changes in the abundance of specific microbial OTUs Figures 1 and 2 3 Abundance of particular OTUs correlates with several TLRs expression Supplemental Figure E5 4 Lung fibroblast CpG-ODN responsiveness to TLR9 activation is positively correlated withexpression of host immune response relevant signaling pathways Figure 3 5 Increased expression of these same immune response relevant pathway genes is negatively correlated with the abundance of OTU1341 Prevotella and OTU1348 Staphylococcus Figure 3 and 6 Alterations in the microbial community structure associate with changes in circulating leukocyte phenotypes Figure 4.
