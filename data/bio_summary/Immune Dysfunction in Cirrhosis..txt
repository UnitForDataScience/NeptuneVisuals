ethanol and by their production by damaged hepatocytes.36 Gut flora can promote alcoholic liver disease by activating TLRs but this process can be reduced by altering the gut microbiota by administration of antibiotics and probiotics.37Recent studies have shown that hepatitis B e antigen HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B CHB patients show down-regulation of TLR2 and that HBeAg-negative CHB patients show up-regulation of TLR2 suggesting its expres- sion may be responsible for rapid progression of disease in the HBeAg-positive CHB patients.38 Functional impairment of TLR2 and TLR4 is one of the major reasons for immune dysfunction and risk of infection in cirrhotic patients.39 Both of these TLRs activate nuclear factor kappa b NFKb in liver cells.40 Studies have shown decreased TLR2 function in early cirrhosis4142 but decreased TLR4 function in advanced cirrho- sis only.4143-46 A study performed by Nischelke et al.47 has shown that TLR2 polymorphisms and NOD2 variants increase the susceptibility for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites.

Conventional SIRS criteria has a low sensitivity and specificity in cirrhotic patients as it can be present in 10-30 without bacterial infections moreover these patients present low pulse rate and leucocyte count due to beta blocker therapy and hyper- splenism respectively which can lead to underestimation of its prevalence.111 In SIRS there is a cytokine storm withpredominance of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-a IL-6 and IL-1 which leads to various changes in the coagulation cascade and circulatory system.Cirrhotic patients are at increased risk for developing SIRS as they have increased levels of endotoxins TNF-a IL-6 and nitric oxide and reduced levels of protein C and coagulation factors.8 SIRS is the cause of around 10 of hospital admissions among this patient population.

In chronic liver disease patients there is marked increase in non-classical CD14CD16 subsets and thisoccurrence correlates with collagen-producing hepatic stel- late cell activation proinflammatory cytokines expression and clinical progression.55 Low lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio has been postulated as an independent prognostic marker in liver cirrhosis.56CD163 is a specific marker for macrophage activation and is shed into the circulation in a soluble form sCD163.57 In cirrhosis it increases in conjunction with increasing Child- Pugh score and shows a strong correlation with the hepatic venous pressure gradient and thus with portal hyperten- sion.58 Waismann et al.59 has demonstrated sCD163 as an independent risk factor for death and variceal bleeding in cir- rhotic patients raising the possibility of its development as a new pharmacological target in the future.

Fiuza et al.66 demonstrated that cirrhotic patients exhibit deficient trans- endothelial migration and G-CSF enhances neutrophil trans- endothelial migration.Recent studies have demonstrated that G-CSF therapy mobilizes CD34 cells and improves the survival of ACLF patients.6768 G-CSF therapy also significantly improved the rate of 2-month survival reduced the Child-Turcotte-Pugh model for end-stage liver disease and sequential organ failure assessment scores and prevented the occurrence of sepsis hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy.67Adaptive immune dysfunctionAdaptive immune dysfunction is also common in cirrhotic patients.

also showed that patients with the TLR4 D299G poly- morphism had more infections and bacteremia.49Impaired monocyte function is also a contributor to CAID leading to defects in chemotaxis phagocytosis superoxide degeneration and production of lysosomal enzymes.50-53 Immune paralysis which is defined as decreased human leu- kocyte antigen-D related HLA-DR expression of monocytes is a well-known feature in ACLF and septic shock but it was recently found also in patients with liver cirrhosis.16 Immune paralysis is characterized by increase in anti-inflam- matory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10 and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and TNF-a.17444554 Immunomodulator agents such as the granulocyte macro- phage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF and interferon- gamma IFN-g can improve monocyte functions and should be investigated further.17 Endotoxemia possibly through an IL-10-mediated mechanism contributes to down-regulation of HLA-DR in cirrhotic patients.45 These low HLA-DR express- ing monocytes have decreased production of proinflamma- tory cytokines such as TNF-a and nitric oxide synthetase as well as allostimulatory activity.45 Avi et al.53 has shown decreased monocyte function in liver cirrhosis as measured by phagocytosis and killing of Candida albicans and Candida pseudotropicalis.

Though antibiotics are the main therapeutic strategy experimental studies are ongoing to investigate the use of pre- pro- symbiotic and fecal microbiota transplantation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.99 Reshaping the microbiota in a beneficial manner may help to prevent com- plications of cirrhosis in the future.Bacterial infections in cirrhosisThere have been drastic improvements in the management and prognosis of cirrhotic patients in the last few decades but the rate of mortality due to infectious complications has not changed much.

Gram-positive bac- teria like Staphyloccocus is responsible for around 20 and anaerobes for around 3 of cases.100 Infection rates in hos- pitalized patients with cirrhosis are 4- to 5-fold higher than those among the general patient population.101 The most common infections that occur in these patients are repre- sented by SBP 25-31.100 Other common infections are urinary tract infections 20-25 pneumonia 15-21 bacteremia 12 and soft tissue infections 11.100For SBP intravenous antibiotics for 5 days intravenous albumin to reduce the incidence of renal impairment and long-term oral antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent further episodes of SBP is the standard of care.

Septic shock and mortality is high in multidrug-resistant infection patients and it is currently recommended that empirical antibiotic prophylaxis is not effective for nosoco- mial infections.TuberculosisThe incidence of tuberculosis is increased in cirrhotic patients as compared to the general population due to the immune dysfunction in the former.

Also these patients are at increased risk of acquiring Vibrio vulnificus with mortality of 50-60 being reported.109 Non-HFE iron overload has been shown to significantly associate with disease severity and reduced survival in patients with decom- pensated cirrhosis.110Systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS sepsis and cirrhosisSepsis is defined as SIRS in the presence of a pathogenic infection or other injury such as a crush injury that can trigger the inflammatory immune response.

Erwin et al.60 demonstrated that in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis the 2518 MCP-1 genotype AA is a risk factor for development of SBP.
