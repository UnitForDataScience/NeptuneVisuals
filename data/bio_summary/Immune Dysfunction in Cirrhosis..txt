ethanol and by their production by damaged hepatocytes.36 gut flora can promote alcoholic liver disease by activating tlrs but this process can be reduced by altering the gut microbiota by administration of antibiotics and probiotics.37recent studies have shown that hepatitis b e antigen hbeag-positive chronic hepatitis b chb patients show down-regulation of tlr2 and that hbeag-negative chb patients show up-regulation of tlr2 suggesting its expres- sion may be responsible for rapid progression of disease in the hbeag-positive chb patients.38 functional impairment of tlr2 and tlr4 is one of the major reasons for immune dysfunction and risk of infection in cirrhotic patients.39 both of these tlrs activate nuclear factor kappa b nfkb in liver cells.40 studies have shown decreased tlr2 function in early cirrhosis4142 but decreased tlr4 function in advanced cirrho- sis only.4143-46 a study performed by nischelke et al.47 has shown that tlr2 polymorphisms and nod2 variants increase the susceptibility for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis sbp in patients with cirrhosis with ascites.
