Microbiota stimula- tion of the immune system establishes the host's immune tone which deter- mines the threshold for immune activa- tion.

The host immune system responds to micro- bial colonization of the intestine and overthe past decade we have learned about the impact of various bacterial species on T lymphocyte differentiation mucin pro- duction and expression of antimicrobial factors.In part because of their therapeutic poten- tial identifying and characterizing bacte- rial species and the immune mechanisms they trigger have become areas of intense and exciting research.

The interdependencies of the various bacterial taxa constituting the microbiota and the overall complexity of microbial populations in the intestine make it difficult to attribute specific immune effects to individual bacterial species .Although transfer of human microbiota into germ-free mice has been revealing  incomplete interspecies transfer of symbiotic bacterial populations and differ- ences between human and murine sym- bionts can result in incomplete or altered host immune activation .

Analyses of these various bacterial species demonstrated that simi- lar immune responses can be initiated by diverse microbial species while closely related bacterial species often differ in terms of immune activation.

Studies using gnotobioticmice however are pro- viding important insights.The hundreds of bacterial species and strains residing in the mammalian intesti- nal tract compete and cooperate in the process forming a complex ecosystem that interfaces with the gut mucosa and enhances host health by optimizing nutri- ent absorption producing essential vita- mins providing colonization resistance against pathogens and promoting regu- latory immune responses that limit inflam- mation.

These varied findings raise important questions about the molecular mechanisms that are triggered by differ- ent intestinal microbes.A recent and important contribution to this field catalogs activation of the murine immune system by 53 distinct commen- sal bacterial species .

The finding that it is impossible to predict the impact of a bacterial strain on the immune system on the basis of responses to closely related strains is an important message emphasizing the need to go beyond sim- ply classifying symbionts on the basis of 16S rRNA gene similarity.As the Geva-Zatorsky paper in Cell becomes a much-cited resource it will be important for readers to remember two qualifications emphasized by the authors.

First they use an 'unabashedly reductionist experimental strategy' to identify microbial interactions with the mammalian immune system.

While increasing the host's innate immune tone enhances resistance against infection the price of greater resistance against pathogens may be an increased risk of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and perhaps even cancer.

Neverthe- less the recent discoveries that specific bacterial species can sway immune development and alter the risk of inflam- mation and reduce the risk of certain infections suggest that microbiota manip- ulation has great potential as a medical intervention for a wide range of diseases including cancer inflammatory bowel dis- ease arthritis and microbial infection.
