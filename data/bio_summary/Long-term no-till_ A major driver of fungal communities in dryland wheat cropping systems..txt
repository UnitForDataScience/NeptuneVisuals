effects of tillage and year on soil fungal communities within each location as assessed with permanova.general communities sampled in 2014 had greater fungal richness and diversity than those from 2013 or 2012 suggesting that yearly or seasonal environmental variation has a significant impact on fungal diversity.

in contrast to the pcfs or cook farms the kambitsch loca- tion tended to have greater diversity when assessed by the inverse simpson's index suggesting greater evenness of fungal communities under ct at this location.variation in fungal genera among tillage practicesthe relative abundances of fungal genera often varied significantly among tillage treatments locations and years  .

tillage treatment was a significant factor determining fungal rich- ness p  0.02 where fungal communities from nt fields tended to have a greater number of otus than those from ct fields for the pcfs and cook farm.

tillage can have a profound effect on micro- bial communities and soilborne fungal pathogens such as rhizoctonia.

we compared the fungal communities in long-term no-till nt plots adjacent to conventionally tilled ct plots over three years at two locations in washington state and one location in idaho us.

we used pyrosequencing of the fungal its gene and identified 422 otus after rarefication.

but a larger proportion of the fungal community is not affected by tillage and may be niche generalists.introductionsince the dawn of agriculture tillage has played an important role by maintaining a distur- bance that favors domesticated plants .

however tillage can have a detrimental effect on soil sustainability by reducing organic matter through exposure to oxygen and microbial decomposition breaking up soil aggregates and fungal networks   but most importantly by increasing soil erosion fromcompeting interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist.water and wind.

however most of the literature on amf or other fungal groups is based on phospholipid fatty acid plfa or fatty acid methyl esterase fame which quantifies broad groups of microbes based on molecules in their membranes.
