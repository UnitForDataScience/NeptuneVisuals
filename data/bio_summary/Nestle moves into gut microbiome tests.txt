In April 2016 Nestle formed part of a 14.5-million series C roundto develop Enterome's EB 8018--a novel small- molecule FimH antagonist that targets adherent invasive Escherichia coli proliferation in the gut one of the main causes of IBD.Nestle gains options to exclusively license rights to commercialize the two initial programs and Nestle's diagnostics subsidiary San Diego- based Prometheus Laboratories will bring in development and commercialization expertise to MDP to develop a biomarker and diagnostic.Also on July 11 Google-backed Cambridge Massachusetts-based Evelo Biosciences raised a total 100 million with plans to begin fiveto ten clinical trials of monoclonal microbes-- specific single strains of naturally occurring microbes--in 2018 followed by licensing a microbiome-based cancer immunotherapy from the University of Chicago in April 2016.The long-running CRISPR-Cas9 patent dis-pute over rights to the lucrative gene-editing tool has taken a new turn with the European Patent Office announcing its intention to award Merck KGA a patent for the technol- ogy.

NEWS Nestle moves into gut microbiome testsCRISPR patent estate splintersSwiss food giant Nestle has entered a partnership with French biotech Enterome Biosciences to develop microbiome-based diagnostics for inflammatory bowel disease IBD and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD.

The Microbiome Diagnostic Partners MDP announced on July 11 consists of a 5050 joint venture between the Paris-based Enterome and Nestle Health Science the Epalinges Switzerland-based Nestle subsidiary.

Nestle will invest EUR20 22.8 million in the MDP and Paris-based Enterome will grant exclusive rights to its microbiome profiling tests in all areas except immuno-oncology.

On July 25 lawyers for Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier formerly of the University of Vienna lodged an appeal with the US Patent and Trademark Office USPTO seeking to reverse a February 17 ruling that there was no interference between their patent claims and those from the Broad based on Feng Zhang's research at the Cambridge Massachusetts institute.

But the European Patent Office's decision to grant the Merck KGA subsidiary MilliporeSigma a patent makes a single winner now seem unlikely.

And in the long term as the technol- ogy evolves novel endonucleases and vari- ous flavors of CRISPR could evade even the broadest patent claims.The lawyers representing the Charpentier-Doudna side face a difficult battle as they need to convince the appeal court judges that the original USPTO appeal board's deci- sion was legally flawed.

They give a lot of deference to the decisions of the patent office Fuller says.
