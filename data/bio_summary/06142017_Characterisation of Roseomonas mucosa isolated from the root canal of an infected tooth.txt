Consequently the observed resistance to these antibiotics might also protect other pathogenic bacteria from antibiotic treatment whengrowing together with R. mucosa in multispecies biofilms in the host.LimitationsThis first report of the isolation of R. mucosa from an infected root canal and the characterisation of biofilm formation of the corresponding strain might further con- tribute to the knowledge on this emerging pathogen and its reservoirs.

the production of antibiotic resist- ance determinants or extracellular polymer matrices cru- cial for biofilm formation .In this communication we describe the characterization of a Roseomonas mucosa strain isolated during treatment of an infected root canal.

However further studies besides this sin- gle case report and initial experiments are necessary to establish that R. mucosa is a significant member of the microbiota of infected root canals and to fully under- stand its role in oral health.Authors' contributionsND carried out growth experiments and characterized biofilm formation SK isolated the strain from files of a root canal treatment WG identified the isolate and carried out antibiotic susceptibility testing TG-K was responsible for fluorescence microscopy MK and AB designed the study and wrote the manuscript.

and using MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry the corresponding bacteria were identified as R. mucosa with a score of 2.4.Table 1 Microbial species isolated from infected rootThe bacteria grew on all tested media Columbia Blood Agar LB Slanetz and Bartley with a preference on rich BHI medium.

As indicated by its name R. mucosa is characterised by a strong slime formation which might be beneficial forbiofilm formation.

A time course of biofilm formation on glass test tube gutta-percha and polystyrene microtiter plate surfaces and in LB and BHI medium revealed that bio- film formation is coupled to growth of the culture and increases with time.While glass surfaces were colonized best and stable solid biofilms were formed Fig.
