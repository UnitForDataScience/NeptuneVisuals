th2 cytokines such as il-5 and il-13 promote colonic wound healing by inducing the alternative activation of macrophages which contributes to epithelial cell proliferation.in contrast il-13 which is upregulated in the colon of patients with uc has been shown to promote theapoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells leading to mucosal barrier disturbance.as described above intestinal epithelial cells produce both physical barriers such as the mucus layer glycocalyx and cell junctions and chemical barriers including amps and the reg3 family of proteins which are regulated by intestinal environmental factors and immune cell-derived cytokines.

mice lacking myd88 in intestinal epithelial cells show decreased production of amps and mucus by intestinal epithelial cells and conse- quently they are highly susceptible to experimental colitis and enteric bacterial infection.7 mice deficient in il-22 that promotes the production of amps by intestinal epithelial cells also show a high sensitivity for dss colitis.

epithelial apoptosis is a prominent feature of the epithelial barrier disturbance in intestinal inflammation effect of pro-inflammatory interleukin-13 on epithelial cell function.

between intestinal environmental factors including gut microbes and host immunity there exist intestinal epithelial cells and several mucosal barriers covering epithelial cells such as the mucus layer containing antimicrobial molecules.

intest- inal epithelial cells which include absorptive epithelial cells goblet cells and paneth cells have two major roles 'segregation' and 'mediation' to maintain a healthy relationship between gutmicrobiota and host immunity.

these barriers are divided into two subtypes physical barriers and chemical barriers.physical barriers include the mucus layer covering the intestinal mucosa the glycocalyx on the microvilli of absorptive intestinal epithelial cells and the cell junctions firmly linking intestinal epithelial cells.

these microbes utilize polysaccharides of muc2 as an energy source therefore the absence of dietary fiber which is the main energy source of intestinal bacteria leads to the expan- sion of mucin-degrading species resulting in the increase of inner mucus degradation.regarding the mechanism by which the inner mucus layer segregates intestinal bacteria and epithelial cells in the large intestine various antimicrobial molecules including immuno- globulin a iga and the defensin family of proteins that are transported or produced by intestinal epithelial cells are thought to be involved in the protection against bacterial invasion of the inner mucus layer.

in this context a recent study identified a highly glycosylated glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi-anchored protein called ly6 plaur domain-containing 8 lypd8 as a novel molecule con- tributing to the segregation of intestinal bacteria and intestinal epithelia in the large intestine.lypd8 which is anchored to the intestinal epithelial cells in the uppermost epithelial layer is constitutively shed into the intestinal lumen and preferentially binds to flagellated bacteria from genera such as escherichia proteus and helicobacter thereby inhibiting the bacterial invasion of the colonic epithelia.

mice lacking lypd8 demonstrate the disappearance of the bacteria-free space just above the epithelial layer of the colon indicating that lypd8 is critical for thesegregation of intestinal bacteria and colonic epithelia.even if bacteria can penetrate the inner mucus layer the glycocalyx a meshwork of carbohydrate moieties of glycolipids or glycoproteins including transmembrane mucins faces invading bacteria as a barrier on the epithelial cell surface.

recent reports revealed that the expression of cell junction-associated mole- cules including occludins and claudins is upregulated by indole a metabolite of dietary tryptophan from commensal bacteria possessing tryptophanase after pregnane x receptor stimulation.in the small intestine where there are fewer goblet cells than in the large intestine chemical barriers including antimicrobial peptides amps and the regenerating islet-derived 3 reg3 family of proteins produced by intestinal epithelial cells particularly paneth cells have critical roles in the segregation of intestinal bacteria and epithelial cells.

il-17 and il-22 produced by th17 cells or type3 innate lymphoid cells ilc3 upregulate the secretion of amps and reg3 family proteins by intestinal epithelial cells.in addition il-6 derived from intraepithelial lymphocytes enhances intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and contributes to healing from mucosal injury.

in mucosal injury activated macrophages differentiated from monocytes recruited to the mucosal wound site trigger the colonic epithelial progenitor niche with direct cell-cell contact to promote epithelial regeneration which helps in the recovery of the mucosal barrier.

therefore intestinal epithelial cells stimu- lated by gut environmental factors interact with host immune cells and modulate gut immune cell responses.segmented filamentous bacteria sfb are commensal bacteria found in the mouse or rat intestine most of which attach to intestinal epithelial cells in the ileum.

intestinal epithelial cells stimulated by gut environmental factors modulate gut immune cell responses by secreting humoral factors such as serum amyloid a saa and several kinds of cytokines a b. intestinal epithelial cells also inactivate bacteria-derived stimulators to host immune cells such as adenosine triphosphate atp to regulate excessive host immune responses c. in addition m cells which specialize in the uptake and delivery of antigens in the intestinal lumen contribute to the induction of antigen-specific iga responses by delivering bacterial or dietary antigens to dendritic cells dcs d.epithelial cells .in addition sfb stimulate il-23 receptor-dependent il-22 production by activated ilc3.
