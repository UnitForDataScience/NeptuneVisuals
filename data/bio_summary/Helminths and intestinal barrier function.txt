thus the prototypic th2 cytokine il-4 added to monolayers of human colon-derived epithelial monolayers increased paracel- lular permeability while reciprocally one can hypothesize that alternatively activated macrophages induced by il-4 production after helminth-infection could via their tissue reparatory capacity enhance epithelial barrier function.collectively the available evidence suggests that helminths can increase gut permeability by abrading the epithelium directly that defined helminth-derived products may affect the structure of the tight junction in general there is a paucity of data here and that immune activity during or after infection cansignificantly compromise or enhance epithelial perme- ability .helminth and host-derived factors impact on intestinal barrier functiondefining the intestinal barrier as mechanisms that prevent material in the lumen entering the circulatory system there is a vast literature on helminth-evoked changes in intestinal barrier function gobletmucus trefoil factorspaneth cellsdefensinsantimicrobial peptides serotonin and mucosal immunity are all components of the barrier that can change signifi- cantly cell number andor function following infec- tion with parasitic helminths and each is worthy of a focused review.enhanced epithelial cell turnover may contribute to the hosts' anti-helminth defensesand this has the concomitant benefit of clearing any microbe-infected enterocytes.

finally we underscore that the gut is an ecosystem and that the myriad of cells that reside there or are recruited in response to infection form an integrated circuit while challenging we contend that the holistic approach of integrated neuroimmunophysiologyneeds to be applied if we are to understand the complex regulation of intestinal barrier function or indeed any aspect of gut function and the consequences of perturbed barrier function for gut homeostasis and disease.disclosure of potential conflicts of interestno potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.acknowledgmentswe thank dr. g. leung for the artwork in .fundingmckay holds a canada research chair tier 1 in intes- tinal immunophysiology in health and disease and whose research is supported by grants from the canadian institutes of health cihr the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada nserc and crohn's colitis canada ccc.

pamps pathogen-associated molecu- lar patterns may keep the gut primed to respond to invasion by pathogens.recent studies have begun to catalog changes in the gut bacteria that occur following infection with hel- minth parasites typically those that seek to establish in the intestine .it is unclear if hel- minth-regulation of the enteric microbiota is a direct effect since they are in the same location or indirect via the host anti-worm immune response for exam- ple il-25 mobilized in response to helminths could suppress synthesis of il-22 and vice versa which is an important regulator of the epithelial response to bacteria promoting mucin and anti-bacterial peptide synthesisand under certain circumstances may aid worm expulsion from the gut.functional consequences of perturbation of the enteric microbiome are largely unknown with a nota- ble exception being that the suppression of airwaysinflammation observed in h. polygyrus-infected mice was dependent on bacteria-derived short-chain fatty acids.intriguingly the decreased barrier function reported following infection and rejection of t. spiralis was ameliorated by treatment with probioticsthe probiotic treatment also resulted in lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines returning us to the conundrum of whether the probiotic effect was by interaction at the level of the enterocyte or the immune system.

the potential of helminth-evoked changes in the enteric nervous systemand the regulation of mucus production by acetylcholine should also be pursued.finally recent work has shown that goblet cells can sense their microenvironment and pass this information to den- dritic cellsthe implications of this for barrier func- tion and host-parasite interactions are poorly understood.paneth cells are a significant source of anti-micro- bial peptides in the mammalian small intestine and infection with nematodes and s. mansoni was shown to induce paneth cell hyperplasiawhile toxocara canis nematode infection increased the number of secretory granules in paneth cells.helminth-regula- tion of anti-microbial peptides has implications for the overall barrier function of the gut as this will affect the composition and structure of the commensalmicrobiota.

intuitively one can accept that the interplay between these species and the host is critically impor- tant in controlling gut function yet knowledge of inter-species communication or cross-kingdominteractions in the regulation of gut function is rudimentary.a normal commensal microbiota is considered an extrinsic component of the intestinal barrier.

the drop in ter in secondary infections with h. poly- gyrus was accompanied by a small increase in the epithelial expression of the pore-forming claudin-2 and the barrier defect was absent in il-13ra1 mice.increased il-13 production following infec- tion with helminths can be from innateor adap- tive immune cells and while il-13 has beenshown to directly decrease the barrier function of epithelial monolayers in vitro it is unclear if helminth-evoked il-13 targets the epithelium directly or via other immunoregulatory activities.with respect to th2-type cytokines mobilized in response to infection with helminths many of these have the potential to affect epithelial barrier function.

mansoni was ruled out using mmcp1 mice.given that the 2 most consistent findings observed in humans having irritable bowel syndrome ibs are increased gut permeability and mastocytosis one wonders if helminth therapy aimed at treating auto- inflammatory diseasemight predispose an individ- ual to ibs-like symptoms.the adaptive immune response that follows infection with helminth parasites can also partici- pate in the increase in gut permeability.
