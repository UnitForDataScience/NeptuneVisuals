Respiratory path- ogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus are commonly isolated from CRS patients  while pathobionts such as Corynebacterium tuberculos- tearicum also found to be enriched in CRS patients have demonstrable capacity to induce sinus mucosal infection in murine models However these pathogens do not exist in isolation but in mixed-species mucosal microbiota the composition and activities of which we hypothesize explain the substantial clinical and immunological hetero- geneity observed in CRS patients.Previous efforts to explain CRS patient heterogen- eity have been based on clinical  immunologic - or pathologic  endotypes though these studies have been relatively small and focused on specific immune cell populations or clinical features.

IL-5 is a potent activator of eosinophils the dominant immune cell type in polyp tissue in West- ern populations of CRS patients  Furthermore these patients also had increased levels of IFN-g Kruskal-Wallis p  0.017 q  0.107 which has been associated with non-eosinophilic polyposis Collectively these findings indicate that distinct dys- biotic pathogenic bacterial microbiota states exist in CRS patient sub-groups that differ in relative risk for polyposis and induce discrete immune responses re- lated to their clinical phenotypes.DiscussionClinical diagnosis of CRS is somewhat subjective and often does not correlate well with patient outcomes  Im- proved stratification of patients offers the opportunity to better tailor therapeutic regimens and advance towards the ultimate goal of personalized therapy.

Despite these limitations the mi- crobial and immunological features described herein provide an explanation for CRS patient heterogeneity and provide a foundation for improved understanding of how distinct pathogenic sinus microbiota may col- lectively and distinctly drive mucosal disease processes in CRS patients.ConclusionsHeterogeneity among CRS patients is poorly understood and represents a significant barrier to disease treatment and to the development of more effective therapies.

Table Discrete pathogenic sinus microbiota exists in CRS patients We postulated that the microbiota dysbiosis exhibited by CRS patients does not represent a single state but rather a gradient of dysbioses punctuated by a limited number of distinct pathogenic microbiota compositional states.
