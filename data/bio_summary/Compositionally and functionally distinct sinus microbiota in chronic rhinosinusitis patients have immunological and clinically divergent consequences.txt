respiratory path- ogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus are commonly isolated from crs patients  while pathobionts such as corynebacterium tuberculos- tearicum also found to be enriched in crs patients have demonstrable capacity to induce sinus mucosal infection in murine models however these pathogens do not exist in isolation but in mixed-species mucosal microbiota the composition and activities of which we hypothesize explain the substantial clinical and immunological hetero- geneity observed in crs patients.previous efforts to explain crs patient heterogen- eity have been based on clinical  immunologic - or pathologic  endotypes though these studies have been relatively small and focused on specific immune cell populations or clinical features.

despite these limitations the mi- crobial and immunological features described herein provide an explanation for crs patient heterogeneity and provide a foundation for improved understanding of how distinct pathogenic sinus microbiota may col- lectively and distinctly drive mucosal disease processes in crs patients.conclusionsheterogeneity among crs patients is poorly understood and represents a significant barrier to disease treatment and to the development of more effective therapies.

table discrete pathogenic sinus microbiota exists in crs patients we postulated that the microbiota dysbiosis exhibited by crs patients does not represent a single state but rather a gradient of dysbioses punctuated by a limited number of distinct pathogenic microbiota compositional states.

fold change in gene expression compared to healthysubjects was used to generate a multivariate immune response profile for each subject.each crs ds group exhibited a significantly distinct host immune response the specifics of which varied across crs patient sub-groups fig.

previous crs microbiota studies have described high inter-patient taxonomic variability and dominance of com- mon respiratory pathogens corynebacterium staphylococ- cus pseudomonas and anaerobes such as fusobacterium and members of prevotellaceae -these gen- era also feature prominently in our study but we expand upon these findings to demonstrate that these respiratory pathogens co-associate with distinct and reproducible microbial partners and explain a large proportion of theobserved inter-personal microbiota variation in crs patients.

this study validates and extends previous findings that show collapse of mucosal-associated microbiota in crs patients here we demonstrate that crs microbiota can exist in at least four compositional states that are predicted to have distinct functional attributes correlate with distinct host immune responses and asso- ciate with differential risk for nasal polyps an important clinical disease phenotype.
