PCA and PCoA analyses revealed that the gut microbiota in the DSS group deviated from thebaseline structure and the HQD group did not return to the level of the control group Figure 2D and 2E.

Samples of the control group indicated by a samples of the DSS group by b and samples of the DSSHQD group by c. HQD Huangqin decoction.orders of microflora.

Furthermore the results in Figure 5A-5C show that the relative abundance of Bacteroides Odoribacter and Prevotellaceae uncultured in the DSS group was markedly higher than in the control group and there was no statistical difference compared with the DSSHQD group.

The relative abundance of Lactococcus was higher in the DSSHQD group than in the DSS group whereas Desulfovibrio and Helicobacter were decreased.

The mice in the HQD group experienced less weight loss compared with the DSS group mice at 7-9 days Figure 1B.

The system clustering tree showed that a significant difference existed in the three groups and the level of the HQD group was close to that of the control group Figure 2F.HQD regulates structural segregation of gut microbiota in miceHistograms illustrating the gut microbiota community structure reveal the microbial species and their relative abundance.

In our study mice with DSS-induced colitis showed no significant distinction compared with mice from the HQD treated group and only slight symptoms compared with the ABDSS group.

Compared with the control group the levels of TNF-a IL-6 IL-1b and COX-2 were significantly increased in the colon of the DSS group.

S24-7norank was found at significantly lower levels in the DSS group compared with that in the control group.

At 5-6 days the mice in the ABDSS group exhibited significant weight loss compared with the DSS group mice Figure 6B.
