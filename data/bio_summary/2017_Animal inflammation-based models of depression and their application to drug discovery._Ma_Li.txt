this sickness behavior later begins to fade away whereas depression-like behavior gains strength.

recent studies show that gf rodents display increased anxiety-like behavior  enhanced stress responses and corticosterone synthesis  as well as depression-like behavior  note however that some other studies report decreased anxiety in gf mice with increased motor activity - which may be explained by strain and test differences.

interestingly the nature of colonizing microorganisms has a direct impact on the resulting behavior for example blautia coccoides reduces anxiety-like behavior in the open-field test whereas bifidobacterium infantis reduces animal motor activity .an alternative but less studied strategy can involve target- ing microbiome via various dietary probiotics showing effi- ciency in treating of depressive symptoms in mice .
