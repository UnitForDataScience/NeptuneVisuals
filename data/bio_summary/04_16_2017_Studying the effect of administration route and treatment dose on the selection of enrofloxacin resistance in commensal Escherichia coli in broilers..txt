On top of that no plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance PMQR genes were de- tected after using a protocol described by Robicsek et al.to detect any qnrA qnrB and qnrS determinants and by Park et al.to detect the aac60- lb-cr determinant.Using this strain a spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutant strain E. coli IA31 was derived as previously described.Using IA31 and the same technique a bacteriologically non-fit E. coli IA50 enrofloxacin- resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit E. coli IA66 enrofloxacin- resistant strain were created Table .

E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as a control strain to identify any amino acid changes when compared with E. coli IA31.refjWP001281242.1jamino acid53-133NC78 GD80 SR1573843-1574108MPC mgL0.5120.51210241024aIn vitro control strain all changes at the amino acid level will be enumerated according to this strain.bEnrofloxacin-susceptible strain used in all in vivo experiments.cEnrofloxacin-resistant non-fit mutant strain.

This indicates that likely no cross-contamination occurred between the treated and the con- trol groups which suggests that the experimental set-up worked.Effect of strain in the absence of treatmentThe results from all non-treated animals Figures and  show that the animals that were inoculated either with a 1001 ratio of the fit resistantfit susceptible strain Experiment 2 or with the op- posite ratio 1100 Experiment 3 did not show any signs of rever- sion of antimicrobial resistance towards susceptibility which suggests that for this strain there appears not to be a fitness cost due to resistance.

Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of the aforementioned variables on the selection of enrofloxacin resistance.Results The factors that significantly contributed were treatment P  0.001 bacterial fitness of the resistant donor strain P  0.001 administration route P  0.052 and interactions between bacterial fitness and admin- istration route P  0.001.Conclusions In the currently used models fluoroquinolone resistance selection was influenced by treatment bacterial fitness of the inoculation strain and administration route.

Bacterial fitness was assessed with in vitro growth competition assays between the resistant strain and the parental susceptible strain.

When comparing the strains in these studies with the strains of this paper the fit strain had a mutation in codon 80 while the mutation in the non-fit strain occurred in codon 78.

Experiment 1 inoculation with a bacteriologically non-fit resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit susceptible strain in a 1001 ratio results.

By contrast 3 weeks day 23 after inoculation the non-fit resistant strain could no longer be isolated from the samples taken from non-treated animals that had been inoculated with the non-fit re- sistant strain either in a 1001 Figure  or in a 1100 Figure  ratio.Effect of treatmentA comparison of the temporal fluctuations of the results from each treated group per experiment Figures - shows that there were considerable fluctuations in Experiments 1 and 4.

Experiment 2 inoculation with a bacteriologically fit resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit susceptible strain in a 1001 ratio results.

Experiment 3 inoculation with a bacteriologically fit resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit susceptible strain in a 1100 ratio results.
