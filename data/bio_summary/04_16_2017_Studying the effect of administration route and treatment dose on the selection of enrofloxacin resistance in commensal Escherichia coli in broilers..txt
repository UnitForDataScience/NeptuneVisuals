by contrast 3 weeks day 23 after inoculation the non-fit resistant strain could no longer be isolated from the samples taken from non-treated animals that had been inoculated with the non-fit re- sistant strain either in a 1001 figure  or in a 1100 figure  ratio.effect of treatmenta comparison of the temporal fluctuations of the results from each treated group per experiment figures - shows that there were considerable fluctuations in experiments 1 and 4. this could be attributed to the reduced fitness of the strain that was predomin- antly inoculated since the growth potential of bacteriologically non-fit bacteria is difficult to predict in vivo.after the treatment period the control groups from experiments 1 3 and 4 showed significantly lower proportions of1995100806040200day 3day 6day 9day 12day 15day 22figure 3. experiment 2 inoculation with a bacteriologically fit resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit susceptible strain in a 1001 ratio results.

on top of that no plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance pmqr genes were de- tected after using a protocol described by robicsek et al.to detect any qnra qnrb and qnrs determinants and by park et al.to detect the aac60- lb-cr determinant.using this strain a spontaneous rifampicin-resistant mutant strain e. coli ia31 was derived as previously described.using ia31 and the same technique a bacteriologically non-fit e. coli ia50 enrofloxacin- resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit e. coli ia66 enrofloxacin- resistant strain were created table .

this indicates that likely no cross-contamination occurred between the treated and the con- trol groups which suggests that the experimental set-up worked.effect of strain in the absence of treatmentthe results from all non-treated animals figures and  show that the animals that were inoculated either with a 1001 ratio of the fit resistantfit susceptible strain experiment 2 or with the op- posite ratio 1100 experiment 3 did not show any signs of rever- sion of antimicrobial resistance towards susceptibility which suggests that for this strain there appears not to be a fitness cost due to resistance.

linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of the aforementioned variables on the selection of enrofloxacin resistance.results the factors that significantly contributed were treatment p  0.001 bacterial fitness of the resistant donor strain p  0.001 administration route p  0.052 and interactions between bacterial fitness and admin- istration route p  0.001.conclusions in the currently used models fluoroquinolone resistance selection was influenced by treatment bacterial fitness of the inoculation strain and administration route.

bacterial fitness was assessed with in vitro growth competition assays between the resistant strain and the parental susceptible strain.

the reference strain showed no codon mutations resulting inamino acid changes when compared with e. coli atcc 25922. for gyra two point mutations at codons 83 and 87 took place in both ia50 and ia66 when compared with the ia31 strain.

in these studies the predominant mutation in parc was found in codon 80 accompanied in some isolates by a mutation in codon 84. when comparing the strains in these studies with the strains of this paper the fit strain had a mutation in codon 80 while the mutation in the non-fit strain occurred in codon 78. to the au- thors' knowledge only two strains with a mutation in codon 78 for parc have been reported previously in the literatureand for ia50 the exact combination of codon changes here reported is described for the first time.

the results from experiment 3 suggest that when the inoculum consists of a small proportion of fit resistant strains the treatment clearly promotes this fit strain thus allowing it to become the dominant strain.

similar effects were seen when comparing antimicrobial use with antimicrobial1996100806040200day 3day 6day 9day 12day 15day 22figure 5. experiment 4 inoculation with a bacteriologically non-fit resistant strain and a bacteriologically fit susceptible strain in a 1100 ratio re- sults.

gut colonization with a bacteriologic- ally fit enrofloxacin-resistant strain and oral administration of enrofloxacin selected more for antimicrobial resistance than col- onization with a non-fit resistant strain and parenteral treatment respectively.
