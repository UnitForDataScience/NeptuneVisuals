When grapevine cells were previously inoculated with S37 before their infection with B. cinerea this activity decreased significantly 2.55.Expression of Defense-Related GenesExpression profiles of number defense-related genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in grapevine cells suspension aftertheir inoculation with S. anulatus S37 andor B. cinerea.

Similarly cells pretreated with B. cinerea were shown to be refractory to the second application of B. cinerea while they were not refractory to an application of S37 .DISCUSSIONThe Streptomyces anulatus S37 has been demonstrated as a protector of the grapevine against B. cinerea   but molecular mechanisms involved in this interactionremains unknown.

When grapevine cells were inoculated with S37 B. cinerea a high burst of H2O2 was observed which was almost seven-fold superior at 20 min as compared to S37 or B. cinerea separately.

The treatment of grapevine cells with S. anulatus S37 B. cinerea and S37 B. cinerea activated rapidly and transiently both 45 and 49 kD MAP kinases .

Since in this study S37 or B. cinerea do not produce H2O2 data not shown we might suggest that S37 primes the oxidative burst in grapevine cells as evident by the enhanced accumulation of H2O2 after pathogen challenge.

Desensitization assays using the extracellular pH showed that once increased by the S. anulatus S37 cells became refractory to further stimulation by the B. cinerea suggesting that grapevine cells distinctly perceived beneficial and pathogenic microbes.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSPV-P and EAB designed the research.

Grapevine cells were then used to analyze the extracellular pH the H2O2 production the MAP kinase assay the cell death the defense-related gene expression and the phytoalexin production after a treatment with the S. anulatus S37 andor the B. cinerea.Control cells were incubated under the same conditions without treatment.

Data indicate viable cells without caspase activity cells exhibiting caspase activity without death markercells in the late stages of caspase activity with death marker and cells that have died via necrosis but not through the caspase pathway.RNA Extraction and Quantitative RT-PCR AnalysisCells were ground in the liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted from 50 mg of ground powder following the Concert PlantRNA reagent protocol according to the manufacturer's instructions Life Technologies.

anulatus S37 in contact with cells has no impact on the viability the FDA signal was weaker in cells infected with B. cinerea indicating disturbed cell membranes and an inhibited respiratory activity.

However when cells were inoculated with S37 then with B. cinerea the FDA signal was weak than the control but significantly higher than in cells infected solely with B. cinerea.The multi-caspase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods.
