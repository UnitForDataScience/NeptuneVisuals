Functional meta- genomics is a powerful technique for the identification of antibiotic resistance genes which have been performed on various environmental samples such as soil water and the human microflora.3-5 Novel antibiotic resistance genes have also been isolated by using functional metagenomics for example the chloramphenicol efflux gene pexA from Alaskan soil a novel gentamicin resistance gene from river sediment samples 10 novel b-lactamase gene families from the human gut microbiome the tetracycline resistance gene tet37 and the tetracycline and tigecycline resistance gene tetAB60 from the human oral cavity.4-81Department of Microbial Diseases UCL Eastman Dental Institute University College London London United Kingdom.2Department of Bacteriology Animal and Plant Health Agency Addlestone United Kingdom.3Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Liverpool United Kingdom.4Research Centre for Drugs and Diagnostics Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine Liverpool United Kingdom.Present affiliation UCD School of Biomolecular and Biomedical Sciences and Conway Institute University College Dublin Ireland.Present affiliation GlaxoSmithKline GSK Slough United Kingdom.Present affiliation ALK-Abello' Horsholm Denmark.105In this work we aimed to detect antimicrobial resistance genes from the human oral metagenome.

This is the first time galE has been shown to confer resistance against quaternary ammonium compounds and represents a novel epimerase-based global cell adaptation which confers resistance to cationic antimicrobials.Keywords UDP-glucose 4-epimerase galE enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase oral metagenome antiseptic resistance fabIIntroductionntimicrobial resistance is one of the world's major public health problems.

The human oral cavity is an environment that is constantly exposed to antimicrobials for example in food and oral healthcare products and the resident oral bacteriadevelop resistance to antimicrobials.It is estimated that more than half of oral bacteria cannot be grown in a laboratory environment.2 Therefore to ana-lyze the entire metagenome for resistance we can clone it into a replicon in a heterologous bacterial host such asE.

The compound was recently banned by the Food and Drug Administration from consumer antiseptic wash products.17Previous mechanisms of triclosan resistance include mu- tations in fabI inhibiting the formation of the ENR-NAD- triclosan ternary complex in Staphylococcus aureus E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.18-20 Overexpression of fabI is another mechanism of triclosan resistance and can be as a result of an increased expression of a native gene or acquisition of an additional copy on a mobile genetic ele- ment.2122 In one study the acquisition of fabI in S. aureus was shown to be facilitated by IS1272 composite transpo- sons designated TnSha1 and TnSha2 from Staphylococcus haemolyticus.22QACs including CTAB and CPC are cationic surfac- tants containing a centrally charged nitrogen with four alkyl or aryl groups.23 One of the important characteristics of QACs is their broad antimicrobial activity against bacteria yeasts fungi and viruses.

Coupled with their low toxicity QACs are used widely as disinfectants in various industries and environments such as food processing cleaning prod- ucts and healthcare environments.24 Their antimicrobial activity begins with the absorption to and penetration into the cell wall followed by disorganization of the cell mem- brane leading to leakage and degradation of intracellular material and subsequent cell lysis.12Several studies on QAC resistance have been reported previously including resistance in Listeria and Salmonella detected in food industries.25-27 In most cases an increase in MIC was found but this was still below the concen- tration used in industries or no cross-tolerance to other antimicrobials has been detected.

The inoculated plates were then incubated in a shaking incubator at 37degC overnight.Plasmid extraction and sequencingClones of interest were subcloned into 5 ml of LB broth containing chloramphenicol and the antimicrobials that they showed resistance to and incubated in a 37degC shaker for 18 hr.

Additional primers were designed and used for the subsequent sequencing to extend the sequences of the inserts Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Data are available online at Transposons mutagenesisTo locate the genes conferring resistance transposon mutagenesis was performed by using the Template Gen- eration System II Kit Thermo Scientific United Kingdom following the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analysis was carried out by using t-test to determine whether the amounts of cytochrome c bound to E. colipCC1BAC and E. colipCC1BACgalE at each cell density were statistically significantly different with p-value 0.05  or p-value 0.005 .ResultsFunctional screening for antimicrobial resistance genesBefore the screening the MIC breakpoints for various antimicrobials against E. coli EPI300 containing pCC1BAC vector were determined by broth microdilution method.
