Generally each indi- vidual's specimens vaginal cervical and endometrial clustered together with the exception of three endometrial samples and one vaginal sample that featured a mix of Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium that formed a cluster.There were possible sub-clusters within the CSTIV with CSTII or dominant L. gasseri within this group.

iners P  0.015 unadjusted for multiple testing.Endometrial gene expression correlated with gynecological factorsWe next assessed endometrial expression of selected genes with known endometrial function interleukin IL-1a IL-6 IL-8 Tenascin-C TN-C tumour necrosis factor TNFa and Syndecan 1 SDC1.

Additionally it is known that the vaginal microbiome and presumably also the endometrial microbiome is affected by ethnicity age pregnancy sexual ac- tivity smoking and exogenous hormones.13-17 While we were notFIGURE 3 Endometrial expression of six selected genes with known implications for endometrial pathology or function.

We propose scratching material could be harvested and tested for the endometrial microbiota and ex- pression of select endometrial genes to optimise embryo transfer timing.

The microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene amplification and endometrial expression of selected human genes by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results Sixty-five specimens from the reproductive tract of 31 women were suc- cessfully analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing 16 controls and 15 cases.

Testing for the expression of selected genes in the endometrium did not show evidence of correlation with case-control status or with microbial commu- nity composition although Tenascin-C expression correlated with a history of miscarriage.Conclusions There is a need for further exploration of the endometrial micro- biota and how the microbiota members or profile interplays with fertility or as- sisted reproductive technologies.KEYWORDS endometrium female infertility microbiota vaginawileyonlinelibrary.comjournalanzjogc 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists1BACKGROUND The vaginal microbiota has an established role in female repro- ductive tract physiology pathogen defence and function.12 In 2011 the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women was characterised by 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene amplicon se- quencing leading to the identification of five community state types CST.3 These were defined by the presence or absence of a dominant Lactobacillus spp.

Analysis of vaginal cervical and endometrial specimens after insertion of an intrauterine levonorgestrel system LNG IUS found a microbiota shift toward Lactobacillus crispatus.6 Species- specific polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis of hysterectomysamples demonstrated that the upper reproductive tract micro- biota did not correlate with selected host inflammatory mark- ers.7 Upon examining the tip of the transfer catheter used for embryo transfer during in vitro fertilisation IVF8 a lower relative abundance of Pseudomonas spp.

An endometrial biopsy was collected using an endome- trial curette and stored in 0.5 mL of RNALater Ambion Foster City USA.

These were classified together other because we assumed similar implications for endometrial gene expression as compared to hormonal contra- ceptives.
