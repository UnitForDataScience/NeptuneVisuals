additionally it is known that the vaginal microbiome and presumably also the endometrial microbiome is affected by ethnicity age pregnancy sexual ac- tivity smoking and exogenous hormones.13-17 while we were notfigure 3 endometrial expression of six selected genes with known implications for endometrial pathology or function.

generally each indi- vidual's specimens vaginal cervical and endometrial clustered together with the exception of three endometrial samples and one vaginal sample that featured a mix of corynebacterium and propionibacterium that formed a cluster.there were possible sub-clusters within the cstiv with cstii or dominant l. gasseri within this group.

iners p  0.015 unadjusted for multiple testing.endometrial gene expression correlated with gynecological factorswe next assessed endometrial expression of selected genes with known endometrial function interleukin il-1a il-6 il-8 tenascin-c tn-c tumour necrosis factor tnfa and syndecan 1 sdc1.

we propose scratching material could be harvested and tested for the endometrial microbiota and ex- pression of select endometrial genes to optimise embryo transfer timing.

the microbiota composition was analysed by 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene amplification and endometrial expression of selected human genes by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.results sixty-five specimens from the reproductive tract of 31 women were suc- cessfully analysed using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing 16 controls and 15 cases.

testing for the expression of selected genes in the endometrium did not show evidence of correlation with case-control status or with microbial commu- nity composition although tenascin-c expression correlated with a history of miscarriage.conclusions there is a need for further exploration of the endometrial micro- biota and how the microbiota members or profile interplays with fertility or as- sisted reproductive technologies.keywords endometrium female infertility microbiota vaginawileyonlinelibrary.comjournalanzjogc 2017 the royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists1background the vaginal microbiota has an established role in female repro- ductive tract physiology pathogen defence and function.12 in 2011 the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women was characterised by 16s ribosomal rna rrna gene amplicon se- quencing leading to the identification of five community state types cst.3 these were defined by the presence or absence of a dominant lactobacillus spp.

analysis of vaginal cervical and endometrial specimens after insertion of an intrauterine levonorgestrel system lng ius found a microbiota shift toward lactobacillus crispatus.6 species- specific polymerase chain reaction pcr analysis of hysterectomysamples demonstrated that the upper reproductive tract micro- biota did not correlate with selected host inflammatory mark- ers.7 upon examining the tip of the transfer catheter used for embryo transfer during in vitro fertilisation ivf8 a lower relative abundance of pseudomonas spp.

tn-c had significantly high expression in participants with history of miscarriage consistent with prior reports of an asso- ciation with recurrent miscarriage.22-25 we also detected the ex-pected differences in il-6 endometrial gene expression in women using lng ius compared to other contraceptives as this has been previously reported.2627 sdc1 has been reported as a marker of endometritis2829 and here we found that sdc1 was significantly downregulated in lng ius users.our pilot study supports that the endometrium microbiota is likely to have subtle yet important differences from the lowerreproductive tract and even the lower reproductive tract micro- biota may have an impact on infertility.

in this pilot study we sought to examine the possible association of the reproductive tract microbiota with women who have a current or recent past history of infertility.materials and methods study designwe designed a pilot case-control study of the reproductive tract microbiota of women with a recent previous or current history of infertility cases compared to women with no history of infertility controls table 1. women already undergoing hysteroscopy for a variety of reasons excluding suspected cancer were invited to par- ticipate.

plots were generated using the r package phyloseq v1.12.2.12 we compared the proportions or dis- tributions of the demographic age obstetric and gynaecological factors between the case and control groups using spss specific test indicated with the results.results case-control groups were comparable for gynaecological factorsthis was a retrospective pilot case-control examination of the reproductive tract microbiota for women with a current or past history of infertility needing assisted reproductive technologiesto conceive cases compared to women with no history of in- fertility controls table 1. the groups had similar proportions of the types of contraceptives in use endometriosis and miscar- riage table 1. however the number of live births seeking preg- nancy and age were significantly different between the cases and controls.endometrial microbiota was generally lower in relative abundance16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed on dna iso- lated from the vagina cervix and endometrium for samples where this could be successfully extracted summarised in table s2.
