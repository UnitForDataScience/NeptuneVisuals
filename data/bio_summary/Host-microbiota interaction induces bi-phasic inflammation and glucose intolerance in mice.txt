wald test with paired design implemented in deseq2 was used for the analysis of differential abundance of otus present in 50 of the samples in 13 out of the 25 fecal samples and grouped at genus level .results and discussioncolonization of gf mice produces bi-phasic glucose intoleranceseveral studies using colonization of gf mice have focused on medium-long term effect of microbiota colonization 14e28 days up to 12e15 weeks on host adiposity and glucose metabolism e. here we evaluated the effect of microbiotaehost interaction on adiposity and glucose metabolism during a period of 28 days after colonization using swiss webster mice as a model of mild obesity on chow diet in order to study the effect of microbiota on metabolism in obesity to avoid the pro-inflammatory effect of high fat diets .we colonized adult gf mice conventionalized mice conv-d by oral gavage with cecum content of age- and sex-matched conv-r mice and analyzed adiposity and glucose metabolism at five different time- points of colonization 1 3 7 14 and 28 days.

gtt and homa showed that conv-rd mice had a delayed phase of glucose impair- ment but not an early phase of glucose impairment e and f supplementary figure 5a and b. our results suggest a central role of the immune system in the host metabolic control in the early stage of the microbiota colonization process and that the early phase of impaired glucose metabolism may be related to the immature gut of gf mice.importantly colonization of gf and abx mice resulted in a similar in- crease in adiposity b after 28 days suggesting that this is not related to gut integrity or immune system maturation.conclusionsin conclusion our data reveal that the establishment of the microbial community biphasically modulates glucose tolerance in mice.

here we investigated how colonization of germ- free gf mice affects kinetics of adiposity and glucose metabolism.methods adiposity and glucose metabolism were evaluated at different time points in ex-gf and antibiotic treated mice after colonization with gut microbiota from a conventionally raised conv-r mouse.

importantly re-colonization of antibiotic treated mice displays only the delayed phase of glucose impairment and adiposity suggesting that the early phase may be unique to colonization of the immature gf mice gut.conclusions our results provide new insights on hostemicrobiota interaction during colonization of gf mice and the resulting effects on adiposity and glucose metabolism in a time resolved fashion.c 2017 the authors.

mouse physiology microbiome configuration serum cytokine levels and gene expression for inflammatory markers were performed in different tissues.results colonization resulted in a bi-phasic glucose impairment the first phase occurring within 3 days of colonization early phase and the second 14e28 days after colonization delayed phase.

principal coordinates analysis pcoa showed strong clustering by day of sampling supplementary figure 4c and d adonis for weighted unifrac p 0.001 r2 0.69 adonis for brayecurtis p 0.001 r2 0.75 and revealed that fecal communities were more similar within time points than within individual mice adonis analysis showed no clustering by mouse identification number adonis for weighted unifrac p 0.225 r2 0.06 adonis for brayecurtis p 0.376 r2 0.04. pcoa analysis also showed that the fecal microbiota became increasingly more similar to the inoculated cecal microbiota used to colonize the mice supplementary figure 3e and f and in agreement with these results we found that the number of otus shared between fecal samples and the inoculum increased with time with a successful colonization of about 82 of the inoculated cecal taxa by day 28 supplementary figure 4g and h.we also investigated the specific changes in relative abundance of microbial genera during colonization and observed significant differ- ences for 30 out of the 35 genera detected in the fecal samples supplementary table 1 and supplementary figure 4i showing that major rearrangements of the fecal microbiota took place at each time point.taken together profiling of the fecal microbiota during colonization of gf mice showed that both species richness and overall microbiota composition changed rapidly during the first week of colonization.

similar to fasting glucose levels we found that glucose tolerance was impaired during the early phase and the delayed phase compared to gf mice with the most pronounced attenuation observed 1 day post-colonization and normalization of glucose tolerance similar to gf mice levels around 7 days post colo- nization h and i. a similar trend was observed when we evaluated insulin levels during gtt supplementary figure 1c.

received august 16 2017  revision received august 28 2017  accepted august 28 2017  available online 21 september 2017 system the development of a gut microbiota also influences the regulation of host metabolic genes in the intestine thus indicating a possible link between gut microbiota the immune system and metabolism .although it is known that colonization of gf mice affects glucose metabolism and adiposity there is limited knowledge about how the development of microbiota and its interaction with the host affects adiposity and glucose metabolism in a time-resolved fashion .

interestingly we observed two separate phases of increased fasting glucose levels f. a first phase was observed within the first 3 days after colonization early phase after which around 7 days post coloniza- tion the levels of fasting glucose decreased and returned to those observed in gf mice.

in order to characterize glucose metabolism during colonization in more detail we performed glucose tolerance tests gtt at each time point.

after 14e28 days of colonization we observed weight gain a associated with increased adiposity b epididymal fat pad ewat weight c and increased adipocyte size d and e. these findings are likely secondary to microbiota-induced increase of energy harvesting from diet after colonization in the host .next we investigated how glucose metabolism was affected during the establishment of the gut microbiota community.
