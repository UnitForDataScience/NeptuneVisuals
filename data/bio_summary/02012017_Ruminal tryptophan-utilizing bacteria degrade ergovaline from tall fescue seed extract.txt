The results of the current study suggest that proliferation of a specific population of tryptophan-utilizing bacteria could be responsible for the degradation of ergovaline in the rumen.Predominant tryptophan-utilizing bacteria from the highest enrichments containing fescue seed extract after 48 h of incubation were also characterized and identified Table 1.. All 3 isolates were Gram-positive spore form- ing rods that produced ammonia from tryptophan but notCato et al.

1993 who observed a linear decline in ergova- line concentrations over 48 h in the soluble fraction of a rumen fluid fermentation of toxic endophyte-infect- ed tall fescue plant material ex vivo.984Harlow et al.Previous research has demonstrated that toxic com- pounds including ergot alkaloids are liberated from plant material by ruminal fermentation De Lorme et al.

The goats had previously received endophyte-infected tall fescue seed but the seed had not been included in the diet  1 y when the samples were taken.Media CompositionThe basal medium contained per liter 240 mg KH2PO4 240 mg K2HPO4 480 mg Na2SO4 480mg NaCl 64 mg CaCl2 x 2H2O 100 mg MgSO4 x7H2O 600 mg cysteine hydrochloride with additional vitamins and trace minerals as previously described Russell et al.

The suspensions were incubated as described above for 48 h. Samples were collected via tuberculin syringes at 0 24 and 48 h of incubation for bacterial enumeration and ergovaline analysis.Total tryptophan-utilizing bacteria and HAB were enumerated in anaerobic basal liquid medium with added tryptophan 15 mg mL-1 or added Trypticase 15 mg mL-1 and Casamino acids 15 mg mL-1 re- spectively Russell et al.

The results of this study indicate which rumen bacteria may play an important role in ergovaline degradation and that microbiological strategies for controlling their activity could have ramifications for fescue toxi- cosis and other forms of ergotism in ruminants.Key words ergot alkaloids ergovaline microbial degradation protein ruminant tall fescue toxicosisc 2017 American Society of Animal Science.

Consequently ruminants that graze toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue can exhibit poor reproduction and growth performance that can annually cost the forage-based livestock industry well over a billion dollars Strickland et al.

Ergovaline is the er- gopeptine produced in the greatest concentration by the tall fescue endophyte representing 84 to 97 of the er- gopeptine fraction Lyons et al.

A tall fescue seed extract was prepared as described by Foote et al.

Furthermore in vitro fermentation studies with tall fescue have demonstrated that feeding rats a whole seed diet that was previously in- cubated with rumen fluid is less toxic than feeding a seed that was not incubated which suggests that rumen micro- biota reduce toxic compounds Westendorf et al.

ruminatium HD4 and R. flavefaciens were not able to degrade ergo- valine values detected not different than zero P  0.39.The loss of dietary nitrogen as ammonia due to fermentation by amino acid-fermenting bacteria most notably HAB in the rumen is considered a source of nutritional inefficiency in ruminant production systems and also a source of environmental pollution Tedeschi et al.
