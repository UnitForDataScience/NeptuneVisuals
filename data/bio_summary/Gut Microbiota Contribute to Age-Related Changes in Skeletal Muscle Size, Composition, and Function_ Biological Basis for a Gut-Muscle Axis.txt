We will begin by reviewing the more well-recognized impact of gut microbiota on skeletal muscle metabolism before transitioning to the lesser acknowledged role of gut microbiota on the regulation of skeletal muscle size composition and function.

Similarly exposure of myotubes to gut microbial-derived extracel- lular vesicles induces insulin resistance  highlighting the multitude of ways in which gut microbiota may influ- ence the metabolic function of skeletal muscle.Insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes may occur at any age but its prevalence is greater in older years  25 in persons C 65 years .

Regulation of muscle composition by gut microbiota is supported by associations between gut bacteria involved in energy metabolism and porcine intramuscular fat content .

Interpreted as a whole these findings advocate that exercise training is an effective means to promote beneficial changes in gut microbial health that seem to reduce circulating inflammation and support the maintenance of muscle mass and function.Establishing an Aging Gut-Muscle Communication AxisInspection of the existing literature suggests that gut microbiota may play an important role in influencing aging skeletal muscle health Fig.

We propose regulation of skeletal muscle by gut microbiota to occur in an endocrine manner beginning with a disturbance in gut homeostasis and culminating with alterations in skeletal muscle char- acteristics.

Specifically advancing age is characterized by a dysbiosis of gut microbiota that is associated with increased intestinal permeability facilitat- ing the passage of endotoxin and other microbial products e.g.

This review will summarize existing literature suggesting cross-talk between gut microbiota and skeletal muscle health with emphasis on the significance of this axis for mediating changes in aging skeletal muscle size composition and function.Keywords Skeletal muscle  Gut microbiota  Aging Inflammation  SarcopeniaIntroductionSkeletal muscle is the largest organ in the human body comprising  40 of total body mass .

One system with tremendous potential to impact host physiology is that of gut microbiota the bacteria archaea viruses and eukary- otic microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract .

The transformative power of gut microbiota on human physiology was emphasized in a groundbreaking study by Ridaura and colleagues  who demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplant from obese humans into lean animals precipitated body composition shifts consistent with the phenotype of their donor highlighting the transmissible effects of metabolic phenotype via microbial exchange.The human body is composed of an estimated 30 trillion cells living in symbiosis with diverse microbial commu- nities .
