The- se results suggest that parapsoriasis is not associated with significant alterations in the cutaneous bacterial microbiome.Key words skin microbiome cutaneous microbial diversity cutaneous microbes large-plaque parapsoriasis small-plaque parapsoriasis cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.Accepted Feb 7 2017 Epub ahead of print Feb 8 2017Acta Derm Venereol 2017 97 685-691.Corr Alexander Salava Department of Dermatology and Allergology Helsinki University Hospital Meilahdentie 2 FIN-00029 Helsinki Finland.E-mail ovel molecular techniques have greatly improved our knowledge of the skin microbiome 1.

Considering the previously known association of the skin microbiome and cutaneous immune defence 29 30 it could have been expected that lesional pa- rapsoriasis would have an effect on the microbiome or vice versa local or systemic immunological factors of the patients would have had an effect on the cutaneous microbiome 31.In recent studies it has been demonstrated clearly that the composition of the skin microbiome is influenced by the host's native and adaptive immune system due to a constant interaction 32.

In other words the microbiome was more alike between the same patient's samples even though one was from lesional and the other from healthy skin than compared with the samples of other patients regardless of samplelesion status or large-small-plaque parapsoriasis type.Skin microbiome in parapsoriasis689Comparisons of specific taxaDESeq2 was used to search for differentially abun- dant taxa between the sample types healthy skin vs. parapsoriasis lesion.

Salava et al.could offer new insight into parapsoriasis and cutaneous lymphomas 43.The role of the skin microbiome in parapsoriasis remains uncertain but it would be important to further define how the microbiome changes during disease progression and to undertake metabolomics studies.

Since parapsoriasis often precedes mycosis fungoides 10 which is the most common form of CTCL the aims of this study were to investigate whether parapsoriasis lesions would have a different skin surface microbiome compared with the individual's healthy non-lesional skin sites and to explore the association of any specific bacteria with the chronic T-cell proliferation underlying parapsoriasis.

Considering that the overall skin microbiota in our subjects appear to be similar to those found in subjects with healthy skin in many previous studies 28 the results of the current study suggest that overgrowth of any specific bacterial genus is not driving parapsoriasis nor does parapsoriasis alter human skin bacterial communities.While parapsoriasis belongs to the spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases of the skin the evolution of parapsoriasis is strongly influenced by the host's immune response.

The skin microbiome is almost as diverse as the gut microbiome and might affect the risk of several diseases including cancer 40.Multiple reasons may explain why the skin micro- biome in the patients' lesional parapsoriasis skin in our patient cohort showed no variation compared with their healthy control skin.

Statistical comparisons of the relative abundances of the 5 Stap- hylococcus oligotypes did not reveal any differences between plaques and healthy skin or parapsoriasis subtypes data not shown.DISCUSSIONTo our knowledge this is the first publication on the skin microbiome in parapsoriasis.

The role of Staphylococci has not been investigated in parapsoriasis earlier but because of the fact that parapsoriasis belongs to the spectrum of cutaneous lymphoproliferative dis- orders and often precedes mycosis fungoides the most prevalent type of CTCL 10 we expected to see changes in the skin microbiome.

There was no sta- tistically significant difference either between healthy control and lesional parapsoriasis skin Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test p  0.34 for both indices or between the small and large-plaque parapsoriasis groups p  0.57 for both indices.In all patients the microbial communities on lesional parapsoriasis skin and healthy control skin were very similar.
