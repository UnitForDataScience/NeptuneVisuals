Aboveground plants may interact with microbes insect herbivores birds and other plants that constitute the phyllo- sphere see  and influence plant growth and development .

Belowground plant roots grow in a highly dynamic environment containing fungi bacteria nematodes invertebrates parasitic plants and the roots of neighboring plants  Key Figure.

In particular the specific rhizosphere microbiome has a pivotal role in plant nutrient and water acquisition and the ability of the plant to cope with abiotic stresses such as drought salinity and high andor low temperatures and can provide the plant with protection against pests and diseases.

Independently of nutrient status it appears that plants may partially control the levels of colonization by regulating the production of SLs because plants well colonized with AM fungi or rhizobia display a reduction in their SL biosynthesis .In addition to these well-known symbioses plants can interact with many other benign or beneficial microorganisms present in the rhizosphere including ectomycorrhizal fungi fungal endophytes such as Trichoderma spp.

However given the mobility of SLs both inside and outside the plant as well as their role in plant development an understanding of their influence on plant interactions with other organisms is essential for future endeavors.

ReviewStrigolactones in Plant Interactions with Beneficial and Detrimental Organisms The Yin and YangJuan A. Lopez-Raez1Ken Shirasu2 3Strigolactones SLs are plant hormones that have important roles as modu- lators of plant development.

These interactions are influenced by chemical communication between the host plant and its associated microbiome particularly by the production and exudation of secondary metabolites by the plant into the rhizosphere .

They may be beneficial to the host plant either nutritional or affecting tolerance andor resistance to different stresses as in the case of arbuscular mycorrhizal AM fungi Trichoderma rhizobia and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria PGPR.

Plant interactions may also be detrimental causing damage or disease to the host plant as in the interaction with pathogenic bacteria or fungi oomycetes nematodes or root parasitic plants.

In all these plant interactions chemical communication between the plant and the other organism is essential.
