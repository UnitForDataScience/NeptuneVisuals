it is unclear whether these observed differences can be partly or primarily attributed to the observed differences in cervical insufficiency as described above.in turn preterm birth and complications related to prema- turity also account for a higher percentage of infant deaths among non-hispanic black women 42.5 compared to non- hispanic white women 30.8. these figures also translate into higher overall infant mortality rates among non-his- panic black women compared with non-hispanic white women 11.5 per 1000 vs. 6.1 per 1000. though overall infant mortality rates in the united states have decreased since 1960 the racial gaps in infant mortality rates have widened since that time.

one study of 472 women eligible for 17-ohpc found that non-hispanic black women had increased rates of non- adherence to 17-ohpc 70 vs. 91 for non-hispanic whitewomen defined as missing more than one dose initiation of therapy 420 weeks' gestation or discontinuation of therapy prior to 37 weeks' gestation.these findings were similar to those of timofeev et al.who found that african-american women initiated 17-ohpc later and discontinued them earlier compared with caucasian women.

the authors found that the odds for early preterm birth o32 weeks were decreased in obese african-american women compared to normal weight african-american women or 14 0.23 95 ci 0.08-0.70 in contrast risks of early preterm birth were increased in obese caucasian women compared to normal weight caucasian women or 14 2.30 95 ci 1.32-4.00.differences in biological responsein a large study evaluating the ability of multiple inflamma- tory biomarkers to predict preterm birth in multiple compart- ments amniotic fluid fetal plasma and maternal plasma overlap between biomarkers in the combined analysis cau- casian-only analysis and african-american only analysis was uncommon across the measured compartments.

since the best described risks are associated with non- hispanic black women and findings among women of other races are less consistent review of women of other races are acknowledged but are beyond the scope of the current review.epidemiology of disparitiesdefining race and ethnicitydefining the problem of preterm birth is challenging because many studies of racial disparity in preterm birth use incon- sistent definitions and interchange the terms 'race' and 'ethnicity.'

in pregnancy the micro- biome of multiple sites has been studied--including the mouth gut placenta and vagina.emerging evidence sug- gests that composition of the microbiome in the mid-trimes- ter differs among women destined to deliver preterm among those with preterm premature rupture of mem- branesand among those with and without chorioamnioni- tis.further though some studies have found the majority of women--regardless of maternal race--have a lactobacil- lus-dominant vaginal microbiomesome report that afri- can-american women are more likely to have a diverse vaginal microbiome e.g.

it has been hypothesized that non-hispanic black women have distinct preterm birth phenotypes compared to non-hispanic white women.

in a large meta- analysis including 11 trials n 14 1899 women of women at increased risk for preterm birth due to a prior spontaneous preterm birth progesterone supplementation with either 17- ohpc or vaginal formulation was proven to reduce several risks related to prematurity including the risk of birth o37 weeks relative risk rr 14 0.55 95 ci 0.42-0.74 o34 weeks rr 14 0.31 95 ci 0.14-0.69 neonatal death rr 14 0.45 95ci 0.27-0.76 use of assisted ventilation rr 14 0.40 95 ci 0.18-0.90 necrotizing enterocolitis rr 14 0.30 95 ci 0.10- 0.89 and neonatal intensive care unit admission rr 14 0.24 95 ci 0.14-0.40.unfortunately disparities are also seen in response to treatment for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth.

timofeev also found that african-american women receiving 17-ohpc carried a more than 2-fold greater risk of recurrent ptb compared to cau- casian women receiving 17-ohpc.

reports of electricity disconnection during pregnancy were more common among white women com- pared to black women.

despite this 16.7 of black women delivered preterm and 11.3 of white women delivered preterm p o 0.007. after statistical modeling incorporating various sociodemographic factors the authors concluded that race could explain only 4 of the variance in gestational age and the majority of the disparity remained unexplained.the interpregnancy interval defined as the duration between birth of one pregnancy and conception of the subsequent pregnancy has been evaluated as a potential risk factor for preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcomes.

a short inter- pregnancy interval less than 6 months irrespective of under- lying preterm birth risk is an established risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth women with short interpregnancy intervals have up to a 40 risk of preterm birth.severalresearchers have investigated whether variation in the inter- pregnancy interval can explain some of the racial disparity in birth outcome as many have observed shorter interpregnancy intervals among non-hispanic black women.

there is a clear familial predisposition to preterm delivery women with a first degree relative with a preterm birth and those women who themselves were delivered preterm carry an increased risk for preterm birth.

in a stratified analysis the 'cc' genotype was protective against preterm birth among european-americans or 14 0.68 95 ci 0.51-0.91 but there was no apparent effect in african-americans or 14 1.01 95 ci 0.72-1.33.in another large study of 1536 single-nucleo- tide polymorphisms snps researchers found 7 genes involved with inflammation extracellular remodeling and cell signaling to be associated with prematurity in african- american women the strongest relationship was found with the protein kinase c-alpha prkca gene.recently researchers have broadened investigations pastevaluation of genotype to compare epigenetic changesbetween women delivering preterm compared to at term.

non-hispanic black women have a 2-fold greater risk for preterm birth compared with non-hispanic white race.

mothers who deliver preterm are at elevated risk for serious morbiditieslater in life including cardiovas- cular disease and stroke.although the preterm birth rate fell from 2007 to 2014 in the united states the rate recently increased between 2014 and 2015.even more alarmingly the gap in the rate of preterm birth between non-hispanic white and non-hispanic black women increased during this time.
