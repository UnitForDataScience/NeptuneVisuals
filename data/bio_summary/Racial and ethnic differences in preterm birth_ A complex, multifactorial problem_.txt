One study of 472 women eligible for 17-OHPC found that non-Hispanic black women had increased rates of non- adherence to 17-OHPC 70 vs. 91 for non-Hispanic whitewomen defined as missing more than one dose initiation of therapy 420 weeks' gestation or discontinuation of therapy prior to 37 weeks' gestation.These findings were similar to those of Timofeev et al.who found that African-American women initiated 17-OHPC later and discontinued them earlier compared with Caucasian women.

The authors found that the odds for early preterm birth o32 weeks were decreased in obese African-American women compared to normal weight African-American women OR 14 0.23 95 CI 0.08-0.70 in contrast risks of early preterm birth were increased in obese Caucasian women compared to normal weight Caucasian women OR 14 2.30 95 CI 1.32-4.00.Differences in biological responseIn a large study evaluating the ability of multiple inflamma- tory biomarkers to predict preterm birth in multiple compart- ments amniotic fluid fetal plasma and maternal plasma overlap between biomarkers in the combined analysis Cau- casian-only analysis and African-American only analysis was uncommon across the measured compartments.

Since the best described risks are associated with non- Hispanic black women and findings among women of other races are less consistent review of women of other races are acknowledged but are beyond the scope of the current review.Epidemiology of disparitiesDefining race and ethnicityDefining the problem of preterm birth is challenging because many studies of racial disparity in preterm birth use incon- sistent definitions and interchange the terms 'race' and 'ethnicity.'

In pregnancy the micro- biome of multiple sites has been studied--including the mouth gut placenta and vagina.Emerging evidence sug- gests that composition of the microbiome in the mid-trimes- ter differs among women destined to deliver preterm among those with preterm premature rupture of mem- branesand among those with and without chorioamnioni- tis.Further though some studies have found the majority of women--regardless of maternal race--have a Lactobacil- lus-dominant vaginal microbiomesome report that Afri- can-American women are more likely to have a diverse vaginal microbiome e.g.

It has been hypothesized that non-Hispanic black women have distinct preterm birth phenotypes compared to non-Hispanic white women.

It is unclear whether these observed differences can be partly or primarily attributed to the observed differences in cervical insufficiency as described above.In turn preterm birth and complications related to prema- turity also account for a higher percentage of infant deaths among non-Hispanic black women 42.5 compared to non- Hispanic white women 30.8.

These figures also translate into higher overall infant mortality rates among non-His- panic black women compared with non-Hispanic white women 11.5 per 1000 vs. 6.1 per 1000.

In a large meta- analysis including 11 trials n 14 1899 women of women at increased risk for preterm birth due to a prior spontaneous preterm birth progesterone supplementation with either 17- OHPC or vaginal formulation was proven to reduce several risks related to prematurity including the risk of birth o37 weeks relative risk RR 14 0.55 95 CI 0.42-0.74 o34 weeks RR 14 0.31 95 CI 0.14-0.69 neonatal death RR 14 0.45 95CI 0.27-0.76 use of assisted ventilation RR 14 0.40 95 CI 0.18-0.90 necrotizing enterocolitis RR 14 0.30 95 CI 0.10- 0.89 and neonatal intensive care unit admission RR 14 0.24 95 CI 0.14-0.40.Unfortunately disparities are also seen in response to treatment for the prevention of recurrent preterm birth.

Timofeev also found that African-American women receiving 17-OHPC carried a more than 2-fold greater risk of recurrent PTB compared to Cau- casian women receiving 17-OHPC.

reports of electricity disconnection during pregnancy were more common among white women com- pared to black women.
