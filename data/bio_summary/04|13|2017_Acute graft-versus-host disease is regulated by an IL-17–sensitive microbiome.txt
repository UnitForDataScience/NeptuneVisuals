il-17a is the most widely studied member of the family and it signals through the il-17 receptor a il-17ra.2 although il-17 was initially reported to be produced by t helper 17th17 cells3 it has since also been shown to be produced by innate cells such as gd t cells natural killer tnkt cells macrophages lymphoid-tissue inducer and t-follicular helper cells in addition to nonimmune cells such as epithelia.4 th17 cells arise from the differentiation of naive t cells mediated by il-6transforming growth factor-b and il-1 with subsequent amplification by il-21 and phenotypic stability controlled principally by il-23.5 donor cd4 and cd8 type-17 t-cell differentiation is now largely accepted as a pathological differentiation program following bone marrow transplantation bmt67 generating sclerotic chronic gvhd particularly within the skin.68in this study we demonstrate that recipient il-17a has a protective role in gvhd and that transfer of distinct intestinal microbiota from il-17 receptor deficient to wild-type wt mice transfers susceptibility to hyper-acute gvhd.methodsgo tomiceb6.il-17ra-- b6.il-17rb-- b6.il-17rc-- amgen washington dc balbc.il-17a-- theuniversity of tokyo japan balbc luciferase9 balbc 45.1 and b6.tcrd-- mice were bred in- house.

we allografted wt andil-17ra-- mice and harvested ileum tissue at day 2 and noted a significant reduction in lysozyme p andreg 3g messenger rna expression figure 5g suggesting that host-derived il-17a signaling is important for the generation of antimicrobial peptides.cohousing with il-17ra-- or il-17rc-- mice increases susceptibility to acute gvhdthe primacy of the gi tract in dictating gvhd outcomes is well established25 and increasing recent evidence has suggested an important role for the gut microbiome in this phenomenon.2627 we hypothesized that il-17ra-- mice susceptible to hyper-acute gvhd would display a unique or altered gimicrobial community and that this may contribute to the severity of gvhd in these mice.

in naive mice the gi tract showed the greatest frequency of il-17a-producing cells 0.76 vs 0.22 in lymphoid tissue figure 4a which were comprised predominantly of gd t cells and conventional cd4 t cells and to a lesser extent t-cell receptor negative tcrneg innate lymphoid t cells and nkt cells figure 4a-b.

critically the transfer of the il-17ra-- microbiota to wt mice duringcohousing was associated with the development of significantly accelerated acute gvhd in these mice relative to separately housed wt recipients median survival of 9 vs 27.5 days indicating transferrable members of the microbial community likely play an important role in disease development figure 6b supplemental table 1. in contrast no change in mortality was observed in il-17ra-- mice followingcohousing despite changes in their gut microbiota figure 6b supplemental table 2.mice deficient in the second il-17af receptor signaling subunit il-17rc also developed accelerated gvhd relative to wt figure 2b.

interestingly the gut microbiota of the il-17ac-deficient mice are capable of inducing susceptibility to acute gvhd in wt mice following transfer via cohousing.the effects of donor-derived il-17a and related cytokines in both experimental and clinical sct is becoming increasingly clear as a pathogenic immune response mediating relatively tissue predominant injury in the skin and lung.29 within the constraints of experimental mouse models these effects appear toinclude both early and late manifestations of gvhd with features of both acute and chronic gvhd.6-829 nevertheless at least 1 study has suggested that donor-derived il-17 may be protective.30 in contrast the effects of recipient-derived il-17 and signaling thereof have not been described in the sct setting.however elegant work by multiple investigators has demonstrated the importance of innate-like lymphoid cells in controlling inflammation in the gi tract.

no difference in survival figure 4d was observedbetween groups demonstrating that gd t cells were unlikely to be the il-17a-producing cell population required to alleviate hyper-acute gvhd.given the technical issues encountered and the limitation of reagents to directly address the contribution of conventional cd4 t cells innate lymphoid t cells and nkt cells to the il-17-mediated protective effect we examined the effect of depleting all il-17-producing populations from the recipient using a dt depletion strategy.

comparison across all 3 experiments revealed anumber of otus with significantly different abundance in wt mice pre- and postcohousing some displaying increased and others decreased abundance at the end of the cohousing period figure 7a supplemental table 3. the majority of these otus were from the bacterial family s24-7 recently defined as candidatus homeothermaceae28 suggesting the possibility of both antagonistic and protective rolesfor this family within gvhd pathology.to address the question of how the changed microbiota was able to lead to gvhd we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization using universal bacterial probes to localize bacteria in the gi tract of wt and il-17ra-- mice 6 days post-allosct.

given the intestinal-specificity of the disease in these animals we cohoused wild-type wt with il-17ra and il-17rc-deficient mice which dramatically enhanced the susceptibility of wt mice to acute gvhd.

furthermore the gut microbiome of wt mice shifted toward that of the il-17rac mice during cohousing prior to transplant confirming that an il-17-sensitive gut microbiota controls susceptibility to acute gvhd.

b6.il-17ra-deficient mice developed hyper-acute gvhd resulting in early mortality relative to b6.wt mice median survival of 7 vs 49 days figure 1a.

these mice in parallel with b6.wt mice were administered 3 doses of dt days -3 -1 and 1 transplanted with g-csf balbc.wt grafts and monitored for gvhd.
