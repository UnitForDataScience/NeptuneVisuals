Hence tree species that were more abundant R gene diverse and immunologically responsive showed correspondingly more extreme root growth arrest following exposure to live soil consistent with the hypothesis that those species have a greater ability to detect and respond to diverse microbes.Potentially additive effects of R gene numberThese focal tree species varied widely in their number and orthogroup distribution of R genes Table 2 apparently as a result of evolutionarily independent expansions and contractions of different R gene families Fig.

When challenged with live soil root-associated fungi in tree species with higher PR gene expression and higher normalizedprotein-coding diversity of R genes had higher relative expression of antioxidant genes median expression level of fungal antioxidant genes vs. all other detected fungal genes Table S9c in Appendix S2 one-tailed P  0.047 0.02 respectively Fig.

In roots exposed to live soil PR gene induction was positively related to the coding diversity of R genes an association that disappeared when we bypassed R gene function experimentally by applying salicylic acid SA a hormone that acts downstream of R genes to activate PR gene expression Shah 2003.

Results from additional species will be required to rigorously determine whether R gene cod- ing diversity combines with R gene number to affect pathogen resistance and NDD.DiscussionSeedlings from local populations of a taxonomically diverse sample of tree species on the BCI 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot in Panama had reduced levels of non- synonymous polymorphism in R genes and differed in a number of immune-related traits.

Increased R gene allelic diversity was therefore posi- tively associated with the ability to detect diverse pathogenic fungi present in soil and activate inducible defence responses.Defence gene activation affected root-associated microbesTo verify that species differences in PR gene expression affected plant-microbe interactions we quantified coun- termeasures enacted by root-associated fungi.

In summary the relationship between normalized protein-coding diver- sity of R genes and local population size was extreme compared with individual protein families but was replicated in one protein family that similarly mediates immunity.R gene protein-coding diversity and negative density dependenceA potential ecological outcome of reduced R gene diversity is that neighbouring plants possessing more similar R gene genotypes may be more likely to trans- mit and succumb to particular pathogen genotypes.

Hence SA treatment served experimentally to bypass pathogen recognition and directly activate antimicrobialTable 1 Study species and assembly statistics for nonredun- dant gene modelsCorrection added on 20 April 2017 after first online publica- tion The values in Median length have been modified at the request of the authorssoil microbes in live soil and ii recognition-indepen- dent SA-inducible defence.Following treatments we uprooted the 2-month-old seedlings washed the roots free of soil and flash-froze them for RNA isolations after which we pooled equalSpecies familyN gene modelsMedian length nt aaMedian read depthamounts of total RNA from each individual within combinations of parent tree N  5 and seedling treat- ment N  3 for sequencing 15 distinctly labelledBeilschmiedia pendulaLauraceae Virola surinamensis MyristicaceaeBrosimum alicastrum25 7471144 2485226 2161249 2513319 6891203 25254pools per species each sequenced in one lane Illu- mina HiSeq 2500 using 2 9 150 nucleotide pairedreads Fig.

Hence our analyses use pNpS to normalize for the neu- tral divergence of alleles Hughes  Nei 1988 assign weight to sequences according to their excess of nonsyn- onymous polymorphism and control for sequence depth- dependent SNP detectability.We used root RNA from a single individual of one ofthe focal species Dipteryx to perform PacBio single read sequencing to verify the IlluminaTrinity gene assembly in general and R genes in particular.To validate our approach we simulated the effect of a small number of founders on R gene allelic diversity using published data on Arabidopsis thaliana see Sup- porting information Fig.

Among-cohort variability in colonization by saprophytic fungi Table S7b in Appendix S2 also dif- fered significantly among tree species P  0.002 Table S7d in Appendix S2 but in a manner unrelated to pNpS of R genes P  0.95 here a two-tailed test because there is no directional prediction for the way tree immune gene diversity should affect fungi feeding extracellularly on dead tissue.We did not design the experiment to measure tree species differences in overall microbial diversity or level of colonization.

When we controlled for response to SA each gene's potential to be upregu- lated the protein-coding diversity of R genes pNpS explained variation in the expression of PR genes Table S8i in Appendix S2 after live soil inoculation one-tailed P  0.009 species means shown in Fig.
