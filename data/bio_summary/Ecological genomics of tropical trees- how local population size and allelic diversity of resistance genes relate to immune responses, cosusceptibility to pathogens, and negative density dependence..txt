a detailed description of methods is contained in the supporting information.resultsr gene allelic diversity in seedling root transcriptomesassembled transcriptomes from seedling roots yielded20 to 30 thousand nonredundant gene models in each of the six focal species table 1. deep sequencing cov- erage median read depth 50 table 2 enabled charac- terization of polymorphism in 7 to 10 thousand genes per species including substantial numbers 79-258 of r genes table 2. in all six species r genes showed highly elevated polymorphism pn ps and pnps table 2 fig.

2006. in roots exposed to live soil pr gene induction was positively related to the coding diversity of r genes an association that disappeared when we bypassed r gene function experimentally by applying salicylic acid sa a hormone that acts downstream of r genes to activate pr gene expression shah 2003. upregulated pr genes included peroxides so to verify effects on plant-microbe interactions we examined the induction of antioxidant self-defence genes in host-asso- ciated fungi after roots were exposed to live soil.

when challenged with live soil root-associated fungi in tree species with higher pr gene expression and higher normalizedprotein-coding diversity of r genes had higher relative expression of antioxidant genes median expression level of fungal antioxidant genes vs. all other detected fungal genes table s9c in appendix s2 one-tailed p  0.047 0.02 respectively fig.

results from additional species will be required to rigorously determine whether r gene cod- ing diversity combines with r gene number to affect pathogen resistance and ndd.discussionseedlings from local populations of a taxonomically diverse sample of tree species on the bci 50-ha forest dynamics plot in panama had reduced levels of non- synonymous polymorphism in r genes and differed in a number of immune-related traits.

this was likely due to the fivefold lower range in median pn among species in the tran- scriptome exclusive of r genes table 2. low values and differences in among-species abundance of poly- morphism applied also to synonymous variation and hence there was much less leverage for detecting spe- cies differences and population size effects on polymor- phism in the transcriptome exclusive of r genes.subsampling to examine r gene protein-coding diversity in relation to other functional groupswe subsampled the transcriptome to test the possibility that lumping genes into two broad categories r genes vs. the remaining transcriptome may create a deceptive result or hide important associations with population size.

increased r gene allelic diversity was therefore posi- tively associated with the ability to detect diverse pathogenic fungi present in soil and activate inducible defence responses.defence gene activation affected root-associated microbesto verify that species differences in pr gene expression affected plant-microbe interactions we quantified coun- termeasures enacted by root-associated fungi.

in summary the relationship between normalized protein-coding diver- sity of r genes and local population size was extreme compared with individual protein families but was replicated in one protein family that similarly mediates immunity.r gene protein-coding diversity and negative density dependencea potential ecological outcome of reduced r gene diversity is that neighbouring plants possessing more similar r gene genotypes may be more likely to trans- mit and succumb to particular pathogen genotypes.

hence our analyses use pnps to normalize for the neu- tral divergence of alleles hughes  nei 1988 assign weight to sequences according to their excess of nonsyn- onymous polymorphism and control for sequence depth- dependent snp detectability.we used root rna from a single individual of one ofthe focal species dipteryx to perform pacbio single read sequencing to verify the illuminatrinity gene assembly in general and r genes in particular.to validate our approach we simulated the effect of a small number of founders on r gene allelic diversity using published data on arabidopsis thaliana see sup- porting information fig.

a previous study of genetic diversity in seedlings from eight species on the bci forest dynamics plot including two of the same species sampled here found similar results allelic diversity increased with local abundance and 'maternal trees of species in high densities receive pollen from several individuals while low-density species get a lar- ger proportion of their pollen from a few individuals' hamrick  murawski 1990. this concordance with the present results hints at generality as does the commu- nity-wide relationship between abundance and ndd comita et al.

we found that small local populations with limited connectivity toa regional metapopulation had reduced r gene allelic diversity decreased defence gene induction down- stream of r gene surveillance and increased cosuscepti- bility of related neighbouring plants to species-specific fungal pathogens.
