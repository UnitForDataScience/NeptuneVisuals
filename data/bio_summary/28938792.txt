in commercially important species such as chick- ens and turkeys the microbiota has been recently re- viewed pan and yu 2013 waite and taylor  and a phylogenetic diversity census of poultry intesti- nal bacteria showed that chickens and turkeys share only 16 similarity between their respective microbio- tas at the species-equivalent level wei et al.

.3550health and disease3551information about the microbiota composition using the 16s rrna gene of the regions of small intestine in turkey species such as duodenum and jejunum we found that an investigation was carried out to identify the microbiota of heavy and light turkey flock in order to study the relationship between bacterial community composition and the insurgency of light turkey syn- drome danzeisen et al.

in- stead a more recent study investigated the temporal relationship between ileal microbiota during develop- ment and the impact of low-dose penicillin on bacte- rial community of ileum and cecum danzeisen et al.

at the ceca level differences in the bacteria gen- era present in turkeys were determined scupham et al.

it has fueled the metagenomics studies to identify the genomes of entire communities including those of uncultivated organisms using the 16s rrna gene because it is a marker for investigating bacterial phylogeny tremblay et al.
