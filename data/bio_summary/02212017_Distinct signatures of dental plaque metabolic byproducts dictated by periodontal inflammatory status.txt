periodontal pathogens may also exploit ethanolamine as a noncompetitive metabolite to outgrow oral microbes associated with periodontal health leading to a significant decrease in its salivary volume in individuals with high pisa.as the second step of this work we explored metabolic byproducts from supragingival plaque obtained from the high and low pisa groups then characterized possible metabolic signatures of supragingival plaque in the high group that is polyamine metabolism arginine and proline metabolism butyric acid metabolism and lysine degradation t5.although we removed only supragingival plaque and left subgingival plaque intact with the intention of avoiding bleeding during debridement our results seem to partially represent the metabolic signatures of the dysbiotic community as a whole.

accordingly we consider that the impact of the imbalance in gen- der distribution on the results was negligibly small as compared to that induced by the differences in pisa.in summary results of this study identified differential salivary metabolites related to periodontal inflamma- tory status and suggest possible metabolic signatures of supragingival plaque associated with periodontal inflam- mation severity.

we previously presented a prediction model of periodontal inflammation severity that uses a combination of salivary metabolomics and periodontal inflamed surface area pisa a quantitative description of the burden of periodontal inflammation which highlighted the utility of pisa for salivary metabolomics research.

additionally by removing supragin- gival plaque and calculus debridement to minimize background metabolites we identified potential salivary metabolites that reflected the severity of periodontal inflammation mostly in patients with moderate periodon- titis.

the metabolites iden- tified are listed in supplementary table s1.before analyzing the relationship between pisa and salivary metabolites we evaluated the strength of correla- tion between each clinical parameter and the pre-debridement salivary metabolic profile.

given that transition from periodontal health to disease is linked to perturbations in overall functional output including altered metabolic signatures in a perio- dontal microbial community these findings raise the possibility that salivary metabolites are surrogate indicators for metabolic signatures of the community which would be helpful for monitoring disease activity as well as untangling the complex microbial interactions that occur during formation of a periodontopathic community.meanwhile we acknowledge that gender distribution in the present study was not optimal as there were moremales in the high pisa group and more females in the low pisa group.

therefore elucidation of salivary metabolites that diminish after debridement will likely help to identify metabolic byproducts in dental plaque and provide insight into its microbial metabolism.in addition next generation sequencing techniques have been used to describe the composition of the perio- dontal polymicrobial community in great depth and previous studies have revealed the presence of an imbalance in relative abundance of members of the community associated with periodontitis termed dysbiosis in affected patients.

in either case we consider that cadaverine is likely a robust biomarker for periodontal inflammation severity regardless ofab806040200-20-40-60-10-5051015rpsrqhqw 10.50.40.30.20.136215215-55055093 1sfruu 0.493 1sfruu 0.493 1sfruu 0.4c90603006040200 cadaverine20151050180120600 hydrocinnamate 0-0.1-0.2-0.1 -0.0500.050.10.150.2rpsrqhqw 1ethanolamineuric acidfigure 1. salivary metabolites associated with periodontal inflammatory status.

along this line analysis of the saliva metabolome which represents the collection of metabolites in saliva has been proposed as an effective tool for periodontal diagnosis since collection of saliva is easy safe and cost effective with several studies reporting salivary met- abolic profiles related to periodontitis using categorical classification of the disease.

it is of particular importance to note that the association of pisa with salivary level of cadaverine was detected without debridement in the present study which had a greater number of subjects with severe periodontitis while our previous study whose subjects mostly consisted of moderate cases required analysis of post-debridement saliva samples in order to narrow down candidate metabolites that reflect periodontal inflammation severity.

of the clinical parameters tested pisa was shown to be the most reliable for explaining the variation of salivary metabolic profile suggesting that the saliva metabolome is strongly influenced by periodontal inflammatory status t2.metabolites associated with periodontal inflammatory status.

the most notable difference between the current study and our earlier pilot trial is that the focus of that previous investigation centered on detecting metabolites derived from subgingival area while the present focused more on detecting microbial-derived metabolites from which metabolic signatures of the dysbiotic community were inferred.as the first step of the present study we constructed a prediction model of pisa using pre-debridement sali- vary metabolic profile as an explanatory variant.

these findings suggest that the metabolic activities of these pathways are upregulated in supragingival microbiota of individuals with high pisa.discussionin this study we constructed a comprehensive prediction model to demonstrate the relationship between pisa and pre-debridement salivary metabolic profiles which not only validated our previous findings but presented novel biomarkers including those associated with periodontal health.
