Observed mutation rates in bacteria studied in the laboratory are thought to balance this trade-off because a wide range of microorganisms have similar low mutation rates about one mutation per genome per 300 cell divisions .Nevertheless bacterial strains with higher than expected mutation rates--known as mutators--have been found in diverse habitats.

We also identified diverse mobile elements within the mutS sequences of hundreds of environmental and clinical bacteria sug-gesting that these elements could play a role in regulating mutation rates in many bacteria.RESULTSWhole-genome sequencing revealed elevated variable and transition-biased mutation rates in V. splendidus 12B01.

Previous studies have shown that mutations often follow a Poisson distribution which assumes a stable average mutation rate   but we found that in all lineages including the hypermutators the variance in the number of new mutations across selection rounds was far greater than that expected under a Poisson model  suggesting that the mutation rate in this strain varied substantially more than rates in other commonly studied bacteria such as E. coli   .The mutations in all lineages displayed a dramatic bias toward transition mutations which accounted for 96 of observed mutations or a transition-to-transversion muta- tion ratio of 22.6 x2  3461.67 df  7 P  10-308 Table S1.

Such cooption of prophages or mobile elements for regulating host genes has been called active lysogeny and might be widespread across bacteria .One plausible model consistent with our mutation results is one in which the mobile element within mutS reversibly excises itself from the genome producing a variable and characteristic mutation rate.

In our mutator lineages that retained the mobile element mutation rates were higher and more variable than would be expected if their mutation rate were stable.

Evidence suggests that many bacteria balance this trade-off by modulating their mutation rates but few mechanisms have been described for such modulation.

Following experimental evolution and whole-genome resequencing of the marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus 12B01 we discovered one such mechanism which al- lows this bacterium to switch to an elevated mutation rate.

In a subset of these bacteria we de- tected excision of the element but not a frameshift mutation the mobile elements leave an intact mutS coding sequence after excision.

Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which one bacterium alters its mutation rate and hint at a possible evolutionary role for mobile elements within mutS in other bacteria.IMPORTANCE DNA mutations are a double-edged sword.
