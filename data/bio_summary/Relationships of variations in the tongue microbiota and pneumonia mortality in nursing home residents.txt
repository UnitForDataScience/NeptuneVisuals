Considering aspiration pneumonia pathogenesis it is reasonable to assume that tongue microbiota relate to pneumonia risk and death in frail elderly adults who reside in nursing homes.

These results suggest that the tongue microbiota composition is associated with increased pneumonia- related mortality risk in frail elderly nursing home residents.The tongue is one of the largest bacterial reservoirs in the oral cavity and tongue bacterial communities are a dominant source of salivary bacteria .

While several previous studies have focused on the relationship between tongue coatings and pneumonia  no attempts have been made to clarify the relationship between pneumonia and the bacterial composition of tongue micro- biota.

This suggests that microbiota type relates to pneumonia-related death independent of the presence of known potentially pathogenic bacteria.In conclusion the present study demonstrated that a type I tongue microbiota community characterized by OTUs that cor- respond to Streptococcus salivarius HOT-755 Veillonella atypica HOT-524 and Prevotella histicola HOT-298 was a risk factor for pneumonia-related death in nursing home residents.

Conclusions The tongue microbiota type was significantly associated with an increased mortality risk from pneumonia in nursing home residents.Keywords Oral cavity Tongue microbiota Prospective cohort Aspiration pneumonia Mortality riskPneumonia is a major worldwide health problem with high mor- tality risk in elderly adults .

The continuous exposure of the throat to dysbiotic microbiota via saliva may contribute to inflammation of the lower airways in frail elderly adults.Our previous study reported that tongue dorsum bacterial colo- nization patterns were related to pneumonia onset and the number of febrile days in institutionalized elderly adults using a terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism T-RFLP analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.

Baseline characteris- tics of the subjects according to the bacterial community types of tongue coatings are shown in .Tongue Community Type and MortalityOf the 121 subjects who demonstrated community type I microbiota at baseline 27 22.3 died and 14 11.6 experienced pneumonia- related deaths during follow-up.

This study identified differences in the relative abundances of dominant bacteria in tongue microbiota and associated these dif- ferences with risk for death among institutionalized elderly adults.
