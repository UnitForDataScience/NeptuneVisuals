Besides slightly decreased body weight and diastolic blood pressure consumptionof MFD promoted marked reductions in total circulating cholesterol - 26 P  0.0001 LDL cholesterol - 34 P  0.0001 LDL-to-HDL and Apo B-to-Apo A1 ratios - 27 P  0.0001 and - 15 P  0.0001 respectively andtriglycerides - 16 P  0.05 compared to baseline .Furthermore the MFD reduced the Reynold's cardiovascular risk score with 36 P  0.05 while the CD did not alter this risk score .

Althoughthe MFD did not significantly alter the gut abundance of these bacteria our correlation analyses of bacterial taxa with cardiovascular risk markers identified members of the gut microbiota that can be targeted in future dietary interven- tions to improve cardiometabolic risk markers.The diet is regarded as a major determinant of gut com- munity structure but in our study the effects of the MFD induced relatively small changes in the gut microbiotaFig.

Treponema an unclassified family in Bacteroidales order adjusted P  0.001 and an unclas- sified genus in Clostridaceae family adjusted P  0.05 were positively associated with blood pressure while Faecalibacterium adjusted P  0.05 and Lachnospira adjusted P  0.001 were negatively correlated.

In addition the control diet was a healthy diet formulated according to the Nordic Nutrition Recom- mendations while a more extreme unhealthy control diet may have resulted in larger differences between groups.In conclusion the MFD did not alter the gut microbiota at phylum or genus level.
