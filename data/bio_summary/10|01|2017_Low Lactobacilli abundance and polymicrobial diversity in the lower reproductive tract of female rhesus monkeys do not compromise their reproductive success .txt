a more recent article utilizing dna-based sequencing reported thatonly 4 of 11 rhesustable 3 the reproductive success of female rhesus monkeys was not affected by high nugent scores low firmicutesbacteroidetes ratios or the low abundance of lactobacilli in the lower reproductive tractatotal number of infants birthed by 10 years of age provided a measure of fecundity.bnumber of mating sessions with a breeder male needed to conceive was used as an index of fertility.creproductive histories of 15 females in study 1 were compared 7 low and 8 high nugent scores and for all 8 females in study 2 4 low and 4 high fb ratios and similarly 4 with lower and 4 higher relative lactobacilli abundance.dcategorization of the firmicutesbacteroidetesratio and lactobacilli was done with the same monkeys but the ranking resulted in two being assigned todifferent subgroups.macaques had lactobacillus sequences spear et al.

a longitudinal and prospective assessment is still warranted to verify that there is no influence of the vaginal microbiota on reproductive success.in sum the current research confirms that female monkeys have a more heterogeneous microbial community in their lower reproductive tract than typically seen in women.

thus either providing a prebiotic energy source favorable to lactobacilli or employing this taxon as a probiotic regimen appears to be sufficient to modify the polymicrobial diversity typically found in the vaginal milieu of female monkeys.our finding that 12 bacterial genera were present at 1 concurs with spear et al.

il-8 concentrations were lower but positively correlated with il-1ss p  0.05based on the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing lactobacilli were present in the specimens from all eight females but the relative abundance was lower than typically found in women figure 3. the values ranged from 3.16 to 17.32 mean  7.05. eleven other genera were also present at abundances above 1 with prevotella spp being the most common mean  7. the microbial profiles of the females were dichotomized into two subtypes based on a median split either low or high lactobacilli 5 or 6. alpha diversity tended to be greater in females with less lactobacilli but this trend did not reach statistical significance.

a lactobacilli were not predominant ranging from 3-17 and 11 other taxa were present at abundances above 1. b further categorization on the basis of relative abundance of lactobacilli 4.9 or 5 indicated only a non- significant trend for less alpha diversity in the females with the most lactobacilli.
