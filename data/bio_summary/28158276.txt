this randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effects of conventional treatment alone control with additional treatment with fmt intervention in patients with slow-transit constipation stc.

theorized that significant relief of constipation by fmt was due to restoration of intestinal homeostasis .

these findings support the hypothesis that the efficacy of fmt on constipation is at least partly dependent on its effects on colonic motility.
