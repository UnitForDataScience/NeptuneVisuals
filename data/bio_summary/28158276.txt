The Wexner constipation scale was evaluated before and 12 weeks after the intervention.

In con- trast patients who had conventional treatment had fewer adverse events than those who had FMT.The primary endpoint of an average of three or more CSBMs per week was chosen because it indicates normal bowel function and constipation.

There is also a need to improve delivery methods to increase the accessibility and acceptability of this type of treatment.ConclusionsIn adults with STC 6 days of FMT increase CSBMs per week soften stool speed up transit and improve symptoms of constipation with a cure rate of 30 higher than conventional treatment.
