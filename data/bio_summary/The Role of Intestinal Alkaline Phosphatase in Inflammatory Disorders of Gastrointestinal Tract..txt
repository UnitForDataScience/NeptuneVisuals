Several studies have examined the role of IAP in experimental colitis Table In IAP-knockout IAP-KO mice with ischemia-induced intestinal barrier dys- function the increased intestinal inflammation was observed possibly due to promotion of the bacterial translocationthrough intestinal barrier in these animals as compared to wild-type mice In another study Mart'inez-Moya et al.

They found the loss in body weight being significantly less in IAP-treated mice and accompanied with reduced colon damage as manifested in their study by a histological index of disease activity for example the crypt and goblet cell loss intestinal oedema and less severe neutrophils infiltration of intestinal wall 25.Ramasamy et al.

Diminished activity of IAP could increase the risk of disease through changes in the microbiome intestinal inflammation and intestinal permeability.

This review was designed to provide an update in recent research on the involvement of IAP in intestinal inflammatory processes with focus on IBD in experimental animal models and human patients.IntroductionAlkaline phosphatase AP is a superfamily of metalloen- zymes known to catalyse the hydrolytic removal of phosphate from a variety of molecules The mammalian AP family consists of several isozymes which can be classified as tissue- nonspecific APs TNAP expressed in bone liver and kidney and tissue-specific APs intestinal placental and germ cell type of the enzyme  .

Interestingly the expression of IAP is almost absent in thehealthy stomach but the TNAP isoform was identified at low levels in the healthy colon IAP present in the apical microvilli of the brush border of enterocytes and secreted into both the intestinal lumen and the bloodstream has been considered as gut mucosal defence factor essential for maintaining gut homeostasis Fawley and Gourlay  reviewing data from several animal and human studies have demonstrated that exogenous IAP exerts the protective effect against intestinal and systemic inflammation in a variety of diseases.

TheIAP has been shown to inhibit the activation of NF- B and its translocation into the nucleus thus preventing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines .Mechanisms of Action of IAPAmong major functions of IAP in GI tract the most impor- tant are the regulation of bicarbonate secretion and pH at duodenal surface the modulation of intestinal long-chain fatty acids LCFA absorption and the detoxification of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide LPS leading to local intestinal and systemic anti-inflammatory effects.

have shown that the IAP expression and LPS-dephosphorylating activity were dramatically decreased after two days of fasting in mice maintained at enteral feeding They suggested that the IAP silencing that occurs with starvation may at least in partFoodIntestinal lumenStimulation InhibitionFigure 1 Hypothetical model depicting the mechanism by which a brush border enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase IAP affects the intestinal microbiota the release of bacterial LPS-induced inflammation and the luminal content of ATP inhibiting the commensal bacteria of different origin.

Cario and Podolsky have collected small intestinal and colonic biopsy specimens from IBD patients and observed that TLR4 was strongly upregulated in intestinal epithelium of UC and CD patients 51.
