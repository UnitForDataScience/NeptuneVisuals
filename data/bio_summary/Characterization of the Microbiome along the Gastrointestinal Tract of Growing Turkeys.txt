ANOVA of PICRUSt data showed significant differences 0.05 in 11 KEGG pathways Arginine and proline metabolism cell division energy metabolism glycerolipid metabolism methane metabolism N-glycan biosynthesis nitrogen metabolism oxidative phosphorylation pentose phosphate pathway and transcription machinery in the caecal microbiome when comparing 6 to 10 and 10 to 16 week old birds all least abundant within 10 week old birds except RNA polymerase and transcription machinery which were at their lowest abundance in 6 week old birds and two of these pathways pentose phosphate and oxidative phosphorylation also differed between 6 and 16 week old birds pentose phosphate pathway was significantly higher in abundance within 6 week old birds compared with 16 week old birds and vice versa for gene abundances correlating to oxidative phosphorylation Figure 5A.

We also found an increase in Lactobacillus in the SI in 10 week old birds compared with 6 week old birds but numbers decreased within 16 week old birds.

Different superscripts are shown for values that differ significantly from each other P  0.05.tract microbiome it is apparent that 10 week old birds show the most difference in their GI tract microbiome as a whole when compared to 6 and 16 week old birds Figures 3 4 Table 4 Supplementary Tables 1-3 and Supplementary Figure 3.

Alpha diversity indices showed that the caecal microbiome of 6 and 16 week old birds were higher in diversity compared with 10 week old birds.Sequencing the rRNA gene of a gut microbiome is relatively simple and cost-effective nonetheless understanding the function of the microbiome is key for understanding interrelationships with the host.

Average sequence length was 415 bp Table 2.The Turkey Microbiome along the Gastrointestinal TractThe PCA plot based on OTUs showed that the microbiome of 10 week old birds was quite distinct to those of 6 and 16 week old birds irrespective of GI tract location Figure 1.

When assessing the effect of age 10 week old birds generally showed the greatest difference in their GI tract microbiome as a whole when compared to 6 and 16 week old birds.

The main observations from the PICRUSt function data were that 10 week old birds differed significantly in the function of their caecal microbiome compared to birds of 6 and 16 weeks of age.In this study we also show using next generation sequencing and QPCR that the abundance of thermophilic Campylobacter spp.

Ten week old turkeys had less Alistipes Jeotgalicoccus Parabacteroides Phascolarctobacterium and Streptococcus and more Campylobacter and Lactobacillus than 6 and 16 week old birds.

Sixteen week old birds also had more Clostridium XI Corynebacterium Facklamia and unclassified bacteria than 6 and 10 week old birds Figures 3 4 Table 3 and Supplementary Tables 1-3.

In the large intestine the D-arginine and the D- ornithine pathway were significantly different in abundance when comparing 6 to 10 and 10 to 16 week old birds highest abundances found in 10 week old birds Figure 5B.
