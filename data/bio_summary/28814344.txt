The expression of sulfonamide and fluoroquinolone resistance genes increased in the thermo- philic phase and then decreased to initial levels whereas the tetracycline resistance genes tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS expression decreased throughout.

Tar- get genes in positive controls including four tet genes two sul genes and class 1 integrons were obtained from compost DNA extracts after PCR amplification and then cloned into Escherichia coli DH5a TaKaRa.

The mix- tures were placed in the dark overnight 12-14 h. The samples were shaken for 30 min at 200 rpm in the dark the following day sonicated for 15 min and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min.

The expression of tetracycline resistance genes tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS decreased during composting where distinctive shifts in the four phases of composting were related to variations in antibiotic concentration.

By contrast hosts for tetracycline resistance genes tetM-tetW-tetO-tetS exhibited a constant decline through time.Conclusions The transcriptional patterns of a core resistome over the course of composting were identified and microbial phylogeny was the key determinant in defining the varied transcriptional response of resistome to this dynamic biological process.

It reduced the risk of emerging environmental contaminants such as tetracyclines tetracycline resistance genes and clinically relevant pathogens carrying ARGs as well as RNA viruses and bacteriophages.Keywords Resistome response Metatranscriptomics Metagenomics Composting ARGs MGEs Correspondence Equal contributors1Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory for Water Pollution Control and Environmental Safety Technology Institute of Environmental Science andTechnology Zhejiang University 866 Yuhangtang Road Hangzhou 310058 ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec The Authors.

The lack of comprehensive antibiotic resistance studies therefore provide a strong impetus to better understand the genetic context and fate of the complete resistome comprising all of the antibiotic resistance genes and their precursors  during composting as well as critically evaluate the potential of this biological treatment to attenuate anti- biotic resistance determinants and limit their dissemin- ation.

ORFs were predicted by using the gene-finding algorithm MetaGeneMark .The abundance and diversity of ARG families in the metatranscriptomic and metagenomic raw sequence data sets were analyzed by screening the antibiotic resistance protein families with the HMMER package version 3.1b1 using a collection of custom-built resistance-gene- specific profiles HMMs e value 10- 5 The detected antibiotic resistance genes and transcripts were screened BLASTP against the NCBI non-redundant database NCBInr to predict their phylogenetic origin.

The q- PCR primers for the target genes and the annealing tem- peratures used are shown in Additional file Table S2.StatisticsRedundancy analysis between environmental parameters and microbial communities Procrustes test for correlation analysis between ARGs and microbial communities and heatmap were performed in R3.1.0  with vegan  and a pheatmap package .

Consistent with the previous reports where tetracycline resistance genes were undetectable after 28-42 days of composting 14 our study further confirms that composting of raw manure is a potential strategy for not only reducing the abundance but also limiting the expression of tetracycline resistance genes.Correlation of ARG-carrying hosts with microbiome profiling during compostingChanges of the resistome are driven by shifts in micro- bial community composition a phenomenon recently established for a set of functionally described metage- nomic soil samples The phylogenetic architecture of active microbial consortia and their associated resis- tome during the composting process were analyzed and compared in the current study.
