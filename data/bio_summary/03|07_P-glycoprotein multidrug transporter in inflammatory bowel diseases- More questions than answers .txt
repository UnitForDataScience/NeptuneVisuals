in addition p-gp may also be involved in the transmem- brane transport of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin il-2 and interferon-gamma ifn-g9 however it remains to be shown how cytokine release could be directly regulated by p-gp signaling.differential regulation ofexpressionthe basal expression pattern of p-gp shows high inter- and also intraindividual variability along the gi tract with a general increase from proximal to distal parts10.

imbalanced host-bacterial interactions may alter xenobiotic metabolism via abcb1mdr1 p-gp con- tributing to intestinal inflammatory processes drug toxicity and resistance development in ibd figure 1. novel large-scale approaches including in-silico and complex computational tools79 are now needed to provide in-depth elucidation of the possible path- ways through which the gut microbiota may modify xenobiotics and vice versa as well as their combined metabolic effects via abcb1mdr1 p-gp and other transporters on host immunity and functions in ibdpathogenesis.the potential therapeutic value of abcb1mdr1 p-gp as a molecular target requires further clarifica- tion in ibd.

future studies must focus on further elucidation of the pathophysiological relevance and immunological functions of p-gp and how its ambiguous effects could be therapeutically targeted in ibd.key words inflammatory bowel diseases multidrug resistance innate immunity microbiota xenobioticsc the authors 2017. published by baishideng publishing group inc. all rights reserved.core tip altered levels of p-glycoprotein p-gp expression as well as genetic variants of abcb1mdr1 have been associated with inflammatory bowel diseases ibd.

in humans the drug transporter p-gp is encoded by the abcb1mdr1 gene located on chromosome 7q21 while in rodents p-gp is encoded by two genes abcb1amdr1a and abcb1bmdr1b.

murine p-gp shares 87 amino acid sequence identity with the human homologue6 which makes knockout ko mouse models useful to study.the secondary structure of abcb1mdr1 p-gp contains two symmetrical halves of an atp-binding domain also known as nucleotide binding domainfactor-binding sequences including specificity protein 1 sp-1 activator protein 1 ap-1 nuclear factor interleukin-6 nf-il-6 forkhead transcription factor fkhr or t-cell factorlymphoid enhancer factor tcf lef which points to complex regulation13.

upstream the nuclear pregnane x receptor pxr may control convergence between xenobiotic detoxification and innate immunity by modulating transcription of p-gp as well as activation of nacht- lrr- and pyd-containing protein 3 nlrp314 and toll-like receptor 4 tlr4 signaling15.downregulation of p-gp expression has been associ- ated with acute intestinal inflammation such as in the experimental mouse model of dextran sulphate sodium dss-induced colitis16 or in some patients with activecario e. p-glycoprotein in ibdulcerative colitis uc17.

interestingly rifaximin a non-absorbable antibiotic potentially beneficial for inducing remission in crohn's disease cd20 may antagonize tnfa- induced inhibition of p-gp via pxr21.varying levels of p-gp in the intestinal mucosa may also be attributed to circadian rhythms caused by clock gene products which - at least in part - control abcb1mdr1 gene expression22.

what commensal community if any is responsible for driving murine colitis in the context of mdr1a deficiency does mdr1a deficiency sensitize otherwise tolerogenic mucosal immune cells to specific microbial ligands andor xenobiotics how do bioactive microbial metabolites modulate xenobiotic signaling via p-gp do xenobiotic compounds directly activate tlr and other innate immune signaling pathways to control p-gp activity how is p-gp-mediated transport involved in microbial efflux from host cellsgene variants associated with ibdseveral studies have evaluated the potential associa- tion of human abcb1 gene polymorphisms with ibd susceptibility.

future research will need to look at different thera- peutic approaches either to activate underactive p-gp in order to attenuate acute inflammation or to inactivate overactive p-gp in order to overcome therapy resistance.referenceslangmann t moehle c mauerer r scharl m liebisch g zahn a stremmel w schmitz g. loss of detoxification in inflammatory bowel disease dysregulation of pregnane x receptor target genes.
