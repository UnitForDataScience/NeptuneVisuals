randomizedpatients to an animal-based diet high in saturated fat or a plant- based diet for 5 days with a washout period of 6 days.

Excess hydrogen production leads to luminal distention however only participants with IBS experience this as pain.51Investigators are now looking at the effect of a low-FODMAP diet on the microbiome with the aim of potentially individualizing and improving this diet.

investigated the effect of a low-FODMAP versus high-FODMAP diet on the microbiome and the metabolites it produces using next-generation sequencing techniques.54 In participants randomized to the low- FODMAP diet there was a significant reduction in urinary hista- mine levels.

This close and interactive relationship be- tween diet and the microbiome offers a potential for therapeutic in- tervention through the development of personalized nutrition.

The significant interindividual differences in the microbiome sensitiv- ity to other influences the sometimes temporary nature of the com- position and the lack of sophisticated techniques employed have been barriers to the detection of alterations in the microbiome which have in turn impacted on the ability to develop successful human dietary interventions.1415 However ongoing research should help to further develop our understanding of the relation- ship between diet the microbiome and disease states.Some individual foods and nutrients have been studied in greater detail than others the best studied being fiber.

FODMAP fermentable oligosaccharide disaccharide mono- saccharide and polyol SIBO small intestine bacterial overgrowth.vegetables should be part of a balanced diet.

In New Zealand fiber intakes for men 22.1 g 95 CI 21.4-22.8 g and women 17.5 g 95 CI 17.1-17.9 g19 are lower than the recommended 30 gday for men and 25 gday for women.20 If fiber supplements are required consider oatbran or ricebran supplements if the patient has a diet high in wheat.Fructose is another foodstuff important in this context.

showed that feeding mice a diet high in saturated fat but not polyunsaturated fat caused a relative increase in the number of normally low-abundance bile acid- tolerant sulfite-reducing bacteria like Bilophilia wadsworthia.23The composition of the microbiome also affects the metabolism of unabsorbed protein and carnitine.

In one study a low-FODMAP diet caused a reduction in Bifidobacterium52 while another study showed that total bacteria numbers were reduced following a low-FODMAP diet.53 However both studies looked at selective bacterial species rather than the whole community.

The researchers also found an in- crease in those on a low-FODMAP diet of a bacteria Adlercreutzia that consume hydrogen.
