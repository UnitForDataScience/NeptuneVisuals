the main findings of the study were1 the identification of ibs subgroups based on distinct microbial clusters with only one of these subgroups ibs1 showing gut microbial and some behavioral and clinical differences 2 the identification of differences in the abundance of certain microbial taxa between ibs1 and hcs and 3 the correlation of microbial taxa and imputed metagenes with structural brain alterations pri- marily in sensory integration and salience network regions in ibs1.

can gut microbial composition be used to classify ibs patients and to identify subgroups with different clinical and behavioral symptoms as recently suggested 2. is there an association between a history of early adverse life events eals and gut microbial composition 3. is there a relationship between gut microbial composition and ibs-related brain biomarkers based on past clinical literature and brain regions altered in ibs we expected to see a relationship between microbiota and emotion- related amygdala hippocampus and sensory brain regions basal ganglia posterior insula and primary sensory and motor regions.methodsparticipantsstool samples were collected at ucla from 29 right- handed adult ibs patients 22 females and 23 hcs 14 females who also underwent multimodal brain imaging studies at ucla.

pcoa indicated the presence of three groups having similar microbial profiles and these are labeled as hcs hc-like ibs and ibs1 throughout the manuscript.adonis analysis a permutational analysis of variance was performed to test for differences between groups in overall microbial composition random forest analysis was used to evaluate the degree to which fecal communities could classify group and identify features differentiating ibs microbial communities from controls.

these findings suggest a possible influence of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on specific brain structures which may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered sensory processing in ibs.identification of ibs subgroups based on microbiome diversity and relative abundance of the phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetesboth hierarchical clustering using average linkage and pcoa analysis on unweighted unifrac distances indi- cated that microbial signatures can be used to identifytwo subgroups among the ibs subjects one that has a microbial composition similar to hcs and one that shows a distinct gut microbial signature.

the finding of ibs subgroups based on gut microbial composition that had identical clinical symptoms suggests that the difference in microbial architecture is either not necessary for symptom generation in ibs or that identical clinical presentations can be caused by different underlying mechanisms one involving gut microbial alterations.

the observed gut microbial changes could be secondary to altered autonomic nervous system output to the gut changing the micro- bial environment alternatively the brain changes could be the consequence of altered signaling to the brain through microbial metabolites or both mecha- nisms may be involved sequencing depth of the microbiome may be a limitation as rare members of the microbiota may be undetected and differences in sequencing depth may affect relative distributions of microbial taxa.

we aimed to determine if subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome ibs subjects can be identified based on differences in gut microbial composition and if there are correlations between gut microbial measures and structural brain signatures in ibs.methods behavioral measures stool samples and structural brain images were collected from 29 adult ibs and 23healthy control subjects hcs.

16s ribosomal rna rrna gene sequencing was used to profile stool microbial communities and various multivariate analysis approaches were used to quantitate microbial composition abundance and diversity.

a history of early adversity has also been shown to becorrelated with brain structural changes a recent study showed cross sectional correlations between brain structure and gut microbial composition the fact that functional activity in some of the same regions somatosensory regions basal ganglia was increased when healthy women consumed a probiotic mix over 4 weeks  suggests the possibility of a link between gut microbial composition and sensory processing and integration in the brain both in healthy control subjects hcs and in a subgroup of ibs patients.by studying a group of well phenotyped ibs subjects and hcs we aimed to address three questions related to gut microbiota clinical parameters and brain signatures1.

based on the pcoa and hierarchical clustering the sam- ples were labeled as ibs1 ibs patients with microbial pro- files distinct from hcs n  13 hc-like ibs ibs patients with similar microbial composition as hcs n  16 and hcs n  23. one ibs subject clustered with ibs1 in the pcoa but clustered with hcs in the hierarchical cluster- ing.

members of the erysipelo- trichaceae genus holdemania were more abundant among ibs1 compared to hc-like ibs q  .001 and hcs q  .001. members of the porphyromonadaceae genus parabacteroides were less abundant in ibs1 compared to hcs q  .003 but not hc-like ibs q  .097.mean differences in clinical metadata between ibs subgroups based on microbial clustersdetailed clinical data for the subgroups of ibs based on microbial community profiles ibs1 9 females 5 males and hc-like ibs 12 females 3 males are available in additional file  table s6.

even though the observed correlation between a his- tory of elas and the microbiome needs to be confirmed in future studies one may speculate that brain driven disturbances of the gut microbial environment in early life may have a long lasting effect on gut microbial composition persisting throughout life which in turn may lead to further changes in brain structurefunction.correlation with brain structuresmoderate-sized correlations with brain structure were observed for certain firmicutes- and bacteroides-associ- ated taxa.

t1-weighted brain images were acquired on a siemens allegra 3t scanner and morphological measures were computed for 165 brain regions.results using unweighted unifrac distances with hierarchical clustering on microbial data samples were clustered into two ibs subgroups within the ibs population ibs1 n  13 and hc-like ibs n  16 and hcs n  23 auroc  0.96sensitivity 0.95 specificity 0.67. a random forest classifier provided further support for the differentiation of ibs1 and hc groups.

gut microbial composition correlated with structural measures of brain regions including sensory- and salience-related regions and with a history of early life trauma.conclusions the results confirm previous reports of gut microbiome-based ibs subgroups and identify for the first time brain structural alterations associated with these subgroups.
