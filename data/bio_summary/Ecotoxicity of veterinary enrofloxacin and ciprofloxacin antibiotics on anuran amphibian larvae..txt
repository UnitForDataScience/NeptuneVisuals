Peltzer.The continuous entry of pharmaceuticals into the aquatic environment from wastewater effluents or leaching and runoff of agricultural soils amended with manure even at low concentra- tions may pose long-term risks to aquatic and terrestrial organisms In surface waters pharmaceuticals and their metabolites generally include several pharmaco-therapeutic classes such as antibiotics antipyretics anti-inflammatory drugs -blockers lipid regulators hormones antidepressants and anesthetics In the '70s the first evidence on pharmacologically active com- pounds clorphibric acid in aquatic systems was reported  but the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the environment became an emerging concern only in the mid-1990s when new analytical technologies were accessible  There are severe con- cerns over this bioactive compound role in enhancing antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria  Fluoroquinolones classes of commonly used -diketone antibiotics DKAs persist for long time in the aquatic environment 1382-6689c 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.due to their massive dose and frequent application of DKAs in human and livestock  This environmental problem can exacerbate bacterial resistance in considerable proportion  Enrofloxacin ENR and ciprofloxacin CPX are the most used drugs in human since the 1980s and veterinary since the 1990s medicine to treatment of urinary tract enteric low respiratory tract and bone infections being mainly active against Gram-negative bacteria During the last century different technologies were developed to remove fluoroquinolones from different aquatic systems  However their removal is complex and they can be found in numerous water matrices worldwide at concentrations that range among ng L-1 to mg L-1 For instance found1.30 ug L-1 CPX concentration in water bodies of Australia whereasreported CPX residues 0.077 ug L-1 in aquatic systems located downstream to the wastewater treatment plant discharges of New Jersey.

Standard stock solutions of ENR and CPX at 1000 mg L-1 were pre- pared in methanol and stored at 20 C. Based on the reported environmental concentrations of both antibiotics in lentic aquatic systems MEC 8.77 ug L-1ENR 7.49 ug L-1CPX where amphibians usually use to reproduce several test solutions were prepared by taking appropriate aliquots of the standard stock solutions evaporating the methanol with N2 and re-suspending in the corresponding volume of water having a final concentrations of 1 10 ug L-1 MEC solutions 100 and 1000 ug L-1.

To date knowl- edge about mode of action of fluoroquinolones in amphibians is limited  ENR and CPX pose risks to sensi- tive aquatic organisms that have identical andor similar target molecules as antibiotics are developed to target-specific molecular pathways  and gener- ally the model organisms use for investigate their ecotoxicity were performed on exotic species The present study approached the risk of ENR and its main metabolite CPX at relevant environmental concentrations on biological endpoints of amphibian larvae based on exposition ecotoxicity assays at sublethal concentrations and effects mor- phological development and growth rates GST and CAT activities.Materials and methodsStock and test solutionsENR and CPX were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Steinheim Germany.

Short-term static tests 96 h were conducted using 200 ml sterile plastic recipients 85 mm diameter 110 mm height.Larvae Stage 26 were exposed to 96 h to concentrations of ENR and CPX 1 ug L-1 and 10 ug L-1 -measured environmental concen- trations - and 100 and 1000 ug L-1 and a negative control with dechlorinated tap water DTW.ENR and CPX treatments were made in triplicate with ten tad- poles per aquarium n  30.

Both antibiotics were hydrophilic obtaining log Kow lower than 1 on ECOSAR simulations DiscussionIn aquatic systems there are no studies indicating the delete- rious effects of fluoroquinolone antibiotics on amphibian larvae probably because these antibiotics are not yet described as toxic for amphibian or they are recently included in environmental screen- ing as emerging contaminants and in the emergence of antibiotic resistance-bacteria  In general orally administered antibiotics in veterinary medicine are excreted with faeces and litter manure which are then usuallyTable 2Ration quotient risk RQ and Ecological Structure Activity Relationship ECOSAR of ENR and CPX.

Higher concentrations at concentrations above 14 mg L-1 of CPX were detected in areas with no or poor wastewater treatment Therefore in an ecotoxicological analysis regarding to emerging pollutants it is important to include acute effects and sub-lethal effects on non-target organisms  ENR and CPX affect growth and reproduction of cyanobacterium Micro- cystis aeruginosa green algae species Selenastrum capricornutumand Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and duckweed Lemna minor at concentrations ranging from 1.96 to 53 ug L-1  Moreover in crustacean Daphnia magna zebrafish Danio rerio and fathead minnow Pimephales promelas have limited tox- icity with no-observed-effect concentrations NOEC at 10 mg L-1  In addition and observed changes in both creatine kinase activ- ity and creatine concentration swimming behaviour and severe histopathological changes of zebrafish heart tissue.

Thus development inhibition percentages higher than 10 were accounted for 100 and 1000 ug L-1 in CPX treatments respect to the controls.Morphometrical geometryAverage body shape changes in tadpoles exposed to ENR and CPX treatments varied significantly with respect to those of con- trol larvae Wilks' A  0.001 F  2.138 p  0.001.
