thus development inhibition percentages higher than 10 were accounted for 100 and 1000 ug l-1 in cpx treatments respect to the controls.morphometrical geometryaverage body shape changes in tadpoles exposed to enr and cpx treatments varied significantly with respect to those of con- trol larvae wilks' a  0.001 f  2.138 p  0.001. the procrustes distance between control and cpx exposed larvae control and enr and the two antibiotics were 0.04 0.02 and 0.03 respectively p  0.0001 for permutation tests for all three pairwise compar- isons.

all standards were of analytical grade purity 95. standard stock solutions of enr and cpx at 1000 mg l-1 were pre- pared in methanol and stored at 20 c. based on the reported environmental concentrations of both antibiotics in lentic aquatic systems mec 8.77 ug l-1enr 7.49 ug l-1cpx where amphibians usually use to reproduce several test solutions were prepared by taking appropriate aliquots of the standard stock solutions evaporating the methanol with n2 and re-suspending in the corresponding volume of water having a final concentrations of 1 10 ug l-1 mec solutions 100 and 1000 ug l-1.

to date knowl- edge about mode of action of fluoroquinolones in amphibians is limited  enr and cpx pose risks to sensi- tive aquatic organisms that have identical andor similar target molecules as antibiotics are developed to target-specific molecular pathways  and gener- ally the model organisms use for investigate their ecotoxicity were performed on exotic species the present study approached the risk of enr and its main metabolite cpx at relevant environmental concentrations on biological endpoints of amphibian larvae based on exposition ecotoxicity assays at sublethal concentrations and effects mor- phological development and growth rates gst and cat activities.materials and methodsstock and test solutionsenr and cpx were purchased from sigma-aldrich steinheim germany.

short-term static tests 96 h were conducted using 200 ml sterile plastic recipients 85 mm diameter 110 mm height.larvae stage 26 were exposed to 96 h to concentrations of enr and cpx 1 ug l-1 and 10 ug l-1 -measured environmental concen- trations - and 100 and 1000 ug l-1 and a negative control with dechlorinated tap water dtw.enr and cpx treatments were made in triplicate with ten tad- poles per aquarium n  30. average tadpole size snout-tail tip was 26 - 1.3 mm and weight was 0.02 - 0.05 g. the water tem- perature and ph were 24 c and 6.5 respectively.

both antibiotics were hydrophilic obtaining log kow lower than 1 on ecosar simulations discussionin aquatic systems there are no studies indicating the delete- rious effects of fluoroquinolone antibiotics on amphibian larvae probably because these antibiotics are not yet described as toxic for amphibian or they are recently included in environmental screen- ing as emerging contaminants and in the emergence of antibiotic resistance-bacteria  in general orally administered antibiotics in veterinary medicine are excreted with faeces and litter manure which are then usuallytable 2ration quotient risk rq and ecological structure activity relationship ecosar of enr and cpx.

higher concentrations at concentrations above 14 mg l-1 of cpx were detected in areas with no or poor wastewater treatment therefore in an ecotoxicological analysis regarding to emerging pollutants it is important to include acute effects and sub-lethal effects on non-target organisms  enr and cpx affect growth and reproduction of cyanobacterium micro- cystis aeruginosa green algae species selenastrum capricornutumand pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and duckweed lemna minor at concentrations ranging from 1.96 to 53 ug l-1  moreover in crustacean daphnia magna zebrafish danio rerio and fathead minnow pimephales promelas have limited tox- icity with no-observed-effect concentrations noec at 10 mg l-1  in addition and observed changes in both creatine kinase activ- ity and creatine concentration swimming behaviour and severe histopathological changes of zebrafish heart tissue.

in this sense the complex pathway of interaction between gst-cat and the activity of one enzyme influ- ences the activity of other enzymes should be investigated in larvae exposed to short and long period at enr and cpx.furthermore the risk quotient rq could be a useful mea- sure that characterizes potential ecological risk of a stressor  the ecotoxicity values obtained at 10 ug l-1 were similarto the maximum concentration found in lentic environments  in this sense the results of the risk assessment per- formed in our study indicate that the environmental release of enr and cpx pose risks to r. arenarum tadpoles poses.

sometimes an imbalance in the commensal gut microbiota due to antibiotics can result in intestinal problems decreasing 20 of the tadpole's daily energy intake by fermenta- tion  and other visible symptoms such as antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and poor growth rates  in addition microbiome gut starvation  gut immune systems and pathogens resistance  in herbivorous amphibian lar- vae exposed to relevant concentrations of cpx and enx could be included in future ecotoxicological risk assessment.oxidative stress biomarkers are used for evaluation of toxic effect of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and other pollutants on fish larvae and anuran larvae in this sense defensive mechanisms of amphibian larvae are capable of counteracting the influence of reac- tive oxygen species ros resulting from the metabolism of various pollutants negative impact on biochemical processes linked with the presence of ros and free radicals are observed in r. arenarum larvae exposed to cpx and enr.
