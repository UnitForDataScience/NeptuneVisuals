However many other drugs also had a statis- tically significant effect on the gut microbiota composition.Consequences of gut microbiota changes caused by medicationWhat is becoming increasingly clear is that antibiotics PPIs and metformin affect the gut microbiota and that other commonly used medication like statins and SSRIs and are associated with distinct gut microbiota signatures.As a consequence these types of medi- cation could have an effect on the risk of developing enteric infections or gut inflammation and they may also have an effect on host metabolism.Susceptibility to enteric infectionsA well-known example of reduced enteric infection resis- tance through alteration of the gut microbiota caused by medication is the increased risk of Clostridium difficileinfections after repeated treatment with antibiotics.

Subsequent gut microbiota studies attributed the increased risk to unfavorable gut microbiota alterations caused by PPI use.Human ani- mal and in vitro studies show an overlap between the spe- cific gut microbiota alterations associated with PPI use as found in Imhann et al.

The overrepresentation of oral microbiota in the gut microbiota of PPI users supports this hypothesis.The effects of antibiotics and PPIs on the gut microbiota are currently the clearest exam- ples of how medication can change susceptibility to enteric infections and have an effect on human health.

One small scale intervention study investigating the role of PPI on the gut microbiota has already been performed.Animal studiesIn addition to intervention studies in humans mouse experiments are required in which gut microbiota changes can be studied in isolation and the effects in tissues and blood markers observed.The effects on enteric-infection-resistance to Clostridium difficile through gut microbiota alterations have already been tested using a mouse model in which mice were exposed to pathogens after antibiotic treatment.

Since the gut microbiota can depending on composition increase or decrease the risk of enteric infections we investigated the effect of PPI use on the gut microbiota.

Favorable microbiota can ameliorate gut inflammation through the induction of regulatory T- cells Tregs interleukin 10 IL-10 and the production of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate.In contrast unfavorable microbiota can produce toxins that pro- mote inflammation of the gut epithelium.

Gut microbiota changes associated with PPI use that increase the risk of Clostridium difficile infection.profoundly disturbed balance between favorable and unfavorable gut microbiota resulting in gut inflamma- tion is seen in Inflammatory Bowel Disease IBD.

Inter- vention studies in humans in which the pre-medica- tion gut microbiota can be compared with the post- medication gut microbiota are relatively easy to imple- ment.

Using the 16S rRNA sequences of stool samples from 1815 individuals spanning 3 independent cohorts we observed profound changes in the gut microbiota of PPI users.
