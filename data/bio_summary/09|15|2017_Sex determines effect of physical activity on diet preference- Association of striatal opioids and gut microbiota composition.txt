while male run consumed less high-fat diet compared to male sed male run con- sumed more of both the high-sucrose and high-corn starchcarbohydrate diets resulting in equivalent levels of overall caloric in- take between the male run and male sed.

to our knowledge this is the first study to examine sex dependent changes of the gut microbiota composition in response to physical activity as well as the interaction between physical activity and resulting diet preference and feeding patterns.the present study examined the interaction of voluntary wheel running run or sedentary conditions sed home-cage diet selection over a 4 week period in male and female wistar rats.

male run rats were significantly different from male sed at both week 0 p  0.006 and week 4 p  0.0002 there was no difference between female run and female sed at either week 0 or week 4.discussionconsidering sex dependent differences in the response to rewards the current study examined the interaction between the two natural rewards of voluntary wheel running and palatable diets in male and female rats.

the findings highlight the necessity for further exploration between male and female response to physical activity and feeding behavior.introductionadequate physical activity has been demonstrated to attenuate the cascade of metabolic maladaptations associated with obesity .

in the current study physical activity is predicted to influence high-fat intake by substituting for the rewarding properties of high-fat diet.it is known from studies on male rats that physical activity and high- fat intake both produce changes in reward-related transcription factors within the ventral striatum .

running distance increased over time f 472 27 p  0.0001 with females in- creasing running more than males f472 11 p  0.0001. thus despite running relatively greater distances than the male rats female rats did not demonstrate the same running associated reduction in weight ob- served in males.dietary preference assessmentfour week total intakeintake of each diet was recorded daily and standardized to kilo- calories per 100 g body weight .high-fat dieta two-way anova of high-fat consumption revealed a main effect of sex f136 15.8 p  0.0003 but not physical activity condition f1362.4 p  0.05. there was a significant sex by physical activity con- dition interaction f136 14.6 p  0.0005 .
