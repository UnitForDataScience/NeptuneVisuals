Proteins D1 and D2 link all redox-active components of photosystem II which mediates the electron transfer from water the final elec- tron donor to the plastoquinone pool 30.In this study for the first time we used the psbA conserved region as a molecular marker to assess the diversity of phototrophic microorganisms in commu- nities of two samples of the endemic Baikal sponge Baikalospongia intermedia a typical representative of the Baikal sponge fauna as well as in the surrounding aquatic community.MATERIALS AND METHODSSpecimens of the sponges B. intermedia IK503 andB.

b Phylogenetic tree of psbA gene sequences of eukaryotic microorganisms associated with the Baikal sponge B. intermedia and surrounding aquatic environment.Interestingly the majority of psbA genes of the aquatic community microorganisms cluster together in indi- vidual branches within both Cyano-PsbA and Vir- PsbA groups.

These data demonstrate the involvement of sponge symbiotic communities in the accumulation of primary production and carbon cycle in the Lake Baikal ecosystem.Keywords Lake Baikal freshwater sponges Baikalospongia intermedia symbiotic community psbA gene phototrophic microorganismsDOI 10.1134S0026893317030086Microbial oxygenic photosynthesis is a key meta- bolic process on the planet and the major driving force in the evolution of plants and multicellular animals.

The group of the closest homologs of these sequences contains several psbA sequences from aquatic and sponge communities which suggests that these cyano- bacterial genotypes are present in the Baikal sponge communities and phytoplankton.Interestingly the group of prokaryotic psbA gene sequences also contains D1 protein sequences of a Paulinella Testacea Cercozoa freshwater amoeboid.

Picocyano- bacteria of the order Chroococcales mainly Syn- echococcus were discovered earlier in both the Baikal communities of different sponge species 21 24-26 and Baikal plankton communities 36 37.Clade Pro-1 in the phylogenetic tree unites cyano- bacterial Cyano-PsbA and viral Vir-PsbA psbA genes identified in both sponge communities and aquatic microbiome Fig.

A total of 35 unique psbA gene sequences have been distinguished in the micro- bial communities of the endemic sponge B. intermedia and 32 unique sequences in the water community surround- ing the sponge.

This fact suggests the presence of Paulinella representatives in Baikal aquatic communi- ties and sponge microbiomes.The psbA sequences of eukaryotic microorganisms have been identified in sponge microbiomes and aquatic communities.

Presumably Nannochloropsis species are typical eukaryotic phototrophs in the Baikal sponge microbiomes.Eu-3 a separate clade unites the fragments of psbA genes of aquatic and sponge microorganisms as well as the sequences of manifold culturable Chlorophyta representatives Fig.
