Regardless of the regulatory system utilized by a specific PUL there generally appears to be a finely tuned interpretation of complex glycan signals that is necessary for a targeted dynamic response with some excep- tions monosaccharides are typically not inducers    and may in fact repress PUL expression .PULOMICSAs introduced above susC-susD pairs are hallmarks of PULs and have been used to enumerate PUL complements among the genomes of key human gut symbionts including B. thetaiotaomicron 88 PULs Bacteroides ovatus 126 PULs and Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2 113 PULs   .

In this context it is especially notable that one of the three B. thetaiotaomicron mannan PULs is located on a mobile element that is struc- turally similar and homologous to that harboring porphyran utilization genes in B. plebeius .GIVE AND TAKE THE ROLES OF GLYCAN UTILIZATION IN GUT ECOLOGYThe coordinated carbohydrate utilization systems of PULs represent an impressive evolutionary solution for capturing valuable carbon sources in competitive environ- ments which avoid the limitations of extracellular systems such as cellulosomes or freely diffusing enzymes employed by fungi and other bacteria.

may have also acquired algal polysaccharide utilization genes from marine bacteria  .The ability of gut bacteria to adapt to structurally complex dietary polysaccharides was highlighted by the discovery and detailed characterization of three PULs from B. thetaiotaomicron involved in the utilization of a-mannans from the yeast cell wall .

Together eight genes were identified as part of a single gene cluster collectively named the starch utilization system Sus which established a new paradigm of complex carbohydrate utilization  .

Monosaccharides are represented by Consortium for Functional Glycomics symbols .THE ARCHETYPAL PUL THE SusThe first evidence of a concerted molecular system for complex glycan degradation in Bacteroidetes bacteria was uncovered through pioneering studies of dietary starch utilization by the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron which were initi- ated in the 1980s by Abigail Salyers and coworkers.

One of the first examples of the comprehensive characterization of a PUL directed toward a more complex plant cell wall polysaccharide was that of the xyloglucan utilization locus XyGUL from the human gut symbiont B. ovatus  .
