Interestingly the numbers of CD43high monocytes were not significantly altered in B27-Tg rats Figure 1C.This increased representation of CD43low mono- cytes was also observed within the BM of B27-Tg rats when compared to WT and B7-Tg control rats Figures 1D-F.

Using a broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment we ameliorated the B27-associated gut inflammation in B27-Tg rats as indi- cated by reductions in the severity of ileitis after 4 weeks of oral antibiotic administration Figures 2A and B. Surpris- ingly this treatment was associated with a reduction in the number of CD43low monocytes not only within the blood- stream but also within the BM of B27-Tg rats Figures 2C-Figure 1.

Representative density plots show the distribution of BM monocytes in WT and B27-Tg rats D. Percentages E and absolute numbers F of CD43low and CD43high monocytes were determined in the BM of WT B7-Tg and B27-Tg animals.

Remarkably 1 week after the initiation of antibiotics the plasma CCL2 levels in B27-Tg rats returned to levels similar to those in WT con- trols Figure 3E.Furthermore we evaluated whether the antibiotic treatment could affect the levels of systemic cytokines in B27-Tg rats.

See Figure 1 for other definitions.GUT-BONE AXIS IN HLA-B27-Tg RATS1813Furthermore it has been demonstrated that BM precursors from B27-Tg rats undergo enhanced TNF- driven but not RANKL-driven osteoclastogenesis as compared to that in control rats 9 for results see Sup- plementary Figure 2 available on the Arthritis  Rheuma- tology web site at Moreover the enhancement of osteoclast differentiation by TNF in B27-Tg rats has been associated with both the production and activity of IL-1a 9 the levels of which were reduced in the plasma of B27- Tg animals upon treatment with oral antibiotics Figure 3F.

The observed changes in monocytes in B27-Tg rats have important implications for bone disease as we have demonstrated that CD43low monocytes are the major precursors for osteoclasts in rats.Furthermore our data are consistent with the recent observation that BM cells from B27-Tg rats have pro- nounced increased osteoclastogenic potential only in the presence of TNF 9.

To investigate the relationship between intestinal inflammation and the central and peripheral innate immune system in the pathogenesis of HLA-B27- associated spondyloarthritis using an HLA-B27-transgenic B27-Tg rat model.Methods.

The myeloid compartment of the blood and bone marrow BM of B27-Tg rats as well as HLA- B7-Tg and non-Tg rats as controls was evaluated by flow cytometry.

B27-Tg rats had substantially higher num- bers of circulating Lin2CD172a1CD43low monocytes as compared to control animals and this was significantly correlated with higher levels of plasma CCL2.

Antibiotic treatment of B27-Tg rats markedly reduced the severity of ileitis plasma levels of CCL2 and IL-1a and number of BM and blood Lin2CD172a1CD43low monocytes a cell subset shown in the present study to have the greatest in vitro osteoclastogenic potential.
