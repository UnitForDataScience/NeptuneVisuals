More research is needed on the health effects of air pollution specifically PM exposure among at-risk SA occu- pational groups including taxi drivers gas attendants and restaurant workers in the U.S. Next steps for future research should include 1 quantifying levels of particulate matter exposure among taxi drivers and other at-risk occupational groups in the U.S 2 gaining a better understanding of the relationship between PMair pollution and inflammation CVD and cancer as well as the contribution of oil fumes among SA at-risk occupational groups 3 assessing the potential of hybrid cars andor air filters as an intervention to decrease PM exposure among taxi drivers and 4 assessing residual risk in immigrants who had cooking stove exposures in their countries of origin.The leading cause of cervical cancer the Human Pap- illoma Virus HPV is another area where research is lacking among U.S. SA populations.

There are few studies on the long- term health effects of prior low to moderate levels of arsenic exposure among Bangladeshi immigrants in the U.S.More studies also need to be done to further investigate the association between high levels of arsenic exposure and various cancers and CVD especially among SAs in the U.S. Arsenic toxicity has been linked to CVD and cancer among SAs in their countries of origin indicating that these risks are likely to apply to SAs in the U.S. as well.

Environmental exposures common among South Asian SA subgroups such as arsenic expo- sure among Bangladeshis and particulate matter air pollution among taxi drivers also pose risks.

However relevantpreliminary findings and research conducted in South Asia and non-U.S. SA diasporic countries can inform future stud- ies in the U.S.Related to the topic of arsenic recommended next steps include conducting more research on arsenic exposure through hair or nail assessments among U.S. SA immigrant populations.

It has since been estimated that areas with tube-well placement and arsenic contamination affect as many as 77 million people .Although drinking contaminated water is the most com- mon cause for arsenic exposure there have been other identified sources of arsenic toxicity such as eating crops irrigated with contaminated groundwater  .

This study showed a significant hazard ratio HR for chronic-disease mortality in districts where arsenic well water levels were over 150 ugL 1.68 HR where arsenic dose was greaterthan 401 ugday 1.58 HR and where total arsenic levels in urine were over 352 ugg 1.47 HR .

Many studies although none conducted among SAs in the U.S. have demonstrated a high prevalence of lung cancer among taxi drivers without known additional risk factors such as smoking in a systematic review SAs were less likely to smoke in their adopted countries versus their countries of origin  suggesting a possible associa- tion with PM  .

A retrospective study in England showed that among SAs HBV incidence was3.1 times higher than among non-SAs .

Eastern which is common among Japanese and other East Asians is more inflammatory in nature than the western strain found among Bangladeshis .
