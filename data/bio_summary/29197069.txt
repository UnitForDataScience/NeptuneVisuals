found an increase of parabacteroides and akkermansia in the feces of humans with a higher rate of colon tumori- genesis.22 in contrast an increased amount of lactobacillus salivarius contributed to reduced colonic inflammatory responses and prevented colorectal carcinogenesis.2324in this study we investigate how the bap in combination with dextran sodium sulfate dss the most common tumor- igenic promoter for inducing colitis in the murine model induced colorectal tumorigenesis and it was prevented by polymethoxyflavones pmfs which was isolated from citrus peels and have been shown to exhibit various biological activ- ities including cancer prevention anti-inflammatory activity and inhibition of metastasis.15 we found that the oral admin- istration of pmfs significantly prevented bapdss-induced colorectal tumorigenesis through reduced bpde and dna adduct formation at the initiation stage.

addi- tionally recent evidence demonstrated that gut microbiota is implicated in variety of chronic diseases including diabetes bowel diseases and crc.1920 accumulating reports suggest that the composition of gut microbiota is closely correlated with colorectal tumorigenesis which includes the initiation and promotionprogression stages.21 for instance baxter et al.

at the tumor initiation stage mice pretreated with pmfs can benefit from their protective effect on bpde-dna adduct generation through modulating xmes expressed for decreas- ing reactive metabolites such as bap-quinones and increas- ing detoxification metabolites in faeces.29 the feces sample for analyzed bap metabolites were collected during mice whowere treated with bap for 6 days and those results explained the effects of pmfs on bap metabolism.

together those results suggested that oral administration of pmfs can prevent bapdss-induced colorectal tumorigenesis.pmfs decreased bpde-dna adduct formation in colon tissue through modulated bap metabolismit is well known that the carcinogenic ability of bap depends on its mutagenic metabolite bpde which reacts with dnato form covalently dna adducts and initiates the processes of tumorigenicity.28 we used ihc with bpde-dna adduct antibodies to determine the level and distribution of bpde- dna adducts in colonic tissue.

therefore investigation of dietary pahs particularly bap that is a representative car- cinogen species for pahs in inducing colorectal tumorigene- sis is essential.crc development a dynamic and long-term process involves many complex factors such as dna mutation sig- naling pathway disorder and colonic microbiota imbal- ance.1415 during colorectal tumorigenesis chemicals or free radicals induce dna damagemutation that plays aninitiation role affecting cell growth regulation oncogene tumor suppressor gene tsg expression and cell differentia- tion.

alto- gether those results indicated that pmfs exhibit an efficiency in preventing bap-induced dna adduct formation via regu- lation of bap metabolism and xmes gene expression.comprehensive overview of how gene expression change from pmfs prevents bapdss-induced colorectal carcinogenesisto examine how the molecular mechanism of bapdss- induced colorectal tumorigenesis is prevented by pmfs we used rna-sequencing technology to analyze a variety of crc development-associated mrna expressions.

this result indicated that bapdss-induced colorectal carcinogenesis may be related to activate ca21-dependent pathway.phytochemical or drug-induced pcd including apoptosisand autophagy has been suggested as a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of cancer.3738 our previous studies found that inducing a completely autophagy process inhibited cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo model by natural dietary compounds.30 to examine the effect of pmfs on the induction of autophagy status in bapdss-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in icr mice we used western blot- ting to determine the expression level of lc3 and beclin-1 as autophagic initiation biomarkers and targets of autophagic degradation by lysosome including p62 and conexin-43 cx-figure 2. oral administration of pmfs significantly reduced bpde-dna adduct formation through regulation of bap metabolism in bapdss- treated mice.
