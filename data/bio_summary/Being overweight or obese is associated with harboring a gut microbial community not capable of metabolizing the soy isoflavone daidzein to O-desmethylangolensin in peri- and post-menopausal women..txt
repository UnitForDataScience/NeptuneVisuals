In a previous study of 297 adults in the United States obese individuals were 3-times more likely to be ODMA non-producers than non-obese individuals whereas a null association with being an equol non-producer was observed In a study of 597 Chinese postmenopausal women ODMA non-producers had higher BMI and higher percent body fat than ODMA producers whereas there was no difference across equol producers and non-producers The objective of this study was to extend these observations to evaluate the risk of being over- weight or obese in relation to daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in peri- and post-menopausal women living in the United States.MethodsThe Lifetime Exposures And Vasomotor e Symptoms LEAVeS study was designed to examine the association of vasomotor symp- toms VMS with the equol-producer phenotype among women ages 45-55 The parent study procedures were approved by the Group Health Institutional Review Board.

One study has not observed associa- tions with dietary factors however others have found that minor components of diet or early-life diet are associated with equol production capability Some differences across these cross-sectional studies in equol and ODMA phenotypes have been observed for age and menopause but it is not known whether these observations are related to the differences in study popu- lations as geographic differences in the microbiome have been observed across studies Large longitudinal studies over the menopausal transition may be able to identify whether there is a change in daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes with age or menopause although such studies would need to be of consider- able size because of the strong correlation of age and menopause.Some limitations to this study should be considered.

A previous study of 104 men and193 women in the United States aged 18-65 years observed that obese adults were almost three-times more likely to be ODMA non-producers than adults of a normal weight classifi- cation p  0.032 while the equol-producer phenotype was not associated with obesity p  0.629 after adjustment for age race gender and menopausal status Another study among 726 Chinese postmenopausal women observed significantly 2 higher BMI p  0.022 and 4 percent body fat p  0.023 in ODMA non- producers than producers This study also observed that ODMA non-producers had 3 higher systolic blood pressure p  0.010 and 4 higher LDL cholesterol p  0.049 suggesting that there may additional downstream effects of obesity related to the ODMA non-producer phenotype.

The study objective was to evaluate the association between being overweight or obese and phenotypic markers of having an overall gut microbial environment not capable of metabolizing the isoflavone daidzein to equol or O-desmethylangolensin ODMA.Study design Cross-sectional study of 137 peri- and 218 post-menopausal women aged 44-55 years who consumed at least three servings per week of soy source of daidzein.

The authors also observed that isoflavone intake was not associated with cardiometabolic outcomes when examined separately by equol producer and non- producer status suggesting that the phenotypes are independently associated with obesity or cardiovascular disease risk factors.In contrast to our findings among peri and postmenopausalwomen a study of 200 premenopausal women ages 40-45 reported no observed association between BMI and daidzein- metabolizing phenotypes non-producers and producers in unadjusted descriptive analysis of the study population In the main analysis that evaluated body composition ODMA non- producers had significantly lower whole body lean mass but this observation did not persist after adjustment for anthropomet- ric measures sociodemographic factors reproductive history and hormone use Overall these findings along with our report suggest there may be differences in the association between ODMA non-producer phenotype and obesity depending on reproductive status.

However it is possible that other fac- tors not measured in this study could have contributed to our findings.In summary ODMA non-producer phenotype was associatedwith obesity in our study of peri- and post-menopausal women.

Some work suggests that pheno- types remain stable over time and other work suggests that the equol-producer phenotype can be variable over short periods cross-over equol phenotypes ranged from 6 to 20 In the study that also evaluated ODMA phenotypes approximately 10 of individuals had a phenotype change Evi- dence suggests that among US populations there is more often a producer to non-producer shift than vice versa Stud- ies have observed associations between daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes and demographic race ethnicity anthropometric height and lifestyle factors physical activity education among premenopausal women.

Equol and ODMA producers and non-producers were identified based on urinary concentrations of daidzein equol and ODMA in a 24-h urine sample.Main outcome measures Mean body mass index BMI and odds of obesity.Results Fifty-one women were ODMA non-producers and 226 were equol non-producers.

The equol non-producer phenotype was not associated with obesity OR  1.13 95 CI 0.64 1.98 and mean BMI was not significantly different between equol producers 27.3 kgm2 and non-producers 26.5 kgm2.Conclusions These results suggest that the ODMA non-producer phenotype is associated with obesity in peri- and post-menopausal women.
