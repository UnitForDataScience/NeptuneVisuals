For example the coral coverage in the Sanya Luhuitou fringing reefHainan Island northern SCS coastal CRRs  decreased from80 to 90 in 1960 to 12 in 2009  in Weizhou Island northern SCS coastal CRRs coverage decreased from 60 to 80 in 1991 to 8e18  in 2010 and in Yongxing Island the Xisha Islands central SCS offshore CRRs coverage decreased from 90 in 1980 to 10 in 2008  .

They include 1 analysing the level of antibiotics in coral tissue including anthozoa and zooxanthellae 2 carrying out more ecotoxicological tests including proteomics and metabolomic studies on more an- tibiotics in corals by controlling exposures especially under chronic conditions and 'environmental relevant' ngL level and 3 con- ducting uptake and depuration experiment of common coral spe- cies in the laboratory.ConclusionThirteen of the nineteen target antibiotics were detected in the surface water from the CRRs in the SCS with the concentrations ranging from 10-2 ng L-1 to 100 ng L-1.

In addition to Yongxing Island SMZ and FF were also detected in the Beijiao Reef SAZ FF 0.61 ng L-1 and Qilian Island SMZ 0.20 ng L-1.

The MDL for eight SAs four MLs two CAPs and five FQs ranged from 0.016 to 0.082 0.016 to 0.096 0.166 to 0.192 and 0.084e0.444 ng L-1 Table S1 respectively.The results and discussionOccurrence of antibiotics in coral reef regions of the SCSThirteen of the nineteen target antibiotics were detected in the surface water from coastal CRRs in the SCS all the FQs TCs and sulfathiazole STZ were not detected with the average concen- trations ranging from 0.02 to 1.2 ng L-1 and the highest concen- trations ranging from 0.15 to 6.3 ng L-1 and Table S4.

Furthermore their concentrations in the coastal and offshore CRRs were generally lower than in the Pearl River outlets mean 1.9e28 ng L-1 estuary mean 0.85e8.8 ng L-1   and some mariculture farms in Hailing Island in the northern SCS 0.15e8.8 ng L-1  SI Table S5.

This area has been a national coral reef nature reserve from 2007 with the largest area 144 km2 and the most diverse coral species among coastal coral reefs.

Transect c Tc was from the Sanya coast to Huangyan Island by the Xisha Islands.As a specific example Weizhou Island was selected to study the impact of terrigenous antibiotic residuals on CRRs and the influence of antibiotic contamination on living coral coverage LCC in CRRs.

The Xisha Islands include Beijiao Reef BJ Qilian Islands QL Yongxing Island YX Dongdao Island DD Huaguang Reef HG and Langhua Reef LH.Materials and methodsStudy areaThe coastal CRRs included four fringing reefs in northern SCS Daya Bay Xuwen Dengloujiao Weizhou Island and Sanya Luhuitou .

Daya Bay has many mari- culture farms and is adjacent to Shenzhen City which has a dense population.Some obvious distribution features also occurred in each CRR.For example the antibiotic concentrations in the samples from the buffer area of the Xuwen Coral Reefs Reserve XW1 XW5 and XW6 8.0e13 ng L-1 were significantly higher than those from the core area of the reserve XW2-XW4 4.3e6.5 ng L-1 see Table 1The detection frequency concentration range and mean of antibiotics in the coral reef regions ng L-1.Fig.
