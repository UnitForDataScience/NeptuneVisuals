the mdl for eight sas four mls two caps and five fqs ranged from 0.016 to 0.082 0.016 to 0.096 0.166 to 0.192 and 0.084e0.444 ng l-1 table s1 respectively.the results and discussionoccurrence of antibiotics in coral reef regions of the scsthirteen of the nineteen target antibiotics were detected in the surface water from coastal crrs in the scs all the fqs tcs and sulfathiazole stz were not detected with the average concen- trations ranging from 0.02 to 1.2 ng l-1 and the highest concen- trations ranging from 0.15 to 6.3 ng l-1 and table s4.

furthermore their concentrations in the coastal and offshore crrs were generally lower than in the pearl river outlets mean 1.9e28 ng l-1 estuary mean 0.85e8.8 ng l-1   and some mariculture farms in hailing island in the northern scs 0.15e8.8 ng l-1  si table s5.

therefore mls can be used as chemical markers for human source contaminants to a certain degree.coastal regions the antibiotic concentrations in the fourcoastal crrs are in the following order xuwen 7.7 ng l-1daya bay 5.7 ng l-1weizhou island 4.2 ng l-1luhuitou 3.5 ng l-1 .

daya bay has many mari- culture farms and is adjacent to shenzhen city which has a dense population.some obvious distribution features also occurred in each crr.for example the antibiotic concentrations in the samples from the buffer area of the xuwen coral reefs reserve xw1 xw5 and xw6 8.0e13 ng l-1 were significantly higher than those from the core area of the reserve xw2-xw4 4.3e6.5 ng l-1 see table 1the detection frequency concentration range and mean of antibiotics in the coral reef regions ng l-1.fig.

the results show that 13 antibiotics were detected in the coastal crrs with con- centrations ranging from 10-2e100 ng l-1 while 5 antibiotics occurred in offshore crrs 300e950 km from the mainland with concentrations ranging from 10-2 to 10-1 ng l-1.

most of the detected antibiotics 813 showed high detection fre- quencies 50. moreover detm rtm ctm and ff were detected in all the samples 100. five of the 13 antibiotics were also detected in offshore crrs 300e950 km from the mainland with the average concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 0.17 ng l-1 and the highest concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 0.53 ng l-1  and table s4.

the total antibiotics concentration in the coastal crrs mean5.3 ng l-1 was ten times higher than in the offshore crrs mean0.50 ng l-1.

antibiotic concentrations in the southern area of weizhou island wz1 wz2 and wz6 3.8e7.0 ng l-1 were higher than those from the northern area wz2-wz5 2.5e2.9 ng l-1.

in addition to yongxing island smz and ff were also detected in the beijiao reef saz ff 0.61 ng l-1 and qilian island smz 0.20 ng l-1.

for all the samples inthe offshore crrs mls were detected at a low level and their total concentrations varied slightly 0.23e0.37 ng l-1 but sma and ff which were only detected in less than half of the samples pre- sented a broad concentration range from 0.07 to 0.85 ng l-1 the sum of sma and ff.in conclusion most crrs were jointly contaminated by human and veterinary source antibiotics.

they include 1 analysing the level of antibiotics in coral tissue including anthozoa and zooxanthellae 2 carrying out more ecotoxicological tests including proteomics and metabolomic studies on more an- tibiotics in corals by controlling exposures especially under chronic conditions and 'environmental relevant' ngl level and 3 con- ducting uptake and depuration experiment of common coral spe- cies in the laboratory.conclusionthirteen of the nineteen target antibiotics were detected in the surface water from the crrs in the scs with the concentrations ranging from 10-2 ng l-1 to 100 ng l-1.

their concentration decreased gradually from the coast total 10 ng l-1 magnitude to offshore total 10-1 ng l-1 magnitude under the multiple in- fluences of contaminant transport degradation and seawater dilution.

for example veterinary medicine cap was not detected in the pearl river outlets and estuary but was detected in some coastal crrs with the highest concentration at1.7 ng l-1.

riverine discharge and mariculture may be important input pathways of antibiotics into the crrs.composition distribution and sources of antibiotics in each coral reef regionamong the 13 antibiotics detected in the four coastal crrs ff smx and rtm were the predominant target compounds with the highest concentrations at 2.1 6.3 and 2.4 ng l-1 respectively.moreover the highest concentration of both ff and smx occurred at the xw6 sampling site table s4 where many mariculture farms were located .

yongxing island showed the highest total antibiotic concentration 1.14 ng l-1 in the offshore crrs although it is not the closest island or reef to the mainland which may be due to the increasing human activity and quick develop- ment into a prosperous city.
