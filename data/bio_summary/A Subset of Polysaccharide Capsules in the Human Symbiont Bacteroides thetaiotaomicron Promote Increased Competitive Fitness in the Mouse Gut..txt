The increased IgA response in MyD88--Trif-- mice was not limited to B. theta CPSs as ELISA using whole acapsular B. theta  E and quantification of total IgA F both showed a correspondingly stronger response in MyD88--Trif-- mice.

Conservation of cps Loci from B. theta VPI-5482 in Other Bacteroidetes StrainsThe genomes of 14 B. theta strains 98 full-length 16S identity to type strain VPI-5482 or closely related strains were probed with genes from the 8 cps loci in the B. theta type strain.

Interestingly confirming others' findings  over the entire experiment levels of anti-CPS IgA were generally higher intheinnate immune-deficientMyD88--Trif-- mice B which correlated with greater competition among strains and eventual elimination of the cps4 and cps6 strains .

However removing host adaptive immunity neither eliminates dynamic expression of capsules by WT B. theta in vivo  nor equilibrates levels of competing single CPS-ex-pressing strains suggesting that other selective pressures are also important.In confirmation of a previous study in B. fragilis   a strain expressing a single CPS CPS5 co-colonizes to high levels with WT B. theta especially under stable conditions e.g.

Competition of Single CPS-Expressing Strains in Germ-free Mice Reveals Distinct Advantages Conferred by Specific CPSs Eight single CPS-expressing strains and an acapsular strain were pooled and inoculated into germ-free mice of three genotypes n  5 micegroup A and D WT B and E MyD88--Trif-- C and F Rag1--.

The less stringent dominance of the cps5 strain in Rag1-- mice reinforces that adaptive immune responses play a role in CPS-mediated fitness  and suggests that CPS5 could be more resilient under these conditions.Compared with Rag1-- mice an opposite trend was observed in MyD88--Trif-- mice deficient in innate immu- nity.

These data implicate the adaptive immune response particularly IgA levels in driving changes in relative abundance seen in the three genotypes of mice tested.Diet Alterations Do Not Have Major Impact on In VivoCompetition or on In Vitro Growth RatePreviously we determined that activation of individual glycan degradation systems induced changes in CPS locus expressionA2.01.51.0Wild-typeababbE1.51.0   0.50.50.00.0B2.01.51.00.5MyD88--Trif--abccF100  806040200.00C1.000.75r  -0.4339p  0.0635r  -0.5123p  0.0249r  -0.3464p  0.1462Wild-typer  -0.3702p  0.1187r  -0.1771p  0.4682r  -0.1520p  0.53442.01.50.500.25r  0.4372p  0.06121.00.50.000.0D1.000.75r  -0.6954p  0.0014r  -0.5521p  0.0175r  -0.6821p  0.0018MyD88--Trif--r  -0.6081p  0.0074r  -0.6568p  0.0031r  0.1001p  0.69272.01.50.500.25r  0.6207p  0.00601.00.50.000.00 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80Time in daysFigure 3.

Pearson correlation coefficients r and p values for each correlation p are also indicated.Fecal IgA to the acapsular strain from WT and MyD88--Trif-- mice was quantified via ELISA.Total IgA from WT and MyD88--Trif-- mice at day 65 was quantified via ELISA.

While the cps4 and cps6 strains maintained detectable populations for several weeks in individual mice by the end of the experiment the cps5 strain was the only strain remaining with all other strains including the cps6 and cps4 strains outcompeted below the limit of detection.
