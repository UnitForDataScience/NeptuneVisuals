surprisingly in wt mice with 100 wt b. theta in all five mice wt b. theta displayed a new pattern of cps expression that var- ied from its pre-antibiotic profile by exhibiting far less cps2 expression and prominent expression of cps5 followed by expression of cps3 and cps1 plus others c. this same pattern was observed in post-antibiotic-treated rag1-- mice d with the notable exception that far less cps5 was expressed by the population with most cps5 expression found in the two mice with low populations of the cps5 strain which instead favored corresponding increases in cps1 cps4 and cps6.

however removing host adaptive immunity neither eliminates dynamic expression of capsules by wt b. theta in vivo  nor equilibrates levels of competing single cps-ex-pressing strains suggesting that other selective pressures are also important.in confirmation of a previous study in b. fragilis   a strain expressing a single cps cps5 co-colonizes to high levels with wt b. theta especially under stable conditions e.g.

as the cps5 strain can only express its cps5 locus expression of cps5 was higher than that of other loci at days 45 and 70 and similar to the abun- dance of the cps5 strain c. at day 45 each of the re- maining seven capsules was expressed above 5 total locus transcript presumably by wt b. theta.

while it is possible that high cps2 expression at day 70 is caused by the same dynamic changes in locus expression observed in  it is unlikely that the observed changes in cps5 expression exclusively found in all wt mice is due to a similar phenomenon as we never observed a large 20 expression change of cps5 in wt or rag1-- mice fed this diet.

in all five mice the cps5 strain became the most dominant strain by day 10. while the cps4 and cps6 strains maintained detectable populations for several weeks in individual mice by the end of the experiment the cps5 strain was the only strain remaining with all other strains including the cps6 and cps4 strains outcompeted below the limit of detection.

these data indicate that each of these single cps-expressing strains only produces a single cps allowing isolation of the role of individual cps in ex- periments in this work.relative cps expression from previous published datasetsmicroarray or rna-seq datasets measuring gene expression in samples containing b. thetaiotaomicron vpi-5482 were selected from the gene expression omnibus website see table s6 for information on each sample set.

this observation supports a model in which cps5 provides b. theta with the greatest advan- tage to occupy a particular niche in the gut that is influenced bycps type sorted by prevalencetotal 111 72 51 45 34 33 24 24 21 20 19 19 18 16 15 14 14 12 12 12 11 11 11 10 8 77 7 66 6 66 6 55 4 4 4 3 32 2 21 1 1 0 0 0figure 7. prevalence of b. theta cps biosynthetic loci in human metagenomic samples the 147 gut metagenomic samples from the human microbiome project were probed with genes from each of the 49 identified b. theta cps loci as well as a set of genes specific to b. theta-sequenced isolates.

furthermore for ex- periments in figure s4e the cps5 strain was rederived from an intermediate strain harboring just 4 cps loci cps5 cps6 cps7 and cps8 with the reasoning that any secondary mutations found in this ancestral strain would be found in multiple strains including other strains that competed both dominantly and poorly in vivo.

we also sought to determine if there were specific global gene expression profiles shared by the most competitive strains cps4 cps5 and cps6 ''winners'' compared with some of the strains that were consis- tently outcompeted cps1 cps2 and acapsular ''losers'' by performing rna sequencing on bacteria from monoassociated mice.

these data further suggest that cps5 provides an advantage to b. theta in vivo while deficiency in innate immunity provokes a more fierce competition among colonizing strains.besides our genome sequencing data demonstrating few mutations among the strains used in this study table s2 we sought to rule out secondary mutations by repeating the compe- tition experiment described above with a newly constructed cps5 strain.

consistent with development of adaptive immune responses during or after the first week of colonization levels of anti-cps iga in wt mice at day 5 were low but significantly increased by day 25 a. at this time point iga levels were significantly higher against cps1 and cps3 than against cps5 with significantly higher anti-cps4 titers compared with anti-cps5 titers emerging by day 45. this is noteworthy given that the intestinal community consisted mainly of the cps5 cps4 and cps6 strains illustrating that the most competitive strain in these mice the cps5 strain is not also the most targeted by iga.

collectively our data indicate that the ability to shift expres- sion of multiple cpss provides an advantage to b. theta that is realized most strongly after antibiotic perturbation and that cps5 confers some advantages in the face of the adaptive immune response.extensive cps biosynthetic locus diversity in sequenced b. theta isolatesas bacteroides fragilis strains harbor broad diversity in cps biosynthetic loci  we wondered whetherthey reside at the same genomic positions.
