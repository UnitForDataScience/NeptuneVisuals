Accordingly the improved intestinal morphology indicated an enhancement of intestinal barrier and absorption capacity of broilers fed with K. marxianus which might result in better feed efficiency.The mucus layer is the first line of defense encountered by intestinal bacteria.

Increased TJs protein expression could result in an enhancement of intestinal barrier function  which subsequently reduce the diffusion of macromolecules such as bacterial toxin and pathogens from intestinal lumen into blood circu- lation thereby promoting the intestinal and systemic health of host.

It was suggested that the improvement of growth performance immune function and intestinal health in chickens could be linked with the modification of intestinal microbial structure -.

Nevertheless it is unknown whether dietary K. marxianus supplementation can improve intestinal microbial structure in animals which might subsequently benefit the immune function and intestinal structure of host.

As an interface between the host and the environment intestinal villi per- form special functions to maintain intestinal absorption and integrity .

This might contribute to the improvement of intestinal morphological structure because of the less bacterial stimulation and could be beneficial for intestinal immunity since mucin also helps to localize sIgA to the gut epithelium .

Therefore the enhanced intestinal absorption as characterized by the improved intestinal morphology coupled with the elevated SGLT-1 expression could also be related to the improved feed efficiency of broilers after K. marxianus addition.Gut microbiota contribute to maintenance of the normal physiological function of intes- tine providing a series of beneficial effects on their hosts such as nutrient digestion immune function and protection from invasive pathogens -.

Thus it could be assumed that there was a connection between the reduced harmful germs in gut and the improved intestinal health of birds after K. marxianus addition at high dose.ConclusionsDietary K. marxianus supplementation was beneficial for feed efficiency host immunity and intestinal structure of broiler chickens.

Supplemental K. marxianus especially at high dose 2.5 gkg improved intestinal microbial structure which may contribute to the improved feed efficiency and intestinal struc- ture of broiler chickens.Supporting informationS1 Fig.
