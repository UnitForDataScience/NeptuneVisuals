Notably research on the in vivo effects of resveratrol on the decline of brain function during aging sug- gested that the underlying mechanism likely involves the down- regulation of miR-134 and miR-124 presumably through upregulation of CREB expression and BDNF synthesis  .Mitochondrial SIRT4 is another sirtuin implicated in aging and regulated by miRNAs such as miR-15b.

Although the evidence suggesting the non-canonical mitochondrial contribution of miR-4495 and miR-1973 to the cytosolic mature miRNA pool and the processing of additional mitochondria-encoded miRNAs is not definitive further effort to validate the concept of mitochondrial retrograde signaling mediated by non-coding RNAs with an impact in aging is warranted.Age-related metabolic inflammation is regulated by miRNAsDuring the last few decades the chronic metabolic dysfunction in tissues such as the white AT has been realized as a major land- mark of physiological and accelerated aging e. Metabolic inflammation metainflammation and more recently metaflammation are terms coined to refer to the chronic low- grade systemic inflammation that is central to obesity and meta- bolic syndrome  .

Further research to validate this hypothesis and discover novel modulators of the human-microbiota relationship with an impact on human aging is warranted.ConclusionsThe discovery of miRNAs involved in multiple metabolic alter- ations that occur during physiological and pathophysiological aging has witnessed major advances in the last decade.

We have also included a provocative section highlighting the potential role in aging of a new designation of miRNAs namely fecal miRNAs recently discovered to regulate intestinal microbiota in mammals.c 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.IntroductionAging the natural process of growing older is characterized by a progressive deterioration of physiological homeostasis at the cellular tissue and organismal level.

As the emergence of bio- logical process regulation by miRNAs playedplays a central role in the evolution of complex life the deregulation caused either by environmental genetic or stochastic factors of miRNA expression andor function consequently represents a key driver of detri- mental alterations of life.In this review we consider the hallmarks described by Lopez-Otin and colleagues as a starting point then focus on those more directly involved in metabolic processes affecting aging and that have been shown to be regulated at least in part by miRNAs .

Commensal microbiota has been shown to impact host aging therefore we reason that fecal miRNA regulation of intestinal flora could be relevant to aging.

Accordingly the mammalian somatotrophic axis involving GH and the insulinIGF-1 signaling pathways plays fundamental roles in modulating physi- ological and pathophysiological aging by altering nutrient sensing insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function among others o.The discovery of microRNAs miRNAs and their mechanisms of action has dramatically widen and clarified our understanding of gene regulation  .

In addi- tion we include a provocative section potentially novel landmark on miRNAs that are regulated by or can regulate commensal microbiota and may impact aging.

mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR insulininsulin-like growth factor 1 IGF-1 as well as by increasing the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase eNOS involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and sirtuin 1 SIRT1 expression  Luigi .Mounting evidence support that CR alters the expression pattern of genes and miRNAs that are affected by aging in multiple species  .

Interestingly by implementing high throughput miRNA profiling we and others have shown a general trend towards reduction of circulating levels of specific miRNAs despite distinct subsets during normal aging in disparate species such as mouse and nematode i.e.
