Mothers' own breast milk feeding influenced the compositional structure of preterm infants' gut microbial community and increased diversity of gut microbiota compared with donor human milk and formula feeding.

The results of the use of prebiotics and probiotics varied among studies however the majority of the researchers reported positive bifidogenic effects on the development of beneficial bacteria.Conclusion Mothers' own milk is considered the best form of nutrition for preterm infants and the gut microbial community.

In general greater abundance of beneficial micro- biota for example Bifidobacterium and Lacto- bacillus is more desirable whereas pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli E. coli Enterobacter Citrobacter Proteus Klebsiella and Candida are less desirable in the promotion of gut health among preterm infants.The alteration or imbalance of microbiota also called dysbiosis or dysbacteriosis can disrupt human wellness particularly among vulnerable infants born prematurely 37 weeks gestational age.

Dysbacteriosis has been associated with increased risk of colic  and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants  and can lead to immune disorders e.g.

Given this potential it is important to consider that fatty acid composi- tion and bioavailability differ among feedings provided to preterm infants on the basis of the type of feeding they are provided.

Oligosaccharides well known as beneficial prebiotics for preterm infants are contained in human milk human milk oligosaccharides HMOs which has been shown to facilitate the growth of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus  .

The benefits related to probiotic use include reduction in pathogenic bacteria increase in beneficial bacteria improvement of food tolerance and decreased incidence of nosocomial sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants  .Feeding has been recognized as one of the most influential factors to contribute to the early development of the gut microbiome because milk is the first food to be introduced to the digestive tract in infancy  .

In addition milk is often supplemented with prebiotics and probiotics to increase the colonization of beneficial bacteria and to promoteThe purpose of this systematic review was to examine the association between feeding types and the development of the gut microbiome in preterm infants.the maturation of the gut community.
