the aims were 1 to analyze the effect of high-concentration multistrain probi- otic vivomixxr visbiomer supplementation on neuropsychological tests exploring several neurocognitive abilities and 2 to evaluate the safety of this supplementation.the primary endpoint aimed at evaluating the effect of this specific kind of probiotics supplementation on the following neuropsycholog- ical tests episodic declarative memory rey auditory verbal learning test ravlt visual perception and long-term visual memory function rey-osterrieth complex figure rocf executive function and ver- bal fluency frontal assessment battery fab test of phonological semantic verbal fluency pvfsvf working memory's number stor- age capacity and short-term memory back and forward digit-verbal span visuospatial short-term working memory corsi block-tappingtest cbtt visual attention and task switching trail making test tmt and frontal functions time and weight estimation test step.to evaluate the safety of the product at the neurological level a lumbar puncture before and after the probiotic supplementation was performed.

neuropsychological performance after probiotic supplementationa battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to all hiv-1- positive patients before t0 and after 6 months of probiotic supplemen- tation t6.

2011. we found that fecal bifidobacteria spp increased in all patients comparedto their basal level at 2 months of supplementation and remained sta- ble throughout the study confirming adherence of the patients to the regimen.our results showed that probiotics do not affect mirna-29a-c lev- els or the signature of mirna-29-a-c in csf collected from cart-fully suppressed hiv-1-positive patients confirming the neurological safety of the probiotic formulation a finding never described before in the literature.moreover our patients presented a relevant improvement of performance in the neuropsychological and behavioral tests after 6 months of probiotic intake.

2011. none of the patients studied had received prior neurocognitive tests.the results of neuropsychological tests are showed in table 1. in particular we observed a significant difference between t0 and t6 for immediate and delayed recall of ravlt immediate p  .0273 de- layed p  .0299 immediate and delayed recall of rocf immediate p  .0058 delayed p  .0019.also pvf p  .0137 step time p  .0246 weight p  .022 tas- 20 p  .0421 stay y-2 p  .0225 and cbtt-forward p  .0322test scores increased significantly in hiv-1-positive patients who took probiotics twice a day for 6 months.by contrast no significant differences were observed for the other neuropsychological test scores examined before and after probiotic intake.

the correlations between mirna-29a-c levels and neurological test scores were evaluated using the pearson's test.
