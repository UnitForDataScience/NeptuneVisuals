Tariq et al  had a similar experience inwhich approximately half of their accepted donor pool were excluded after passing screening with 1 donor becoming preg- nant 2 testing positive for Shiga toxin in stool and 1 opted out of being a donor.It was found that 11 of our PDs screened were eligible to be donors for FMTs.

Furthermore a particular donor seemed to be especially effective in a study of FMT for ulcerative colitis  but whether the same donor's micro- biome would also be ideal for other indications is unknown.

The strengths of this study are that it shows 1 a minimum cost estimate for clinics thinking of using FMTs and establishing their own pool of donors and 2 the difficulties that can be anticipated to establish and maintain a donor pool from a single center without significant funding.Our data raise the concern regarding the feasibility of in- dividual centers establishing and maintaining FMT donor pools.

The need to exclude donors with an increased risk of these diseases has left uncertainties regarding the cost and feasibility of donor screening.

The total cost for finding a single suitable donor was 15 190 US dollars.

This study illustrates that screening many individuals to find a donor and the subsequent associated costs may make central processing and shipment a more reasonable alternative.Keywords.

The need to exclude donors with evidence of these conditions or even evidence of being at increased risk of having a microbi- ome associated with these conditions such as having a family history of the disease because the microbiome can be similar among family members that live together  has left uncer- tainty regarding the cost and feasibility of donor screening.
