these two species are members of the red complex of periodontal pathogens that is the species most strongly associated with severe periodontitis 30. a recent report revealed that p. gingivalis was detected at a higher rate in escc tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal and healthy control mucosa moreover p. gingivalis presence was associated with escc lymph node metastasis and decreased survival time 39. more research is needed to deter- mine whether periodontal disease andor periodontal patho- gens play a role in eacescc carcinogenesis particularly as periodontal pathogen-eac risk associations were inconsistent between the cps-ii and plco cohorts.several small studies have characterized the esophageal microbiota in relation to eac 7 11 or its precursors gerd 7-9 and barrett's esophagus 7-10. campylobacter species were shown to dominate gerd and barrett's esophagus biop- sies compared with controls in two culture-based studies of subjects from the united kingdom 7 10. yang and colleagues surveyed 16s rrna genes from distal esophageal biopsies of 12 controls 12 gerd patients and 12 barrett's esophagus patients in the united states 8 they observed a distinctly different microbial composition in gerd and barrett's esophagus patients compared with controls characterized by greater diver- sity decreased streptococcus and increased abundance of gram- negative anaerobes including veillonella neisseria prevotella campylobacter porphyromonas fusobacterium and actinomyces.

in addition periodon- titis a disease of oral dysbiosis may be associated with increased esophageal cancer risk 14. however no studies have prospec- tively examined whether upper digestive tract microbiota influence risk for subsequent esophageal cancer.we hypothesized that oral microbiota influence develop- ment of esophageal cancer.

differing findings from previous literature may relate to differ- ences in study design cross-sectional vs. prospective and sample origin biopsy vs. oral.other studies have characterized the microbiota related to escc 13 and its precursor esd 12. yu and colleagues observed that lower microbial richness and altered composi- tion of upper digestive tract microbiota were associated with esd in chinese subjects 12. likewise chen and colleagues reported differences in carriage andor relative abundance of oral genera between 87 escc cases and 85 controls including increased relative abundance of prevotella streptococcus and porphyromonas in escc cases.

increased abundance of endocyto- sis sulfur relay system biosynthesis of siderophore groups and bisphenol degradation pathways was associated with higher eac risk and a-linolenic acid ala metabolism and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways with lower risk all p  0.05. we did not identify any pathways associated with escc risk.

cancer res 7723 6777-87. c2017 aacr.introductionesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and sixth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide 1. because late-stage presentation is common in most cases esoph- ageal cancers are highly fatal 5-year survival rates range from 15 to 25 in most countries 2. consequently there is a critical need for new avenues of prevention risk stratification and early detection.the two main types esophageal adenocarcinoma eac and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma escc differ greatly in incidence geography and etiology.
