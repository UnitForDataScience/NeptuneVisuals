 Prevention and EpidemiologyOral Microbiome Composition Reflects Prospective Risk for Esophageal CancersBrandilyn A. Peters1 Jing Wu12 Zhiheng Pei234 Liying Yang5 Mark P. Purdue6 Neal D. Freedman6 Eric J. Jacobs7 Susan M. Gapstur7 Richard B. Hayes12and Jiyoung Ahn12AbstractBacteria may play a role in esophageal adenocarcinoma EAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC although evidence is limited to cross-sectional studies.

Consequently there is a critical need for new avenues of prevention risk stratification and early detection.The two main types esophageal adenocarcinoma EAC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ESCC differ greatly in incidence geography and etiology.

Taxa names are colored by phylum OR estimates are colored only if nominally statistically significant P  0.05.nanceiensis Bergeyella oral taxon 322 Neisseria weaveri and Trep- onema vincentii was associated with higher ESCC risk while increased abundance of Prevotella oral taxon 306 and Aggregati- bacter paraphrophilus was associated with lower ESCC risk all P  0.05.

A recent report revealed that P. gingivalis was detected at a higher rate in ESCC tumor tissue compared with adjacent normal and healthy control mucosa moreover P. gingivalis presence was associated with ESCC lymph node metastasis and decreased survival time 39.

Likewise Chen and colleagues reported differences in carriage andor relative abundance of oral genera between 87 ESCC cases and 85 controls including increased relative abundance of Prevotella Streptococcus and Porphyromonas in ESCC cases.
