for example small molecules ''capsid binding agents'' that inhibit rv-a and rv-b binding and replication are not effective against rv-c because of differences in capsid structure.3c protease inhibitors are effective in vitro but results in clinical trials were disappointing.the large number of antigenically distinct rv types has been a barrier to vaccine development although new approaches have identified some degree of cross-reactivity among rv types and a highly multiplexed rv vaccine is immunogenic in animal models.detection and epidemiology.

an australian birth cohort study showed that the risk for wheezing at age 5 years was increased if the wheezing at less than 1 year of age was associated with rv either alone or 3.2 or with concomitant rsv or 4.1 but only in children with sensitization at an age of less than 2 years.therefore data from these high-risk birth cohorts suggest that atopic airways have an increased susceptibility to long-term dysfunction after rv-induced wheezing illnesses.in addition the subsequent asthma risk has also been demonstrated in population-based long-term follow-up studies in children hospitalized for the wheezing episode.in a finnish study asthma at age 7 years was more common after rv-induced 52 or 4.1 than after rsv-induced 15 severe bronchiolitis.in prospective studies viral wheezing episodes in infancy are associated with increased asthma risk for as long as 15 to 18 years.one study focused on the first episode of severe wheezing and demonstrated an association between rv andschool-age atopic asthma 84 or 5.5 in an 8-year follow-up.when the upper age limit of bronchiolitis is set to 6 months non-rsv-induced bronchiolitis most of these cases are rv induced has shown higher asthma risk 24 at age6.5 years than rsv-induced bronchiolitis 8.the association between rv-induced wheezing and the development of childhood asthma has been confirmed in a recent meta-analysis including 15 original articles.rsvrsv is a pneumovirus in the paramyxoviridae family and is a single-stranded enveloped rna virus with 2 major antigenic groups a and b .

respiratory syncytial virus rsv is the main causative agent of bronchiolitis whereas rhinovirus rv is most commonly detected in wheezing children thereafter.severe respiratory illness induced by either of these viruses is associated with subsequent development of asthma and the risk is greatest for young children who wheeze with rv infections.

children hospitalized for rv-induced wheezing tend to be older are more likely to have wheezed previously more often have allergic sensitization compared with those with rsv-induced wheezing and also show a favorable response to oral corticosteroid treatment whereas those with rsv-induced wheezing do not.although rsv can generally cause more severe infections in infants than rv the inception of wheeze might be more rapid and duration shorter with rv compared with rsv infection.

surfactant proteins have shown protective effects against rsv infection by regulating innate and adaptive immunity and participating in host defense pathways such as regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production chemotaxis or tissue repair.after rv attachment infected cells recognize rv pathogen-associated molecular patterns through interaction with 2 different families of pattern recognition receptors toll-like receptor tlr 2 tlr3 tlr7 and tlr8 and retinoic acid-inducible gene i-like receptors.tlr4 is a key regulatorof both innate and adaptive immune responses in rsvinfection.

for example both rv in- fections and allergens can enhance the airway epithelial cell production of il-25 and il-33 which promotes type 2 airway inflammation and remodeling.the il-33 polymorphism is linked to intermediate and late-onset wheezing and allergic sensitization.the first line of defense against rv infection is the airway epithelium which is relatively resistant to infec- tion when undamaged.

disrupted airway epithelium can favor rv replication by opening the way to deeper cell layers in which rv replicates most actively and by increasing the num- ber of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptors as shown inrecent in vitro studies.

damaged barrier function of the airway epithelium can also lead to enhanced absorption of aeroallergens or invasion of bacterial pathogens through the airway wall.finally rvs can contribute to airway remodel- ing by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor tgf-b and chemoattractants for airway smooth muscle cells.these effects might be more pronounced for rv infections in early life.thus repeated rv infections that extend to the lower airways could damage the airways and lead to remodeling of airway structures.rsv-induced wheezing and asthmarsv-induced bronchiolitis is linked to an increased risk for asthma.

palivizumab an mab that reduces the rate of severe rsv infection decreased recurrent wheezing in up to a 6-year follow-up in preterm infants but did not affect rates of atopic asthma.for infants with an initial rv-induced wheezing episode a 3-day course of oral prednisolone decreased the time to initiation of asthma control therapy in the subgroup of children with high rv genome load.interestingly all children with high rv genome load who were treated with pla- cebo required asthma control medication within just 14 months.

these findings suggest that rv infec- tions modify the upper airway microbiome and that quantitative and qualitative changes in the airway microbiome modify the probability that rv infection will lead to an exacerbation of asthma.conclusions and therapeutic opportunitiesrespiratory viruses interact with host and environmental factors to increase the risk of wheezing illnesses in infants and to increase the risk of exacerbations in asthmatic children.

rv likely causes less structural damage and yet is a significant contributor to wheezing illnesses in young children and in the context of asthma.

several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered and especially rhinovirus rv diagnostics have markedly improved.we have learned that bronchiolitis and early wheezing episodes are almost always 90 to 100 of cases associated with viral infections.

acute wheezing illnesses with rv and respiratory syncytial virus rsv are early markers for recurrent wheezing.in addition rv-induced wheezing episodes in infancy are a major risk factor for later asthma especially in children with atopic features.

once asthma is established exposure to allergens and rv infections are important triggers of asthma exacerbations in children.this review will focus on the role of viral infections on the development and exacerbation of asthma in children.
