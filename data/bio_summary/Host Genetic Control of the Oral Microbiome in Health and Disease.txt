Minusand plus signs next to each taxon name indicate taxa associated with caries-negative and caries- positive states respectively other taxa following a decreasing trend can be seen in Figure S6A.Previous twin-based studies on the heritability of oral microbes have relied on culture-based and array-based checkerboard hy- bridization approaches and contrary to our results they have suggested that the abundance of the cariogenic S. mutans and specific pathogenic attributes such as acid production in dental plaque and saliva are highly heritable traits  .The data presented herein show no evidence that potentially cariogenic streptococci and other taxa likely associated with caries are significantly driven by genetic factors.

On the contrary we show that taxa possibly playing a role in caries pathology are mainly modulated by shared and unique environmental forces and that the heritable fraction of the oral microbiome is not signifi- cantly associated with oral disease.These data also show that some taxa associated with health and disease also covaried with age and sugar consumption patterns and exhibited distinct ecological interactions.

These reports largely focused on the gut microbiome have shown heritable microbiome traits involved in food metabolic functions such as methanogenesis and fermentation  and host loci associated with the abundance of specific gut taxa such as Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia  .Evidence of host genetic control of the human oral microbiome using high-throughput sequencing approaches has been scarcer especially in the context of oral health and disease.CFigure 6.

The presence of dental caries was assessed using two categories based on disease progression caries confined to the outer enamel layer enamel and caries involving both the enamel and the deeper dentinal layer caries progressing to dentin.

Caries experience in each participant was initially reduced to a whole-mouth score and three classifications were utilized no evidence of current or previous caries experience evidence of current caries affecting the enamel layer only on one or more tooth surfaces evidence of previous or current caries experience that has progressed through the enamel layer to involve the dentin on one or more tooth surfaces including restorations or tooth extractions due to caries.

Moreover twin studies have shown that the gut microbiome similarity increases with host genetic background that some gut taxa are driven by additive genetic effects and that the abundance of specific gut taxa is linked to genes associated with immune and metabolic functions in the host .

These data contrast with results presented for the gut microbiome   where highly heritable taxa tended to co-occur more often.The low connectivity of highly heritable taxa is in contrast with OTUs showing a higher portion of their variability explained by shared environmental factors which tended to be highly con- nected hubs.

These taxa showed both greater shared and uniquenon-shared environmental vari- ation C  A and E or E  A and C. All the taxa associated with dental caries in enamel or progressing into dentin had a greater portion of their variation explained by unique or shared environ- mental factors A and 6B.

Thus while the human oral microbiome composition is influ- enced by host genetic background potentially cario- genic taxa are likely not controlled by genetic factors.INTRODUCTIONAlthough there has been a tremendous expansion in human mi- crobiome research with hundreds of projects underway globally  the oral microbiome has not received the same level of attention as its gut counterpart.
