This comparison indicated that in contrast with the gut microbiome oral bacteria may be more influenced by additive genetic effects oral microbiome A  19 Falconer's  0.25 gut microbiome A  12 Fal- coner's  0.14 p  2e-5 while the gut microbiome exhibits higher influence of shared environmental factors gut micro- biome C  29 oral microbiome C  8 p  4.1e-51.

These taxa showed both greater shared and uniquenon-shared environmental vari- ation C  A and E or E  A and C. All the taxa associated with dental caries in enamel or progressing into dentin had a greater portion of their variation explained by unique or shared environ- mental factors A and 6B.

Among the highly heritable OTUs Prevotella pallens exhibited the greatest A value A  65.4 q  1e-10 C  0 E  34.5 followed by Veillonella oral taxon A  59.6 q  1e-10 C  0 E  40 Pasteurellaceae A  58.1 q  1e-10 C  0 E  41.8 and Corynebacterium durum A  54.3 q  4.1e-5 C  1 E  49.3.

Highly Heritable Taxa Covary Significantly between MZ Twin PairsA-D Abundances of P. pallens A and B and unclassified Veillonella C and D. The taxa with the highest heritability values correlated significantly between twin pairs with stronger associations between MZ A and C Pearson's rho  0.5 p  0.001 compared to DZ individuals B and D.CDEcological Dynamics of Heritable MicrobesBased on the evidence collected ecological associations of taxa both driven by additive genetic effects or environmental factors and associated with health and disease were investigated.

Minusand plus signs next to each taxon name indicate taxa associated with caries-negative and caries- positive states respectively other taxa following a decreasing trend can be seen in Figure S6A.Previous twin-based studies on the heritability of oral microbes have relied on culture-based and array-based checkerboard hy- bridization approaches and contrary to our results they have suggested that the abundance of the cariogenic S. mutans and specific pathogenic attributes such as acid production in dental plaque and saliva are highly heritable traits  .The data presented herein show no evidence that potentially cariogenic streptococci and other taxa likely associated with caries are significantly driven by genetic factors.

Ecological Dynamics of the Oral Microbiome in the Context of Health and HeritabilityA and B Network view of co-occurrence patterns between OTUs nodes based on heritability estimates A  C and E A and shared environmental variation C  A and E B. Inset scatterplot shows relationships between degree of connectivity and A or C estimates.

Black gray and white circles denote OTUs with a greater proportion of their variation ex- plained by additive genetic A  C and E shared environmental C  A and E and non-sharedunique environmental factors E  A and C respectively.DC and D P. pallens C associated with a healthystate decreased in abundance as children aged while the environmentally driven Tannerella D predictive of caries showed the opposite trend.

On the contrary we show that taxa possibly playing a role in caries pathology are mainly modulated by shared and unique environmental forces and that the heritable fraction of the oral microbiome is not signifi- cantly associated with oral disease.These data also show that some taxa associated with health and disease also covaried with age and sugar consumption patterns and exhibited distinct ecological interactions.

Oral Microbiome Composition of Twins Discordant for Oral CariesA-D Principal coordinates ordination plots show that caries phenotype in dentin A and B and enamel C and D does not drive plaque microbiome composition in MZ A and C and dizygotic B and D twins as demonstrated by PERMANOVA p  0.9 R2  0.01.

These reports largely focused on the gut microbiome have shown heritable microbiome traits involved in food metabolic functions such as methanogenesis and fermentation  and host loci associated with the abundance of specific gut taxa such as Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia  .Evidence of host genetic control of the human oral microbiome using high-throughput sequencing approaches has been scarcer especially in the context of oral health and disease.CFigure 6.
