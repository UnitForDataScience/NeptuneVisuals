from a modelling perspective there are a number of questions to be an- swered chief among these are can a profile of the microbiota of a food matrix or other environment be used to predict the presence or absence of a pathogen or spoilage microorganism or given a specific microbial ecology what growth dynamics are we likely to observe and can we predict this an immediate follow-on question is then whether or not the microbiota can be modified in order to control the presence of an undesirable microorganism and can we propose efficient intervention strategies more generally which model adaptation or which new models are necessary to incorporate the ecosystem information in the ea predictions based on modelling of microbial communities have been reported for cheese fermentation  and marine phage abundance  using lotka-volterra equations corresponding to a nonlinear system of differential equations to model the predator-prey relationship of a simple ecosystem.studying microbial dynamics with generalized lotka-volterra equationsrequires the cell concentrations of the different taxa the growth rates of each taxon and its abundance at different times and the interaction strengths of the different community members which can be estimated by using network inference .

advancements in the research activities of these two domains will be presented and discussed through examples with a special focus on industrial applications.microbial dynamics along the food chainecology of food-associated microbial communitythe conditions encountered during food processing and storage shape the composition of the food-associated microbial community and have a governing influence on the growth persistence and inactivation of a pathogen in the food .

in addition to co-oc- currence and co-exclusion analysis functional metagenomics techni- ques could be deployed to characterize the metabolic potential of the microbial communities and their possible capability to produce antag- onistic or protective effects against pathogens  .for further inclusion in a farm-to-fork ea it is crucial to understandthe link between the factory environment microbial community and pathogen growth survival or decline.

it was stated that microbial responses to given environmental conditions were reproducible and could therefore be further used to predict microbial growth or inactivation .

in contrast progress in biomarker identification and characterization has already opened the possibility of making qualitative or even quantitative connection between process and formulation conditions and microbial responses at the strain level.

among them it is important to highlight the char- acteristics of the pathogenic agent the microbial ecology of the food the initial contamination of the raw material the processing packa- ging distribution and storage of the foods  .in 2009 although the separation of risk assessment and risk man- agement was not challenged a more interactive and comprehensive risk analysis framework was introduced .

the microbial communities interact in different ways.

microbial contaminants can originate from raw material airborne contamination or contact surfaces that were improperly cleaned andor disinfected.

metabolites andor molecules are released butnot at the same concentrations over the time and space meaning that microbial adaptation to environmental stress in space and in time is acontinuous process  .
