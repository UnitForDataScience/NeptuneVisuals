Indeed approximately 60 of cis9-181 a major milk FA 50e56 of cis9-161 90 of cis9-141 and 60 of cis9trans11-CLA originate from mammary gland syn- thesis through the action of the SCD enzyme on circulating 180 160 140 and trans11-181 respectively .Consequently rumen lipid metabolism and mammary uptakede novo synthesis and desaturation of FA determine the milk FA composition .Factors affecting milk fat compositionPasture feedingMilk yield and compositionIn cows grazed grass generally led to decreased milk yield and increased fat and protein content when compared to maize silage diets or total mixed rations e. In goats no difference in dairy performance was observed between grazed grass and alfalfa hay diet except for an increased fat yield for grazing animals .Milk fatty acid compositionFresh grass is rich in total FA 1e3 and 183n-3 represents 50e75 of total FA.

In contrast milk from cows fed pasture rich in Legumes had higher milk MUFA including trans11- and cis9-181 and PUFA concentrations espe- cially total CLA and no changes in 183n-3 concentration than milk from cows fed alfalfa hay whereas milk SFA content was not altered .

Linseed oil oftenly decreased milk fat yield whereas rapeseed had no effect .In goats hay-based diets supplemented with 5.5 linseed oil did not modify DM intake and milk yield whereas milk fat content and yield were increased .

Moreover dietary supplementation with 5.5 of oil from whole rapeseed did not change DM intake reduced milk yield and raised milk fat content .General milk fatty acid responses to oilseedsIn cows published experiments with a supply of 0.65 and0.59 kgd in the diet of linseed and rapeseed respectively were compiled according to a meta-analysis approach .

For the same level of milk cis9trans11-CLA the milk concentration of trans FA not containing trans11-181 and cis9trans11-CLA was increased more with linseed than grazed grass .In goats few studies have been done on the effect of oilseeds on milk FA composition and indirectly compared to those in cows.

The FA uptaken from the plasma are either released by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase from triglycerides circulating in chylomicrons or very low density lipoproteins or are derived from plasma non-esterified FA that circulate bound to al- bumin for the long-chain FA 16 atoms of carbon and over which are on average 60 of the FA secreted in milk those de novo synthesised involve two key enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase that use circulating acetate and beta- hydroxybutyrate produced by ruminal fermentation of carbohy- drates and by rumen epithelium from absorbed butyrate respec- tively resulting in short- and medium-chain FA 40 to 160 which are on average 40 of FA in milk .In mammary tissue these FA may be further desaturated by the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase SCD which introduces a cis-9 double bond on the fatty acyl-CoA substrates and mainly desa- turases 140 to 190 FA.

Mature grass is poorer in lipids and 183n-3 than young grass and grazing mature grass induced lower milk concentration of this FA - 0.3 g100 g and cis9trans11-CLA - 0.9 g100 g of total FA compared to young grass .In cows grazing pastures from different altitudes lowland vs. highland vs. Alpine induced variations in milk FA composition .

This variability could be due to both the grass phenological stage and the cow selection of grass.Goats grazing in a mountain spring pasture produced milk with an increased milk 183n-3 concentration  0.5 g100 g of total FA without changing cis9trans11-CLA compared to goats on a diet based on alfalfa hay straw and concentrate .

The whole linseed supplementation did not modify milk yield and milk fat content or yield in mid or late lactation .
