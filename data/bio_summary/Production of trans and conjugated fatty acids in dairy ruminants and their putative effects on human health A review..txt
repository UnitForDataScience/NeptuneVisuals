Moreover the European Food Safety Authority has recommended that total fat represent 20e35 of EI and for SFA and trans FA the intake should be as low as possible whereas Anses has recommended total fat be 35e40 of EI SFA 12 of EI and 2 of EI for trans FA respec- tively.

Nevertheless recent published studies report that industrial and ruminant trans FA rTFA the two major sources of trans FA have different effects on CVD risk factors .In Europe milk and dairy products provide from 27 to 57 of allSFA intake .

In vitro studies have shown that EPA cis5cis8cis11 cis14cis17-205 and DHA cis4cis7cis10- cis13cis16cis19-226 produce trans 181 isomers 6e15 primarily trans 10 and 11 isomers and cis 181 isomers 11e15 .

Dietary guidelines recommend that trans FA should be limited to 2 of EI without distinguishingthe origin of the trans FA.

Indeed individual trans isomers of 181 may have specific properties that need to be further investigated.Epidemiological studies clearly demonstrated a positive asso- ciation between CHD and trans FA intake from an industrial source and no from rTFA .

The World Health Organisation has recommended that total fat saturated FA SFA and trans FA should contribute up to 15e30 10 and 1 of the total en- ergy intake EI respectively.

Moreover these dietary products also contribute significantly to trans FA intake in human diets from 17 to 72 for The Netherlands and Germany respectively TRANSFAIR study .

The last part presents the consequences of trans 181 and conjugated FA on human health.Ruminant diets and characteristics of the rumenThe reticulo-rumen is the first digestive compartment in rumi- nants in which feeds are fermented by rumen microbes .
