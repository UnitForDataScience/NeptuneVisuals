For the rpoB gene analysis a partial sequence of the rpoB gene of strain MBLN091T was amplified by using the primers RPOB1698F 5C-AAYA- TYGGWTTGATHTCWTC-3C and RPOB2041R 5C- TGACGCATCATGTTDGAWCCCAT-3C which weredesigned based on a slight modification of the sequences previously described by Dahllof et al.

The 16S rRNA gene and rpoB gene sequences were obtained and assembled as described previously by Roh et al.
