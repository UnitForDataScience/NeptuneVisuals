1 - Some fundamental mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD which can explain the complex pathophysiology of the disease.

Moreover systemic clinical manifestations due to NAFLD-related CVD and or kidney disease may also be recognized.DiagnosisIt is widely accepted that NAFLD is mostly diagnosed by exclusion of other possible causes of chronic liver disease.

NASH may progress to NASH-related cirrhosis and HCC more often than SS which is regarded as a benign entity .Currently it is believed that NAFLD is not only a liver confined pathology but it is regarded as a multisystem disease with a hepatic component as well as extra-hepatic manifestations  except for the liver-related morbidity NAFLD is also related to extra-hepatic morbidity including systemic metabolic complications e.g.

Thus it is not recommended for all patients with NAFLD but should be considered for those who are at great risk for developing NASH and advanced fibrosis strength - 1 evidence - B or those patients with suspected NAFLD in whom the clinicaland laboratory evaluation cannot safely exclude other causes of chronic liver disease strength - 1 evidence - B .

adipsin obestatin omentin vaspin etc.. A thorough insight into the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking adipokines with NAFLD might lead to the design of studies investigating the combined adipokine peptides used as noninvasive diagnostic markers of NAFLD and novel clinical trials targeting the NAFLD treatment .Endocrine disruptors or endocrine-disrupting chemicalsEDCs constitute a highly heterogeneous group of molecules found in the environment or in consumer products.

Moreover higher rates of anti-Hp IgG were reported in NAFLD patients compared to controls in a cross-sectional study  but also an association between Hp infection and the mentioned IR being the pathoge- netic basis of NAFLD .Clinical ManifestationsThe great majority of patients with NAFLD remain asymp- tomatic or may report nonspecific symptoms especially fatigue .
