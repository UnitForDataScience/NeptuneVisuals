Briefly CS would ameliorate OA if A. muciniphila is present due to without overgrowth of SSB and SRB whereas CS would aggravate OA if A. muciniphila is absent because of failure in or lack of competition with abundant SSB and SRB.

2016.How can A. muciniphila residing in the gut confer a beneficial effect of CS on OA Why is CS ineffective or even harmful when SSB preferentially occupy the gut A. muciniphila may act as a gatekeeper of the mucosa de Vos 2017 or stimulate the mucosal immunity to prevent pathogenic invasion and prompt thickening of the colonic mucosa to reduce the susceptibility to infection.

D Unbalanced gut symbionts with more MEB than SSBSRB that ameliorate OA when the abundance of A. muciniphila is optimal or aggravate OA if the colonization of A. muciniphila is excessive.

To decipher how can an individual gut microbiota determine the clinical values of CS for treatment on OA we suggest here that CS would give distinct outcomes for OA treatment depending on Akkermansia muciniphila a gut commensal probiotic bacterial species as optimal presence albeit also behaving as mucus-eroding bacteria MEB when abundant presence.

Here we aim to give a perspective on the clinical assessment of the impact of CS on OA and other inflammatory disorders.EXPLAINING INCONSISTENT OUTCOMES OF CS ON OA BY THEINDIVIDUAL-SPECIFICITY OF GUT MICROBIOTA SYMBIONTSConsidering the oral administration gastrointestinal uptake and structural similarity of CS with mucin-type O-glycans of the colonic epithelium we propose a hypothesis of an Akkermansia muciniphila-dependent CS effect on OA in which CS improves OA if A. muciniphila is present and CS aggravates OA ifA.

muciniphila is absent.

A. muciniphila is a species of mucin- eroding bacteria MEB that competes with sulfatase-secreting bacteria SSB and the population should increase when SSB are rare and decrease when SSB are abundant.

2016.Colonization of A. muciniphila in the gastrointestinal tract varies among individuals Bressa et al.

A. muciniphila has been shown to increase following restriction in dietary fiber and a shift from fiber to mucin consumption Desai et al.
