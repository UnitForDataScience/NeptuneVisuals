Growing C. elegans on K12DtnaA compared with K12 shifted the Kaplan-Meier survival curve to the left Fig.

1A but was without significant effect on maximal lifespan Fig.

E. coli OP50 the normal food source for C. elegans which also produces indoles induced a survival curve similar to that seen with K12 Fig.

Growth of animals on K12DtnaA supple- mented with 250 mM indole compared with K12DtnaA supplemented with vehicle methanol shifted the Kaplan-Meier survival curve to the right Fig.

1C but was without significant effect on maximal lifespan Fig.

Notably growth of animals on K12 supplemented with 100 mM indole further shifted the survival curve to the right com- pared with animals grown on K12 alone and marginally extended maximal lifespan suggesting that exogenous indole may provide a therapeutic effect even beyond that of commensal bacteria Fig.

Exposure to indole increased survival of both young 2 d and old 18 d adult worms following thermal stress Fig.

Moreover brief preexposure 72 h of young 1 d adults to indole in the absence of K12DtnaA still rendered animals more resistant to heat stress compared with vehicle-treated controls Fig.

However differences were evident after day 15 animals grown with indole exhibited more thrashing motility and pharyngeal pumping and exhibited delayed onset of paralysis compared with animals grown without indole Fig.

Similar effects were evi- dent when animals were grown on K12 compared with K12DtnaA Fig.
