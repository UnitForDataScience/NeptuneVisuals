Interestingly the amount of butyric acid cor- responded to control value 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal.The relative amount of acetic acid was 1.5- fold decreased R  0.05 compared to the values observed one day after ceftriaxone withdrawal1.21.00.80.60.40.20ControlIn 1 day after ceftriaxone withdrawal In 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawaland corresponded to control values while relative amount of propionic acid remained 2-fold reduced R  0.05 vs. control.

We observed the 1.6-fold increased relative amount of acetic acid and 3.3- and 1.9-fold reduced pro- portion of propionic and butyric acids respectively R  0.05 one day after ceftriaxone withdrawal Fig.

This index reflects the redox potential of the colon environment balan- ce between putatively anti-inflammatory properties of butyric and propionic acids and proinflammatory acetic acid 32.

According to similar anti-inflammatory properties of these acids an increased level of butyric acid might occur due to a compensatory metabolic ac- tivation of butyrate-producing bacteria in response to a significant reduction in propionate formation.

The most signifi- cant changes were observed in the concentration of propionic and butyric acids that led to the increase of relative amount of acetic acid.

Identification of a free fatty acid receptor FFA2R expressed on leukocytes and activated by short-chain fatty acids.

Thus observed changes may indicate a trend toward a proinflammatory condition in the colon.Allowing for the fact that dysbiotic disturbance of mucosal microbiota were observed for a long time after ceftriaxone administration 27 we tested how these changes affect the SCFAs level in rat's feces.Concentration of the short-chain fatty acids SCFAs in rats in 1 and 56 days after ceftriaxone 300 mgkg i.m.
