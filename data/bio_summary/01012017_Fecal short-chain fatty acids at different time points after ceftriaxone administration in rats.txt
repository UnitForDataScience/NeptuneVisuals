One day after ceftriaxone withdrawal the concentrations of acetic propionic butyric acids and total SCFAs were decreased 2.9- 13.8- 8.5- 4.8-fold P  0.05 respectively.

This index reflects the redox potential of the colon environment balan- ce between putatively anti-inflammatory properties of butyric and propionic acids and proinflammatory acetic acid 32.

According to similar anti-inflammatory properties of these acids an increased level of butyric acid might occur due to a compensatory metabolic ac- tivation of butyrate-producing bacteria in response to a significant reduction in propionate formation.
