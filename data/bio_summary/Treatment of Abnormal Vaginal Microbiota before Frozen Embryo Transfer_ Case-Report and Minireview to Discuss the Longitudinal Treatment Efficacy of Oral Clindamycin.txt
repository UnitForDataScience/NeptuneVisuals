Furthermore we discuss future aspects of AVM treatment such as the potential impact of estrogen and live biotherapeutic products to positively modulate the microbiota of the reproductive tract.Keywords vaginal microbiota clindamycin frozen embryo transfer bacterial vaginosisINTRODUCTIONDuring the last two or three decades the diagnostic approach to BV has been either the clinical Amsel Criteria pH  4.5 fishy odor clue cells on wet smear vaginal discharge or different scoring methods of Gram stained vaginal smears e.g.

To further investigate causation intervention based studies are urgently needed and in that regard an important question is how do we modulate the vaginal microbiota from unfavorable to favorableWhen considering the close similarity between BV and AVM the standard treatment regimens for BV metronidazole and clindamycin seem to be the first line choice for AVM treatment.

To our knowledge no data has been presented to document the longitudinal treatment response of oral clindamycin administered for molecularly diagnosed AVM in an IVF setting.Here we present a case-report documenting the longitudinal effect of oral clindamycin on AVM and discuss our findings in the context of the available literature.cycle following two failed fresh IVF cycles see flowchart in Figure 1.

The low pH may have influenced the activity of clindamycin in the vaginal compartment as reported for Staphylococcus aureus the clindamycin MIC increased 4-fold by a decrease in pH from 7.4 to5.5 Lemaire et al.

2016 it could be speculated that oral clindamycin had sufficient activity in the uterine cavity to eradicate the G. vaginalis biofilm and apparently also vaginal G. vaginalis yet leaving the vaginal lactobacilli unaffected.

Consequently the vaginal pH was measured and a vaginal swab was obtained for AVM diagnosis using quantitative q threshold assessment of G. vaginalis and A. vaginae by qPCR Datcu et al.

The patient reported no side- effects from clindamycin during the treatment period until the follow-up consultation 8-days later.As shown in Figure 2 the short- and long-term treatment efficacy from oral clindamycin on AVM was excellent resulting in rapid eradication of G. vaginalis.

This finding may have important implications for the selection of the optimal route of administration of clindamycin in treatment trials of AVM in women preparing for IVF treatment as AVM has been shown to be negatively associated with reproductive outcomes following IVF.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSTH JJ BA and PH contributed to study design and manuscript drafting.
