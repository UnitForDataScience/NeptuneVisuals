have become more frequent throughout the san francisco estuary sfe delta since the early 2000s lehman et al.

2013. concomitantly populations of four pelagic fishes have been in decline throughout the sfe delta since 2002 a phenomenon referred to as the pelagic organism decline pod sommer et al.

2007 thomson et al.

2010. the temporal and spatial overlap of these two trends raises the possibility that microcystis blooms have contributed to the declining fish populations acuna et al.

2012. the sfe is the largest estuary on the u.s. pacific coast and consists of five major zones spanning the marine-freshwater continuum.secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacterial blooms may directly impair fish health and fitness wie- gand and pflugmacher 2005 leflaive and ten-hage 2007. the hepatotoxin microcystin can cause histopatho- logical effects in the organs of fish and can impair juvenile development malbrouck and kestemont 2006. microcys- tins have been identified in the liver tissue of delta smelt hypomesmus transpacificus harvested from the delta with liver necrosis and lesions characteristic of microcystin exposure also observed in long lived pod-impacted spe- cies including the striped bass morone saxatilis lehman et al.

2010. microcystis blooms may also indirectly influ- ence pod fishes by altering food web structure through competition smith 1986 huisman et al.

2004 or by releasing allelopathic compounds smith and doan 1999 legrand et al.

diatoms and cryptophytes ferrao-filho et al.

2000 von elert and wolffrom 2001 von elert et al.

2003. cal- anoid copepods are the main prey of most sfe fish larvae and juvenile delta smelt hobbs et al.

is a poor food source for thepredominant calanoid copepods in the delta eurytemora affinis and pseudodiaptomus forbesi ger et al.

2010 likely due to the large size of colonies burnsd and hegarty 1994 their lack of sterols and fatty acids lamp- ert 1987 and their production of toxic secondary metabolites wilson et al.

in addition to the putative effects of cya- nobacterial blooms a number of other stressors are believed to negatively influence pod species including increased salinity feyrer et al.

2007 decreased total suspended solids nobriga et al.

2005 increased water temperatures komoroske et al.
