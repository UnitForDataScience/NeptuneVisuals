have become more frequent throughout the San Francisco Estuary SFE Delta since the early 2000s Lehman et al.

Concomitantly populations of four pelagic fishes have been in decline throughout the SFE Delta since 2002 a phenomenon referred to as the pelagic organism decline POD Sommer et al.

2007 Thomson et al.

The temporal and spatial overlap of these two trends raises the possibility that Microcystis blooms have contributed to the declining fish populations Acuna et al.

Microcys- tins have been identified in the liver tissue of delta smelt Hypomesmus transpacificus harvested from the Delta with liver necrosis and lesions characteristic of microcystin exposure also observed in long lived POD-impacted spe- cies including the striped bass Morone saxatilis Lehman et al.

Microcystis blooms may also indirectly influ- ence POD fishes by altering food web structure through competition Smith 1986 Huisman et al.

2004 or by releasing allelopathic compounds Smith and Doan 1999 Legrand et al.

diatoms and cryptophytes Ferrao-Filho et al.

Cal- anoid copepods are the main prey of most SFE fish larvae and juvenile delta smelt Hobbs et al.
