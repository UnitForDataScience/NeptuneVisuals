Furthermore we investigated the folate production and release by B. adolescentis DSM 20083T and B. pseudocatenulatum DSM 20438T after 24 h cultivation using 5-CH3-H4folate and 5-CH3- H4PteGlu2-4 as marker compounds for cellular transport.Extra- and Intra-cellular Folate Production of B. adolescentis DSM 20083T during the Stationary PhaseResults from the growth experiment of B. adolescentis DSM 20083T in FFM showed a fast adaption to the synthetic medium which is depicted by the short lag-phase from 0 to 3 h Figure 1A.The stationary phase was reached after 11.5 h and viable cell counts remained constant after 15 h. In the following experiment the ratio of dead cells showed a linear increase from 15 to 45 h during the stationary phase Figure 1B confirming that steady state conditions were applied for folate analysis.

After 24 h B. adolescentis 125 mg cells wet weight produced a total amount of 0.846 nmol 5-CH3-H4folate 0.385 - 0.059 nmol 46 - 7 and 0.461 - 0.095 nmol 54 - 11 measured in the intracellular viable cells 52- 3 measured by fluorescence microscopy and extracellular lysed cells 48 - 3 fraction respectively.

the time t1-t0 between removing the culture from FFM and fluorescence microscopy.Extra- and Intra-Cellular Folate Production of B. adolescentis DSM 20083T during Stationary PhaseGrowth of B. adolescentis DSM 20083T was determined by drop plate method to identify the stationary phase see Supplementary Section S2.

For the least stable folate vitamer H4folate we observed a significant decrease P  0.05 intracellularly during steady state conditions Figure 1E.Characterization of Folate Production by B. adolescentis DSM 20083TOne culture of B. adolescentis DSM 20083T was examinedfor intra- and extra-cellular 5-CH -H folate and 5-CH -343 nA extracellular calculated nmolData AnalysisData analysis was carried out using the Xcalibur Software version2.0 Thermo Scientific Waltham USA.

Both methods showed no significant difference of the absolute amount of intra- and extra-cellular 5-CH3-H4folate.TABLE 1  Relative viabilities obtained from fluorescence microscopy measured or SIVA-LC-MSMS calculated.StrainRelative viability Fluorescence Ratio of absoluteThese results disprove the assumption that 5-CH3-H4folateis excreted actively by B. adolescentis as it would imply a significant higher proportion of extracellular 5-CH3-H4folate to total 5-CH3-H4folate than the ratio of dead cells measured bycalculation microscopyamounts5-CH3-H4folate intra-extra-cellular to totalmicroscopy.

Extracellular folates may indeed originate from intracellular folates but without being actively excreted and rather via liberation from bacterial cells after their death and desintegration.To test this hypothesis microbiological and analytical methods were applied to quantify folates and cell viability using pure cultures of B. adolescentis DSM 20083T and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum DSM 20438T.

The latter authors identified 5-CH3-H4folate structures of folate vitamers see Figure S1 and H4folate as main vitamers accumulated by cells cultivated in FFM.We recently developed a stable isotope dilution assay SIDA coupled with LC-MSMS for sensitive quantitation of the main folate vitamers accumulated and released by Bifidobacterium adolescentis DSM 20083T including 5-CH3-H4folate 5-HCO- H4folate H4folate and 5-CH3-H4PteGlu2-4 Kopp et al.

Both methods showed no significant P  0.05 difference between the absolute amount of intra- and extra-cellular 5-CH3-H4folate.Compared to the results obtained with B. adolescentis we found an even higher agreement between viabledead cells and intra-extra-cellular folate for B. pseudocatenulatum.DISCUSSIONCharacterization of folate synthesis by bacteria is challenging as analytical methodologies for folate determination differ considerably and imprecision of measurements might lead to a misinterpretation of results.Our previously developed SIDA LC-MSMS for detailed assessment of intra- and extra-cellular folate patterns in bifidobacteria Kopp et al.

Therefore we chose 5-CH3-H4folate as marker compound and determined intra- and extra-cellular concentrations of this vitamer and its polyglutamate patterns.The determination of 5-CH3-H4PteGlu2-4 revealed 5-CH3-H4PteGlu4 to be the only polyglutamic form released from cells into the medium 100 after 24 h. Combined with the relative count of viable and dead cells we obtained a significant correlation between viability and absolute amount of intra- and extra-cellular 5-CH3-H4folate.

In analogy to B. adolescentis DSM 20083T a relative viability of 56 - 7 and a relative mortality of 44 - 10 was calculated using the LC-MS approach.A relative corrected Figure S2B amount of 56 - 3 viable and 44 - 3 dead cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy.
