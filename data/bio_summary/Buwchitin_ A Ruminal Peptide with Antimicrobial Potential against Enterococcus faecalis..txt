2009 simon and daniel 2009. we identified a novel antimicrobial gene buwchitin from the rumen microbiome and sought to express and characterize itstable 3  hemolytic activity of buwchitin against sheep erythrocytes.

buwchitin which was identified as a potential antimicrobial gene was then expressed and further tested for antimicrobial activity.

given the low depolarizing activity of buwchitin it would seem that membrane-destabilizing activity alone does not explain the antimicrobial activity of buwchitin.

it is known that poly-cationic amps bound to teichoic acids including lipoteichoic lta and wall teichoic acids wta build a poly-anionic ladder and may initiate bacterial killing by facilitating the entry of peptides into the cytoplasmic membrane without membrane depolarization schneewind and missiakas 2014 malanovic and lohner 2016. further investigation into buwchitin teichoic acid binding and other mode of action studies are required to gain insights into its mechanism of action and the events leading to cell death.buwchitin is positively charged and has an amphiphilic structure with 29 hydrophobic residues as has been observed for many antimicrobial peptides hancock and sahl 2006. this positive charge greatly facilitates the accumulation of amps at the polyanionic microbial cell surfaces and may be sufficient for antimicrobial action hancock and sahl 2006 thusperturbing the membrane integrity.
