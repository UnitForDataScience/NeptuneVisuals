These functions cannot be performed normally in several diseases of which the following are dis- cussed here irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease which includes Crohn's disease and ulcer- ative colitis.

This is consistent with the current concept that antioxidants act by inhibiting oxidative stress pathways in a tissue- and environment-specific manner and not by simply acting as scavengers.c 2017 S. Karger AG BaselIntroductionThe problems in the gastrointestinal GI tract can lead to many diseases but in this review only irritable bowel syndrome IBS and inflammatory bowel disease IBD which includes Crohn's disease CD and ulcer- ative colitis UC are considered.
