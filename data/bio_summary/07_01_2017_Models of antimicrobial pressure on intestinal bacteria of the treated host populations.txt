the correspondence between the pre- dictions and data has improved with this ceftiofur model formulation incorporating the metabolite biotic degradation in small intestine and updated estimates of the digesta contents volumes the earlier deterministic model formulation predicted lower ce concentrations in large intestine .distributions of variables related to intestinal fate of ceftiofur metabolitesdistributions assigned to the variables related to the ce intestinal concentrations are summarized in .

the relative influence of the variables on the antimicrobially active ctc concentrations in the small and large intestines were similar in the model simulations assuming a hay-based diet tables 3-4. the simulated distributions showed that a longer digesta transit via the upper gi with a hay-based diet may result in a greater degradation and hence lower ctc concentrations in the small vs.  and especially in the large vs. intestines compared with those with a grain-based diet.the maximum projected ce concentration in the small intestine was at hour 14 and in the large intestine at hour 17 post-injection of the sustained-release cef- tiofur formulation  .

we simulated the influence of variation in the variables related to the ce intestinal fate above and  on the outcome - the ce concentrations undegraded and assumed to remain unsorbed antimicrobially active ceftiofur metabolites in the small and large intestines during the treatment and the intestinal elimination period.concentration of antimicrobial drugs in intestine2087simulation and analysis of the modelseach model was simulated 1000 times in vensimr professional software ventana systems inc harvard ma usa with latin hypercube sampling  of the value of each variable related to the drugmetabolite intestinal fate from the assumed distribution except for the digesta transit rates that were explicitly defined for the two diet scenarios for the ctc model.

those include the drug's fraction inclusive of any active metabolites excreted in bile the drug's fractions and intestinal segments of excretion via other mechanisms the rates and intestinal segments of the drug's absorption and re-absorption the rates and intestinal segments of the drug's abiotic and biotic degradation in the intestine the digesta passage time through the intestinal segments the rates mechanisms and reversibility of the drug's sorption to the digesta and enteric microbiome and the volume of luminal contents in the intestinal segments.

therefore based on a 020 estimate of the total ceftiofur degradation rate in spiked cattle feces    and considering that all cattle would have some enteric bacteria producing the degradation enzymes the ce hourly biodegradation rate in the intestine was assigned a uniform 015 025.we could not locate an estimate of ce sorption to cattle digesta or feces.

.a a single variable - fraction of ctc adsorbed to the digesta or microbiome - was included in the simulations.b intestinal transit time of ctc was set as the average of the liquid and solid digesta phases.c forage scenarios were diets a - grain based and b - long-form hay based.on the outcome - the concentrations of antimicrobially active ctc undegraded and unsorbed in the small and large intestines during the treatment and the intes- tinal elimination period.example 2 cephalosporin ceftiofur by injectionmodel structurefrom the framework outlined in  we chose the applicable processes and variables for modeling intestinal concentrations of ceftiofur metabolites .

the examples highlight the extent of currentignorance and need for empirical data on the variables influencing the selective pressures imposed by antimicrobial treatments on the host's intestinal bacteria.key words antimicrobial concentration in intestine antimicrobial pharmacokinetics antimicrobial resistance cattle drug degradation population pharmacokinetics.

in short these include the drug's fractions excreted in bile or via intestinal wall and re-absorbed the drug's abiotic and biotic degradation in the intestine the rates and fractions of the drug's sorption to the digesta and enteric microbiome as well as the digesta contents volume and passage time.

these include the drug's  transit time throughout the intestinal segments  abiotic and biotic degradation during the intestinal transit sorption to the  digesta and  microbiome  defecation the rate and pattern of the fecal masses leaving the intestine and  volume of the luminalcontents in intestinal segments the denominator for the antimicrobial concentrations present.to illustrate the importance of the variables - above least understood processes influencing the antimicrobial fate in the intestine i.e.
