The GI endocrine cells integrate and interact with each other and the ENS105.The NES regulates GI motility secretion absorption visceral sensitivity local immune defense cell proli- feration and appetite105.INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GI NES AND INTESTINAL MICROBIOTAor neurons paracrine mode through the circulating blood endocrine mode or by afferent and efferent synaptic transmission94-97 Figure 2.Recent observations of GI endocrine cells exhibiting both endocrine and neuron-like characteristics support a long-standing hypothesis about the evolution of the GI NES98.

The concentration of substance P in the colon of IL-2-knockout mice is decreased while substance-P- immunoreactive cells were unchanged251.Somatostatin The number of somatostatin cells is decreased in the colon of patients with IBD and in animal models of human IBD except for TNBS- induced colitis where it is increased245263-265 Figure 5.Ghrelin The circulating levels of ghrelin are elevated in patients with IBD with active inflammation266267.

Similarly the density of the GI endocrine cells the proportions of different endocrine cell types and the release of GI NEPA are affected in both IBD patients and animal models of human IBD.Chromograninsecretogranin family The circulating level of CgA is elevated in IBD patients and is reduced following treatment with certain biological agents56238-241.

The changes in GI endocrine cells can be explained by two different mechanisms abnormal stem cell clonogenic and differentiation progeny toward endocrine cells activities Figure 6 and switching on and off of the expression of certain GI NEPA Figure 7.Abnormal stem cell clonogenic and diffe- rentiation activities Each intestinal crypt contains four to six stem cells that either divide into identical new stem cells clonogenic or differentiate into all types of epithelial cells through a series of progenitors270-281.
