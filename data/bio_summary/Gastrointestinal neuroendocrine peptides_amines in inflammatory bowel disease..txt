the incidence of ibd isthe nes comprises two parts the gi endocrine cells in the mucosa and the enteric nervous system ens figure 1. the gi endocrine cells occur in all segments of the gi tract except for the esophagus4647.

it has been shown recently that mature gi endocrine cells can express up to seven different hormones515261-64.the gi endocrine cells have specialized sensory microvilli that project into the lumen and they respond to luminal stimuli mostly nutrients andor bacteria byproducts by releasing their hormones into the lamina propria324265-85.

furthermore butyrate has been found to affect neurons of the ens113116.interactions between the gi nes and the immune systemseveral nepa of the gi nes have been shown to interact with the immune system including members of the chromograninsecretogranin family serotonin vasoactive intestinal peptide vip members of the neuropeptide y npy family substance p somatostatin and ghrelin.chromograninsecretogranin familyall of the gi endocrine cell types produce members of the granins family including chromogranins a andb that are co-stored and co-released from the gi endocrine cells34117-120.

similarly the density of the gi endocrine cells the proportions of different endocrine cell types and the release of gi nepa are affected in both ibd patients and animal models of human ibd.chromograninsecretogranin family the circulating level of cga is elevated in ibd patients and is reduced following treatment with certain biological agents56238-241.

however recent studies have shed some light on the possible mechanisms of the inflammation-induced changes in the gi endocrine cells in ibd258270.whereas changes in gi endocrine cells do occur in uc cd lymphocytic colitis and animal models of human ibd the nature of these changes differ between the different ibds and animal modelsel-salhy m et al.

these findings show that the differentiation progeny toward endocrine cells is affected in animal models of human ibd.endocrine cellsfigure 6 proinflammatory substances such as cytokines may act on the intestinal stem cells and increase their clonogenic and differentiation progeny so that the density of intestinal endocrine cells increases during active inflammation.of human ibd9117244-248250259.
