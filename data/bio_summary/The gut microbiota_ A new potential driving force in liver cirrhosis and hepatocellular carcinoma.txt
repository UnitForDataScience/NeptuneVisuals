the gut microbiota has recently been recognized as a major environmental factor influencing the pathogenesis of several human diseases3 including liver cirrhosis45 and its complica- tions.6 the gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic microbial community mostly constituted of bacteria but also comprising fungi protozoa archea and viruses that inhabits the intestine.7 in physiological conditions the intestinal microbiota has a symbiotic relationship with its human host to which it provides metabolic trophic immunological and defense functions.7 the balanced interaction among bacteria epithelium andgut immune system is a prerequisite to guarantee the paradoxical dual function of the human ''healthy'' gut that absorbs nutrients while limiting the access of pathogen bacteria andor microbial-derived molecules lipopolysaccharide lps bacterial dna flagellyn peptidoglycans etc.

''14 indeed the liver receives approximately 70 of its blood supply from the intestine and delivers into the gut several substances beneficial to the intestinal trophism and functioning.15 when quantitative and qualitative changes in gut microbiota dysbiosis occur the integrity of the intestinal barrier is compromised with a consequent ''leaky gut'' and a pathological bacterial translocation bt.15 the microbiota-driven activation of kupffer cells the macrophages of the liver leads to the release proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfa whereas the stimulation of hsc promotes the development and the progression of liver fibrosis mainly through tlr-4-dependent nuclear factor nfkb activation.16 the inflammasome the multiprotein complex that senses signals from patho- gens and damaged cells also contributes to the micro- biota-driven liver injury and the hepatic immune response activation.1718 the inflammasome activation peculiarly requires a double signal to induce the inflam- matory response and leads to caspase-1 activation which proteolytically activates the cytokines.

the anatomical and function connection existing between gut and liver provides the theoretical basis to assume the liver is a major target for gut microbes.

gut microbiota is now emerging as a plausible candidate to explain this variability.in this manuscript we review the human and the experimental evidence supporting the potential implication of gut microbiota in the promotion progression and complication of liver disease.keywordsgut bacteria liver carcinogenesis bacterial translocation dysbiosisreceived 5 january 2017 accepted 21 march 2017introductionhepatocellular carcinoma hcc is the fifth most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death globally.1 hcc develops in the context of liver cirrhosis in the majority of cases and remains the leading cause of death among patients with advanced liver disease.2 the risk of developing hcc is widely variable among cirrhotic patients thus suggest- ing that beyond cirrhosis itself multiple additional genetic and environmental factors can be implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis.

thereby in this manuscript we will focus on the human and the experimental evidence supporting this association.gut microbiome and liver cirrhosisliver cirrhosis the end stage of different types of hep- atic injury is characterized by a derangement of hepatic architecture and portal hypertension.20 the increase in portal pressure elicits structural modifications of theintestinal wall including vascular congestion edema fibromuscolar proliferation thickening of the musco- laris mucosae and reduction or loosening of the tight junctions tj.2122 as a consequence intestinal perme- ability increases by both paracellular and transcellular movements hesitating in a pathological bt.23 on the other side a low gastric acid secretion an impaired intestinal motility a reduced antimicrobial activity of defensins decreased levels of mucosal iga and modi- fications in bile acids bas secretion are reported in patients with cirrhosis.24 bile acids exert antimicrobial effects by directly damaging the membrane of bacterial cells and indirectly through the activation of antibac- terial molecules through the farnesoid x receptor fxr a nuclear receptor for bile acids.25 fxr also regulates the expression of genes crucial in preventing bacterial overgrowth and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium.26in summary cirrhosis and portal hypertension dir- ectly impair intestinal permeability and indirectly affect the composition of gut microbiota thus facilitating bt and worsening liver disease.2728a contributory role of gut microbiota in the patho- genesis and progression of liver cirrhosis and its com- plications seems to be plausible based on finding the altered microbiota composition in stool saliva and mucosa samples of patients with liver cirrhosis table 1. overall the microbiome in cirrhosis shows dysbiosis with a decrease of bacteroidetes paralleled with an increase of proteobacteria at the phylum level and a decrease of lachnospiraceae and an increase of enterobacteriaceae veillonelaceae at the family level.

found higher proportion of bacteria of buccal origin such as streptococcus and veillonella in the gut microbiome of cirrhotics thus suggesting that the oral microbiota invades the gut and contributes to the progression of the disease in cir- rhotics.31 indeed the reduced gastric acid secretion and the modification in bas secretion observed in cirrhosis may facilitate the intestinal colonization of bacteria of buccal origin.

the limited number of patients analyzed the non-stratification of patients according to liver disease etiology and not least the non-standardized methodology and the associative nature of the studies conducted so far contribute to making the implication of gut microbes in the develop- ment or progression of liver diseases still speculative.gut microbiome and hcc animal models and human studiesin spite of the large amount of data on gut microbiome composition in cirrhosis only little and recent evidence is available in liver cancer.

it is likely that the promotion of a t regulatory t-reg cell immune- response by bacteria-derived metabolites decreases the migration of t helper 17 th17 cells to the liver.40 indeed previous studies found an increased level of th17 cells in the tumor and peri-tumor tissue suggest- ing their implication in liver carcinogenesis.41-43 overall these data draw a potential new pathway of liver car- cinogenesis based on a ''gut microbiota-liver axis'' paving the way to new possible strategies for the pre- vention and treatment of liver cancer.the obesity-associated gut microbiota is character- ized by increased levels of secondary ba deoxycholic acid dca known to promote hepatocarcinogen- esis.44 genetically or high-fat diet hfd-induced obes- ity was associated with higher levels of dca and a higher incidence of hcc in mice treated with thechemical carcinogen dimethylbenzaanthracene dmba.

this inflammatory response is amplified by il-1b which in turn provides positive feed-forward stimulation for pro- inflammatory molecules.19clinical and experimental evidence convincingly sup- ports the role of gut microbiota in many different stages of liver diseases.
