The genes encoding both BSAP-1 and BSAP-2 were acquired with adjacent genes encoding orthologs of their receptors replacing the receptor and rendering the strain resistant to the newly acquired toxin .In studying secreted antimicrobial molecules produced by B. fragilis we found that several strains such as 638R inhibited the growth of many B. fragilis strains whereas other strains had no secreted antimicrobial activity against the panel of strains analyzed .

The search for ubb higBA and the BSAP-1-encoding gene in the metagenomes was performed in the same way using the DNA sequences of CQW3703188 and CQW3703189 the higB and higA genes respectively from B. fragilis 078320-1 BF638R3923 the ubb gene from B. fragilis 638R including the region encoding the heretofore unannotated signal sequence and BF638R1646 the BSAP-1-encoding gene from B. fragilis 638R as queries Table S2.Genome sequencing of additional B. fragilis strains.

As 638R produces both BSAP-1 and BfUbb we performed a comprehensive analysis of the toxin activity of BSAP-1 and BfUbb against a set of 40 B. fragilis strains revealing that 75 of B. fra- gilis strains are targeted by one or the other of these two secreted proteins of strain 638R.IMPORTANCE We are just beginning to understand some of the important interac- tions that occur between microbes of the human gut microbiota that dictate the composition and abundance of its constituent members.

BSAP-1 is produced by a subset of B. fragilis strains and mediates its toxicity through pore formation following recognition of a specific outer membrane f3-barrel protein on sensitive non-BSAP-1-producing B. fragilis strains.

Unlike our findings with BSAP-1 where the B. fragilis strains analyzed either produce the toxin or are sensitive to it there are many B. fragilis strains that do not synthesize BfUbb and are also not sensitive to it Table S1.Species-wide analysis of the genetic architecture of the ubb region.

Another finding indicating that the HigBA system may not be the target of BfUbb is that we identified four B. fragilis strains with higAB genetic regions nearly identical to those of other sensitive strains and yet thesefour strains are not sensitive to BfUbb Table S1.Analysis of human gut metagenomic data sets for ubb.

The genes from B. fragilis 638R are BF638R1741 dnaJ BF638R3250 groL BF638R0298 gyrB BF638R1245 recA and BF638R4052 rpoB the genes from B. fragilis 078320-1 are CQW3703448 dnaJ CQW3703630 groL CQW3702683 gyrB CQW3701563 recA and CQW3701330 rpoB and the genes from B. fragilis 3112 are BFAG01078 dnaJ BFAG03510 groL BFAG02716 gyrB BFAG00519 recA and BFAG04295 rpoB.

As T6SSs are contact dependent this antagonism may largely occur when nutritional niches overlap andor when dietary nutrients are limiting and Bacteroidales species are forced to utilize host mucins one of the preferred carbon sources of B. fragilis .In contrast to the B. fragilis T6SSs the two identified Bacteroidales secreted non- contact-dependent antimicrobial proteins BSAPs each targets a subset of strains of the same species  .

We also showed that a mutant in which the BSAP-1-encoding gene of B. fragilis 638R is deleted retains the ability to inhibit the growth of a subset of B. fragilis strains .
