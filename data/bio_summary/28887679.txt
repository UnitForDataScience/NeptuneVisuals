Hot springs in India could be grouped into three categories based on intrin- sic temperature moderately hot 37-42 degC hot 50-70 degC and very hot 70 degC Table .

These observations reflect the presence of sulfate and arsenic in those two hot springs that support the growth of the organisms.Looking back and way forwardIndia has made its footprints on hot spring microbiological research in 2003 by investigating one hot spring at Bakresh- war Ghosh et al.

Das2Received 12 June 2017  Revised 22 August 2017  Accepted 31 August 2017  Published online 8 September 2017c Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017Abstract The earliest microbiological studies on hot springs in India date from 2003 a much later date com- pared to global attention in this striking field of study.

Despite a wide distribution of hot springs throughout India with hints of intrinsic scientific interest limited attention has been paid towards microbiological analysis of these hot springs.

This review for the first time has made an attempt to collectively look into those studies their outcomes and proposed a way forward with the identification of the limita-tions in the current format of studies.Geographical distribution of hot springsGSI has identified seven geothermal provinces containing nearly 400 thermal springs following in-depth geophysical explorations of hot springs based on the tectonic elements and geothermal gradients across India.

chemically analyzed all four closely located hot springs at Mahanadi geothermal province hot spring at Tarabalo Atri Athamallik and Taptapani had minor vari- ations in the concentrations of Na F Cl dissolved solids and conductivity.

1 description of novel species 2 screening and characterization of different bio-resources 3 metagen- omic investigation of hot spring microbiome and 4 whole genome analysis of bacteria for an elucidation of genes linked to the phenotypic expression.17 strains representing novel species were reported from 7 hot springs Supplementary Table 2.

59 morphologically distinct colonies were isolated from hot spring at Soldhar and Ringigad where authors found Bacillus as the most abundant culturable genera in those hot springs Kumar et al.

The abundance of bacteria in hot spring and predominance of described phyla has been documented from several hot springs distributed throughout the globe Meyer-Dombard et al.
