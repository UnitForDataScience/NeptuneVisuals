After collection they were transported to the laboratory in an insulated container with ice where they were thoroughly homogenized to one representative sample per locality and immediately processed.Artificial oil contaminationHeavy oil contamination was performed using fresh sediment sam- ples from each locality and the oil biodegradation process was moni- tored weekly during the first month and then monthly during the four following months when the oil was visually degraded.

We conducted a laboratory oil contamination experiment using sedi- ments from two mangroves with different oil contamination histories aiming to test the two-phase pattern of oil biodegradation hypothesis .

Several studies on oil contamination reported a drastic short-term reduction in the diversity of the bacterial communities which could be accounted for by oil toxicity and strong selection for particular hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria such as Alcanivorax spp.

Guanabara Bay has a much higher salin- ity value than Gargau and has been exposed to multiple oil spills whereas in Gargau there has never been an oil spill.

During the oil incubation period both sampling sites from Guanabara Bay showed change values close to 100 from the ini- tial community with the exception of GBA at day 7 suggesting that the initial community of GBA was already impacted by the presence of oil components.

Mangrove bacterial diversity and the impact of oil contaminationrevealed by pyrosequencing bacterial proxies for oil pollution.

The samples were kept under the same conditions until the oil was visibly degraded which happened after 5 months.

The most distinct cluster cluster 1 had samples from GBA and GBB and cluster 4 had samples from the 4 localities.DiscussionThe focus of this work was to test the reported hypothesis of a two- phase pattern of oil biodegradation  by assessing the ecological aspects of mangrove bacterial communities under artifi- cial heavy-oil exposure.

The second time-interval represents monthly  of changes in the community in relation to the first month.factors together our results indicate that oil exposure has a long-term effect in bacterial community structure and that the bacterial assem- blages are different as overall samples from Guanabara did not cluster together with samples from Gargau.
