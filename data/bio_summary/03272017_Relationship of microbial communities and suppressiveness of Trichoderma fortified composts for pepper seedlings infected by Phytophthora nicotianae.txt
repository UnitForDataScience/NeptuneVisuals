PCPTh compost and black peat fortified with T. harzianum PCPTa compost and black peat fortified with T. asperellum PCP compost and black peat PP Peat inoculated with P. nicotianae.

The lowest number of P. nicotianae was observed in treatment PCPTa fortified with T. asperellum p0.05 while the treatments with compost treatment PCP showed the highest values p0.05 compared with the rest of treatments .Abundance of BCAs in the rhizosphere of different substratesqPCR showed that the amount of T. asperellum did not change significantly p0.05 with the pathogen after 28 days of inoculation PCPTa  while in the absence of the pathogen P. nicotianae CPTa the amount of T. asperellum decreased significantly p0.05 .On the other hand T. harzianum did not change with or without pathogen inoculation after 28 days of inoculation PCPTh CPTh .

Quantification of T. asperellum and T. harzianum in different treatments at the beginning of the experiment 0 days and after harvesting 28 days.nd not detectedThe relative abundance at the phylum level varied across the different samples .Some differences were found between P. nicotianae non-infected compost treatments CPTh CPTa and CP and peat treatment P. Peat treatment showed higher relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria TM7 and Chlorobi and lower relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes and Chloroflexi.

The remaining high quality sequences were grouped in operational taxonomic units OTUs following open-refer- ence OTU picking protocol for QIIME where sequences were clustered against the UNITE database using the uclust ref algorithm at 97 similarity.Quantitative PCR qPCRQuantification of T. harzianum T. asperellum and P. nicotianae were performed in a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR system Applied Biosystems Waltham MA USA with Microamp1 Fast Optical 96-Well Reaction plate with barcode Life Technologies Carlsbad California.

Principal Component Analysis of bacterial and fungal communities was performed with Canoco for Windows 4.5.ResultsSuppressive effect and P. nicotianae abundance in the different substratesThe suppressive effect of the compost fortified with T. asperellum PCPTa was significantly p0.05 more effective than the one fortified with T. harzianum PCPTa .
