Apart from its orixogenic effects and direct correlation to insulin resistance leptin modulates the function of neutrophils   NK cells and macrophages increases the expression of adhesion molecules and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 IL-12 and TNF-a enhances naive T cell proliferation and contributes to maturation and survival of thymic T cells  .Adiponectin levels are inversely correlated with insulin resis- tance and high-molecular weight adiponectin was suggested to be protective against insulin resistance  .

For example Lacto-N-fucopentaose III LNFPIII an immunomodulatory glycan found in human milk improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice fed with high-fat diet HFD partially by increasing interleukin IL-10 secretion by macrophages and dendritic cells thereby reducing white adipose tissue inflamma- tion and potentiating insulin response and decreased hepatic lipogenesis.

Specifically the IL6 variant rs7801406 was associated with lower fasting insulin levels and the TNFA variant rs3039662 was associated with elevated fasting insulin levels.

The term ''para-inflamma- tion'' was coined by Ruslan Medzhitov  to characterize immune responses in which persistent tissue stress by a variety of stimuli such as advanced glycation end products AGEs and oxidized lipoproteins triggers maladaptive chronic non-resolving immune activation which is capable of resetting homeostatic set-points and thereby inhibiting insulin signaling pathways and prompting the development of insulin resistance ultimately driving all components of the metabolic syndrome.

Furthermore TNF-a neutralization improves insulin sensitivity   and deletion of IKK-b protects mice from the development of insulin resistance  .

ATM-mediated inflammation is one of the causes of insulin resistance   by secretion of cytokines suppressing insulin signaling through local paracrine and endocrine sys- temic pathways  .Following adipocyte secretion of MCP-1 and leukotriene B4 LTB4 monocytes are recruited to adipose tissues where they differentiate into ATMs which secrete TNF-a IL-6 and IL-1b that attract additional macrophages which lead to the activation of JNK and IKK-b  and increased tran- scription of inflammatory genes.

In contrast deletion of peroxisome proliferator-acti- vated receptor-g PPAR-g a transcription factor mediating anti- inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects increased insulin resistance and glucose intolerance  .In addition to macrophages other immune cells feature differential adipose tissue infiltration during obesity thereby contributing to insulin resistance.

In the absence of T lymphocytes RAG-1 deficient mice developed insulin resistance when fed HFD while CD4 T cell transfer normalized glucose tolerance in these mice suggesting a protective metabolic role for lympho- cytes against insulin resistance .

Furthermore obesity was shown to trigger small intestinal inflammation characterized by increased T cell density and pro-inflammatory cytokines possibly contributing to local insulin resistance in enterocytes  .Non-hematopoietic Mediators of the Metabolic Syndrome In addition to bona fide immune cells adipocytes secrete adipo- kines among which are leptin adiponectin resistin and visfatin which provide an important link between obesity insulin resis- tance and inflammation  .

In humans intermittent caloric restriction improved fasting insulin and insulin resistance and ameliorated blood pressure serum cholesterol and lipid levels .
