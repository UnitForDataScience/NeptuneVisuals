Given the complexity and numbers of species involved the overall metabolism of these bacteria in the GIT is also very complex and assessments of human and animal GIT health outcomes are often analysed by a number of indicators and parameters for GIT health.

Health benefits of reduced protein fermentation are related to the reduction of ammonia and other nitrogenous compounds in the GIT  while increased protein fermentation is considered to be detrimental to GIT health .Ammonia NH3 is the dominant by-product of the fermentation of amino acids in the GIT.

a prebiotic is a nondigestible compound that through its metabolization by microorganisms in the gut modulates composition andor activity of the gut microbiota thus conferring a beneficial physiological effect on the host.In other words the most important change is that it is alterations in GIT bacterial metabolism rather than specific numbers of bacterial species which receives the most attention.

In terms of behaviour in the GIT water solubility is considered to be a useful predictor of its water-holding capacity viscosity and degree of fermentation by GIT bacteria .

Largely it is DF and phytochemical-rich foods which are absent from these ultra-processed foods and it is these constituents which are being seen as an essential component for overall host health and of the gastrointestinal tract GIT microbiota .Gastro-Intestinal Tract Fermentation and Effects on HealthFor many years it has been recognised that a significant proportion of the health benefits of DF result from the presence and activities of the host's resident microbial population within the GIT .

However it is now a major area of investigation on the back of the cheap and accurate molecular characterisation of microbial species which is now possible using DNA sequencing techniques  coupled with detailed enzymology studies.Gastro-Intestinal Tract MicrobiotaThe GIT microbiota encompasses the microbial population within the entire GIT from the mouth to the anus.

The flavan-3-ols used were mostly metabolised by the GIT microbiota within 4-8 h to monomeric flavonoids and hydroxylated phenol-carboxylic acids which were speculated to be responsible for antioxidant activities .Sanchez-Patan and co-workers  assessed the metabolism of phenolic compounds comparing a cranberry and a grape seed extract by the GIT microbiota using an in vitro model of the ascending and descending colon without previous intestinal digestion.

At that time a prebiotic was generally to be a single usually a comparatively simple carbohydrate ingredient that would be fermentable in the GIT leading to a positive shift in the microbiota and therefore considered to support GIT health .However since then this definition has been modified several times as summarized by Bindels et al.
