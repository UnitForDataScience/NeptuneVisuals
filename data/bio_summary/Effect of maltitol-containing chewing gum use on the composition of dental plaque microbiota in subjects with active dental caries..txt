They were also shown to increase plaque pH and reduce plaque scores and levels of caries-associated bacterial species from the genera Streptococcus Lactobacillus and Actinomyces .

Samples of plaque were collected at baseline following which subjects were asked to use the chew- ing gum five times two pieces of SweetPearlr maltitol gum or one piece of gum base a day for 2 weeks after which further plaque samples were collected.The chewing gums were experimental formula- tions.

The plaque from each subject at each visit was pooled and placed in 1 mL SSDE buffer saline-saturated 20 DMSO- 0.25M EDTA pH 8.0 and stored at -70degC until being subjected to analysis.DNA was extracted from the plaque samples by means of the Genelute DNA extraction kit Merck Gillingham UK with the additional pre-treatment with lysozyme Merck recommended by the manu- facturers for Gram-positive bacteria and 16S rRNA genes amplified by PCR with primers 27F with the YM modification and 519R targeting variable regions 1-3.

A longer duration of treatment may therefore have shown an effect of chewing on levels of bacterial caries markers and should be investigated for effects on plaque microbiota composition.The levels of the caries-associated bacterial groups mutans-group streptococci and lactobacilli in plaque were very low even in the caries-active group.

Bacteria in dental plaque produce acids that degrade the tooth tissues and the local reduction of pH leads to the selection of an aciduric microbiota which contributes further to lesion development.

Polyols such as xylitol can inhibit acid production by plaque reduce the numbers of acid-producing bacteria and have been shown to be anti-cariogenic .

Chewing gum stimulates salivary flow promoting the removal of dietary fermentable carbohydrate from the mouth while also removing plaque from the teeth .

The aim of this study was to investigate the interac- tion between maltitol and oral bacteria by comparing the composition of the dental plaque microbiota in patients with active caries before and after using a chewing gum supplemented with maltitol or base gum for 2 weeks.

The composition of the plaque microbiota was determined using a high-c 2017 The Authors.
