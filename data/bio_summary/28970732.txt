although gm imbalance in diseased infants was identified and gm improved after kd treatment more exploration was needed to elucidate the contri bution of a healthy gm to epilepsy onsetrecovery.this study revealed that kd can mitigate the symepileptic infants.

to uncover the mechanism and pathogens involved in refractory infantile epilepsy further research should underscore functional gene networks in gm.acknowledgmentswe thank the staff of wehealthgene who contributed to the project but whose names are not included in the author list.backgroundinfants with refractory epilepsy could not be cured by several anti-epileptic drugs aeds and ketogenic diet kd was increasingly used as an alternative therapy to refractory epilepsy.

in this study we performed a comparison between diseased infants before and after kd treatment and healthy controls to explore if and how gm of infants with refractorypediatric epilepsy is widespread with complications including cognitive impairment delayed neurodevelop ment and loss of bodily control12.

the decreased number of dominant pathogens and significantly increased number of beneficial bacteria after kd treatment offer new insight into kd therapy for epilepsy.applicationsthis study found several types of bacteria altered in the gm suggesting that these bacteria could be monitored as biomarkers to provide an important reference for epilepsy treatment.terminologygm which consists of many kinds of bacteria including pathogens commensalsxie g et al .

although this study provides new insight into the involvement of gm in pediatric refractory epilepsy the gap between kd and epilepsy recovery is still huge.

a highfat diet induced selective enrichment of bilemetabolizing microbiota such as bacteroides16 whilst highfiber foods promoted thecore tip many infants with epilepsy are refractory to current antiepileptic drugs and ketogenic diet kd could help to moderate seizure frequency as an alternative treatment.

kd could rapidly alter gm and alleviate seizure frequency in infants with refractory epilepsy.

proteobacteria was highly accumulated in infants with refractory epilepsy 24.34 and decreased dramatically after kd therapy 10.77. at the genus level cronobacter was dominant in the patients 23.30 vs 0.00 in the healthy group.

this will provide more insights into distinct metabolic networks in imbalanced gm.in conclusion we found that gm of infants with refractory epilepsy differed dramatically from that of healthy infants.

they discovered that the composition of the gm in healthy and diseased infants was significantly different specifically in healthy infants as opposed to those with refractory epilepsy.
