consequently as this 16s rrna nucleotide sequence similarity was lower than the threshold of 98 recommended by tindall rossello-mora busse ludwig and kampfer 2010 to delineate a new species it was classified as a new species called bacillus kwashiorkori sit6t table 1. furthermore this percentage of similarity comprised in the range of percentage similarity of bacillus species 82.7-100 confirming the new spe- cies status rossi-tamisier benamar raoult  fournier 2015. the reference spectrum for strain sit6t was thus incremented in the urmite database figure 2 and then compared to other known species of the genus bacillus.
