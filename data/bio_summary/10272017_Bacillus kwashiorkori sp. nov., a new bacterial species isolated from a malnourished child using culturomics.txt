The mean level of nucleotide sequence similarity at the genome level between B. kwashiorkori and other Bacillus species was estimated using the Average Genomic Identity of Orthologous Gene Sequences AGIOS in-house software Ramasamy et al.

The reference spectrum for strain SIT6T was thus incremented in the URMITE database Figure 2 and then compared to other known species of the genus Bacillus.

The range of AGIOS varied from 54.77 to 65.50 between B. kwashiorkori and other compared Bacillus speciesTable 7.

An automated cluster gen- eration and sequencing run was performed in a single 39-hr run in a 2 x 251 bp.FIGURE 3 Gel view comparing Bacillus kwashiorkori SIT6T spectra with other members of the genus Bacillus.

Although the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain SIT6T showed 94.58 similarity with Bacillus kokeshiiformis MO-04T and 94.57 similarity with Bacillus thermolactis R-6488T by EzBioCloud's identify server.
