Taken together all these character- istic structural features yield an extended sequence pattern H-E-2X-H- 2X-G-2X-H-ST-6X-M-3X-Y-9X-D-D-7X-Y-X D which distin-guishes the C-terminal segment of MMP CDs from other metzincin families and MPs in general .In addition to the CD a further hallmark of MMPs is that latency is maintained through the PD  which together with transcriptional regulation and dedicated protein inhibitors regulates physiological MMP activity .

We thus performed a database search which revealed several potential sequences in the phylumTable 3Fungal MMP sequences.Phylum AscomycotaClass DothideomycetesBipolaris oryzae388 residuesGB XP0077684757UP W6ZMI0Bipolaris victoriae388 residuesGB XP014556326UP W7EIS0Bipolaris zeicola388 residuesGB XP007709037UP W6YG21Cochliobulus heterostrophus Bipolaris maydis388 residuesGB XP014075121UP N4X7I4 UP M2V381Cochliobulus sativus Bipolaris sorokiniana320 residuesGB XP007696738UP M2TCL8 Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa411 residuesGB XP018039150UP A0A177CMM7 Phaeosphaeria nodorum Parastagonospora nodorumSeptoria nodorum326 residuesGB XP001794978UP Q0UUK1 Pyrenochaeta sp.565 residuesUP A0A178DJW7Stagonospora sp.393 residuesUP A0A178BDB5Stemphylium lycopersici563 residuesUP A0A0L1HKC2 Class EurotiomycetesAspergillus calidoustus290 residuesUP A0A0U5G9D2Aspergillus flavus274 residuesGB XP002379978UP B8NI13 UP A0A0D9MRC7Aspergillus lentulus311 residuesUP A0A0S7DKQ5Aspergillus udagawae282 residuesUP A0A0K8L198Endocarpon pusillum306 residuesGB XP007803399UP U1HKZ8Exophiala aquamarina282 residuesGB XP013264742UP A0A072PQX4Neosartorya fischeri Aspergillus fischerianus616 residuesGB XP001261124UP A1DIM0 Class LeotiomycetesPseudogymnoascus sp.255 residuesUP A0A094DQI1 UP A0A094ITE6 Class OrbiliomycetesAll sequence codes are from UniProt UP  or GenBank GB .Sequence searches were performed with structurally validated MMP CDs within UniProt  or the National Center for Biotechnology Information blast.ncbi.nlm.

However when the structures of profragilysin-3 and the closely-related metalloproteinase II were reported it became obvious that fragilysins which are present in enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains but not com- mensal ones represent a metzincin family on their own which is closer to adamalysinADAMs than MMPs if at all .To complete the picture of MMP distribution in prokaryotes we conducted sequence similarity searches and identified several hundred potential MMP orthologs across archaeal and bacterial genomes some of them with several copies.
