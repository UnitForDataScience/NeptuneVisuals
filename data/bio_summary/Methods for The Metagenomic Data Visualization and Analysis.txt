With this consideration in mind we have divided the description of the methods for metagenomic data visualization into three sections the methods that are commonly intended for the visual display of a single metage- nome several metagenomes the number is about 10 and multiple metagenomes tens to hundreds of metagenomes.Table 3.1 Methods for metagenomic data visualization with a short description rationality for the visualization of single several and multiple metagenomes the advantages and drawbacks of each approach and some selected tools and articles where this approach was implementedMethodSuggested usage and subtypesSingle metagenomeSeveral metagenomesMultiplemetagenomes AdvantagesDrawbacksSelected implementationsPie chartsTaxon abundance at all taxonomic ranksTaxon abundance at a fixed taxonomic rank with various characteristics of contigsComparison of metagenomic featuresBar chartsTaxon abundance at alltaxonomic ranksTaxon abundance at a fixedtaxonomic rankTaxon abundance for any numerical meta-data category-Convenient for overviewing the community structure of a single metagenome-Multiple metagenomic can be represented as rings-Many metagenome features represented as ringsSummarizes the information about all metagenomes--Opportunities for the demonstrativecomparison of several metagenomesInformation about all samples is usedPoor comparability between several metagenomesCan be too large and contain too much information for easy perceptionCan be too large and contain too much information for easy perceptionCan contain too many coloured bars for easy perceptionToo many taxa are shownDifficult to perceive if the number of the categories is highKrona AmphoraVizu TaxonomerAnvi'oAnvi'oAmphoraVizuCommunity Analyzer PhinchPhinchDistribution of samples for each taxonomic rank--Difficulty for perception if the number of taxa is largeCommunity AnalyzerManhattan plots Metagenomic SNPsdistribution along the microbial genomes--The highest values of each metagenomic SNP are clearly distinguishableToo many SNPs can be confusingExplicitTable 3.1 ContinuedSuggested usage andSingleSeveralMultipleSelectedMethodsubtypesmetagenomemetagenomesmetagenomes AdvantagesDrawbacksimplementationsBubble chartsContig graph of a singlemetagenome--Dimension reduction and nice representation in the form of densely concentrated contigsLarge number of contigs can be disorientatingElviz R package 'gbtools'Rarefaction curvesTaxonomic graph at any taxonomic rankRichness of the community alpha-diversityWhen large the representation is chaotic--Shows multilevel informationPhinchQIIME Eren et al.

An example of this is the metagenomic single nucleotide polymorphisms metagenomic SNPs that can be calculated in large numbers in each of the most prevalent genomes in the metagenome Luo et al.

The samples on a PCoA can be coloured by the country of origin to highlight the country-specific features of microbiota in the populations of the world Tyakht et al.

The approach can be used to track the temporal dynamics for example of an infant gut metagenome with respect to the adults' samples this visualization was performed using the EMPeror tool Vazquez- Baeza et al.

Since the data are metagenomic vertices are samples painted in one colour and taxa painted in another colour while edges connect taxa with all samples where they occur.A special case of the several metagenomes analysis is the paired comparison when the samples are grouped into pairs.

Although this approach can display mutually exclu- sive relations between the taxa the limitation is that it does not show the abundances of individual taxa.One of the novel approaches for metagenomic visualization depicts taxonomic units as vertices Sedlar et al.

For example ESOM-clustering has been used for classifying the metagenomic sequence structures for the selected metagenomes Laczny et al.

One of the recent metagenomic visualization tools that implements such hybrid is ResistoMap Yarygin et al.
