the fact that a researcher's success is based on effective navigation between different scales of visual representation for the data is neatly expressed by the so-called visual information seeking mantra 'overview first zoom and filter then details on demand' shneiderman 1996. with this consideration in mind we have divided the description of the methods for metagenomic data visualization into three sections the methods that are commonly intended for the visual display of a single metage- nome several metagenomes the number is about 10 and multiple metagenomes tens to hundreds of metagenomes.table 3.1 methods for metagenomic data visualization with a short description rationality for the visualization of single several and multiple metagenomes the advantages and drawbacks of each approach and some selected tools and articles where this approach was implementedmethodsuggested usage and subtypessingle metagenomeseveral metagenomesmultiplemetagenomes advantagesdrawbacksselected implementationspie chartstaxon abundance at all taxonomic rankstaxon abundance at a fixed taxonomic rank with various characteristics of contigscomparison of metagenomic featuresbar chartstaxon abundance at alltaxonomic rankstaxon abundance at a fixedtaxonomic ranktaxon abundance for any numerical meta-data category-convenient for overviewing the community structure of a single metagenome-multiple metagenomic can be represented as rings-many metagenome features represented as ringssummarizes the information about all metagenomes--opportunities for the demonstrativecomparison of several metagenomesinformation about all samples is usedpoor comparability between several metagenomescan be too large and contain too much information for easy perceptioncan be too large and contain too much information for easy perceptioncan contain too many coloured bars for easy perceptiontoo many taxa are showndifficult to perceive if the number of the categories is highkrona amphoravizu taxonomeranvi'oanvi'oamphoravizucommunity analyzer phinchphinchdistribution of samples for each taxonomic rank--difficulty for perception if the number of taxa is largecommunity analyzermanhattan plots metagenomic snpsdistribution along the microbial genomes--the highest values of each metagenomic snp are clearly distinguishabletoo many snps can be confusingexplicittable 3.1 continuedsuggested usage andsingleseveralmultipleselectedmethodsubtypesmetagenomemetagenomesmetagenomes advantagesdrawbacksimplementationsbubble chartscontig graph of a singlemetagenome--dimension reduction and nice representation in the form of densely concentrated contigslarge number of contigs can be disorientatingelviz r package 'gbtools'rarefaction curvestaxonomic graph at any taxonomic rankrichness of the community alpha-diversitywhen large the representation is chaotic--shows multilevel informationphinchqiime eren et al.

nucleic acids research 2010visualization of metagenomic data  43visualizing a single metagenomeon the most detailed level visualization of a single metagenomic dataset is needed to repre- sent clearly some taxonomic functional or other properties of a given metagenome in order to understand its structure and infer biological insights.

analysis of a metagenomic dataset involves certain feature extraction millions of metagenomic reads produced as the result of the dna sequencing can hardly be directly visualized in a comprehensive way.

2014 or the r package 'rcharts' vaidyanathan 2013. it is worth mentioning an advanced implementation of a box plot 'violin plot' that shows more details about the variablevisualization of metagenomic data  49distribution due to the presence of a histogram especially useful for the data distributed in a non-normal way the method is available in the r package 'vioplot' adler and adler 2014.the standard way of representing the community structure inferred from metagenomic data is by means of an abundance table where the rows correspond to samples and col- umns to features microbial taxa the values in the cells show the relative abundance of the respective taxa in the sample.

more detailed it can be interpreted as a ramification representation of the data with the arrow width depending on the quantification of the grouped data.visualization of metagenomic data  51it is possible to construct a ramification representing relative abundance of the taxa that groups metagenomic data into taxa at every taxonomic rank.

metagenomic data can be also represented as trees with the r package 'phyloseq' mcmurdie and holmes 2013. along with the well-known visualization methods like pie charts and bar charts a box plot is another popular technique for representing the numerical data that indicates their48  sudarikov et al.figure 3.2 bar chart showing taxonomic composition of microbial communities at the level of class.

although this approach can display mutually exclu- sive relations between the taxa the limitation is that it does not show the abundances of individual taxa.one of the novel approaches for metagenomic visualization depicts taxonomic units as vertices sedlar et al.

for example esom-clustering has been used for classifying the metagenomic sequence structures for the selected metagenomes laczny et al.

one of the recent metagenomic visualization tools that implements such hybrid is resistomap yarygin et al.

faced with such complex data a metagenomic researcher needs to select the means for data analysis properly.

here we present a review of the state-of-the-art methods for the visualization of metagenomic data in a multilevel manner from the methods applicable to an in-depth analysis of a single metagenome to the techniques appropriate for large-scale studies containing hundreds of environmental samples.introductionmetagenomics is an interdisciplinary research field combining molecular genetics micro- bial ecology and data analysis.

visualization of metagenomics is an active area of research with dozens of new publications describing novel original methods every year and bringing new tools for generating and testing novel biological hypotheses from the visualization.here we represent a comprehensive overview of the existing methods for the visualiza- tion of metagenomic datasets.

while the general graphic design guidelines of choosing the proper palette illustration composition proportions fonts and other artistic elements are described elsewhere tufte 1986 steele and iliinsky 2010 the main focus of our review is on various visual techniques that prove particularly appropriate for mining the data on microbiota and can be easily adopted by a beginning metagenomic researcher using publicly available software implementations as a web service or a stand-alone application.
