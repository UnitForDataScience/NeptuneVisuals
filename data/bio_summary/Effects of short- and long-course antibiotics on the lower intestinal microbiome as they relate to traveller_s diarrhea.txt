Although treatment with an antibiotic to which the offending path- ogen is resistant has never been demonstrated to worsen or prolong infection in a randomized controlled study of antibiotics for travel- ler's diarrhea neither is it the goal of such studies to examine such a role for antibiotics in these studies--instead special care is taken to study antibiotics in populations where resistance is not a prob- lem.

Meanwhile as demonstrated in studies of antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea there are clearly days of illness that are currently being prevented either through effective prophylaxis in high-risk persons or early self- treatment that shortens the course of diarrhea.However there are other adverse events related to antibiotics that must also be con- sidered including community-associated C. difficile infection that has been reported in antibiotic-exposed travellersas well as other adverse drug events.Focusing just on traveller's diarrhea the shift from overall benefit to harm caused by antibiotics may be depen- dent upon both the timing of antibiotic exposure in relation to exposure to the pathobiont i.e.

and Camplylobacter spp.However early data suggest that even the much more common bacterial cause of traveller's diarrhea Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli ETEC may also function as a pathobiont in that there may be unique individual or collective sets of commensal bacteria that protect some humans from dis- ease following challengeand animal models suggest a role for probiotics in the prevention of ETEC diarrhea.The important role of prior treatment with antibiotics inthis case a large dose of streptomycin in increasing the suscepti- bility of mice to intestinal infection with Salmonella enteriditis was first recognized in 1964--an effect thought mediated by elimination of certain anaerobes.More recently in a large combined case-control and source attribution analysis of hu- man salmonellosis cases Mughini-Gras et al.showed that re- cent use of antibiotics had a population attributable risk similar to that of eating raw or undercooked eggs.

The gut resis- tome among healthy community-dwelling adults reflects geographic variability in antibiotic use practices in both humans and food-producing animals as well as possibly the transmission of antibiotic resistance genes through the food supply.Conclusions Because antibiotic use among travelers will influence the resistome and thereby promote geographic spread of resistance it is important that antibiotic use recommendations for travelers be guided by resistance sur- veillance data as well as a careful assessment of the risks and benefits to both the individual and society.Key words Traveller's diarrhea antibiotics microbiomeIntroductionOf over one billion international travellers a year about 300 million travel from relatively industrialized regions with high levels of sanitation to less industrialized regions where travel- lers' diarrhea occurs in 20-50.-Among patients with travel- ler's diarrhea anywhere from 5 to 62 may take antibiotics despite most cases being mild to moderate in severity.

Thus a key metabolic function of the gut microbiome is bile salt metab- olism that normally defends against CDI but is disrupted by an- tibiotics.There may be other similarly specific mechanisms that lie behind the colonization resistance afforded by the gut microbiome against other pathobionts.Antibiotic Effects on the MicrobiomeRecent advances in next generation sequencing and metagenom- ics make it possible to build upon epidemiologic data tounderstand the impact of antibiotics on the risk of infection and antibiotic resistance.

up to 61 Campylobacter spp..Epidemiologic data indicating infection risk from antibioticsin addition to having important implications for how one approaches the prevention and management of traveller's diar- rhea highlight the importance of resistance to colonization and infection afforded by an intact gut microbiome.

One bacterial phylum that commonly increases in the gut following antibiotics are the proteobacteria including Enterobacteriacea these are pro-inflammatory and often carry antibiotic resistance genes the number and diversity of these genes i.e.

the resistome commonly expands following antibiotics.

Indeed the re- current form of CDI is now frequently managed through microbiome restoration in the form of faecal microbiota trans- plantation FMT.Colonization Resistance and Infection by PathobiontsLike C. difficile there are a number of other bacterial pathogens that similarly can either only cause disease or are much more likely to cause disease after the human or animal host has re- ceived antibiotics that disrupt the gut microbiome.
