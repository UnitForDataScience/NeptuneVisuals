the poster-child of an infection with both intrinsic and acquiredpublished by oxford university press 2016. this work is written by a us government employee and is in the public domain in the us.antibiotic resistance that is widely-accepted to be 'caused' by an- tibiotics is clostridium difficile infection cdi.

up to 61 campylobacter spp..epidemiologic data indicating infection risk from antibioticsin addition to having important implications for how one approaches the prevention and management of traveller's diar- rhea highlight the importance of resistance to colonization and infection afforded by an intact gut microbiome.

while these pathogens account for only a fraction of traveler's diarrhea such predisposition reflects how antibiotic exposure that precedes or occurs during travel may increase the risk for infection with other more common patho- gens even possibly enterotoxigenic eschericia coli especially in the setting of acquired resistance.

the role of shifts in bacterial diversity and compo- sition in increasing susceptibility to infection and the accumula- tion of antibiotic resistance is probably less widely understood.

indeed the re- current form of cdi is now frequently managed through microbiome restoration in the form of faecal microbiota trans- plantation fmt.colonization resistance and infection by pathobiontslike c. difficile there are a number of other bacterial pathogens that similarly can either only cause disease or are much more likely to cause disease after the human or animal host has re- ceived antibiotics that disrupt the gut microbiome.

and camplylobacter spp.however early data suggest that even the much more common bacterial cause of traveller's diarrhea enterotoxigenic escherichia coli etec may also function as a pathobiont in that there may be unique individual or collective sets of commensal bacteria that protect some humans from dis- ease following challengeand animal models suggest a role for probiotics in the prevention of etec diarrhea.the important role of prior treatment with antibiotics inthis case a large dose of streptomycin in increasing the suscepti- bility of mice to intestinal infection with salmonella enteriditis was first recognized in 1964--an effect thought mediated by elimination of certain anaerobes.more recently in a large combined case-control and source attribution analysis of hu- man salmonellosis cases mughini-gras et al.showed that re- cent use of antibiotics had a population attributable risk similar to that of eating raw or undercooked eggs.

in another case-control study from denmark during an era when campylobacter resistance to fluoroquinolones was 21.7 and to macrolides was 2.3 koningstein et al.found the or of exposure up to 1-year before infection to be 1.48 95 confidence interval 95ci 1.38-1.59 for macrolides and2.42 95ci 1.96-2.98 for fluoroquinolones.

interestingly incontrast to fluoroquinolones the macrolides appeared protec- tive or 0.72 95ci 0.56-0.92 against campylobacter infec- tion when administered in the month prior to illness--a finding that likely reflects the lower rate of acquired macrolide resis- tance the prolonged effective half-life of some of the macro- lides and the fact that these shorter windows of exposure included the 'acute' beginning phase of illness among the cases.what begins to emerge from these studies is that prior antibiotic exposure increases the overall risk for infection regardless of ac- quired resistance in the organism and as resistance to the antibiotic increases in the population even acute exposure i.e.

that bordering on treatment may propel rather than retard the infection.

although treatment with an antibiotic to which the offending path- ogen is resistant has never been demonstrated to worsen or prolong infection in a randomized controlled study of antibiotics for travel- ler's diarrhea neither is it the goal of such studies to examine such a role for antibiotics in these studies--instead special care is taken to study antibiotics in populations where resistance is not a prob- lem.

thus a key metabolic function of the gut microbiome is bile salt metab- olism that normally defends against cdi but is disrupted by an- tibiotics.there may be other similarly specific mechanisms that lie behind the colonization resistance afforded by the gut microbiome against other pathobionts.antibiotic effects on the microbiomerecent advances in next generation sequencing and metagenom- ics make it possible to build upon epidemiologic data tounderstand the impact of antibiotics on the risk of infection and antibiotic resistance.

these antibiotic ef- fects on the microbiome include a decrease in diversity expansion of the resistome loss of keystone species that support complex ecol- ogies loss of protective species against specific pathogens promo- tion of colonization by pathobionts and promotion of dominance that can be a driver for some types of infection and transmission.

meanwhile as demonstrated in studies of antibiotics for traveller's diarrhea there are clearly days of illness that are currently being prevented either through effective prophylaxis in high-risk persons or early self- treatment that shortens the course of diarrhea.however there are other adverse events related to antibiotics that must also be con- sidered including community-associated c. difficile infection that has been reported in antibiotic-exposed travellersas well as other adverse drug events.focusing just on traveller's diarrhea the shift from overall benefit to harm caused by antibiotics may be depen- dent upon both the timing of antibiotic exposure in relation to exposure to the pathobiont i.e.

resistance of the mouse's intes- tinal tract to experimental salmonella infection.
