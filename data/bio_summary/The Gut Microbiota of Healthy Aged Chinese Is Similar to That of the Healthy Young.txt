The loading plot in shows the OTUs responsible for the difference in location of the samples.The finding that the 19- to 24-year-old group was divergent from the general population was reexamined by rerunning the analysis with the inclusion of a second cohort of 212 samples collected from military and police training groups here the young soldier group the entire data set in this case included 1095 samples and 562 OTUs when filtered as for the general population cohort.

This is in contrast to other studies where the separation of particular groups was driven by only a few relatively abundant taxa  .Examination of confounding factors suggested that the age groups were distinct from each other and that subsetting the age groups by metadata failed to reveal any substantial variance within groups that could be attributed to the metadata see Fig.

While there is significant overlap in the location of the samples from each group the most extreme groups were the youngest ages 3 to 6 and 8 to 12 years the oldest age 94 years and surprisingly the 19- to 24-year-old group.

The tight clustering of the young soldiers within the 19- to 24-year-old group was likely because the young solider group members were selected to be very healthy and very active and all were housed together in two distinct common environments.The young soldier group comprises people from a military training center in Lanzhou and from a separate police training facility in Lanzhou.

In contrast the bulk of the OTUs in the genera Prevotella and Bacteroides become relatively more abundant in all successive age groups until age 20 then relatively rarer in the 30- to 50-year-old group relatively more abundant in the 60- to 79-year-old group and relatively rarer again in those 94 years old.DISCUSSIONThe present study identified a distinct gut microbiota in a 19- to 24-year-old cohort from the general population that has not been observed in large-scale analyses of other populations  and may be unique to this healthy cohort in China.

Importantly the samples from the young soldier cohort were collected in a different way than for the remainder of the samples yet the 19- to 24-year-old college students and young soldier samples cluster together on PCA plots by unsupervised clustering and had a small variance in the PERMANOVA analysis.

Third block randomization of samples was not conducted although samples from every age group were in each processed batch they were not random- ized or blocked.

In contrast the members of cluster C composed entirely of OTUs assigned to the Bifidobacterium genus were relatively less abundant in the 19- to 24-year-old groups than in the age groups that immediately surround the 19- to 24-year-old and young soldier groups.

It is likely that the most strongly associated groups include predominantly members of the same genus because different members of the same genus have similar growth requirements limitations and interactions.Clusters F and G were relatively constant across all samples and were composed of OTUs identified as being members of the Faecalibacterium genus suggesting that they are members of the core microbiota in this population.
