At the other end of the interaction spectrum colonisation by opportu- nistic and pathogenic microbes can result in dis- eased host phenotypes .Yet despite the large body of literature describing the functional importance of microorganisms to the health and survival of reef species to date almost no research has explored the contribution of prokar- yotic microorganisms to host transgenerationalMicrobial contributions to the persistence of coral reefsNS Webster and TH Reuschspecies 1.

Thus for different host species with similar functional niches symbionts will eventually converge functionally and the collective gene pool encompassed within the holobiont is therefore critical for transgenerational acclimatisation of the host.ConclusionWe propose here an inclusive concept of adaptation sensu lato in coral reef organisms that encompasses in addition to epigenetic adaptation of the host a pervasive role of MMTA via symbiont shuffling and switching genetic mutation and horizontal transfer of beneficial genes that are inherited by offspring.

Recommendations for future research on reef species therefore includei determining if variation in host fitness due to assembly of different microbiomes with unique microbial functions ultimately drives a multigenera- tional response to selection ii experimentally asses- sing the mechanisms and rates of transgenerational acclimatisation and adaptation iii manipulative experiments to alter microbial composition and assess phenotypic responses iv determining the extent of functional equivalence in microbiomes to assess whether hidden diversity is critical for holobiont functioning under ocean change and v using a modified Price equation   to integrate the relative contributions of epigenetic adaptations in the host via a germ line and mitotic mutations b microbiome changes established by both shuffling and switching andc evolution within microbial strains including HGT.Conflict of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the many pertinent studies on reef adap- tation that could not be included in this article because of space restrictions.

Microbially induced modifications of the host pheno- type that alter host fitness and can be under selection pressure has previously been proposed as part of the hologenome theory of evolution  Here we are particularly focussed on microbial contributions to transgenerational acclimati-sation of reef species.Functional importance of reef microbiomesRecent molecular advances have revealed just how fundamentally important microorganisms are to the holobiont phenotype of almost all reef species.

The 'coral probiotic hypothesis' also posits that alterations in the coral microbiome may enable the host to avoid pathogenic infection under elevated seawater temperature Acclimatisation via symbiont shufflingVariation in microbial symbiosis that contributes to local acclimatisation of the host can occur via microbial frequency shifts symbiont shuffling acquisition of novel microbial strains symbiont switching or horizontal gene transfer HGT betweenGuinea In this environment two species of reef sponge were found to be 40-fold more abundant at sites with active CO2 bubbling than they were at control sites only 100's of metres away.

For instance recent analysis of coral and algal microbiomes revealed communities of highly diverse and stable symbionts but no single bacterial species that was ubiquitously associated with a single host species indicating a lack of strict symbiont heredity .

We know that future climate change conditions can rapidly alter the composition and function of reef host microbiomes Supplementary Table 1 and reviewed in  but whether these shifts in symbio- sis are causally responsible for the ability of the host to acclimatise or adapt to new environmental conditions is still uncertain.

Viral-mediated HGT of beneficial genes between different symbiotic microorganisms andor between host and symbionts has the poten- tial to increase host fitness and cause rapid ecologi- cal speciation that allows reef holobionts to adapt and survive under changing environmental condi- tions.

Another example is the suspected transfer of eukaryotic-like proteins from the sponge host to the symbionts with these eukaryotic-like proteins thought to be used by the symbionts to regulate host phagocytosis .

Rather specific microorganisms or microbial genes that provide a fitness advantage to the host under conditions of elevated sea temperature and ocean acidification could be maintained and passed to subsequent generations ultimately resulting in transgenerational acclimatisation of the host.
