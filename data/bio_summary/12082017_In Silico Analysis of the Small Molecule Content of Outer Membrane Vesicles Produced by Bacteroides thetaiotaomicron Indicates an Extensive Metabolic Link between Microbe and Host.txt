the internalization of e. coli omvs by cultured polarized colonic epithelial cells shows that omvs are internalized by host cells   suggesting that metabolites present in omvs could in principle be utilized for host metabolism.

the control exerted by bt over its omv small molecule contents going as far as blocking available metabolites and packing metabolites with limited availability in the cell into omvs must be for some biological purpose as it represents a significant investment of energy  .bt preferentially packs omvs with molecules metabolized in silico in the mouseto test the assertion that the core metabolites packed into omvs are intended for the mammalian host the predicted consumability of those metabolites by mouse in silico according to immbtomv was calculated using fba.

metabolites that are directly exported by bt are also significantly enriched in these discriminating metabolites p5e 58 accounting for one additional metabolite of the 25. all eight amino acids classified as peptides that were significantly different between gf- and conventionally reared mice in the study of  are observed in omvs in this study and none are present in the dm itself suggesting that bt one of the dominant members of the human intestine microbiota   could play a role in amino acid biosynthesis in vivo using omvs as the channel for theirtransport to the host.the core omv metabolome enables putative functional annotation of enzymes in mouse shows the compartments that are affected by the addition of an omv compartment to the expanded model enabling metabolite transfer from bt to mouse and the numbers of metabolites that can be transferred between thesecompartments according to the metabolites observed in omvs in either medium.

we have found that adding omvs to such models would allowfor a more comprehensive representation of the link between the git microbial organ and the rest of the human body.conclusionan investigation of the metabolomic content of bt and the omvs it produces combined with fba of an integrated mouse-bt metabolic model has shown that bt controls the metabolite complement of omvs and that the resulting metabolite profile is enriched for metabolites that its murine host can metabolize.

while 13c-labeled fluxomics combinedwith metabolomics has been used to show metabolic activity within omvs produced by enteropathogenic bacteroides fragilis   to date the role of omvs in metabolic exchange between intestinal bacteria and their hosts has not been investigated.constraint-based genome-scale metabolic models gems have been used extensively in the analysis of bacterial and mammalian metabolism.

while many metabolites are seen solely in rm omvs 181 a further 154 metabolites are observed in both and only four metabolites seen solely in dm omvs.

forty-five of these are observed in rm omvs so a potential reason for their presence is in readiness for a change in nutrient availability at which point they can be released to omvs.

metabolites seen in omvs in both media core omv metabolites are significantly more likely to have been observed in bt cells in rm p4.610-4 than metabolites only observed in rm omvs.

there are 69 metabolites that are present in rm omvs that are not exported to omvs when cells are grown in dm despite the cell maintaining measurable pools of those metabolites in the dm.

however the presence of s-oxidized l-methionine in omvs produced in both media indicates that bt does not compete directly with the host for l-methionine produces it in measurable quantities inside the cell in both conditions and even exports it via omvs presumably with the intention of providing the host with this amino acid.for all reactions added by fgf reversibilities initially calculated using equilibrator   were checked against their curated kegg reaction reversibilities.

although literature searches failed to find empirical evidence to support the functional inferences made here it is striking that putative enzymes could be found for more than a third of the reactions predicted to be present.omv lipids are not enriched with lipids found in mouse membranestwenty kegg-identified lipids are contained in the lipid membrane of omvs produced in dm and 12 of these are contained in the original mouse model the mouse submodel of iexgfmmb0 but this does not represent an enrichment of mouse lipids in omvs with respect to all bt lipids the mouse shares 36 out of the 78 lipids produced by bt according to iexgfmmb0.

enzymes already present in the original model but annotated with other roles  data from modelseed  .omvs where they are not present in the cell indicates that bt controls the lipid complement of omvs for some purpose.these extra lipids are not significantly shorter than those in bt cells nor are they significantly more saturated than the lipids present in those cells so they do not appear to be added to accommodate the extra curvature of omvs due to their physical or chemical properties.

every lipid found in omvs from dm is also present in omvs from rm reflectingthe additive nature of omv packing by bt when provided with additional nutrients.

many contents of the omvs have been observed by  in a mouse host only when bacteria are present in its git but this is not sufficient to deduce their source to be omvs produced by these bacteria.

the lipid content of omvs appears not to be enriched for lipids present either in the murine large intestine or in mouse tissues in general as inferred in silico leaving the difference between the bt lipid content and that of its omvs unexplained.
