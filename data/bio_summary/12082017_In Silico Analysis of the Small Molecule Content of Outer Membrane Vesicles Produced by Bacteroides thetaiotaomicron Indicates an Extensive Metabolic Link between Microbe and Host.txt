The results show that OMV contents are not significantly enriched in any KEGG metabolic pathways either in mouse or Bt with respect to the metabolites imported to Bt observed in Bt cells or predicted essential in silico.

More precise specification of the availability of nutrients to Bt in vivo requires further experimentation which would help to characterize better the OMV-mediated metabolic transfers from Bt to mouse.In this study we have presented good evidence that Bt packs OMVs with metabolites that are targeted at the mammalian host but several large questions remain unanswered from this analysis.

Although the Bt model contains a cytosol compartment it does not in fact differentiate between cytosolic and periplasmic reactions so the Bt cytosol compartment is referred to as the Bt cell to make this explicit.

These results are a clear indication that Bt preferentially packs its OMVs with metabolites that the mouse can metabolize.To identify whether a particular pathway or set of pathways is targeted by Bt with its OMV contents the distribution of core OMV metabolites in KEGG pathways was investigated by metabolite set enrichment analysis  .

All eight amino acids classified as peptides that were significantly different between GF- and conventionally reared mice in the study of  are observed in OMVs in this study and none are present in the DM itself suggesting that Bt one of the dominant members of the human intestine microbiota   could play a role in amino acid biosynthesis in vivo using OMVs as the channel for theirtransport to the host.The Core OMV Metabolome Enables Putative Functional Annotation of Enzymes in Mouse shows the compartments that are affected by the addition of an OMV compartment to the expanded model enabling metabolite transfer from Bt to mouse and the numbers of metabolites that can be transferred between thesecompartments according to the metabolites observed in OMVs in either medium.

Although literature searches failed to find empirical evidence to support the functional inferences made here it is striking that putative enzymes could be found for more than a third of the reactions predicted to be present.OMV Lipids Are Not Enriched with Lipids Found in Mouse MembranesTwenty KEGG-identified lipids are contained in the lipid membrane of OMVs produced in DM and 12 of these are contained in the original mouse model the mouse submodel of iexGFMMB0 but this does not represent an enrichment of mouse lipids in OMVs with respect to all Bt lipids the mouse shares 36 out of the 78 lipids produced by Bt according to iexGFMMB0.

Fourteen of the lipids observed at TP2 in Bt cells grown in DM are contained in the OMV membrane but of the additional six produced by Bt specifically for OMVs i.e.

Without further experimental investigation it is not possible to say which subset of the observed lipid complement in Bt cells is part of the outer membrane of Bt but this addition of six further lipids toTABLE 2  The proposed reactions by which metabolites present in the OMV could be connected to mouse metabolism.BiGG IDCommon nameReactionsProducibilityconsumabilityRequired enzyme EC numberEnzyme in mouse Gene ID13zdstErucic acidExporter 13zdstt-revePC--1ag1-AcylglycerolR07293 RPCMonoacylglycerol acylhydrolaseLipe 16890.13ampAdenosine31 -phosphateR01562 INPC31 -AMP phosphohydrolase 3.1.3.6-R03537 IPNC21 31 -Cyclic AMP 31 -nucleotidohydrolase-3.1.4.163c3hmpAlpha-IsopropylmalateR01213 IPNCAcetyl-CoA3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate-C-acetyltransferase 2.3.3.139z12zocdcyaLinoleateR08177 INPCLinoleoyl-CoA hydrolase 3.1.2.2Acot2 171210.1AchmsO-Acetyl-homoserineR01287 INPCO-Acetyl-L-homoserine acetate-lyase-2.5.1.49R01776 IPNCAcetyl-CoAL-homoserine-O-acetyltransferase 2.3.1.31CrtnCreatinineR01884 RPCCreatinine amidohydrolase 3.5.2.10-g3peGlycerophospho- ethanolamineR01470 INPCGlycerophosphohydrolase 3.1.4.2Gpcpd1 74182.1GenisteinGenisteinR06553 I NPCIsoflavone synthase-hom LL-HomoserineR01776 INPCAcetyl-CoAL-homoserine-O-acetyltransferase 2.3.1.31R00175 I PNCS-Adenosyl-L-methionine hydrolase-3.3.1.2idt LL-IditolR07145 RPCL-IditolNAD 2-oxidoreductaseSord 20322.1MalonMalonateR00743 RPCAcetyl-CoAmalonate CoA-transferase2.8.3.3MaltttrMaltotetraoseR03801 INPC14-Beta-D-Glucan glucohydrolase3.2.1.74R03802 IPNC14-Beta-D-Glucan glucohydrolase3.2.1.74metsoxS LL-Methionine S-oxideR02025 INPCL-Methionineoxidized-thioredoxinS-oxidoreductasepsphingsPhytosphingosineR06525 IPNCSphinganine ferrocytochrome b5oxygenoxidoreductaserbn DD-RibonateR01079 R PCD-RiboseNADP 1-oxidoreductase1.1.1.115saccrp LSaccharopineR00715 RPCN6-L-13-dicarboxypropyl-L-lysineNADoxidoreductase 1.5.1.7---Msrb2 and Msrb3 76467.1 and320183.1Degs2 70059.1--Reactions are referenced by KEGG ID and proposed mouse genes include NCBI gene ID.

Enzymes already present in the original model but annotated with other roles  data from ModelSEED  .OMVs where they are not present in the cell indicates that Bt controls the lipid complement of OMVs for some purpose.These extra lipids are not significantly shorter than those in Bt cells nor are they significantly more saturated than the lipids present in those cells so they do not appear to be added to accommodate the extra curvature of OMVs due to their physical or chemical properties.

Conversely all 15 of the dipeptides in the core metabolite set are seen in Bt cells as well but it is currently unclear what significance this has for the function of the dipeptides.Challenges in Elucidating Host-Microbe Metabolic Interactions via OMVsMost digestion initiates in the small intestine before the chyme is transferred to the colon the segment of the GIT in which Bt mostly resides.
