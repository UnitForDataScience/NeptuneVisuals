The resulting down-regulation in b-hemoglobin later recorded in fish from those tanks further suggests a highly negative impact of oil to fish health.Oil exposure also resulted in reduced expression of IgM mRNA the primary systemic fish antibody and typically one of the first to respond to bacterial infection -.

Bars represent average gene expression log2 relative to control fish for 3 fish per treatment and error bars represent minimum and maximum values of relative quantification based on standard deviation of Ct values from qPCR analyses.oil degrading bacteria including Oceanospirillales Thalassolituus and Alcanivorax comprised up to 60 of the microbial community in the lower and upper gills of fish exposed to oil  .

The fact that IgM down-regulation was only observed in oil-exposed flounder that increased colonization by V. anguillarum only occurred in fish with down-regulated IgM and that mortality only occurred in fish with down- regulated IgM and increased V. anguillarum produces a clear mechanism for mortality.In addition oil exposure resulted in consistent and clear shifts in overall bacterial commu- nity composition in gills and intestines of fish collected one day after pathogen challenge Figs and .

Principal coordinates analysis of data collected from all organs for 12 fish 3 per treat- ment indicated that oil-exposed and non-oil-exposed fish contained taxonomically distinct bacterial communities with gill and intestinal communities from oiled fish also differing from each other .

OilNo Pathogen challenged fish showed similar shifts in bacterial flora  and suppression in IgM expression  to OilPathogen challenged fish indicating multi- ple mechanisms by which oil exposure can affect homeostasis and immune response in oil exposed fish.
