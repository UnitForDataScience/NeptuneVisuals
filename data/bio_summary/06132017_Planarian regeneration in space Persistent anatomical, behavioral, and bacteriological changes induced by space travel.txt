it is proba- ble that physical forces both internal and external are modulated by the physical force of earth's gravity which probably influenced the way that the regenerative and developmental abilities of living organisms have evolved on earth bizzarri  cucina 2014.on earth biological systems are also subject to the naturally vary- ing geomagnetic field gmf dubrov 1978. this variation in geo- magnetic disturbance has been shown to impact not only animal behavior beischer 1971 zamoshchina et al.
