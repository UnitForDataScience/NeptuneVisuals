apicola and S. alviAs Tet B was identified within both G. apicola and S. alvi we wanted to investigate whether there could be possible HGT of Tet B between the two species.

Additionally the whole Tn10 sequence was identical to the one identified in G. apicola A7.We also compared the tetH of G. apicola and S. alvi which showed 100 identity towards different reference genes Table S3.

It is likely that these niches coexist within the same space within the honeybee-gut cavity as indicated by the detected HGT within the G. apicola and between G. apicola and S. alvi which are known to form biofilms within the gut Martinson et al.

An alignment of the aa sequence of these two genes from G. apicola and S. alvi showed that tetH in S. alvi was 3 aa longer and that they differed by 6 aa at the terminal end Fig.

Contrary the tetH genes identified within G. apicola and S. alvi were different and the pres- ence of tetH within these two bacteria genera was limited to only one subgrouplineage each Figures 3 and 5 indicating a more clo- nal spread within the community which matches that the tetH genes are found within the genome.The tetH gene identified within S. alvi using RESFINDER was iden- tical to a reference sequence based on pairwise comparison of the nucleotide sequence.

We also performed minimum inhibitory concentration MIC testing on cultured bacterial strains.This work presents evidence for differences in genome content between subgroups in G. apicola and HGT of Tcr genes among the Arizonan G. apicola strains.

S8.We performed susceptibility testing for all isolates of G. apicola and found for G. apicola with Tet B that the MIC representing Nor- wegian and Arizonan strains varied between 3 and 16 mgL and 12 and 16 mgL respectively Table S11.

Although previous work showed differences in pectin-degradation capacity by G. apicola strains and 16S rRNA gene analysis and single-cell sequencing have shown genetic variations within G. apicola no specific subgroups have been fully identified Engel et al.

The pectin-degrading capacity of G. apicola may be a health benefit for the honeybee and this functional trait has co-evolved with G. apicola as the pectin-gene phylogenies correlates with the genomic phylogeny Fig.
