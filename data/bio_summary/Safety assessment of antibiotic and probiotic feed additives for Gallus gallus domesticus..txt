bioluminescent readings in the ileum after 3.5 h were significantly different for treatment groups p  0.0001. readings recorded for the probiotic treatment group were significantly lower compared to the antibiotic p  0.0002 and control p  0.0201 groups but the control and antibiotic treatment groups were similar.

for the different treatment groups unclassified clostridiales p  0.011 coriobacteriaceae p  0.012 synergistaceae p  0.013 enterobacteriaceae p  0.018 erysipelotrichaceae p 0.026 and brucellaceae p 0.033. the antibiotic treatment group had higher levels of unclassified clostridiales 3.4 fold increase coriobacteriaceae 2.9 fold increase synergistaceae unique family of antibiotic group erysipelotrichaceae 3.3 fold increase and brucellaceae unique family of antibiotic group and were significantly different from the probiotic p  0.05 and control groups p  0.05. the families from probiotic and control treatment groups did not differ significantly.

lymphocyte lym and basophil baso counts on the other hand were significantly different at day 19. broilers from the antibiotic treatment group had a higher mean lym p 0.012 and baso 0.018 count com- pared to the probiotic treatment group.

no significant differences were recorded in thrombocyte counts for the different treatment groups at day 19 p 0.121 and day 29 p 0.350 supplementary table .at day 19 broilers from the different treatment groups had no significant differences in total red blood cell rbc haemoglobin content hgb haematocrit content hct mean corpuscular volume mcv mean cor- puscular haemoglobin mch and mean corpuscular haemoglobin counts mchc listed in table .

if villi height are the same for two treatment groups as in the current study but the area per villus is larger in the one treatment group the number of villi per cm2 are less and so also the total surface area for nutrient absorption.

microbiomes from the antibiotic treatment group were more diverse and otu's were compared to the control and probiotic treatment groups more evenly distributed.

the antibiotic and control treatment groups differed significantly with respect to average and high abundant species diversity q  1 3 p 0.028 and p 0.041 respectively but did not differ in rare species diversity q -1 p 0.05. the antibiotic and probioticfigure 5. total species richness obtained by the a chao 1 index anova significance of p 0.22 the b shannon's diversity index anova significance of p 0.02 and the c richness index anova significance of p 0.216 for cecal bacterial communities of broilers from the different treatment group i.e.

adonis analysis revealed significant differences between community composition and treatment p 0.029.families present in more than 50 of broilers from a specific treatment were considered part of the micro-biome.

no sig- nificant differences were recorded between the antibiotic and probiotic treatment groups and between the control and probiotic treatment group.

broilers from the probiotic treatment group received between 1.0 and 4.1 x 108 cfu daily of the multi-strain probiotic consisting of lactobacillus crispatus dpn167 9.3 x 106 to 3.8 x 107 cfu lactobacillus salivarius dpn181 1.3 x 107 to 5.3 x 107 cfu lactobacillus gallinarum dpn164 4.6 x 107 to 1.9 x 108 cfu lactobacillus johnsonii dpn184 6.8 x 106 tox 107 cfu enterococcus faecalis dpn94 1.8 x 107 to 7.5 x 107 cfu and bacillus amyloliquefaciens dpn123 6.8 x 106 to 2.8 x 107 cfu.broilers in the antibiotic treatment group 10 cages received the same ration in the four feeding cycles butthe feed was supplemented with a combination of sulphadiazine 0.375 ppmgram feed colistin 0.128 ppm gram feed and trimethoprim 0.075 ppmgram feed and contained no probiotics.

lactose and sucrose were added to the feed used in each feeding cycle of the antibiotic and control treatment groups to yield concentrations identical to the feed administered to the probiotic treatment group.health and growth performance.

no significant differences in total red blood cell haemoglobin and haematocrit content and mean values for corpuscular volume corpuscularhaemoglobin and corpuscular haemoglobin numbers were recorded amongst broilers from the different treatment groups.

the use of antibiotics as growth promoter in animal feed has been banned by the european union in an attempt to control natural selection for antibiotic-resistant pathogensand ensure that currently available antibiotics remain effective in the treatment of animal and human infections.the general assumption is that chickens intensively reared do not acquire beneficial microbiota from the envi- ronment.

the average feed conversion ratios fcrs of broilers in the probiotic and antibiotic treatment groups were not significantly different from that recorded for broilers in the untreated group on days 7 14 21 and 28 supplementary table  suggesting that neither the multi-strain probiotic nor the antibiotics had an effect on growth performance.

at day 19 the white blood cell wbc heterophil het monocyte mono and eosin- ophil eos counts were not significantly different for broilers from the different treatment groups table .
