For probiotic-treated broilers high readings were observed in the ileum 3.13 x 104 and colon 3.43 x 104 and low readings in the duodenum 2.32 x 103 and cecum 2.84 x 103 at 2 h. After 3.5 h low levels were observed in the duodenum 2.79 x 103 cecum 5.14 x 103 and colon 3.62 x 103.

Broilers from the probiotic treatment group were administered 100 ul of the multi-strainprobiotic 8.34 x 108 cfu by intragastric gavage 2 h before the administration of L. monocytogenes EGDe.The probiotic preparation was prepared as follows L. crispatus DPN167 L. salivarius DPN181 L. gallinarum DPN164 L. johnsonii DPN184 and E. faecalis DPN94 were cultured in MRS broth for 12 h at 37 degC under anaer- obic conditions.

Feed of broilers from the probiotic treatment group were supplemented with the multi-strain probiotic as follows pre-starter was supplemented with 24 mg dried probiotic cells per gram feed to yield 6.7 x 106 cfugram feed consisting of 6.1 x 105 cfu L. crispatus DPN167 8.4 x 105 cfuL.
