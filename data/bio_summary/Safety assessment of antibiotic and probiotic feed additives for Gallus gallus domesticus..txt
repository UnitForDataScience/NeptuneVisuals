Broilers from the probiotic treatment group were administered 100 ul of the multi-strainprobiotic 8.34 x 108 cfu by intragastric gavage 2 h before the administration of L. monocytogenes EGDe.The probiotic preparation was prepared as follows L. crispatus DPN167 L. salivarius DPN181 L. gallinarum DPN164 L. johnsonii DPN184 and E. faecalis DPN94 were cultured in MRS broth for 12 h at 37 degC under anaer- obic conditions.

More research on the intestinal ecosystem and inter-microbial and microbiota-host interactions are required.In this study we evaluated the effect of antibiotics sulphadiazine colistin and trimethoprim in combination and a multi-strain probiotic L. crispatus L. salivarius L. gallinarum L. johnsonii E. faecalis and B. amyloliquefa- ciens on the performance of healthy broilers.

However understanding how these changes in bacterial composition relate to metabolic changes which ultimately relate to improved health and performance needs to be elucidated.ConclusionsSupplementation of broiler feed with the antibiotic combination sulphadiazine colistin and trimethoprim or multi-strain probiotic L. crispatus DPN167 L. salivarius DPN181 L. gallinarum DPN164 L. johnsonii DPN184E.

The multi-strain probiotic consisted of L. crispatus DPN167 L. salivarius DPN181 L. gallinarum DPN164 L. johnsonii DPN184 E. faecalis DPN94 and B. amyloliq- uefaciens DPN123.

The finisher was supplemented with 3.5 mg probiotic powder per gram feed 9.9 x 105 cfug feed consisting of 9.0 x 104 cfu L. crispatus DPN167 1.3 x 105 cfu L. salivarius DPN181 4.4 x 105 cfu L. gallinarum DPN164 6.2 x 104 cfu L. johnsonii DPN184 1.8 x 105 cfuE.

In a recent study where broilers were fed a multi-strain probiotic consisting of L. johnso- nii L. crispatus L. salivarius and an unidentified Lactobacillus sp.

Bioluminescence counts p S-1 cm-1 sr-1 for the different gastro-intestinal compartments duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon of broilers from the different treatment groups multi-strain probiotic antibiotic combination and control at 2 and 3.5 h after administration of L. monocytogenes EGDe.Indicates significant differences p 0.05 Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test.cell numbers of L. monocytogenes per gram intestine for the duodenum jejunum ileum cecum and colon 2 and 3.5 h after administration of L. monocytogenes is shown in Supplementary Fig.

Feed of broilers from the probiotic treatment group were supplemented with the multi-strain probiotic as follows pre-starter was supplemented with 24 mg dried probiotic cells per gram feed to yield 6.7 x 106 cfugram feed consisting of 6.1 x 105 cfu L. crispatus DPN167 8.4 x 105 cfuL.

The strains were combined to yield a total cell count of 2.8 x 108 cfug freeze-dried powder consisting of 2.6 x 107 cfu L. crispatus DPN167 3.6 x 107 cfu L. salivarius DPN181 1.3 x 108 cfu L. gallinarum DPN164 1.9 x 107 cfu L. johnsonii DPN184 5.1 x 107 cfu E. faecalis DPN94 and 1.9 x 107 cfu B. amyloliquefaciens DPN123.Feeding trials.

The starter feed was supplemented with 12 mg pro- biotic powder per gram feed 3.3 x 106 cfugram feed consisting of 3.1 x 105 cfu L. crispatus DPN167 4.2 x 105 cfu L. salivarius DPN181 1.6 x 106 cfu L. gallinarum DPN164 2.2 x 105 cfu L. johnsonii DPN184 6.1 x 106 cfuE.
