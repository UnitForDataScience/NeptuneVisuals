These transporters help determine the turnover of bile acid ligands and control access to the intracellular bile acid receptors in important target cells.Feedback regulation of hepatic bile acid synthesis intestinal bile acid transporters and the FXR-FGF1519 pathwayBile acids are synthesized from cholesterol via 2 pathways the major classical pathway Cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase Cyp7a1 pathway that favors cholic acid biosynthesis and a minor alternative pathway that favors biosynthesis of chenodeoxycholic acid in humans or muricholic acid in mice 11.

As illustrated in Figure 1 inactivation of the Asbt in mice produces a classical severe bile acid malabsorption phenotype whereby excretion of bile acids in the feces is increased more then 5-fold whole body bile acid pool size is reduced and whole body bile acid pool composition is altered.The ratio of taurocholate to tauromuricholate in the bile acid pool shifts from approximately 11 which is typically found in wild type mice to greater than 51 suggesting a dramatic derepression of hepatic bile acid synthesis via the Cyp7a1 pathway 16.

One line of evidence suggests that bile acid sequestrants induce hepatic bile acid synthesis and alter the bile acid species present in the systemic circulation thereby increasing activation of TGR5 in brown adipose tissue and increasing energy expenditure 30.Interestingly changes in systemic levels of different bile acid species have also been implicated in the beneficial metabolic effects of bariatric surgery 31-33.

Investigation beginning in the 1960's showed that hepatic bile acid synthesis and Cyp7a1 activity was suppressed after administration of exogenous bile acids and induced when bile acid return to the liver was blocked by administration of bile acid sequestrants or by biliary diversion 12.

In contrast to blocking apical bile acid uptake inactivation of Osta in mice failed to increase fecal bile acid excretion or significantly alter whole body bile acid pool composition.

Schematic of differential effects of blocking ileal apical versus basolateral bile acid transport on bile acid metabolismRelative to wild type mice fecal bile acid excretion is increased almost 7-fold in Asbt knockout mice.

The best-studied bile acid receptors are the farnesoid X receptor FXR and G protein-coupled receptor 1 GPBAR1 also called TGR5 or membrane-type receptor for bile acids M-BAR but the list of bile acid receptors also includes other nuclear receptors such as the pregnane X receptor PXR and vitamin D receptor VDR and other G protein- coupled receptors such as the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 S1PR2 and muscarinicCorresponding Author Paul A.

This review discusses the contribution of an important component of the enterohepatic circulation the intestinal bile acid transporters to bile acid signaling.Enterohepatic circulation of bile acidsAfter their synthesis in the hepatocyte bile acids are secreted into bile and stored in the gallbladder or small intestinal lumen.

This initiates signaling via the docking protein fibroblast growth factor substrate 2 FRS2a and a tyrosine phosphatase tyrosine- protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 Shp2 to stimulate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase ERK12 activity and block activation of Cyp7a1 gene expression by HNF4a and LRH-1.Changes in Asbt or Osta-Ostb expression has the potential to control the intracellular levels of bile acids and therefore influence FXR-mediated regulation of FGF1519 production.This is nicely illustrated by comparing the effects of inhibiting ileal apical versus basolateral membrane bile acid transport on bile acid metabolism 1617.

In Osta-- versus Asbt-- mice total ileal FGF15 mRNA expression isincreased almost 10-fold and this inversely correlates with approximately 8-fold reductions in liver Cyp7a1 mRNA expression 9-fold reductions in liver microsomal Cyp7a1 enzyme activity and 7-fold reductions in fecal bile acid excretion.DawsonPage 4Bile acid-regulation of metabolism bile acid transporters and the FXR- FGF1519 pathwayBile acids have been shown to modulate a variety of metabolic pathways involved in controlling glucose lipid and energy homeostasis.
