Using the metadb a this protein was identified as a NifU homologue involved in Fe-S cluster formation b was not identi- fied c was identified only in two control and two diabetic children d the origin of this protein was Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 e was not identified in the three diabetic children f was not quantitatively significant g the origin of this protein was Lactococcus lactis lactis Il1403 h the origin of this protein was Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 i also identified in control children j also identified in control children and significantly more abundant.strongly interconnected classes i.e.

In the intestinal prote- ome of Control children the most abundant human pro- teins were elastase 3A pancreatic preprotein elastase 3B preprotein and the protein chymotrypsin C which was found exclusively in the Control intestinal proteome .

The database also includes'distracters' that are sequences unlikely to be found in thehealthy gut supplementary information for this database can be found following the link s.The HMRG database is composed of 51 human-derived ref- erence isolate genomes that are known to be common gut inhabitants from the Joint Genome Institute IMG human microbiome project in a FASTA-formatted protein sequence database and concatenated with the estimated human pro- tein database National Center for Biotechnology Informa- tion.

It is known that the main lysine fermentation products obtained by the growth of intestinal bacteria are butyrate and acetate  whereas valine leucine and isoleucine fermentation products are the short-chain fatty acids isobutyrate from valine isoval- erate and ammonia from leucine and the 2-methylbutyrate from isoleucine These facts reinforce the hypothesis that short-chain fatty acids production by Eubacterium rectale under T1D intestinal environment require amino acid metab- olism.

Two intriguing observations from the T1D intestinal proteome were noticed i the abundance of glyceraldehyde- 3-phosphate dehydrogenase EL8810785 EC 1.2.1.12 gluta- mate dehydrogenase NAD and GroEL by Bacteroides doreiand ii DnaK produced by Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides uniformis was only observed in the T1D intestinal proteome.

IAP is known to be critical for intestinal homeostasis and health by virtue of its multiple interactions with intestinal commensal and patho- genic microbiota diet and mucosal interface .

Of these protein clusters only 11  were human proteins and contaminants while the remainder were asso- ciated with intestinal microbiota Table S3.

The difference in the overlap between the two databases likely is related to the assembly of the two databases in particular metadb is a metagenome-derived database superimposing a higher number of proteins but clearly is a more taxonomy-restricted database in compari- son to the HMRG database which was mainly generated by linking 51 human-derived reference isolate genomes from the Joint Genome Institute IMG human microbiome project allowing more definitive speciesprotein identification.The proteome analysis proceeded with the proteins that were observed in all biological samples and which showed a fold change 2.0 and P0.05.It should be noted that despite the great potential of a meta- proteomics approach for understanding the impact of the intestinal microbiota on host health and disease this meth- odology still poses some challenges namely the different protein extraction methods differential centrifugation ultracentrifugation with density gradient or direct extraction from stool samples may have a meaningful impact on pro- teinpeptide identification particularly the differential centrifugation which may result in diminished host and food-associated proteins along with microbial cell surface proteins .

This finding suggests that the population of Bifidobacterium is not disturbed by the diabetic intestinal milieu but its protein pat- tern is modified.T1D proteome is enriched with proteins of some species of clostridial clusters XIVa and IV and from BacteroidesIn the T1D faecal samples it was observed that eight proteins from Faecalibacterium prausnitzii that belong to the clostrid- ial cluster IV also known as Clostridium leptum were more abundant .

Such finding leads us to suggest that the intestinal milieu of T1D children is not impairing the Bacteroides population but rather is shaping its protein profile in particular Bacteroides dorei and Bacteroides uniformis.In contrast to our study Murri et al.
