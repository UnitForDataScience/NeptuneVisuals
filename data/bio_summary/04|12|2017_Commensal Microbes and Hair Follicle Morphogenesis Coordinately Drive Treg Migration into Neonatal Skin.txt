All authors discussed results and commented on the manuscript.Scharschmidt et al.Page 2INTRODUCTIONRegulatory T Treg cells play a critical role in establishing and maintaining immune homeostasis in peripheral tissues.

Treg cells residing in these tissues demonstrate unique T cell receptor profiles and distinct functions when compared to cells found in lymphoid organs Feuerer et al.

2009 Burzyn et al.

Although we are beginning to understand the fundamental biology of Treg cells in adult tissues very little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for establishing tissue residence of these cells early in life.Colonization by commensal microbes and formative shaping of the host-commensal relationship occurs in neonatal life Dominguez-Bello et al.

2010 concurrently with the establishment of Treg cell populations at barrier sites where these commensals reside Gollwitzer et al.
