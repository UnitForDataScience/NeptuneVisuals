BLASTn results showed that 5 of the top 10 OTUs were most closely matched 97-100 identity to Proteobacteria associated with other spec- imens of C. crambe and other sponge species Table  while the remaining five OTUs matched closely 98-100 to Proteobacte- ria associated with corals seawater or sediment samples Ta- ble .DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrated that the microbial community of Crambe crambe distinctly differs in composition and structure from the free-living community observed in ambient seawater consistent with previous studies of sponge microbiomes Lee et al.

As such the stability of the microbiome in C. crambe across natural and heavy metal-impacted locations is particularly notable and suggests that not all sponge-associated microbial communities are disrupted by exposure to pollution and heavy metals.Crambe crambe has been categorized as a low microbial abun- dance LMA sponge via electron microscopy Gloeckner et al.

Notably all nine of these common symbiont taxa were more abundant in the microbiomes of C. crambe from the natural habitat compared to C. crambe from the impacted harbor possibly indicating minor and OTU-specific impacts of heavy metal pollution on the abundance of common symbiont taxa in C. crambe.Overall the results of our study indicate that the micro- biome of C. crambe exhibits greater stability and pollution tol- erance than free-living bacterioplankton and suggest that some sponges may be able to mitigate the effects of heavy metal pol- lutants through persistent relationships with microbial sym- bionts.

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST analyses were conducted with 16S rRNA nucleotide se- quences of the 10 most common OTUs in C. crambe to compare symbiont sequences herein to those in the GenBank database recording percentage identity and sources of top matches.RESULTSComparative analysis of microbial community diversity and compositionOf the total 6434 OTUs recovered 2271 were associated with the sponge Crambe crambe and 4170 were detected in the seawater samples.

An additional nine common proteobacte- rial OTUs in C. crambe represented microbial taxa specific to C. crambe present in other sponge species e.g.

Erwin ABSTRACTMarine sponges have been shown to harbor diverse microbial symbiont communities that play key roles in host functioning yet little is known about how anthropogenic disturbances impact sponge-microbe interactions.

To achieve this goal we characterized and compared microbial communities in C. crambe and seawater collected from a polluted harbor Blanes Harbor and an adjacent 1 km natural habitat outside the har- bor Punta Santa Anna.METHODSSample collectionTriplicate samples of Crambe crambe Schmidt  and ambient seawater 1 L were collected at two locations separated by 1 km inside Blanes Harbor BH 41.6742N 2.7992E and at Punta Santa Anna SA 41.6725N 2.8038E in October 2012.
