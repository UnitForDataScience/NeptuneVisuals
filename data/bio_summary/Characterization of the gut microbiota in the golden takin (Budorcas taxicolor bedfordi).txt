at the phylum level actinobacteria was significantlymore abundant in group b than in group a. at the class level coriobacteriia and deltaproteobacteria were sig- nificantly less abundant in group a than in group b. at the order level coriobacteriales was also significantlyhigher in group b. at the family level coriobacteriaceae was significantly higher in group b while ruminococ- caceae and bacteroidaless24-7group were higher in group a table .

in present study the four female golden takins demonstrated highly similar microbiota and the five golden takin males had relatively highly similar microbiota although j6 and j7 were relatively far from the other three samples which might indicate that the fecal microbiota of golden takins might also be influenced by the animal's sex.

unclassified bacteria and their func- tions in different hosts required further research.the pca and heatmap analyses indicated that the sepa- ration was observed between the microbiota of group a and group b. however within groups there was a high percent identity suggesting the fecal microbiota of golden takins may be influenced by different seasons.

four fresh fecal samples group a were col- lected at jinan wild animal park during the late morning in december 2015. five fresh fecal samples group b were collected at jinan animal park during the late morn- ing in april 2016. group a and group b respectively rep-ggactacnngggtatctaat as previously described hugerth et al.

based on anosim analysis significant differences were observed in bacte- rial community structure between group a and group b p  0.05. when analyzing differences between the two groups the alpha diversity index and box-plots intui- tively reflected the median degree of dispersion maxi- mum minimum and outlier of species diversity withintable 2 alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota in the nine golden takins in this studygroups.

among these 18 genera parabacteroides sphaerochaeta ruminiclostridium1 and phascolarcto- bacterium were significantly higher in group a while theothers were significantly higher in group b. additionally 13 of the 18 genera belonged to firmicutes.discussionin present study we first performed high-throughput sequencing to characterize the microbial community in the golden takin.

however the physiological mechanisms underlying sexual influence were uncertain.in conclusion we describe the predominant fecal bac- terial populations in golden takin and offered the taxo- nomic baseline for further research investigating the intestinal ecosystems in golden takins.

the number of species in group a was lower than that in group b fig.

the result indi- cated that the sample j1 j2 j3 and j4 group a grouped together while the sample j5 j6 j7 and j8 group b clus- tered together fig.

in addition the pca score plot revealed the separation of group a from group b fig.

eighteen of the 216 genera were sig- nificantly different p  0.05 between group a and group b table .

considerable evidence supports the complexity of the gut microbiota in many mammals and the necessity of gut bacterial communities to maintain gut homeostasis.c the authors 2017. this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution 4.0 international license  which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided you give appropriate credit to the original authors and the source provide a link to the creative commons license and indicate if changes were made.however surprisingly little research was on the gut micro- biota of the golden takin.

therefore in present research we characterized the fecal microbiota of nine golden takins by performing high-throughput sequencing.

moreover rarefaction curves revealed lower phylogenetic diversity and numbers of observed species otus in the winter microbiota than in the spring microbiota.
