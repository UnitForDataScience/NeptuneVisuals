The results indicated that oral cavity oral vestibule and plaque have different characteristics.The GHOST-MP program is implemented in C and is available under the BSD Berkeley Software Distribution License from .Results and DiscussionEvaluation of Scalability and Search SpeedBefore performing the analysis of the human oral microbiome we evaluated the search speed of GHOST-MP which was measured on two systems TSUBAME 2.5 at Tokyo Institute of Technology and the K computer at RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science using human oral metagenomic shotgun sequencing data queries and the KEGG GENES amino acid sequence database.

The combination of a sophisticated search algorithm with database indexing and a massively parallel search allowed us to achieve this large-scale similarity search within a short period of time.Large-Scale Sequence Similarity Search for Metagenomic Sequencing DataTo demonstrate the applicability of GHOST-MP to large-scale functional analysis of metagenomic data we applied the functional analysis workflow to healthy human oral metagenomic data consisting of 381 samples taken from eight oral sites with approximately 18 billion sequence reads Table S2.

We applied this tool to human oral metagenomic data and the results indicate that the oral cavity the oral vestibule and plaque have different characteristics based on the functional gene category.Keywords database search sequence similarity search metagenomics human oral microbiomeIntroductionMost microbes are difficult to isolate and cultivate .

The reconstruction of metabolic pathways provides information about potential metabolites possible paths to a specific metabolite and the structure of a metabolic network in an environment.To estimate the abundance of ortholog groups in environmental samples sequence similarity searches have been used to identify ortholog groups of each sequence in the metagenomic data.

The fast search ability of GHOST-MP enabled us to perform a large-scale sequence similarity search of 381 human oral microbiome metagenomic sequencing data 18 billion reads against the whole database of KEGG GENES 8.6 million amino acid sequences on a massively parallel computing system.

The centroid of the triangle represents an equal average relative abundance of the three oral site groups.Materials and MethodsSequence DataHuman oral metagenomic sequencing data were downloaded from the HMP Data Analysis and Coordination Center HMP DACC .

The similarity search of the sequencing data with the KEGG GENES amino acid sequence database on the K computer took 183 h 898231 core hours which is the product of the number of CPU cores used and the elapsed time.

The suffix array can be used with a binary search to find all suffixes matching the query string and is a data structure widely used in biological sequence searches .

This technique is particularly useful for metagenomic data produced by massively parallel DNA sequencing because massively parallel sequencing data consist of many nucleotide sequence fragments and this approach can search for each fragment in parallel.
