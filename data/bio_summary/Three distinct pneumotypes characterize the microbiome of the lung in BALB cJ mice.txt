PCOA plot showing the cluster- ing of lung samples from two lung sites upper lung UL and lower lung LL.

In contrast lung samples from individual mice expressed distinct microbiomes.Iterative comparisons between samples suggested that lung tissues could be categorized into three groups i lungbackground having few or no detectable microbes ii lungaspirate expressing a microbiome similar to the URT and iii lungunique comprising a microbiota distinct from that of the URT.A third of all lung samples 33 fell into the lungbackground group.

Samples were taken from the superior lobe upper lung UL and inferior lobe lower lung LL of the right lung n  36.

The traditional view that viable bacteria are rarely present in normal healthy lung is consistent with the lung being actively surveilled by immune cells and the observation that 33 of tissue samples were sterile the lungbackground group.

The remaining sample contigs were filtered for chimeric sequences using the uchimeref  with comparison against the GOLD database of chimera-free 16S sequences .OTU clustering and taxonomic assignmentBioinformatics analyses such as OTU clustering were performed on sequences from URT and lung samples as a combined data set.

Results indicate that the URT micro- biome of different animals overlapped by  70 .Microbiome of the lungIn contrast to URT samples there was considerable heterogeneity in the frequency and distri- bution of bacterial sequences present in low biomass lung samples.

An NMDS analysis based on the UniFrac distances highlights the tendency of the samples to cluster according to the pneumotypes identified .Comparison of the lung and URT microbiomesTwo statistical approaches were taken to compare the microbiomes present in lungunique lungaspirate and URT sample groups lungbackground samples were not included as they were devoid of evaluable sequences.

The group lungaspirate represents a microbiome similar to that of the URT whereas lungunique shows a more distinct and diverse microbiome.The composition of the microbiome in URT samples from co-housed mice was highly repro- ducible allowing for the generation of a representative microbiome .

The lungaspirate group contained mem- bers of both groups and was enriched in Streptococcus Haemophilus Aggregatibacter Actino- bacillus Mannheimia which is characteristic of the URT as well as with Candidatus and Flavobacterium which is primarily found in lungunique samples .Distribution of genera among groupsHaemophilus Mannheimia and Streptococcus accounted for  90 of all sequence reads in the URT samples.

Thus the conclu- sion by some groups that human lung microbiota derives primarily from the upper respiratory tract in accordance with the adapted island model of biogeography  must be reconsid- ered in the light of our finding that the murine lung actually encompasses three distinct pneumotypes.
