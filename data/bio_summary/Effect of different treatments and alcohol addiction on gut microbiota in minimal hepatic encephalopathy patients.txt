Therefore investigation into gut microbiota alterations in these patients may reveal distinct mechanisms of the disease pathogenesis and facilitate treatment strategy development specifically for this population.Certain treatment regimens have been designed for the therapy of MHE including administration of rifaximin a semisynthetic antibiotic probiotics lactulose prebiotics4892ZUO et al TREATMENT AND ALCOHOL AFFECT GUT MICROBIOTA IN MHE PATIENTSFigure 3.

In general the abundance of Firmicutes declined following treatment particularly in non-alcoholic MHE patients.Ammonia produced by gut microbes is regarded as an important inducing agent of MHE and its level is highly correlated with MHE pathogenesis 25.

In addition patient 2 did not have an evident response to rifaximin treatment in terms of microbiota diver- sity as Shannon index remained almost the same subsequent to treatment.Similarly if subjects are divided into the alcoholic and non-alcoholic MHE groups a predominant decrease in Shannon index is observed in non-alcoholic patients following treatment.

This suggests that despite the impact of probiotics on microbiota diversity this impact may be negligible when considering the entire phylogenetic tree.Upon comparison of alcoholic and non-alcoholic MHE patients in the present study non-alcoholic subjectspresented a predominant reduction in Shannon diversity index and higher pairwise Unifrac values post treatment vs. pre-treatment values when compared to alcoholic MHE patients.

Jointly these changes contribute to the modulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis asso- ciated with MHE 8.In conclusion the present study investigated the effect of different treatment strategies including rifaximin alone or rifaximin plus probiotics on gut microbiota in MHE patients.

Given the correlation between the metabolic functions of gut microbiota and HE the aim of various therapeutic regimens is to restore the gut microbiota towards the normal composition and func- tions.Therefore the present study conducted the first comprehen- sive metagenomics investigation into gut microbiota alterations subsequent to treatment with rifaximin a well-documented anti-MHE drug or a combination treatment consisting of rifaximin and probiotics 12.

DNA from the intestinal bacteria community of patients was isolated immediately prior to treatment and 4 weeks following treatment with rifaximin or rifaximin plus probiotics using the CTAB hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide approach 13.

Patients prior to treatment were denoted as numbers 1-14 and after treatment the patients were denoted as the numbertreatment.

Upon taking a closer look a predominant reduction in the index can be observed following treatment with rifaximin plus probiotics whereas the group with rifaximin only treatment presented a more diversified response.

Comparing the values for each patient prior to and following treatment the magnitude of response to the treatment for that specific patient is obtained.
