however the rapid fermentation of fos may cause a higher initial production of gases52 should be paid more attention.the present results showed that the glycation extent of myo- fibrillar proteins played an important role in the production of butyrate during in vitro fecal fermentation but less affected the production of the other scfas which were not consistent with the study that sodium caseinategalactose conjugate improved the production of acetate in comparison to sodium caseinate heated alone but did not cause the increased pro- duction of butyrate in vitro batch fermentation.19 however hernandez-hernandez et al.21 found that no significant differ- ences between hydrolyzed caseinomacropeptide and the corresponding glycoconjugates in the production of acetate in vitro fecal fermentation and other previous studies also reported that glycated pea proteins and b-lactoglobulingalacto-table 1 short-chain fatty acids scfas and branched-chain fatty acids bcfas production in batch cultures after 12 h and 24 h of fermentation using fos and digested glycoconjugates preparation at 0 h m0 3 h m3 6 h m6 9 h m9 12 h m12 18 h m18 and 24 h m24 of heating com- pared with a control that without substrate added ck.

from thepresent results glycated myofibrillar proteins with a higher level of amadori products and lower browning intensity enhanced the production of scfas in the fermentation of fecal microbiota.microbial community structures analysisa high bacterial abundance and diversity is generally thought of as a significant characteristic in the healthy gut ecosystem which plays a positive role in human metabolism and health.53 to investigate the detailed effects of the glyca- tion extent of proteins on microbiota in fermentation samples we used high-throughput sequencing of variable regions of 16s ribosomal dna to analyze the composition and diversity of microbiota in the samples from 12 h of fermentation.

fermentation was conducted in fermentation tubes which were 16 mm x 100 mm glass screw tubes equipped with rubber plug inside the screw cap.

s2 and the content of scfas and bcfas in faecal fermentation samples which were incubated with digested glycoconjugates is shown in table 1. for digested glycoconjugates fermentation the pro- duction of each scfas increased with incubation time and acetate was the most dominated scfas followed by butyrateand propionate.

in addition the production of the highest level of butyrate was obtained in m12 6.12 - 0.15 mm after 12 h of fermentation and significant higher than that of m0 and m3 but close to that of m6 and m9 for 24 h of fermentation m3produced the highest level butyrate 9.31 - 0.20 mm in all digested glycoconjugates.

in contrast the production of buty- rate in m18 and m24 were much lower than that of other glycoconjugates.as for bcfas m12 for 12 h of fermentation significantly increased the production of iso-butyrate compared to other samples except that of m18 and m3 for 24 h of fermentation accelerated the production of iso-butyrate compared to other samples.

a higher level of propionate and butyrate for 12 h of fermentation was generated when compared to 24 h of fermentation indicating a rapid consumption of fos.

values were expressed as the mean - standard deviations n  3mean - standard deviations mmone-way anova with duncan's test was used to determine significant differences p  0.05 among different samples at the same time of fermentation for each scfas or bcfas concentration.oligosaccharides conjugate could not increase the production of scfas including acetate propionate and butyrate during fecal fermentation when compared to non-glycated pro- teins.720 therefore we hypothesized that the types and glyca- tion extent of proteins affected the profiles of scfas but alsothe utilization of different gut microbiota species.

these digested glycoconjugates were further fer- mented by fecal inoculum and gas chromatograph gc analysis and high-throughput sequencing technologies were employed to monitor the formation of scfas and branched- chain fatty acids bcfas and changes of microbial commu- nity structures during the in vitro batch fermentation respectively.
