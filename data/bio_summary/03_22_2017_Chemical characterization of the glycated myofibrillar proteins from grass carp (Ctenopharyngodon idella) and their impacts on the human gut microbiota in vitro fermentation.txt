See DOI 10.1039 c6fo01632dreaction between an available amine group of proteins and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar forming a glycosylamine which then undergoes an irreversible Amadori rearrangement to produce the Amadori products.8 As reaction intermediates Amadori products further degrade to advanced glycation end products AGEs one class of undesirable effects of com-ponents that result from thermal food processing such as Ne-carboxymethyl-lysine and pyrraline.9 On the other hand the glycation via Maillard reaction is considered as one of the most promising chemical modifications to improve protein functionalities such as antigenicity of a-lactalbumin10 immunoreactivity and allergenicity of hazelnut protein11 heat stability of whey protein isolate12 gelling properties of soybean b-conglycinin.13 Also the glycation of protein or protein hydro- lysates accompanied with the formation of markedly aroma and taste-enhancing properties.14 However the glycationmight to result in some negative effects on proteins includinglower susceptibility to proteases15 and the decrease of nutri- tion quality.16The lower digestibility of glycated proteins may escape gastrointestinal enzymes and reach the lower gastrointestinal tract where they have the potential to modulate the physiology of intestinal ecosystem by influencing the metabolism of par- ticular bacterial species.7 Some previous studies have showed that Amadori products are scarcely digested and excreted and up to 80 of dietary Amadori products were degraded by intes- tinal bacteria.917 The fructoselysine Amadori product utilized by Escherichia coli has been identified.18 Recently several studies have found that pea proteins caseinateb-lactoglobulin and caseinomacropeptide glycated with redu- cing sugar have potential prebiotic effects in vitro fecal fermen- tation based on the analysis of fluorescent in situ hybridisation technology.719-21 However an increase of some detrimental bacteria sulfate-reducing bacteria and clostridia and a decrease of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were observed in fermentation of glycated bovine serum albumin BSA with human fecal bacteria from ulcerative colitis patients when compared to native BSA.22 Therefore the bifidogenic-effects of glycated proteins on the human gut microbiota remain contro- versial and mostly unknown.Fish myofibrillar proteins are thermally and chemically unstable than that of other vertebrates and the food function- ality is easy to be impaired as protein denaturation under high temperature low pH and high salt concentration.23 The glyca- tion via Maillard reaction by dry-heating greatly improved the functional properties of fish myofibrillar proteins.2425 However the digestibility of glycated fish proteins and their effects on the composition and diversity of human gut micro- biota is still unknown.Grass carp is a popular species of freshwater fish in China with an estimated annual harvest of 5 070 000 metric tons in 2013.26 The objective of the present study was to characterize the chemical characterization and digestibility of the glycated myofibrillar proteins from grass carp by dry- heating.

However the rapid fermentation of FOS may cause a higher initial production of gases52 should be paid more attention.The present results showed that the glycation extent of myo- fibrillar proteins played an important role in the production of butyrate during in vitro fecal fermentation but less affected the production of the other SCFAs which were not consistent with the study that sodium caseinategalactose conjugate improved the production of acetate in comparison to sodium caseinate heated alone but did not cause the increased pro- duction of butyrate in vitro batch fermentation.19 However Hernandez-Hernandez et al.21 found that no significant differ- ences between hydrolyzed caseinomacropeptide and the corresponding glycoconjugates in the production of acetate in vitro fecal fermentation and other previous studies also reported that glycated pea proteins and b-lactoglobulingalacto-Table 1 Short-chain fatty acids SCFAs and branched-chain fatty acids BCFAs production in batch cultures after 12 h and 24 h of fermentation using FOS and digested glycoconjugates preparation at 0 h M0 3 h M3 6 h M6 9 h M9 12 h M12 18 h M18 and 24 h M24 of heating com- pared with a control that without substrate added CK.

The pH was adjusted to 2.5 with 1 M HCl and porcine pepsin was added at an approximately physiological ratio of enzyme to substrate 1  20 w  w. The digestion was performed at 37 degC for 2 h. The gastric digestion was stopped by raising the pH to 7.5 using 1 M NH4HCO3.

The electron impact EI ion source temperature was 230 degC and ionization voltage was 70 eV the quadrupole analyser tempera- ture was 150 degC.DNA extraction PCR amplification and Illumina sequencingMicrobial genomic DNA was extracted from the fermentation samples according to the method reported by Yu  Morrison.33 The concentration of DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer NanoDrop Technologies Wilmington DE USA.

From thepresent results glycated myofibrillar proteins with a higher level of Amadori products and lower browning intensity enhanced the production of SCFAs in the fermentation of fecal microbiota.Microbial community structures analysisA high bacterial abundance and diversity is generally thought of as a significant characteristic in the healthy gut ecosystem which plays a positive role in human metabolism and health.53 To investigate the detailed effects of the glyca- tion extent of proteins on microbiota in fermentation samples we used high-throughput sequencing of variable regions of 16S ribosomal DNA to analyze the composition and diversity of microbiota in the samples from 12 h of fermentation.

The production of butyrate in fermentation of digested glycoconjugates was affected by the glycation extent of myofibrillar proteins and significantly and positively correlated with Mitsuokella LachnospiraceaeUCG-004 Sutterella Salinimicrobium Fodinibius and Nitriliruptor  p  0.05 but negatively correlated with Enterococcus Dorea  p  0.05 Escherichia-Shigella and Phascolarctobacterium  p  0.01.

The analysis of correlation between the average values of buty- rate concentrations and relative abundances of top 35 most abundant genera in fermentation samples was assessed by Pearson's correlation test and p  0.05 or p  0.01 represented different statistically significant levels.

The M9 produced the highest concentration acetate in all samples after 12 h and 24 h of fermentation although the content of acetate did not show significant differ- ences between M0 non-glycated myofibrillar proteins and other digested glycoconjugates samples.

The production of BCFAs for FOS fermentation could be attrib- uted to residual substrates in inoculum.
