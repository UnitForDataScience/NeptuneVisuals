This study suggests that a commonly used statin RSV leads to an altered gut microbial composition in normal mice with attendant impacts on local gene expression profiles a finding that should prompt further studies to investigate the impli- cations of statins for gut microbiota stability and health in humans.NEW  NOTEWORTHY This work demonstrates that rosuvastatin administration in mice affects the gastrointestinal microbiota influ- ences bile acid metabolism and alters transcription of genes encoding factors involved in gut homeostasis and immunity in the gastrointes- tinal tract.bile acid inflammation isoprenoid microbiota statinSTATINS ARE AMONG the most commonly used medications worldwide 26.

While immune param- eters and bile acid profiles are known to exert a powerful influence on the microbiota we recognize that other physio- logical parameters including regulation of local cholesterollevels 35 36 may also potentially influence the structure of the gut microbial community.In the current study we demonstrate that oral RSV alters the gut microbiota in mice and also influences bile acid profiles and local gene expression profiles.

BAs can alter the micro- bial content of the gut through impacts on individual microor- ganisms and ratios of various BAs in the gut are likely to influence microbiota composition 21 28 63.

RSV treatment of mice significantly af- fected bile acid metabolism and impacted expression of inflammatory markers known to influence microbial community structure including RegIII-y and Camp in the gut.

B. wadsworthia was not affected by RSV except at the highest concentration 3 mgml.Oral RSV modulates expression of gut defensins and local and systemic cytokines in C57Bl6 mice.

As RSV was seen to alter the gut microbiota in our initial study we carried out a separate experiment to examine the effects of statin treatment on local and hepatic gene expression profiles in the host.

We also observed a significant increase in local expression of genes encoding iNOS2 and the mucin Muc2 factors that are likely to impact locally on the composition of the microbiota 24.It has been previously shown that oral administration of cholic acid to rats significantly alters the composition of the gut microbiota 21 63.

Ezetimibe and simvastatin modulate gut microbiota and expression of genes related to cholesterol metabolism.

Xenobiotics shape the physi- ology and gene expression of the active human gut microbiome.

In another recent study administration of simva- statin to mice ad libitum in the diet for 1 wk did not signifi- cantly influence major genera of gut bacteria whose abundance was measured using a targeted qPCR approach 6.
