The PERMANOVA showed a statistical diference in the Bacterial species composition between the type of the samples Additional file Table S3 even as the NMDS analysis also showed that Zika patients clustering together a part from the three controls groups Additional file Figure S1286 1.5 and 1183 4.8 reads Burkholderia 2801.47 and 713 2.87 reads Flavobacterium 2441.28 and 533 2.15 reads Streptococcus 78 0.41and 515 2.1 reads and Paucibacter 146 077 and 295 1.19 reads Fig.

showed that Controls were more diverse than the two Zika infected AF samples altough only the comparissons between Zika patients and Term Control considering Simpson index and Zika patients and Preterm Control considering Shannon index were statistically significant Additional file  Table S2.

Additionally we compared these two cases with metatranscriptomic sequences from 16 pregnant women collected at various times in their pregnancies four Prenatal samples 18-24 weeks six late Preterm samples 34-36 weeks and six Term samples 39-40 weeks The Illumina sequences obtained from these two cases and the 16 metatranscriptomes used as controls were pre-processed using Prinseq software to remove reads smaller than 35 bp and sequences with quality scores lower than Phred 20.

However previous studies comparing the bacterial diversity in patients with immuno-deficient syndrome HIV showed that there is an increase in bac- terial diversity in HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative patients .

Enterobacteria phage phiX174 sequences were found in both patients 537 87.9 and 625 31.19 reads.

To test the hypothesis that the taxonomic composition of the AF was the same in the four sample types two infected Zika patients Prenatal Preterm and Term Permutational Multivariate Ana- lysis of Variance PERMANOVA was performed using the adonis function of the Vegan package  Bray- Curtis distances and 999 permutations.

Zika positive AF patients 1 and 2 were more diverse Shannon index  2.578 and 2.678 Simpson index  091 and 090 than Prenatal and Preterm Controls samples Shannonindex  2.44 Simpson index  0.88 and Shannon index  2.54 Simpson index  0.9 respectivelly Fig.

Unidentified Bacterial sequences were the most abundant group found in both samples 3483 reads in the sample from patient 1 and 6538 reads in the sample from patient 2.

In total 170928 and 166717 eukaryotic sequences showed no hits or were not taxonomically assigned by MEGAN in samples from the patients 1 and 2 respectively.
