Animals diets and managementThe experiment on the adsorption of AFB1 in basal diet in vitro was as follows treatment R1 1 kg basal diet treatment R2 1 kg basal diet  50 mg AFB1 treatment R3 1 kg basal diet  50 mg AFB11 x 106 CFUg LP R4 1 kg basal diet  50 mg AFB11 x 107 CFUg LP and R51 kg basal diet  50 mg AFB11 x 108 CFUg LP for 28 days.

Group I was fed with the control diet basal diet group II was given the contaminated diet basal diet  50 mgkg AFB1 and group III was fed with an LP-treated diet basal diet  50 mgkg AFB11 x 108 CFUg LP.

The process included 8 polyacrylamide gel with 35-65 linear gradients of denaturant 100 denaturant corresponds to 40 formamide and 7 M-urea in 1 x Tris acetate-EDTA buffer and was performed at 60 degC for 16 h at 100 V.
