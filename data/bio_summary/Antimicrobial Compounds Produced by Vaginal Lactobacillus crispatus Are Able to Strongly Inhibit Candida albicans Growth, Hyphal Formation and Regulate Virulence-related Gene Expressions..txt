after catalase treatment the growth inhibition rates of three cfs a014 a055 and a083 were found to decrease indicating that the observed anti-candida effects of these three strains were partially attributed to the production of h2o2 p  0.05. however it was strange that the growth inhibition abilities of five cfs b135 b062 b351 b161 and b511 were found to significantly increase after catalase treatment.effect of cfs on c. albicans hyphal formationthe effect of cfs on the hyphal formation was evaluated in rpmi 1640 agar medium containing 10 fbs hypha-inducing condition.

showed that cfs significantly down-regulated the expression of the hyphae- specific genes als3 0.140-fold hwp1 0.075-fold and ece1 0.045-fold the differences were statistically significant compared to mrs control p  0.01. the gene expression level of sap5 1.283-fold had no statistical difference compared to the control p  0.05. strikingly eap1 gene which involved in adhesion and biofilm formation was found to be significantly up- regulated by cfs treatment 2.590-fold p  0.01. in addition the expression level of negative transcriptional regulator nrg1 was also found to be significantly up-regulated 1.911-fold p  0.05 while two hyphae activator regulatory genes tec1 1.272-fold and efg1 1.200-fold involved in c. albicansmorphogenesis were found to have no statistical difference compared to the control p  0.05.comparing the different effects of cfs on c. albicans gene expression we found that all seven l. crispatus cfs significantly down-regulated the expression of als3 hwp1 and ece1 genes  and there were no inter-strain difference except for gene hwp1 by lsd test b145 vs. b535 p 0.026 b535 vs. b135 p 0.024 .

in the presence of cfs or mrs-hcl the growth of c. albicans was significantly reduced when compared to the mrs control in general  p  0.01. in addition while the mrs-hcl could significantly inhibit the growth of c. albicans od630 nm mrs-hcl vs. control 0.861 0.122 vs. 1.021 0.103 p 0.008 each of the cfs could further inhibit c. albicans growth with significant difference compared to mrs-hcl p  0.01.in order to test whether the antimicrobial activity was due to h2o2 the cfs was treated with catalase enzyme 1 mgml sigma st. louis mo usa at 37c for 1 h before approachingto the inhibition assay .

the susceptibility to heat was evaluated by subjecting the b145 cfs to a number of thermal treatments60c for 30 min 100c for 30 min and 121c for 15 min.the susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes was investigated by exposing cfs to proteinase-k and trypsin 1 mgml keygen biotech nanjing china for 3 h at 37c   .the b145 cfs had about 60 growth inhibition activity onc.

images of colony edges were obtained using a stereomicroscope sz66optec chongqing china.to assess the effect of cfs in liquid medium a mixture of 900 ul c. albicans suspensions  106 cfuml in medium and 100 ul cfs was added into each well of a 48- well microplate and aerobically incubated at 37c for 4 h. quantification of inhibition of the yeast-to-hyphae transition was accomplished by counting the number of individual yeast cells versus the number of hyphae in the population under a light microscope axiocam mrc5 carl zeiss jena germany.

the strong- moderate- weak- and non-producers were 50.0 918 22.2 418 5.6 118 and 22.2 418 respectively.effect of cfs on c. albicans growththe strains of lactobacilli were assayed for their ability to produce inhibition compounds in cfs against the growth ofc.

in addition the effect of cfs on the hyphal formation was evaluated in liquid medium supplemented with cfs.

the growth inhibition rate of c. albicans treated by l. crispatus 71.1 5.2 was significantly higher than those treated by l. gasseri 57.1 6.3  or l. jensenii 57.4 9.9 respectively p  0.01. the hyphae inhibition rate of c. albicans treated by l. crispatus 88.3 3.02 was significantly higher than that by l. jensenii 81.9 6.2 p  0.05. however there was no significant difference between l. crispatus and l. gasseri treatments 88.3 3.0 vs. 84.9 6.0 p  0.05. taking into consideration of growth and hyphal formation inhibition activities we chose l. crispatus cfs to study the effects on the transcription of c. albicans virulence-related genes.modulation of c. albicans gene expression by cfsthe expression levels of the hyphae-specific genes als3 hwp1 ece1 eap1 and sap5 and transcriptional regulatory genes efg1 tec1 and nrg1 were quantified in c. albicans incubated with cfs by qrt-pcr.

in addition the anti-hyphal activities of cfs were significantly reduced after exposing to heat or protease treatments compared to that of the untreated cfs p  0.01 .

however the residual activity of protease-treated cfs was significantly lower than those of heat treatments p  0.05.these primarily results suggested that the growth and the hyphal inhibition activities of l. crispatus b145 cfs might be attributed to the antimicrobial compounds with different chemical nature in terms of heat stability and protease susceptibility.discussionvulvovaginal candidiasis primarily caused by c. albicans is one of the most common urogenital diseases affecting women of reproductive-age and associated to the disruption of the healthy vaginal microbiota  .

each of cfs from the tested lactobacillus strains showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than mrs-hcl liquid ph 4.0 p  0.01. it suggests that other antimicrobial compounds might play roles in the growth inhibition effects of cfs on c. albicans.

albicans atcc 10231. we found that the l. crispatus showed the most significant antimicrobial activities in microplate-based liquid medium assay p  0.05. all seven cell-free supernatants cfs from l. crispatus strains reduced the growth of c. albicans by 60. the effects might be due to their productions of some secretory antimicrobial compounds in addition to h2o2 and organic acids.

furthermore each of the cfs of lactobacillus strains was found to significantly suppress the yeast-to-hyphae transition of c. albicans under hyphae-inducing conditions rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum.

the hyphae inhibition rates of c. albicans treated by cfs from l. crispatus l. gasseri and l. jensenii were 88.3 - 3.02 84.9 - 6.0 and81.9 - 6.2 respectively.

the results demonstrated that l. crispatus cfs significantly down-regulated the expression of hyphae-specific genes als3 0.140-fold hwp1 0.075-fold and ece1 0.045-fold while up-regulated the expression of the negative transcriptional regulator gene nrg1 with 1.911-fold.
