Specifically 50 in the RCDI group 12 of 24 patients had surgery and 26 in the non-RCDI group 29 of 113 patients P  .024 had surgery 3 of the surgeries in the RCDI group were due to CDI com- plications colectomy in all 3 cases 2 of the surgeries in the non-RCDI group were due to chronic complications of priorTable 3.

Probiotic use was more frequent in patients with RCDI com- pared to patients without RCDI 62 vs 41 respectively P  .05.

However data suggest that patients who undergo FMT for RCDI are highly satisfied with the procedure and testify to the significant patient-level burden of RCDI.In summary this follow-up study has demonstrated that FMT was an effective treatment option in our cohort of 137 RCDI patients.

Overall 82 113137 of patients at follow-up had no recur- rence of C. difficile infection CDI post-FMT non-RCDI group and 18 24137 of patients had CDI post-FMT RCDI group.

As FMT is becoming increasingly used for RCDI  we sought to estimate long-term clinical outcomes of FMT recipients durability of the procedure and patient satisfaction.METHODSThis was a single-center follow-up study of all RCDI patients who underwent FMT at Emory University between July 2012 and December 2016.

Stratified by antibiotic use RCDI was found in 1861 patients who used antibiotics in the post-FMT period 29.5 compared to 676 patients who did not use antibiotics 7.9.

Patients with RCDI were more likely to be hospitalized 1824 75 than patients without RCDI 36113 32.

Stratifying by RCDI the RCDI group had a median 0-pound change in weight and the non-RCDI group had a median increase of 5 pounds from FMT to time of follow-up.Patients reported high levels of satisfaction with FMT for RCDI.

However we suspect that this represents bias related to a higher rate of probiotic use either for higher perceived risk of RCDI among these patients due to underlying illnesses anti- biotic exposures or some other cause rather than a causal effect of probiotics in increasing risk of RCDI.

Eligible patients who received FMT for RCDI at Emory Hospital between 1 July 2012 and 31 December 2016 were contacted via telephone for a follow-up survey.
