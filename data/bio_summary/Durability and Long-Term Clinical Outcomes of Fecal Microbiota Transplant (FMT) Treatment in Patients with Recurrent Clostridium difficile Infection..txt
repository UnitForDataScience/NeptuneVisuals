probiotic use was more frequent in patients with rcdi com- pared to patients without rcdi 62 vs 41 respectively p  .05. however we suspect that this represents bias related to a higher rate of probiotic use either for higher perceived risk of rcdi among these patients due to underlying illnesses anti- biotic exposures or some other cause rather than a causal effect of probiotics in increasing risk of rcdi.

stratified by recurrence non-cdi antibiotic use after fmt was morecommon in the rcdi group compared to the non-rcdi group 75 and 38 respectively p  .0009. the median number of antibiotic courses post-fmt was 2 range 1-10. stratified by antibiotic use rcdi was found in 1861 patients who used antibiotics in the post-fmt period 29.5 compared to 676 patients who did not use antibiotics 7.9. the most frequently prescribed antibiotics post-fmt overall and in the rcdi group were quinolones cephalosporins macrolides and nitrofuran- toin.

patients with rcdi were more likely to be hospitalized 1824 75 than patients without rcdi 36113 32. nine hospitalizations in the rcdi group were related to c. difficile complications while 1 hospitalization in the non-rcdi group was related to chronic complications of a previous cdi.

the yuck factor associated with fmt is an often-referenced barrier to more widespread use 36. however data suggest that patients who undergo fmt for rcdi are highly satisfied with the procedure and testify to the significant patient-level burden of rcdi.in summary this follow-up study has demonstrated that fmt was an effective treatment option in our cohort of 137 rcdi patients.

at the time of fmt 112137 patients 82 were treated in an outpatient setting 23137 17 were inpatients and 2137 1 were in a nursing home facility.table 2. characteristics of patients who died in the post-fecal microbiota transplant periodcharacteristicn total n  26median age in years at time of death range72 22-95 median time in months from fecal microbiota10 1-33transplant to time of death rangemetastatic cancer9chronic kidney disease2heart failure2respiratory failure due to graft rejection2sepsis due to bacteremia2unspecified2bowel obstruction due to anal stricture1myocardial infarction1acute renal failure1ischemic stroke1seizure1abbreviation fmt fecal microbiota transplant.a cause of death listed in death summary andor post-mortem clinician's communication note.2  cid 2017xx xx xxxx  mamo et aldonor characteristicsall but 1 of the eligible patients who underwent fmt at emory university received screened material from unrelated donors who were unknown to the recipient but known to the author who processed the donated feces c. k.. these unrelated donors were screened by the consensus donor screening recommenda- tions at the time .

as fmt is becoming increasingly used for rcdi  we sought to estimate long-term clinical outcomes of fmt recipients durability of the procedure and patient satisfaction.methodsthis was a single-center follow-up study of all rcdi patients who underwent fmt at emory university between july 2012 and december 2016. the fmt protocol has been approved at emory healthcare by the medical practices infection preventionantibiotic utilization and the pharmacy and therapeutics com- mittees since july 2012. fmt was performed in both outpatient and inpatient settings using either nasogastric tube or colonos- copy.

the most commonly reported causes of recurrent diarrhea after fmt not related to rcdi were crohn's disease flares microscopic or ul- cerative colitis 666 9 surgery 366 5 irritable bowel syndrome ibs 266 3 and self-limited gastroenteritis 266 3. the remaining 2466 patients 36 with diarrhea who had positive pcr testing for c. difficile after fmt were classified as having rcdi.

stratifying by rcdi the rcdi group had a median 0-pound change in weight and the non-rcdi group had a median increase of 5 pounds from fmt to time of follow-up.patients reported high levels of satisfaction with fmt for rcdi.

eligible patients who received fmt for rcdi at emory hospital between 1 july 2012 and 31 december 2016 were contacted via telephone for a follow-up survey.

antibiotic exposure for non-cdi infections after fmt was more common in the rcdi group compared to the non-rcdi group 75 vs 38 p  .0009. overall 11 of patients reported improvement or resolution of diagnoses not related to cdi post-fmt and 33 reported development of a new medical condition or symptom post-fmt.
