While there were no differences in baseline transepithelial resistance Isc or cAMP-stimulated secretion the GF mice had a significantly greater secretory response to serotonin than their HM counterparts suggesting that the presence of gut microbiota specifically tempers the secretory response to 5-HT.

In an earlier study these authors 4 also demonstrated the influence of diet on gut transit time in GF and HM mice but its effects on serotonin-mediated Isc are un- known.

With a view to gain an insight into the human microbiota the authors compared serotonin-sensitive ion secretion in age-matched Swiss Webster Germ Free GF mice with those colonized with human gut microbiota HM.

Finally all these findings need to be related to the effects of serotonin on other aspects of gut function like contractility and sensation.The gut possesses a variety of regulatory mechanisms that coordinate the diverse actions of 5-HT to maintain homeostasis of fluid transport and contractility and this paper adds the gut microbiota to that armamentarium.

Second in colonoids derived from GF mice acetate at a single concen- tration but not butyrate decreased the levels of 5-HT3B mRNA hinting that the signal may be via short chain fatty acids in particular acetate.As with many good studies the findings raise more ques- tions What is the diversity and composition of the protective commensals While treating all mice with samples from one human allows for a well-controlled study it begs the question of what effects 3-diversity will have on the response What is the trigger Is the microbiome profile altered in disease states and does it use the same or different triggers There is some hint to the trigger in nondiseased states in that the short chain fatty acid acetate attenuates the 5-HT3 mRNA levels in GF-derived colonoids.
