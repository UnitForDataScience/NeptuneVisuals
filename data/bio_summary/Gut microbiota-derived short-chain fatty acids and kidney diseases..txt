SCFAs affect the expression of genes with diverse functions by inhibiting the activity of HDAC to exhibit anti-tumor anti- fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities.2033 Additionally SCFA-mediated inhibition of HDACs might be independent of GPCRs and GPR41 is involved in the process.34The functions of scFAsAs reported SCFAs regulate tissue-specific health as well as systemic health including appetite gastrointestinal motility colitis metabolic syndrome airway disease and even carcinogenesis.35-37 All of these influences are derived from the complex functions of SCFAs including influencingenergy metabolism evoking hormone release and regulating immune inflammation and blood pressure.energy metabolismLocally SCFAs butyrate preferentially are used as fuel for colonocytes and in the maintenance of the epithelium.7 After absorption into the bloodstream17 circulatory SCFAs act as a primary substrate for hepatic and adipocyte lipogenesis as well as for intestinal gluconeogenesis and exhibit a range of metabolic effects Figure 1.3839 For example SCFAs activate AMP-activated protein kinases AMPK in the liver and muscle thereby triggering the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and thus stimulating glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation and improving glycemic control at least in murine models.40Several studies reported the benefits of regulating lipid or glucose metabolism by resistant starch which increasedSCFAs production4142 or fecal transplantation of butyrate- producing bacteria.4344 Administration of acetate or propionate in adipocytes of mice reduced plasma free fatty acid levels by enhancing adipogenesis and inhibiting lipolysis via the activation of GPR43.3845-47 In obese hyperinsulinemia fafa rats propionate lowered urinary glucose excretion and fasting blood glucose levels.48 Amelioration of obesity and its comor- bidities as well as insulin resistance was also observed in mice fed with dietary supplementation of acetate.40 Not only in an experimental setup but also in clinical studies overweight adults supplemented with inulin-propionate ester for a longer term which could be metabolized by the microbiota in the colon to propionate showed a significant reduction in weight gain via appetite regulation.49 Patients were advised to increase their dietary fibers which increased concentrations of SCFAs in the gut and circulatory system this was associated with the reduction of adverse consequences of hyperglycemia.50Fatty acid oxidationFatty acid synthesisSatiety AppetiteLeptinInsulin GlucagonGlucose uptakeAdipogenesis LipolysisInsulin resistance Free fatty acidGLP-1PYYNon-digestibledietary fibers and endogenoussubstratesGut microbiota fermentationShort-chain fatty acidsGPCRs GPR41 GPR43 Olfr78 GPR109AHDACEnteroendocrine L cellIntestinal gluconeogenesisGlucose toleranceFuel for colonocytesFigure 1 short-chain fatty acids to host appetite and metabolism control.

scFAs can also decrease fatty acid synthesis and promote fatty acid oxidation in the liver.

This review will provide an overview of the physiology and functions of SCFAs in kidney disease.Keywords gut microbiome short-chain fatty acids kidney diseases gut-kidney axisIntroductionThe human intestinal tract harbors a diverse and complex microbial community which plays a pivotal role in health.

On one hand metabolites - particularly short-chain fatty acids SCFAs - are generally proven to promote health.1-3 On the other hand uremic toxins including indoles ammonia and trimethylamine N-oxide produced by the gut microbiota enhance the develop- ment and progression of chronic kidney disease CKD.4-7 An insufficiency in gut microbiota-generated SCFAs is also associated with illnesses including inflammatory bowel disease obesity type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus autism major depression colon cancer as well as kidney diseases - the focus of the discussion.8-11 The functions of SCFAs are mainly related to their activation of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors GPCRs and their inhibition of histone acetylation HDAC.12 Due to their positive effects therapeutic studies of SCFAs have been carried out both in clinical and in animal studies.

Before we outline the known roles of SCFAs in renal diseases we will first review what is known regarding the basic functions and systemic roles of SCFAs.Gut microbiota-derived SCFAsDefinition production and transportation of SCFAsSCFAs are straight-chain saturated fatty acids composed of less than six carbon atoms among which acetate two carbons propionate three carbons and butyratesubmit your manuscript  Drug Design Development and Therapy 201711 3531-35423531c 2017 Li et al.

short-chain fatty acids scFAs produced via microbiota fermentation of non-digestible dietary fibers or endogenous substrates can be used as fuel for colonocytes and stimulate intestinal gluconeogenesis which improves glucose tolerance.

in adipose tissue scFAs can increase adipogenesis and inhibit lipolysis thereby decreasing free fatty acids.
