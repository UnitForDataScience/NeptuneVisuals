however the direct effect of scfas on t cells enhances the generation of th1 and th17 cells to boost immunity to fight pathogens which means that activation of scfas for immune cells and epithelial cells may increase inflammatory responses if not properly regulated.abbreviations dcs dendritic cells fas short-chain fatty acids gpcrs g protein-coupled receptors hdac histone acetylation no nitrous oxide tgf-b transforming growth factor-b tnf-a tumor necrosis factor-a.via olfr78 and gpr41 expressed on the afferent arteriole juxtaglomerular apparatus and smooth-muscle cells of the small resistance vessels.93-95 so the functions of scfas in most parts are contradictory it is now becoming clear that gut microbiota-derived metabolites play a central role in host physiology.96scfas in kidney diseasesin recent years considerable studies have explored a new and exciting area the interaction between the gut microbiome and kidney disease and have reported that alteration of intestinal microbiota in ckd is an important indicator of impairedrenal function and progression of ckd.97 kidney disease is often related to malnutrition hypertension or hypotension microinflammation dysbiosis of immune system and multiple oxidative stress which could be reversed by scfas figure 3. furthermore growing evidence has highlighted that scfas exhibited positive effects on kidney disease in both experimental animals and patients.clinical investigations of gut microbiota-derived sfcasrecently multiple studies focusing on microbiota in ckd or end-stage renal disease esrd patients have reported afigure 3 regulation of short-chain fatty acids to improve kidney function scfas can decrease the disruption of epithelial tight junction.

increasing dietary fiber in ckd rats showed similar results to clinical research with signifi- cantly improved intestinal epithelial tight junctions reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and less severe renal dysfunction.80 besides increasing scfas in uremic rats could improve kidney function and neutralizing bacteria-derived uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate inside the gut could also delay the progression of ckd and cardiovascular disease.114 the direct effects of scfas on kidney disease have been studied in juvenile diabetic rats by administering butyrate post- treatment the results showed that scfas not only decreased plasma glucose creatinine and urea but also improved renal histological alterations including fibrosis and collagen depo- sition apoptosis and dna damage.115 supplementation of acetate was reported to attenuate glomerular and tubuloint- erstitial fibrosis in the doca-salt mice.116however there are still several negative outcomes of scfas on kidney injury.

besides c2rd mice fed a high-fiber diet had increased gut butyrate and were more susceptible to infection with escherichia coli118 as well as enhanced gb3 levels in the gut and kidney which resulted in severe kidney damage.119despite growing interest in scfas many problems involving chronic kidney injury have not yet been answered and are still disputed.

inflammation and oxidative stress are inseparably linked as each causes and strengthens the other which could cause glomerulosclerosis tubular atrophy and fibrosis.120 therefore besides decreasing inflammation scfas inhibit ros generation induced by high glucose and lps in gmcs121 and hk-2 human kidney epithelial cells after hypoxia.2 in addition to gmcs elevated concentration of butyrate in proximal tubular epithelial cells was described to prevent tgf-b1 generation122 which is involved in renal fibrosis and its antagonistic action has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target.123-125 in porcine kidney fibroblast wt1 involved in cell proliferation and development was markedly enhanced along with an increase in sodium butyrate levels and by prolonging the treatment.126127these investigations of scfas on kidney resident cells glomerular cells and tubular cells which concentrate on inflammation ros and fibrosis are in agreement with the findings from animal experiments and provide more potential pathways to understand the mechanisms.

however future studies are still required to focus more on the interaction among scfas-associated molecular patterns and metabo- lism inflammation and immune system in order to clarify the molecular mechanisms behind kidney injury in the pathogenesis of kidney disease.conclusionin summary the function of gut microbiota-derived scfas in kidney disease has become an exciting area in recent years.

though controversial growing evidence suggests that scfas which regulate inflammation oxidative stress and fibrosis have been involved in kidney disease through the activation of the gut-kidney axis however the molecular relationship among gut microbiota- derived metabolites signaling pathways and kidney disease remains to be elucidated.

this review will provide an overview of the physiology and functions of scfas in kidney disease.keywords gut microbiome short-chain fatty acids kidney diseases gut-kidney axisintroductionthe human intestinal tract harbors a diverse and complex microbial community which plays a pivotal role in health.

on one hand metabolites - particularly short-chain fatty acids scfas - are generally proven to promote health.1-3 on the other hand uremic toxins including indoles ammonia and trimethylamine n-oxide produced by the gut microbiota enhance the develop- ment and progression of chronic kidney disease ckd.4-7 an insufficiency in gut microbiota-generated scfas is also associated with illnesses including inflammatory bowel disease obesity type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus autism major depression colon cancer as well as kidney diseases - the focus of the discussion.8-11 the functions of scfas are mainly related to their activation of transmembrane g protein-coupled receptors gpcrs and their inhibition of histone acetylation hdac.12 due to their positive effects therapeutic studies of scfas have been carried out both in clinical and in animal studies.

however despite indirect positive effects of scfas on remission of ckdesrd direct effects on kidney diseases are still in the experimental stage and require further study.experimental studies of sfcas in animalsin recent decades a small but growing number of animal experiments focusing on scfas in kidney disease have been reported using different models.

though various mechanisms were reported most of these studies suggest that decreasing inflammation and enhancing antioxidant activity by scfas may result in the improvement of renal function.in the ischemia-reperfusion injury model treatment with acetate or acetate-producing bacteria could reduce kidney injury.2 the key mechanism of action of scfas against kidney injury was suggested to be the reduction of inflamma- tory cytokines and chemokines locally and systemically as well as the inhibition of production of reactive oxygen species ros apoptosis and chromatin modification.2 it is also interesting to note that in the ischemia-reperfusion models of other tissues scfas1 or scfa-producing bacteria110 have been shown to exhibit protective effects implying that the underlying mechanism may be common across tissues.cin is another form of aki with exposure contrasting that of the media.

importantly the benefits of scfas on diabetic nephropathy the leading cause of esrd worldwide should be paid more attention to because of the positive effects of scfas on regulation of energy metabolism and immune inflammation.experimental studies of sfcas in kidney cellsresearchers have explored not only the in vivo effects of scfas but also their mechanism of action on kidney cells table 3. when glomerular mesangial cells gmcs are induced by high glucose and lipopolysaccharide lpsthe pharmacological concentrations of scfas accompanied with gpr43 agonist diminish renal inflammation by decreas- ing mcp-1 and il-1b.

this review will provide an overview of the physiology and functions of gut microbiota-derived scfas in kidney disease.

gpr43 has a potential role in inflammation and metabolic disorders.22-25 more importantly gpr41 and gpr43 both are expressed in the kidney and renal arteries.26 the potencies of scfas are different but the rank order has remained gener- ally consistent among different investigators table 1.2127 olfr78 is another key receptor for scfas which is expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells including subset of large renal vessels renal afferent arteriole and juxtaglomerular apparatus where it participates in the regulation of renin secretion in response to scfas.2628 unlike other receptors olfr78 is more sensitive to acetate and propionate but not to butyrate.

regulation of scfas on blood pressure and plasma glucose may help to ameliorate renal function in chronic kidney diseases.
