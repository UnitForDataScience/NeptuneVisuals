Our results showing a stable micro- biota dominated by Haemophilus Veillonella Prevotella and Streptococcus spp are similar to those obtained by other sample collection methodsand from healthy smokers and non-smokers.Additionally our data indicating a reduc- tion in a diversity in more severe COPD and with a non-de- ficient genotype correlate with other studies which have compared the lung microbiota of different COPD stages with healthy smokers and non-smokers.We observed relatively few Pseudomonas genera OTUs.Our study was commu- nity based examining a patient population with less severe COPD than other studies and may be more representative of the wider patient population with COPD since Pseudo- monas spp are known colonisers in more severe COPD and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Figure 4 A Graph showing only the Haemophilus spp operational taxonomic units OTUs from each sample further identified to species level indicating the dominant Haemophilus spp was Haemophilus influenzae all samples were from stable patients and each patient was only represented once.

Graphs show mean with SE.bind in order to inhibit phagocytosis combined with the high prevalence of H. influenzae in patients with COPD.Previous studies on the impact of MBL deficiency in COPD are inconsistent none have enrolled 300 patients without preselection for a subset of patients with COPD that is frequent exacerbators or had sufficient follow-up time to evaluate exacerbation frequency whereas we analysed the electronic medical record data from 1796 patients with COPD with an average follow-up of 5.4 years.

Individuals with specific single nucleotide poly- morphisms SNPs of the MBL2 gene cannot form stable multimeric forms leading to systemic defi- ciency of the MBL protein.Of the population 10-30 carry MBL deficient haplotypes but have no detectable phenotype when healthy.In populations with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis CF MBL deficiency is associated with more exacerbations including severe exacerbations faster decline in FEV1 and increased Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation.In COPD associations between MBL deficiency and hospitalisations for acute exacerbations or more frequent exacerba- tions have been identifiedwhereas Eagan et alfound no relationship between MBL plasma levels and COPD risk or disease severity.

MBL undergoes oxidation in the COPD airway oxidised MBL suppresses macrophage phago- cytosis of Haemophilus influenzae a key COPD pathogen.

This study was designed to test if MBL deficiency protects against exacerbations and is associated with a lower abundance of Haemophilus spp in the COPD airway.MeThodSTayside Allergy and Respiratory disease Information System population based genetic studyIn 2008 patients age 40 years with an FEV1FVC ratio 70 and a clinical diagnosis of COPD were invited toparticipate in a primary care based longitudinal cohort study and population registry called Tayside Allergy and Respira- tory Disease Information System TARDIS.

Our finding that MBL deficiency is protective against Haemophilus spp infection is consistent with data showing that oxidised MBL disrupts MBL oligomer formation and inhibits phagocytic clearance of Haemophilus spp in COPD alveolar macrophages.Impaired phagocytosis of Haemoph- ilus spp in COPD macrophages has been previously demon- strated our data fit with the proposal that MBL has a role in inhibiting clearance of bacteria from the airway.MBL deficiency may be beneficial by removing an inhibitory factor preventing bacterial phagocytosis.

The patient population consisted of primarily early COPD with preserved lung function and hence the generalisability of these data to later stage COPD would need to be confirmed in other studies.

Binding assays represent the mean with SE of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.this represents the largest study of the microbiota in COPD to date and the largest study of the impact of genetic MBL defi- ciency in COPD.In conclusion we have shown using a large primary care based genetic study and a nested microbiota subcohort study MBL deficiency in COPD is protective against the risk of exac- erbations and is associated with a more diverse lung microbiota.

Preclinical data suggest MBL interferes with phagocytosis of Haemophilus influenzae a key COPD pathogen.
