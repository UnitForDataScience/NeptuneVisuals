it is estimated that the oceans re- ceive 0.47-8.40 million tonnes of oil petroleum hydrocarbons annual- ly global marine oil pollution information gateway  and some of it ends up on the shores as tarballs.tarballs are formed when the crude oil released into marine envi- ronment by anthropogenic or natural activities changes over time due to weathering .

4.liu z. liu j. zhu q. wu w. 2012. the weathering of oil after the deepwater horizon oil spill insights from the chemical composition of the oil from the sea surface salt marshes andsediments.

as most of oil transport is done via sea occasional accidental spillages re- sult in the introduction of crude oil into marine environment.

the weathering is believed to depend on environmental conditions such as temperature wind velocity ocean current dynamics and dissolved oxygen concen- tration type and source of oil and time and amount of oil spillage .

available studies suggest that weathered oil is less toxic than the crude oil .

they ob- served higher number of human pathogen v. vulnificus in tarballs than in sea water and sand.investigated oil degrading bacterial community from previously contaminated sea water of the gulf st. vincent south- ern australia sa and weathered oil tarballs from refinery of sa australia.

envi- ronmental factors such as temperature available nutrients salinity dissolved oxygen concentration and physical state of crude oil are known to affect biodegradation of crude oil.

the geographical locations of tarball pollution at the global level are presented in .tarballs chemically differ from their parent crude oil depending on the formation conditions .

during weathering if oxygen from the atmosphere gets mixed with hydrocarbons present in the crude oil it can form oxygenated hydrocarbons oxyhydrocarbons.

meta-toluic acid a toxic compound present in tarballs is known to persist in marine environment .tarballs have high metal concentration than the parent crude oil.
