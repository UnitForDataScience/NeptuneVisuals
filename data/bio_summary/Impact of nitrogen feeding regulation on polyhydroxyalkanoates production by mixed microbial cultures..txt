Specifically during the coupled feeding run each SBR cycle was characterized by an initial feed phase 10 min 0.25 L a reaction phase 348 min and a withdrawal phase of the mixed liquor 2 min 0.25 L. In the uncoupled feeding runs the structure of each cycle consisted of an initial phase of carbon feeding 10 min 0.21 L a first reaction phase during which the external carbon source was consumed 140 min a withdrawal phase of the mixed liquor 2 min 0.25 L a nitrogen feeding phase 5 min 0.04 L and a second reaction phase 203 min which differentiated from the first reaction phase for the absence of the external organic substrate.

In the uncoupled feeding strategy in order to sustain microbial growth only during the famine phase nitrogen was added after the end of the feast phase at minute 152 from the beginning of the cycle and upon addition it was fairly quickly consumed during the famine phase in concomitance to PHA consumption B.

Indeed in the coupled feeding condition nitrogen was available for most of the SBR cycle and it was mainly consumed during the feast phase suggesting the simultaneous occurrence of microbial growth and PHA storage while the remainder fraction was used during the famine phase for the growth of PHA-storing microorganisms along with polymer consumption B.

More specifically in the coupled feeding run nitrogen was nearly completely consumed only by the end of the SBR cycle whereas in the uncoupled feeding run in which it was fed after the beginning of the famine phase resulting in a shorter period for its consumption before the end of the cycle a nitrogen limitation established only in the feast phase leading to the higher PHA production.

The main aim of a controlled nitrogen dosage in different moments of the SBR cycle is to favour PHA storage during the feast phase under nitrogen lacking conditions and microbial growth in the famine phase in the presence of nitrogen.

Hence the proportions of the two acids used for all cellular activities were likely not the same when changing the nitrogen feeding strategy which means that probably a larger proportion of acetic acid was used for growth and maintenance whereas a larger proportion of propionic acid was used for PHA storage in the run performed with the uncoupled C and N feeding strategy.Effect of the CN ratio in the SBR with uncoupled carbon and nitrogen feedingThree separate SBR runs were carried out with nitrogen being fed separately from the other nutrients and the carbon source at the beginning of the famine phase.

Based on these considerations and taking into account an apparent low viscosity of the mixed liquor as well as the high PHA production that is never correlated with fungi presence it is plausible to assume that fungi were not present in the other two SBR runs.ConclusionsThe strategy adopted for nitrogen supply was found to have a significant impact on PHA production in a sequencing batch reactor SBR aimed at the selection of PHA-storing mixed microbial cultures MMC from an activated sludge.
