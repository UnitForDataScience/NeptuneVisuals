HFDs containing lard can enhance the expression of genes involved in fatty acid catabolism such as lipoprotein lipase LPL and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a PPARa and down- regulate genes involved in fatty acid synthesis including fatty acid synthase FAS and acetyl-CoA carboxylase ACC .

Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 493 2017 1075e1081HFD containing lard displayed increased lipogenesis and hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A HMG-CoA reductase HMGCR activity and decreased PPARa expression .

The effects of edible oils on lipogenic gene expression A-F Relative mRNA expression of the indicated gene products by real-time PCR.

We observed that the S-group accumulated more fat in the epididymal and subcutaneous fat pads than the L- and control groups although recent studies indicated that the expression of FAS is increased in the visceral and subcutaneous fat pads of mice fed a HFD enriched with lard .

Although lard induced more hepatic stea- tosis unlike a diet-induced obesity model in SPF mice our results showed no differences in inflammation between HFDs enriched with lard or soybean oil.

Gnotobiotic C57BL6JNarl mice were inoculated with Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus and Paenibacillus azoreducens and then fed either a normal diet LabDiet 5010 control group or a diet containing 60 lard L-group or soybean oil S-group for 18 months.

The expression of fatty acid synthase FAS hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseHMGCR sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 SREBP2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma PPARg in the livers of the L-group were markedly elevated compared to the S- group.

However there were no differences in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a between the groups.

Mice fed lard gain more weight and accumulate more visceral fat than mice fed fish oil .
