It is important to acknowledge that the baseline microbiome varies among normal individuals and that colonization by certain bacteria appears to be conferring either a protective or deleterious effect on subsequent viral infection described in .However contrary to the gastrointestinal tract or skin niches it is only recently that the respiratory tract microbiome has been studied.Although more than 7000 articles were associated with the microbiome keyword in PubMed with a slight part focusing on respiratory tract microbiome only a small proportion focused on microbiome disturbance in viral infections especially in respiratory tract infections .Impact of the Respiratory Microbiota on Viral Infection PathogenesisAfter a first period focusing on the characterization of the composition and the physiological variations of the healthy respiratory microbiome most recent studies have focused on changes induced during a so- called pathological situation infectious or not.

Studies focusing on the microbiome associated with transcriptomic analyses of the host response and deep characterization of the pathogen would lead to a better understanding of viral pathogenesis and open avenues for biomarker development and innovative therapeutics.Keywords respiratory tract viral infections respiratory microbiome 16S whole genome sequencing NGSIntroductionBurden of Acute Respiratory Infections ARIAcute respiratory infections ARIs are the most common type of acute infection worldwide in both adults and children and are mainly caused by viruses including respiratory syncytial virus RSV human rhinovirus hRV influenza virus IV or metapneumovirus hMPV.

Doing so we would prove the benefit of using the microbiome as a prognostic marker of severe forms of viral respiratory diseases.No causal relation between the nasopharyngeal microbiome and the immune response to viral infections could be deduced from the studies described in this subsection.

Bacterial microbiota could have a direct effect on viral infection enhancing virion liberation or virion adherence to a new host cell or an indirect effect on immune response to viral response to infection activating Toll-like receptors TLR leading to cellular activation of dendritic cells BT lymphocytes and monocytes via interleukin IL secretion.

All three actors of the viral disease need to first be completely characterized microbiome characterization for the environment viral genome to study the pathogen itself and transcriptomic analyses for the host response.
