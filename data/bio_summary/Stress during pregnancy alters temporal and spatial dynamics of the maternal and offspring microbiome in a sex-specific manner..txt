these results show that stress during pregnancy affects bacterial community structure and composition within the vagina suggesting the possibility that these dysbiotic communities are transmitted to offspring during birth.shared overlap between maternal and offspring communities is determined by offspring age.

similarities between mother-offspring microbiota were dependent on maternal body site and age of offspring whereby neonate colonic microbiota resemble the maternal vaginal microbiota immediately following birth and become more similar to the maternal gut microbiota as a function of age.to determine whether maternal stress experience shapes assembly of offspring colonic microbiota commu-nity composition was evaluated in offspring colon samples at birth during active breastfeeding and at weaning.

comparison of maternal and offspring microbiota revealed that similarities in bacterial community composition was predicted by a complex interaction between maternal body niche and offspring age and sex.

while these results show that maternal stress experience impacts microbial community composition and elicits metabolic consequences at birth the lasting consequences of trans- mission of dysbiotic vaginal communities on the assembly of offspring microbial communities remains unclear.therefore to examine the hypothesis that maternal stress experience disrupts gut and vaginal microbialdynamics during critical prenatal and postnatal windows we used a high-resolution sampling strategy cou- pled with 16s rrna marker gene sequencing to examine outcomes in our mouse model of early prenatal stress in which male but not female offspring demonstrate significant neurodevelopmental changes in hypotha- lamic and limbic circuits and in the regulation of stress responsivity cognitive dysfunction and post-pubertal growth.

conversely colonic community structure in pn2 eps offspring was more similar to pn2 eps maternal vaginal samples compared with pn2 control maternal vaginal samples p  0.0046 permutation test 3b.effects of eps on bacterial communities are sex-specific in offspring.

constructing these age-discriminatory models for male and female offspring revealed that while many of the age-discriminatory taxa were shared between male and female offspring their ranked importance in driving sex-specific maturation of the colonic bacteria differed supplemental fig.

to control for potential confounds of the housing and the cage environment in the assessment of eps effects on the microbiota several precautions were taken first in the bacterial community composition assessment in maternal fecal and vaginal samples females were singly housed during the entire duration of the pregnancy and second in the bacterial communities assessment within offspring colonic samples one male and one female offspring were collected at each time point from a different dam such that the sample size correspond to cage number.dna isolation amplification and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene.

the model derived from control maternal and offspring microbiota was then applied to microbiota from stress-exposed mothers and male and female offspring.
