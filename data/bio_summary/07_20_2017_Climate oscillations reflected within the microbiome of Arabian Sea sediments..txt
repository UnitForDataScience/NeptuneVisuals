In line with this the relative abundance of monooxygenases had a significant inverse correlation with preserved marine organic matter Bromine r -0.35 P  0.001 and was thus most abundant during reduced OMZ strength.Anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox bacteria that are present in Arabian Sea sediments under the OMZ were presumably also affected by historical changes in the OMZ strength.

These include continental mid-Cretaceous black shales harboring marine communities lignite-hosted subseafloor microbiomes that resemble soil communities Mediterranean turbidites harboring increased bacterial taxa from soils bacteria in Baltic Sea sediments that reflect variations in paleo-salinity and correlations between the microbial diversity and past depositional conditions in maar lake sediments.

Thus in agreement with earlier studies   our results show that OMZ conditions and denitrification mainly occurred during the warm interstadials which led to the deposition of d15N-enriched and TOC-rich 0.5 sediments while no or weak OMZ during cold stadials resulted in thedeposition of bioturbated TOC-poor sediments.

With some notable exceptions  the abundance of prokaryotes in marine sediments usually decreases an order of magnitude over the top 10 m. However the multiple TOC-rich layers in our core likely bolstered the subsistence of the heterotrophic bacteria and archaea as was previously reported from Pleistocene Mediterranean sapropelsand organic-rich coastal sediments.

The 0.5 mbsf depth suggested by our data is within the 0.4-2 mbsf depth where sulfate reduction predominantly occurs in multiple cores from several nearby locations on the continental margin sediments of the Arabian Sea.

The TOC-rich intervals are separated by TOC-depleted sediments which exhibit signs of bioturbation and were thus deposited under higher bottom water oxygen concentrations and reduced OMZ strength.

The age model used to deter- mine the timing of changes in depositional and environmental conditions is based on the correlation of our XRF- derived bromine Br record a biophilic halogen that binds to allochthonous marine organic matter to the high-resolution TOC record of Schulz et al.and radiocarbon dating of foraminiferal carbonates Tables  .

Rather they correlate with paleoenvironmental conditions namely past OMZ intensities which indicates that a portion 5-15 of the bacterial community in our Arabian Sea sediments have subsisted since burial with weak selection.
