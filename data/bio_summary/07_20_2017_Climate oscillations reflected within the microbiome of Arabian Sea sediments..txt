Deeper in the core Pseudomonas was the major indicator taxon 0-55 total 16S rRNA gene reads per sample for strong OMZ periods together with Alcanivorax 0-11 total 16S rRNA gene reads per sample Fig.

While the bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance did not correlate significantly with sediment depth the archaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance was 5-10 fold higher in the interglacial sediments Fig.

Lourens L.  Reichart G. J. Bromine counts from XRF scanning as an estimate of the marine organic carbon content of sediment cores.

B Relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes percentage of total reads per sample assigned to sulfate reducing bacterial SRB taxa across the 214 samples are shown in the grey shaded area plot and total bacterial 16S rRNA genes as estimated by qPCR are displayed as white circles.

Indeed despite passing through peri- ods with different preservation conditions Synechococcus 16S rRNA gene copy numbers exhibited a significant exponential decline with time r 0.89 P  0.001 and did not correlate with higher TOC values corresponding to periods of increased OMZ strength and OM preservation Fig.

Archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified separately using the Domain-specific primers Arch21F 5'-TTC CGG TTG ATC CYG CC-3'and Arch915r 5'-GTG CTC CCC CGC CAA TTC-3' and then reamplified nested PCR prior to sequencing using the universal primers for the V4 region after Caporaso et al.. 16S rDNA V4-region of the widespread oceanic unicellular pelagic cyano- bacterial genera Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus was amplified from the sedimentary DNA with the universal bacterial primer 806r in combination with a newly developed specific forward primer SynPro525f 5'-CGC GGT AAT ACG GGA GTG-3'.

The lack of a decrease in the overall 16S rRNA gene copies throughout our core suggests that a substantial part of the residing prokar- yotes contain intact DNA and are viable.

No genes diagnostic for sulfate reduction dissimilatory sulfate reductase adenosine phos- phosulfate reductase were found in the metagenomes throughout the entire core presumably because the SRB had a relatively low 1 total 16S rRNA gene sequences abundance Fig.

In line with this the relative abundance of monooxygenases had a significant inverse correlation with preserved marine organic matter Bromine r -0.35 P  0.001 and was thus most abundant during reduced OMZ strength.Anaerobic ammonia oxidizing anammox bacteria that are present in Arabian Sea sediments under the OMZ were presumably also affected by historical changes in the OMZ strength.

Thermograms are normalized such that the area under each curve is equal to unity.deposited under recurring strong OMZ conditions are significantly more similar ANOSIM P  0.001 to one another than those deposited under weak OMZ conditions Fig.
