This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02174666.Am J Clin Nutr 2017106909-20.Keywords isoflavone bone turnover bioavailability probiotics osteopenia postmenopause equol bone densityINTRODUCTIONThe natural decline in endogenous estrogen during meno- pause reduces bone mineral density BMD and incurs negative changes to bone microarchitecture and this increases the risk of osteoporosis and fracture in women 1 2.

Observational data support that cortical denser bone loss has a greater dependency on estrogen deficiency than does trabecular more porous bone loss to test this a 4-y RCT investigated the effects of ET in postmenopausal women assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and found that cortical bone was more responsive to ET than trabecular bone 46.

DXA was used to determine bone mineral content BMC BMD and T score at each site.Biomarkers of bone turnoverMeasurements of biomarkers of bone turnover were performed on freshly thawed aliquots by a single analyst blinded to clinical status.

Differences in bone mineral density bone mineral content and bone areal size in fracturing and non-fracturing women and their interrelationships at the spine and hip.

The use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography in this study would have facilitated a more comprehensive and greater distinction of isoflavone effects on cortical compared with trabecular bone 46.BIOAVAILABLE ISOFLAVONES FOR MENOPAUSE SYMPTOMS919Including other biomarkers of bone turnover would provide a more comprehensive overview of bone-turnover mechanisms particularly sclerostin an ERb-mediated pre-resorptive marker produced by osteocytes and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase from osteoblasts 37-39 60.

Sec- ondarily we determined the effects of RCE on bone turnover markers estrogen metabolites plasma isoflavone concentra- tion equol-producer status plasma lipid concentrations and blood pressure BP.METHODSParticipants and study designThis study was a 12-mo parallel-design placebo-controlled double-blind RCT.

Self-reported exercise and training remained consistent throughout the study and no difference was found between the 2 groups supporting a negligible effect of changes in exercise on bone turnover in this study 54 55.

We also thank laboratory technicians Eva Molgard Jensen and Lene Trudso Department of Clinical Medicine Aarhus University and Lise Pedersen Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology Odense Univer- sity Hospital for performing key analyses.The authors' responsibilities were as follows--MNTL wrote the manu- script and took primary responsibility for the final content PBJ and MNTL were responsible for applying to the ethics committee and for the study funding MNTL PBJ and CBT devised and carried out the clinical aspects of the study undertook data collection performed statistical analyses and interpreted the analyses MNTL and CBT were responsible for equol deter- mination and isoflavone plasma extraction procedures XF and LPC pro- vided facilities for the isoflavone analysis and performed analyses LMR performed the plasma osteoprotegerin analyses SL completed all other bone turnover marker assays in plasma and determined urinary estrogen metabolites PBJ approved the final version of the manuscript and all authors revised read and approved the manuscript.

All participants consented to keep habitual diet and exercise constant for the duration of the study.Eighty-five participants were found to be eligible and were included in the study and these participants were randomized into either the control CON extract group or the RCE treatment group by a computer-generated code simple randomization.

The data from the present study support this assertion because BMD loss at the FN and trochanter was blunted in the RCE group compared with the CON group after12 mo at a higher dosage.
