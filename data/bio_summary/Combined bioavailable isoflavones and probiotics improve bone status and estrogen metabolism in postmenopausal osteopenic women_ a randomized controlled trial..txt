the significant effects on bmc at other sites may have been possible with a higher number of participants 44. the beneficial effects of isoflavone treatments against estrogen-deficient bmd loss but not bmc loss have been documented in previous rcts 45. observational data support that cortical denser bone loss has a greater dependency on estrogen deficiency than does trabecular more porous bone loss to test this a 4-y rct investigated the effects of et in postmenopausal women assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and found that cortical bone was more responsive to et than trabecular bone 46. this may also be the case in the present study where a greater response to isoflavone treatment was found at the fn which is richer in cortical tissue than in the lumbar spine.

the use of high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography in this study would have facilitated a more comprehensive and greater distinction of isoflavone effects on cortical compared with trabecular bone 46.bioavailable isoflavones for menopause symptoms919including other biomarkers of bone turnover would provide a more comprehensive overview of bone-turnover mechanisms particularly sclerostin an erb-mediated pre-resorptive marker produced by osteocytes and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase from osteoblasts 37-39 60. methods determining food intake although comprehensive are subject to bias and only cover a small window of the total duration of the study 9 d. self-report measures in this study are subjective and open to various biases especially recall bias and response bias.

dxa scans found that 12 mo of treatment with rce was more effective at attenuating expected postmenopausal bone resorption at the fn l22l4 region and trochanter than cdm alone figure 3. the bmd loss from baseline to 12 mo was w2-fold lower at the fn in the rce group 20.99 than the con group 22.2 at the l22l4 region the con group lost w3-fold more bmdformed was of a higher density with no significant effect on mineralization.

we have previously demonstrated short-term attenuative effects of a fermented rce 37 mg isoflavone aglyconesd and probiotic treatment on bmd at the l22l4 region in healthy menopausal women 40. the spine comprises mostly trabecular bone and we previously postulated that a longer treatment duration and a higher dose may be required to achieve attenuation of bmd loss in cortical skeletal locations 47. the data from the present study support this assertion because bmd loss at the fn and trochanter was blunted in the rce group compared with the con group after12 mo at a higher dosage.

self-reported exercise and training remained consistent throughout the study and no difference was found between the 2 groups supporting a negligible effect of changes in exercise on bone turnover in this study 54 55. equol is a daidzein a derivative of formononetin metabolite produced by anaerobic bacteria and has greater estro- genic potency than its precursor 42. none of the participants were found to be equol producers at baseline and no participant in the con group became a producer.

an rct of postmenopausal women receiving a higher dose than the present study of 100 mg aglycone equiva- lents glycosidesd for 30 d showed mean plasma isoflavone concentrations of 1251 ngml in contrast in the present study we found .3-fold higher plasma concentrations of isoflavone when given a dose of 57.45 mgd of isoflavones 59. these findings support the important role of isoflavone molecular form and the intestinal microbiome in isoflavone uptake me- tabolism and ultimately therapeutic efficacy.limitationsa study duration of 2 y would incorporate 3 complete bone remodeling cycles this would further strengthen the evi- dence provided by dxa in this trial.

these data suggest that isoflavones exhibit capabilities to encour- age a less carcinogenic estrogen metabolism 23 24. three- day diet diaries found a significant effect of time on calcium 0.001 magnesium 0.001 and protein 0.05. there were no differences detected between groups in any dietary nutrients at any point during the study supporting that dietary nutrient intake differences had minimal influence on the outcomes of the study table 3. to put this into context a change in dietary calcium amounted to a percentile change in the nof- recommended calcium intake of 213.25 for the con group and 211.88 for the rce group.
