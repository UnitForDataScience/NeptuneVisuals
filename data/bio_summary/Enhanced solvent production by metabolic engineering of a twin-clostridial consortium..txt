In the case of the 743B8052 co- culture the consortium of 743BIII8052 produced 15.1 gL of solvents  4.86 gL of ethanol 7.48 gL of butanol and 2.72 gL of acetone from 58.9 gL AECC in 120 h. However 6.16 gL of butyrateand 5.32 gL of total sugars mainly xylose remained within the external medium which effectively reduced the overall potentialFig.

The engineered twin-clostridia consortium was shown to decompose 83.2 gL of AECC and produce 22.1 gL of solvents 4.25 gL acetone 11.5 gL butanol and 6.37 gL ethanol.

At 108 h the CBP consortium produced 22.1 gL solvents 4.25 gL acetone 11.5 gL butanol and 6.37 gL ethanol from 83.2 gL AECC.

The synthetic consortium was shown to decompose 83.2 gL of AECC and produce 22.1 gL of solvents 4.25 gL acetone 11.5 gL butanol and 6.37 gL ethanol.

At 120 h the consortium of 743BIII8052IIIIV produced 17.5 gL of solvents 4.83 gL of ethanol9.52 gL of butanol and 3.19 gL of acetone .

With increasing butyrate accumulation 6.45-9.06 gL at 36 h the amount of butanol produced by the consortia rose from 4.72 to 6.65 gL at 120 h. The correspond- ing increase in butanol yield expressed in terms of the ratio of the butanol produced divided by the amount of AECC consumed - see Material and Methods rose from 0.102 to 0.127.

For example butyrate production module I and butyrate re- assimilation module III sequentially combine towards the production of butanol butanol production arises from both butyrate re-assimila- tion module III and carbon source utilization module IV.Fig.

After 96 h of growth the 743B mutant strain harboring the two modules produced 15.2 gL of butyrate 4.05 gL of ethanol and accumulated8.71 gL of total sugars from 51.6 gL of AECC.
