in the case of the 743b8052 co- culture the consortium of 743biii8052 produced 15.1 gl of solvents  4.86 gl of ethanol 7.48 gl of butanol and 2.72 gl of acetone from 58.9 gl aecc in 120 h. however 6.16 gl of butyrateand 5.32 gl of total sugars mainly xylose remained within the external medium which effectively reduced the overall potentialfig.

with increasing butyrate accumulation 6.45-9.06 gl at 36 h the amount of butanol produced by the consortia rose from 4.72 to 6.65 gl at 120 h. the correspond- ing increase in butanol yield expressed in terms of the ratio of the butanol produced divided by the amount of aecc consumed - see material and methods rose from 0.102 to 0.127. these results indicated that the enhancement of butyrate production indeed im- proved butanol yields.

the engineered twin-clostridia consortium was shown to decompose 83.2 gl of aecc and produce 22.1 gl of solvents 4.25 gl acetone 11.5 gl butanol and 6.37 gl ethanol.

at 108 h the cbp consortium produced 22.1 gl solvents 4.25 gl acetone 11.5 gl butanol and 6.37 gl ethanol from 83.2 gl aecc.

the synthetic consortium was shown to decompose 83.2 gl of aecc and produce 22.1 gl of solvents 4.25 gl acetone 11.5 gl butanol and 6.37 gl ethanol.

at 120 h the consortium of 743biii8052iiiiv produced 17.5 gl of solvents 4.83 gl of ethanol9.52 gl of butanol and 3.19 gl of acetone .

for example butyrate production module i and butyrate re- assimilation module iii sequentially combine towards the production of butanol butanol production arises from both butyrate re-assimila- tion module iii and carbon source utilization module iv.fig.

after 96 h of growth the 743b mutant strain harboring the two modules produced 15.2 gl of butyrate 4.05 gl of ethanol and accumulated8.71 gl of total sugars from 51.6 gl of aecc.

when the 743bdhyd mutants were co-cultured with wild 8052 d butyrate accumulation at 36 h rose slightly from 6.37 to7.31 gl compared to the wild type and butanol production at 120 h increased from 4.63 to 5.92 gl.

compared with the results obtained using a consortiumcomposed of just the wild type strains butanol production in the 743b 8052iii consortium was increased by 20.1 while the levels of butyrate and total sugars in the medium were reduced by 15.9 and 20.0 respectively b d and b. however at the completion of the co-fermentation of the engineered strains there still remained 3.64 gl of butyrate and 5.16 gl of pentose in the external medium.

thus butyrate levels of 13.5 gl were attained which represents a 191 improvement over that produced by wild type .having assessed the effects of the modifications to moduleionbutyrate formation in 743b we next examined the consequences on butanol production in consortium b. there was an obvious positive correlation between butyrate accumulation in fermentation metaphase and the final butanol yields.

total solvent production increased from 6.61 to 12.7 gl a consequence of the in parallel increase in ethanol production.modulesiand ii were assembled in 743b in order to cooperativelyincrease butyrate production rates and thereby butanol synthesis.

the data in b and d are the means and standard deviations of threeenhancement of butanol production by promoting butyrate supply from c. cellulovoransin the design strategy butyrate supply from 743b c. cellulovor- ans to 8052 c. beijerinckii plays a key role in the stepwise butanol production.
