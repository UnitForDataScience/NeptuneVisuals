In contrast AD is a multi-factorial disease with several disease subtypes.

Thus it remains to be determined if a fraction of patients with AD could benefit from psoriasis-based treatments.Figure 1Immune mechanisms of allergic disease and their clinical usage are linked to type 2 immunity immune tolerance hygiene hypothesis early intervention window of opportunity precision medicine T cells and Treg cells B cells and Breg cells Innate lymphoid cells eosinophils biologics and preclinical models.Pre-clinical animal models are used to study the disease pathogenesis and evaluate potential treatment options.

Precision medicine of today repeats after Hippocrates and his followers what we all might have forgotten It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has .References viii Allergy and hypersensitivity Editorial Sokolowska and Akdis ix

As extensively reviewed by Paul and collea- gues  EoE is a type 2 immunity disease developed as an abnormal response to several food-derived or aeroal- lergens with a substantial component of epithelial barrier impairment and dysregulation of epithelial differentia- tion .

Interestingly IgG4-positive plasma cells are present in the inflamed tissue and the disease in experimental settings seems not be exclusively IgE-mediated according to findings based on the experi- mental EoE models and lack of patient's response to anti- IgE therapies .

Psoriasis is a unique example of an inflammatory skin disease in which highly-successful therapy with IL-17 antagonists con- firmed the major role of Type 17 Th17 Tc17 T cells in its pathogenesis with subsequent activation of Th1 and Th22 and neutrophil influx to the epidermis .

It needs to be considered that since human AD is not a homogenous disease and several endotypes and pheno- types occur  more than one pre-clinical model should often be studied to recapitulate the whole spectrum.Immunology of multiple omics in precision personalized medicineIn quest to understand the early pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases their clinical immunological and molecular subtypes as well as their course and response to treatment several modern scientific tools have been applied.

Bigger studies in diverse popula- tions with real hypothesis-free approaches and thought- ful involvement of novel methodology are needed to enable understanding of the disease.
