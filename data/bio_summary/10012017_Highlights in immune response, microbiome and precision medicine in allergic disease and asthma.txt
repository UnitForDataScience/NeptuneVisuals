it needs to be considered that since human ad is not a homogenous disease and several endotypes and pheno- types occur  more than one pre-clinical model should often be studied to recapitulate the whole spectrum.immunology of multiple omics in precision personalized medicinein quest to understand the early pathogenesis of asthma and allergic diseases their clinical immunological and molecular subtypes as well as their course and response to treatment several modern scientific tools have been applied.

thus it remains to be determined if a fraction of patients with ad could benefit from psoriasis-based treatments.figure 1immune mechanisms of allergic disease and their clinical usage are linked to type 2 immunity immune tolerance hygiene hypothesis early intervention window of opportunity precision medicine t cells and treg cells b cells and breg cells innate lymphoid cells eosinophils biologics and preclinical models.pre-clinical animal models are used to study the disease pathogenesis and evaluate potential treatment options.

interestingly histamine-producing bacteria were more abundant in patients with asthma compared to controls as well as they were increased in patients withsevere asthma .

they also led to our deeper understanding of the role of microbiome and other environmental factors innate immunity barriers in the tissues and interplay of innate and adaptive immunity in the development of allergy or immune tolerance in asthma food allergy eosinophilic esophagitis atopic dermatitis as well as in allergen- specific immunotherapy and healthy immune response to allergens.immune tolerance to allergensspecific immune response to allergens is decisive in the development of clinically healthy or allergic states.

among others novel subsets of allergen-specific regulatory and effector t cells detailed phenotype of allergen-specific breg cells interactions between regulatory dcs and t cells as well as a novel role of ilcs in the development of breg cells have been recently described .further on with hygiene hypothesis and immune correlates allergic diseases and asthma have been on the rapid rise worldwide over the last decades which indicates a strong environmental component .

these findings have been eloquently supported in a recent study analysing amish farm children with low prevalence of asthma and allergic sensitization in comparison to hutterite children raised in the industrialised farms who have high rates of both diseases .

supporting these findings house dust extract from amish houses was able to inhibit allergic inflammation in mouse model of allergic airway diseases.

in contrast ad is a multi-factorial disease with several disease subtypes.

precision medicine of today repeats after hippocrates and his followers what we all might have forgotten it is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has .references viii allergy and hypersensitivity editorial sokolowska and akdis ix

interestingly this effect disap- peared in the myd88- and trif-deficient mice indicating a critical role of innate immunity in providing traditional farm-based protection .immunoregulatory role of bioamines secreted by commensal bacteriafarm effect and hygiene hypothesis strongly suggest that microbiota metabolites from bacteria and food-micro- biota interactions influence the susceptibility to allergy and asthma development as well as the course and severity of the diseases and their response to treatment .

ad is often associated with the presence of increased ige and coexists with allergies and asthma.

novel asthma and allergy monitoring approaches may include in the future several - omics techniques such as genomics epige- nomics transcriptomics proteomics metabolomicseditorial sokolowska and akdis viilipidomics microbiome sequencing and detailed expo- some characterisation together with deeper immunophe- notyping of cells of innate immunity and allergen-specific t and b cells .

healthy bee kee- pers who receive multiple bee stings and do not develop allergy and allergen-specific immunotherapy ait of allergic patients represent two relevant human in vivo models to investigate immunological correlates with the clinical immune tolerance.
