This categorization of precision nutrition pillars includes a more in-depth exploration of the challenges that nutrition science must face in next years to evolve in the context of an increasing prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders resulting largely from the wide-scale adoption of unhealthy feeding behaviors in an obesogenic food environment in which it has become increasingly difficult to adhere to healthy dietary patterns.Figure 2.The three levels of precision nutrition according to the International Society of NutrigeneticsNutrigenomics ISNN .In this regard a better understanding of the inter-individual variability in the response to diet has been recently identified by the American Society of Nutrition ASN as one of the six top research priorities to be addressed in nutrition science to face the forthcoming challenges in population health management .

Finally results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed.Keywords precision nutrition nutrigenomics physical activity deep phenotyping metabolomics gut microbiotaPrecision NutritionThe Road to Tailored Dietary AdvicesOne of the ultimate goals of the promising field of precision nutrition is the design of tailored nutritional recommendations to treat or prevent metabolic disorders .

This review was an attempt to stress the most important challenges and issues that nutritional science has to overcome in order to successfully translate basic and clinical knowledge into an effective precision nutrition care.Up to date the PREDIMED study and the Food4Me project could be considered as state-of-the-art trials in the field of precision nutrition and two of the most stimulating wide-scale approaches in this field that will hopefully provide guidance about how precision nutrition could be used to successfully prevent and manage cardiometabolic disorders.

The use of advanced and objective measurements abdominal fat ultrasound triaxial accelerometry combined with traditional and self-reported data FFQ PA represents a strength of this study  and a step forward in precision nutrition.As previously outlined in the Precision nutrition section a similar strategy was carried out by Zeevi et al.

Thus while personalized nutrition based on genes is already being implemented successfully based on numerous research studies such as the ones above mentioned precision nutrition may still lack sufficient evidence for full implementation given its complexity as will be reviewed below.Regarding obesity and metabolic syndrome recent published studies focusing on gene-environment interactions have revealed important insights about the impact of macronutrient intake in the association of genetic markers with metabolic health fat mass accumulation or body composition.

In any case such an innovative prediction algorithm which utilizes clinical nutritional and lifestyle variables as well as microbiome profiles as input parameters exemplifies the great possibilities offered by these sophisticated methods for the further implementation of precision nutrition.According to the International Society of NutrigeneticsNutrigenomics ISNN the future of precision nutrition should be discussed at three levels stratification of conventional nutritional guidelines into population subgroups by age gender and other social determinants individual approaches issued from a deep and refined phenotyping and a genetic-directed nutrition based on rare genetic variants having high penetrance and impact on individuals' response to particular foods  Figure .

Regarding the impact of nutrition on genetic makeup and vice versa the capacity to accurately monitor food and energy intake remains a major challenge in precision nutrition research.A better characterization of dietary habits throughout an intervention study will ultimately increase one's chance of generating clear findings.

These results pointed out the potential modulation of the microbiome through the interaction between diet and genetic makeup as a target to be considered in further precision nutrition studies .Other examples highlighting the relevance of gut microbiota in precision nutrition have reported its role in the relationship between red meat consumption and the development of atherosclerosis and CVD .

On the other hand a substantial part of the task of translating precision nutrition into a widely applicable procedure in nutritional practice remains on private industries by pursuing the development of precision nutrition tools affordable and accessible to the general population.

Thus as highlighted in the position statement of the International Society of NutrigeneticsNutrigenomics  ethical and legal aspects around precision nutrition as well as the built environment and social contexts that influence food consumption have to be considered for a wide and fruitful implementation of this promising concept of modern nutrition into the general population.Acknowledgments J.T.M.
