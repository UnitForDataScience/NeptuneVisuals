a significant interaction was observed between the adherence score to the medas 14-item questionnaire and a grs formed by two snps at the fto and mc4r loci in determining t2d risk pinteraction  0.006. specifically carriers of the rare alleles of these two loci had higher t2d risk when adherence to the mediterranean diet was low but this association disappeared as adherence increased .metabolomic tools such as liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are also being used in the predimed study to characterize walnut or cocoa consumption under free-living conditions  providing a better assessment of dietary exposure to specific nutrients which might be successfully applied in precision nutrition for the assessment of complex dietary patterns.

for instance significant interactions between specific gene variants within the clock  and the cry1  circadian genes with low-fat diet and carbohydrate intake respectively have been identified.in the first study the interaction between snps at the clock locus rs1801260 rs3749474 rs4580704 with a mediterranean diet and a low-fat diet was tested in 897 patients with coronaryheart disease from the coronary diet intervention with olive oil and cardiovascular prevention cordioprev clinical trial clinicaltrials.gov nct00924937.

the use of advanced and objective measurements abdominal fat ultrasound triaxial accelerometry combined with traditional and self-reported data ffq pa represents a strength of this study  and a step forward in precision nutrition.as previously outlined in the precision nutrition section a similar strategy was carried out by zeevi et al.

results from this study revealed that adherence scores to a mediterranean diet were greater among individuals assigned to personalized intervention groups as compared to the control group non-personalized general dietary advice 5.48 - 0.07 vs. 5.20 - 0.05 respectively p  0.002 with the largest differences found when genotype data was included in the analysis of the intervention group 5.63 - 0.10 vs. 5.38 - 0.10 respectively p  0.029. similarly a recent randomized controlled trial illustrated how disclosing genetic information can lead to greater behavioral changes in dietary habits than population-based or general nutritional recommendations .

the limitations of subjective and memory-based dietary assessment methods m-bm such as ffq 24-h dietary recall 24h dietary record dr and dietary history dh have been known for a long time  and continue to be questioned today  with under- or over-reporting not being accounted for in many studies which may lead to biased results in nutritional intervention studies.

as an example results of this study revealed that individuals with high total cholesterol levels were also characterized by higher plasma sphingomyelins and phosphatidylcholine concentrations .as previously mentioned in the dietary habits section objective measurement of the adherence to a dietary pattern remains a major challenge of precision nutrition.

adherence to the intervention was tested in a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial with three dietary interventions mediterranean diet plus virgin or washed olive oil and a control group with habitual diet  where the previously mentioned medas was used to assess individual diet scores .

more examples of gene-diet interactions metabotyping and the mediterranean diet impact on gene expression epigenetic or lipidomic biomarkers emerged from the predimed study are extensively reviewed by fito et al.

this review was an attempt to stress the most important challenges and issues that nutritional science has to overcome in order to successfully translate basic and clinical knowledge into an effective precision nutrition care.up to date the predimed study and the food4me project could be considered as state-of-the-art trials in the field of precision nutrition and two of the most stimulating wide-scale approaches in this field that will hopefully provide guidance about how precision nutrition could be used to successfully prevent and manage cardiometabolic disorders.

this categorization of precision nutrition pillars includes a more in-depth exploration of the challenges that nutrition science must face in next years to evolve in the context of an increasing prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic disorders resulting largely from the wide-scale adoption of unhealthy feeding behaviors in an obesogenic food environment in which it has become increasingly difficult to adhere to healthy dietary patterns.figure 2.the three levels of precision nutrition according to the international society of nutrigeneticsnutrigenomics isnn .in this regard a better understanding of the inter-individual variability in the response to diet has been recently identified by the american society of nutrition asn as one of the six top research priorities to be addressed in nutrition science to face the forthcoming challenges in population health management .

finally results from published studies providing examples of new avenues to successfully implement innovative precision nutrition approaches will be reviewed.keywords precision nutrition nutrigenomics physical activity deep phenotyping metabolomics gut microbiotaprecision nutritionthe road to tailored dietary advicesone of the ultimate goals of the promising field of precision nutrition is the design of tailored nutritional recommendations to treat or prevent metabolic disorders .

the initial results found in the mediterranean population of 728 subjects following a mediterranean diet were further replicated in a north american population of 820 subjects participating in the genetics of lipid lowering drugs and diet network goldn study.these and other findings reviewed by asher  sassone-corsi and oike et al.

in this study a total of 200 men and women from the scapis study swedish cardiopulmonary bioimage study  and aged 50-64 years were recruited and invited to complete a rapid ffq the minimeal-q and a 4-day web-based food record tool the riksmaten method.

another example of the distinctive effect of the mediterranean diet depending on genetic background was found in a recent case-control study with more than 7000 participants with or without t2d issued from the predimed study .

by using this approach researchers are able to unmask dietary changes within a given intervention group and to discriminate participants according to their particular diet trajectories during the study and not only by their assigned intervention groups.
