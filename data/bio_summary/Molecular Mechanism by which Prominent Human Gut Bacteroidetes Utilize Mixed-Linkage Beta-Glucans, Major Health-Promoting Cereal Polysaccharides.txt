outline the molecular mechanism of mlg utilization by bacteroides ovatus and reveal that the majority of surveyed humans possess mlg-utilizing bacteroidetes.introductionthe composition and homeostasis of the human gut microbiota has a profound and intimate connection to various aspects of our physiology health and wellbeing littman and pamer 2011. indeed a multitude of diseases such as type 2 diabetes inflammatory bowel diseases ibds and cancer have been linked to alterations in the population and proportion of microbes in this highly complex and dynamic ecosystem that exists in our large intestine biedermann and rogler 2015 fujimura et al.

2010 kau et al.

2011 schwabe and jobin 2013. the molecular mechanisms by which the microbiota exerts influence on human health are largely unresolved and undoubtedly complex yet may hold the key to personalized medicine through therapeutics that target the gut microbial ecosystem blanton et al.

2012 subramanian et al.

2015.tamura et al.page 3a major factor in shaping the composition and physiology of the gut microbiota is the influx of complex glycans - popularly known as dietary fibre - that evade degradation by the limited set of human genome-encoded glycoside hydrolases hamaker and tuncil 2014 el kaoutari et al.

2012. indeed regular ingestion of plant polysaccharides is integral to maintaining a healthy balance of microbes in our lower gastrointestinal tract de filippo et al.

2010 sonnenburg and sonnenburg 2014. members of the bacteroidetes a dominant phylum in the human gut possess an arsenal of polysaccharide utilization loci pul to target a wide range of complex glycans el kaoutari et al.

2013. analogous to the archetypal bacteroides thetaiotaomicron starch utilization system sus a hallmark of all bacteroidetes puls is the organization of genes clustered around tandem suscsusd homologs encoding a tonb dependent transporter tbdt and a cell-surface glycan-binding protein sgbp respectively martens et al.

2009. additional co-localized and co-regulated sgbps a cohort of enzymes and a transcriptional regulator typically make up a machinery that acts in concert to sense break down and import complex glycans grondin et al.
