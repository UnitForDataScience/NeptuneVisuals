Given the importance of the interaction between the gut-brain axis and gut microbiota under stress we evaluated i the effect of two different weaning methods on the composition of gut microbiota across time and ii how the shifts of gut microbiota composition after weaning affect the host.

A q  0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSWe used a multi-step approach to identify i the effects of the weaning methods on gut microbiota composition and host phenotypic variables across time and ii the dynamics of microbiota gut composition and function after weaning and their association with the host phenotypic variables Figure 2.The Weaning Method Caused No Changes in Host Performance but Conferred Significant Effects on Salivary CortisolBody weight Figure 3A and average daily gain Figure 3B were not affected by the weaning method.

In terms of microbiota composition the UniFrac distance followed by PCoA Figure 4B showed no distinct clustering between samples from the A and the P group which was indicative of--if at all--no detectable differences in microbiota composition between the two weaning methods.

The most conserved microbiota change after weaning was anincrease of the species belonging to Streptococcus in the animals of the A group q  0.05 relative to the P group.Despite the lack of systematic differences in gut microbiota composition in horses subjected to the two different weaning methods we investigated putatively associated functional modifications.

Interestingly anaerobic fungal loads were lower p  0.05 in the A group relative to the P group with more than 0.5 log of difference across all time points during the week following weaning Figure 4E.Gut Microbiota Composition and Functions Shifts Immediately after WeaningIrrespective of the effects of the weaning method on the gut microbiota we next assessed the influence that definitive maternal separation at weaning 0 d exerted on the composition of the gut microbiota of all the 34 foals.

Intriguingly 80 of the individuals from community type 1 at 3 days post-weaning presented higher genetic relatedness as they were siblings Figure S1 so that the abundance of bacteria belonging to community 1 were more similar between genetically similar individuals than genetically distant ones.Linking Genera Directly to Host Phenotypes Rather Than Relying on Unsupervised Gut Community Types at 3 Days Post-weaning Gives Similar ResultsSince discrete gut community types might be less effective to discover associations between an individual's gut function performance and his gut microbiota composition we used Spearman correlation to translate gut microbiota compositionto functionality at the host level at 3 days post-weaning.

Moreover it demonstrates for the first time the contribution of the gut microbiota composition following maternal separation at weaning to horse phenotypes.Maternal separation at weaning immediately shifted the composition of the gut microbiota in all animals revealing fitness differences among species.

environmental and stochastic factors are shaping the gut microbiota community type following weaning.Interestingly microbiota gut composition appears to be specifically associated with different host phenotypes in humans Arumugam et al.

Further experiments are needed to understand whether the alterations of gut microbiota at weaning might affect the neurobiology of stress and endocrine function of the microbiota as suggested by Cryan and Dinan 2012 as well as the host in the long-term.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSNM designed and carried out the bioinformatics and biostatistical analysis wrote the main manuscript text and prepared all the figures.

In the A method mares and foals were never separated prior to weaning 0 d. Different host phenotypes and gut microbiota composition were studied across 6 age strata days -30 0 3 5 7 and 30 after weaning by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
