intriguingly 80 of the individuals from community type 1 at 3 days post-weaning presented higher genetic relatedness as they were siblings figure s1 so that the abundance of bacteria belonging to community 1 were more similar between genetically similar individuals than genetically distant ones.linking genera directly to host phenotypes rather than relying on unsupervised gut community types at 3 days post-weaning gives similar resultssince discrete gut community types might be less effective to discover associations between an individual's gut function performance and his gut microbiota composition we used spearman correlation to translate gut microbiota compositionto functionality at the host level at 3 days post-weaning.

in fact community type 1 was found in 80 ofsuckling foals -30 d and almost disappeared followingweaning while community type 2 only appeared after weaning figure s4.it was not only the most abundant genera that differentiated the gut community types figure 5c rather the community types were identified based on complex configurations of numerous genera that might engage in cooperative metabolism positive interaction or competition captured by the number and magnitude of mutually negative interactions.

on the contrary the telomere length was higher p  0.05 in community type 2 and 3 compared to community 1 at 3 days post-weaning figure s5g.furthermore average daily gain and the number of times going to the concentrate feeder was greater in community type 2 relative to community type 3 especially during the first week after weaning figures s5hi.

given the importance of the interaction between the gut-brain axis and gut microbiota under stress we evaluated i the effect of two different weaning methods on the composition of gut microbiota across time and ii how the shifts of gut microbiota composition after weaning affect the host.

interestingly anaerobic fungal loads were lower p  0.05 in the a group relative to the p group with more than 0.5 log of difference across all time points during the week following weaning figure 4e.gut microbiota composition and functions shifts immediately after weaningirrespective of the effects of the weaning method on the gut microbiota we next assessed the influence that definitive maternal separation at weaning 0 d exerted on the composition of the gut microbiota of all the 34 foals.

this step involved the analysis of the a-diversity and b-diversity across time as well as the analysis to assess gut genera whose relative abundancescontinuedbiosynthesis were significantly underrepresented following maternal separation at weaning figure s3b table s9.the concentration of scfas in feces significantly increased following the definitive maternal separation at weaning figure s3c but not the fecal ph figure s3d.the gut microbiota composition during the first 3 days post-weaning is highly variable between individuals community typeshaving established that the gut microbiota composition and function appeared to be markedly disrupted during the first days post-weaning we subsequently investigated the intra- and inter- individual variation across time for all 34 foals.

environmental and stochastic factors are shaping the gut microbiota community type following weaning.interestingly microbiota gut composition appears to be specifically associated with different host phenotypes in humans arumugam et al.

the non-parametric wilcoxon rank-sum test with benjamini-hochberg multiple test correction was used to compare the chao1 index and the abundance of genera between gut community types in each time point.analysis of the interaction between microbiota composition and host phenotypesin order to find the possible associations between the gut community types and the host phenotypes i.e.

we also observed that animals with lower loads of fungi but higher loads of bacteria and protozoa at 3 days post-weaning were likely to belong to community type 2 p  0.05 figures s5ce table s12.because gut microbiota composition may also play a key role in controlling the physiological and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in the weaning stress response we investigated putative associations between stress indicators telomere length and salivary cortisol levels and the different gut community types.

across all the examined pathways related to the immune system response the rig-i-like receptor-signaling pathway was enriched in community type 2 when compared to the other ones.given the differences of predicted functional capacity between considered gut community types at 3 days post-weaning it is not surprising that five out of the eight scfas measured namely acetate propionate butyrate isovalerate and valerate were significantly higher p  0.05 in the animals belonging to community type 2 than in the other two communities at 3 days post-weaning figures s5ab table s12.
