The supernatant was ana- lyzed by UPLCMS.Ultra-performance liquid chromatographic condition The liquid chromatography was carried out on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC system Waters Corp. Milford MA USA.

The parent and three meta- bolites isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside isorhamnetin and quercetin were detected and identified based on the characteristics of their deprotonated molecules.

The majority of bacteria such as Escherichia sp.

The metabolic pathway and metabolites of iso- rhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidoside by the different human intestinal bacteria were firstly investi- gated.

The recent studies on isorhamnetin-3-O-neohesperidoside show that it has significant biological and pharmacological activities including antioxidant  antiatherogenic  and antimicrobial  ef- fects.

Meanwhile its aglycone isorhamnetin can notably protectc The Author 2016.

The trillions of bacteria housed in our gastro-intestinal tract play an essential role in host homeostasis.

The general anaerobic medium GAM used for all fermentation experi- ments in this study contained gL L-cysteine hydrochloride 0.3 sodium thioglycolate 0.3 beef liver extract powder 1.2 KH2PO4 2.5 beef extract 2.2 soya peptone 3.0 glucose 3.0 NaCl 3.0 yeast extract 5.0 soluble starch 5.0 tryptone 10.0 proteose peptone 10.0 and digestive serum powder 13.5.

The pH was adjusted to 7.3.Preparation of human intestinal bacterial mixtureFresh human fecal samples were collected from a healthy female vol- unteer who had not taken any medicine in 3 months and avoided all drinks and food containing polyphenols in 48 h prior to fecal collec- tion.

The mixture was centrifuged at 2000xg for 10 min and the suspension was used as human intestinal bacterial mixture.
