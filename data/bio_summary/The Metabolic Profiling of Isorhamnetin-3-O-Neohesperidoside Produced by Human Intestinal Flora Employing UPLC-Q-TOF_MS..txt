in this study ultra-performance liquid chromatographyquadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry together with automated data analysis software metabolynxtm was used for analysis of the metabolic profile of isorham- netin-3-o-neohesperidoside by the isolated human intestinal bacteria.

30. the metabolic pathway and metabolites of iso- rhamnetin-3-o-neohesperidoside by the different human intestinal bacteria were firstly investi- gated.

recent researches have shown that cattail pollen mainly contains flavanoid glycosides stigmasterols fatty acids nucleo- sides cerebrosides terpenoids and long chain hydrocarbons  which can inhibit the immune system suppress platelet aggregation induce uterine contractions and treat atherosclerosis as well as stimulate theproliferation of human keratinocytes in vitro  .

profiling of the common proxy for this community the fecal microbiota by 16s ribosomal rna studies and by direct sequencing of genetic material has shown that the human gut microbiota is a complex community of 100 tril- lion archaeal and bacterial cells distributed over more than 1000 spe- cies .

these findings suggest that intestinal microflora may activate the pharmacological effect of herbal foods and medicines for intestinal as well as systemic diseases and must be the catalytic converter for the transformation of herbal components to bioactive compounds .however the metabolic pathway and metabolites of isorhamnetin-3-o-neohesperidoside produced by the different human intestinal bac- teria are not well investigated.

to further clarify the metabolic profile of isorhamnetin-3-o-neohesperidoside fresh human fecal samples were collected from a healthy female volunteer and isolated to different bacterial colonies.

the mixture was centrifuged at 2000xg for 10 min and the suspension was used as human intestinal bacterial mixture.

an aliquot of the bacterial mixture sample was directly applied to the experiment while the remaining sample was preserved by adding 20 glycerol vv as a cryoprotectant  .isolation of human intestinal bacteriathe bacteria mixture was serially diluted in sterile water and each of the dilutions were spread on gam agar plates.

leucine-enkephalin was used as the lock mass to generate an m-h- ion mz 554.2615 at a concentration ofthe metabolic profiling of isorhamnetin-3-o-neohesperidoside produced by human intestinal flora employing uplc-q-tofms245200 pgml and flow rate of 100 lmin to ensure accuracy during the ms analysis via a syringe pump.

more importantly it could be rapidly absorbed and eliminated in rat plasma after oral administration .metabolite m4metabolite m4 showed an uplc profile with a retention at 6.75 min and ms spectrum which gave a m-h- ion at mz 301.0359 figure d. the fragment ions mz 151.0045 and mz 149.0248 were corresponding to the retro-diels alder rda cleavage from m-h- mz 301.0359. the characteristic product ion at mz 273.0419 was formed by the elimination of ch2o from mz 301.0359 then mz 273.0419 lost o to form mz 257.0462table i. retention time rt and fragment ions of isorhamnetin-3-o-neohesperidoside and its metabolites m1-m4 produced by human intestinal bacteria using uplcqtof-ms246du et al.time minfigure 1. uplcms chromatograms of isorhamnetin-3-o-neohesperidoside and its metabolites.
