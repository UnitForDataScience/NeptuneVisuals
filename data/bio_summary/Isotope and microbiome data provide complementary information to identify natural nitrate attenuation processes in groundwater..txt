In all wells gene copy abundance values were similar to those found in other groundwater studies  and lower than those found in other environments characterized by higher concentra- tions of organic carbon such as constructed wetlands estuaries and ag- ricultural soils  .In general 16S rRNA gene correlated positively Spearman's correla-tion p b 0.01 with all functional genes except nirK indicating that the relative abundance of potential denitrifiers remained constant in the studied wells .

Moreover wells with higher nir abundance were negatively correlated to oxygen concentration and pH which agrees with several studies at different environments includ- ing groundwater  .Similarly to what has been observed for qnirS  qnirK the ratioqnirS  qnirKqnosZI  II a proxy of N2O accumulation  was higher in the SW zone wells .

Mean nitrate concentration in the NE zone wells is of23 - 2 mgL and in the SW zone wells of 71 - 7 mgL.

In this paper we investigate the contribution of both approaches to describe denitrification in a con- solidated rock aquifer limestone and marls with a porosity related to fracture networks located in the north- eastern sector of the Osona basin NE Spain.Isotopic methods indicated the origin of nitrate fertilization using manure and that denitrification occurred reaching a reduction of near 25 of the nitrate mass in groundwater.

Mean nitrate values around 70 mgL in the SW zones  are considerably lower than the high nitrate concentrations registered in shallow wells and natural springs   supporting the mentioned dilu- tion process.The d15NNO3 and d18ONO3 isotopic signatures of NO- in groundwaterprovide evidence of denitrification.

This result is particularly interesting from the hydrodynamic per- spective as it distinguishes two distinct nitrate source areas the NE area located in the hills with a lower nitrate input and the SW area lo- cated in the basin with a larger proportion of arable land and therefore a larger manure input that results in higher nitrate concentrations.

Nitrate content in groundwater is easily above the 50 mg NO3L limit for drinking reaching up to 500 mg NO3L in some wells  .

In consequence groundwater samples especially those from the SW zone are constituted by a mixture of regional flow paths intercepted at the deeper parts of the uncased wells and local infiltration from the upper levels.

Both results derived from isotopic and microbial data corroborate the occurrence and extent of denitrification yet they fail to indicate at which locationmoment along the flow path these reactions had taken place.The groundwater microbial community structureIn order to infer the main taxonomical groups responsible for deni- trification in Osona wells microbial communities were studied on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence.
