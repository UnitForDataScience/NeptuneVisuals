mTOR staining was strongest in epithelial cells suggesting they con- tribute most to the activity measured in the mTOR activity assay and differential expression mTOR pathway in the transcriptomics data sets.Systemic cytokines and chemokinesTo investigate whether the mTOR activity induced by the different diets resulted in any changes in systemic immunity we measured a panel of cytokines and chemokines in the serum of mice from each dietary group .

Activation of mTOR pathway plays a key role in shaping and controlling the effector responses of immune cells associated with innate and adaptive immune responses through coupling these events to intracellular meta- bolic status and environmental nutrients .To investigate whether the relative down-regulation of gene transcription associated with mTOR regulated cellular processes in SBM-fed mice was linked to reduced mTOR activity we measured the amount of active phosphorylated mTOR in ileal tissue samples.

As far as we are aware a correlation between mTOR protein expression and mTOR activity has not been previously reported and may be due to an autoregulatory mechanism involving mTOR activation.As the effects of the SBM diet on mTOR and immunity pathways in the ileal mucosal might be influenced by cross-talk with the microbiota we analyzed the effects of diet on the ilealImmunohistochemistry of PFA-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections with anti-mTOR antibody in ileal tissue of mice fed with different experimental diets.

This suggest that levels of mTOR protein expression correlate with mTOR activity and that protein expression may be increased following activation of mTOR possibly via an auto- regulatory mechanism.

2017 Dietary protein sources differentially affect microbiota mTOR activity and transcription of mTOR signaling pathways in the small intestine.

The impact of diet on mTOR signaling in the intestine is not fully understood not only with regard to the effector pathways but also with respect to mTOR sensing of novel nutritional and microbial metabolites.To gain further insights into the effect of different conventional and unconventional dietary protein sources on intestinal energy levels in vivo we performed a transcriptomics analysis and measured mTORC1 protein in tissue.

The proportions of several other families were also affected by the various diets Figsand.Protein source influences mTORC1 activity and amount of mTOR protein in ileum tissueEndogenous levels of phosphorylated mTOR in cells derived from ileal tissue of mice fed with SBM diet the most common source of animal protein was lowest among all the dietary treat- ments.

In comparison to the other protein sources 14 hub genes in gene networks associated with antigen presentation mTOR signaling and TGFa expression were down-regulated in the mice on the SBM diet.Functionally these genes are of particular relevance to mTOR pathway which has a role in cel- lular differentiation and proliferation of epithelial cells as well as T cells B cells and antigen presenting cells in the intestinal lamina propria .
