animalis VKL and B. animalis VKB separately and in various compositions on the level of serum cholesterol gut microbiota contents and liver morphology on a high-calorie- induced obesity model in BALBc mice.Materials and methods We used for the study female BALBc mice 6-8 weeks old 18-24 g. Experimental animals were fed by a fat-enriched diet FED and 8 experimental groups were formed 12 mice in each group to test strains of probiotic bacteria L. delbrueckii subsp.

casei IMV B-7280 the weight of obese mice decreased and cholesterol and its fraction levels in se- rum were reduced.

and coliform bacteria increased the number of staphylococci and streptococci reduced and the number of microscopic fungi significantly decreased in the gut of obese mice after treatment with L. casei IMV B-7280L.

animalis VKB or probiotic compositions we observed re- duction of the mesenteric fat size after injection of all these probiotic bacteria separately and probiotic compositions.

The number of probiotic strains demonstrated ability to de- crease cholesterol level in vivo however it was poorly con- firmed in a clinical setting.

In the blood serum of the obese mice the level of cholesterol was estimated.
