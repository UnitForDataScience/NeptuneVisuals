These results suggest that skin microbiome alterations after UVB treatment could be related to treatment and treatment response.Key words psoriasis microbiome UVB treatment.

After treatment lesional skin had significantly higher levels of Actinomyces FDR p  0.05 and lower levels of Paracoccus FDR p  0.05 compared with non-lesional skin.Effect of nbUVB treatmentnbUVB treatment led to an increase in the relative abun- dance of the genus Clostridium and a decrease in the relative abundance of the genus Pseudomonas in both le- sional FDR p  0.01 and FDR p  0.001 and non-lesional skin FDR p  0.05 and FDR p  0.001 and an increase in the relative abundance of the genus Megasphaera in non-lesional skin FDR p  0.05.p  0.05 and no correlation between target PSI and Shan- non diversity index after treatment R  -0.09 and p  0.05.A 10.9B 1Cyanobacteria 0.9Distribution of the bacterial microbiome of the skinThe majority of the bacteria fall into 3 dominating phyla Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria Fig.

We chose to relate our data to target PSI since the treatment response and microbiome correlation in the target lesion is clinically more relevant than comparing with whole-skin PASI and we chose achieving  75 improvement in PSI in the target lesion as the definition of treatment respon- ders since PASI75 is an established definition of treatment response.

If differences in the skin microbiota between responders and non-responders to specific treatment can be confirmed in larger studies this could be used in the future to individualize treatment of psoriatic patients leading to better treatment results.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis study was supported by grants from the Swedish Psoriasis Foundation and from Futurum The Academy of Healthcare County Council of Jonkoping Sweden.

However so far nothing is known about the effect of nbUVB treatment on the skin microbiome in patients with psoriasis.The aim of this study is to analyse differences in the microbiome between lesional and non-lesional skin in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and to investigate changes in the microbiome in these patients after nbUVB treatment.

Furthermore this study was designed to in- vestigate to what extent responding to nbUVB treatment altered the skin microbiome.METHODSStudy subjectsA total of 30 patients with plaque type psoriasis with indication for nbUVB treatment were enrolled in this prospective study.

The patients were treated with nbUVB according to clinic protocol and after completing the treatment new samples were taken from the same areas as before treatment and PASI and target lesion PSI was assessed again.

When a previous treatment resulted in erythema no treatment was given the next day or the dose was decreased depending on whether the erythema was asymptomatic or severe and painful.Table I.

The mean -SD PASI before treatment was 8.0 - 4.5 and after treatment 2.1 - 1.8.

Mean -SD target PSI before treatment was 5.2 - 1.4 and after treatment 1.1 -1.4.
