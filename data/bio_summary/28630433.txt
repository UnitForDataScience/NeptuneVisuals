Liver transplantation LT resolves the associated problems in patients with liver failure or portal hypertension following LT the liver function of patients gradually returns to normal and portal hypertension-related gastrointestinal diseases can be alleviated.Currently no study has reported on the differences in the intestinal microbiota of patients who received LT as measured using 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA sequencing technology.

The increased amino acid metabo- lism in patients after LT indicates that the level of intestinal nutrients is increased and the digestive and absorptive functions of the intestinal tract are improved in these patients .Liver function gradually improves and portal venous pressure is relieved in recipients after LT. Our study indicates that fecal microbial communities were significantly altered following LT and that the gut microbi- ota composition of LT recipients was more similar to that of healthy controls after the LT surgery.

We found that the gut microbiota of patients with severe liver disease who were awaiting LT was significantly different from that of healthy controls as represented by the first principal component p 0.0066.Additionally the second principal component represented a significant difference in the gut microbiota of patients between pre-LT and post-LT surgery p 0.03125.

The results of our PCoA based on OTU composition showed that the gut microbiota of patients with severe liver disease who were awaiting LT surgery was significantly different from that of control subjects however there was no significant difference in the gut microbiota between post-LT and control samples.

The results of a principal component analysis PCoA weighted unifrac distance based on OTU composition showed that the gut microbiota of patients with severe liver disease who were awaiting LT surgery pre-LT were significantly different from that of control patients which corresponded to the first principal component PC1 p  0.0066.

The pur- pose of this study was to analyze the differences in the intestinal microflora of patients between pre-LT and post-LT to investigate the effect of LT therapy and subsequent immunosuppressive treatment on the intestinal microflora thereby providing experimental data further revealing the mechanism by which liver diseases alter the gut microbiota.MethodsStudy population.

Lu et al.analyzed the variation in the microbiome during the perioperative period in LT patients by performing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE and their results showed that the diversity in predominant intestinal microbes decreased substantially in patients who experienced infection during the perioperative period.Using MiSeq-PE250 sequencing technology combined with bioinformatics analysis we studied the characteristics of the intestinal microbiota from patients with end-stage liver disease before and after they received LT.

Notably the amount type and composition of intestinal microflora can have both direct and indirect effects on the physiological function of the liver and can impact the occurrence and development of liver diseases  .In patients with end-stage liver disease liver cells show degeneration necrosis and other pathological changes that damage the normal liver structure ultimately leading to cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

This research includes studies on the association of gut micro- biota alterations with liver diseases such as obesity-related liver disease non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  autoimmune liver disease and liver cirrhosis .

No significant differences in microbial richness observed species Chao1 and ICE indices or diversity shannon simpson and invsimpson indices were found between any of the three cohorts pre-LT patients post-LT patients and healthy controls p  0.05 Table .Changes to gut microbiota composition in recipients of LT surgery.
