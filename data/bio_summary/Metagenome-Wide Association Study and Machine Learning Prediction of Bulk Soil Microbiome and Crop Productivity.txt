MWAS was performed to find significant associations between taxa and crop productivity using Wilcoxon rank sum test after filtering taxa with raw abundance below 12 counts across 12 soil samples from MG-RAST Karlsson et al.

The results of CCA vector fitting indicated crop productivity is the major factor and explained 16 of taxa variance while water pH explained 8DISCUSSIONCrop productivity is a quantitative trait determined by a variety of factors Van Roekel et al.

Moreover an important biotic feature is the genetics of the crop variety the genotype which includes the genetics of the photosynthesis and productivity performance Dhanapal et al.

Bacteria in the Bradyrhizodium genus are well known for their symbiosis roles with legumes to fix nitrogen and benefit crop productivity Duran et al.

The interactions between soybean and different Bradyrhizodium strains on crop productivity were shown to be significant Zimmer et al.

Nonetheless because soil microbiome could be far more complicated and diverse than human microbiome limited sequencing depth to detect rare taxa and the reproducibility under the challenge of highly varied environmental factors will be the technical bottlenecks.productivity areas similar to the abundance of Ascomycota Planctomycetales and Streptophyta Table 2 which gives an intuition that Actinomycetales may be detrimental to crop health some studies reported co-inoculation benefits of Actinomycetes with Bradyrhizodium japonicum that promoted soybean growth Soe et al.

Association of shifting populations in the root zone microbiome of millet with enhanced crop productivity in the Sahel Dhanapal A. P. Ray J. D. Singh S. K. Hoyos-Villegas V. Smith J. R. Purcell L. C. et al.

Ourexperimental design ensured each pair of two areas in the same agronomic field with no known difference in environmental conditions such as rainfall received the same management by the farmers with identical crop genetic variety and agricultural applications such as fertilization at each of the six locations in Illinois and because there were known differences in diseases or pests reported in the sampling season between the two areas we hypothesized that bulk soils with some unevenly distributed abiotic or biotic factors might be a cause of crop productivity difference.Twenty-six soil characteristics were quantified in the soil samples however none of these displayed significant correlations to crop productivity.

We demonstrated the merit of MWAS and machine learning for the first time in a plant-microbiome study.Keywords machine learning metagenome-wide association study microbiome nitrogen fixation productivity random forest rhizobium soybeansINTRODUCTIONThe soil microbiome has been a great interest for its potentials in improving plant nutrient utilization and suppressing soil-borne diseases Muller et al.

While abiotic soil characteristics such as pH soil types and trace elements can strongly influence a microbiome composition Xu et al.
