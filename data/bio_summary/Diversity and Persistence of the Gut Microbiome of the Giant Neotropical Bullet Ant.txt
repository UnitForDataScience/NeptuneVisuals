Only a single bacterial taxon in the Firmicutes is consistently present across individuals indicating a remarkably simple core bacterial community for the giant Neotropical bullet ant.

Five of eleven wild Costa Rican guts had Rhizobiales present at least at a low level and five of eight diet manipulated Costa Rican guts hadRhizobiales present.Role of geography on structuring host gut bacterial diversityThe principal coordinates analysis PCoA of all wild caught P. clavata bacterial communities shows that there is no clustering based on geography or colony for either guts or mouths .

There were 396 OTUs found in wild mouths from Costa Rica and 115 found in guts and only 66 shared between the two organs suggesting that there is likely some amount of filtering that occurs between the mouth and gut.Role of diet in structuring bacterial diversityTo investigate the influence of diet on host bacterial community structure we included samples from wild caught colonies of the giant Neotropical bullet ant and conspecifics from some of the same colonies after keeping on a diet of sucrose water in the laboratory.The distribution of read counts for guts and mouths differed substantially.

To begin to address this question we investigate the diversity and persistence of the bacterial community of the giant Neotropical bullet ant Paraponera clavata.

To understand how the digestive tract can filter bacterial communities we sampled mouth and gut communities.

Geography did not explain host bacterial diversity but we did find significant reductions in diversity between the mouth and the gut tract.

For example high-throughput se- quencing technologies are providing critical insights into the diversity and role of microbial communities for human health and disease   frequency of horizontally ac- quired bacterial genes in eukaryotic genomes   and the unintended impact antibiotics may have on human health  .These tools are providing insights into the diver- sity of associations that are present across the tree of life including among the insects   .

Understanding core those that are present in all or the majority of individuals bacterial communities from the digestive tract may be one of the most fundamental questions we can address through comparing samples from across aAdvance Access publication June 23 2017c The Author 2017.

Although not much work has been done to document the microbial community associated with this species a previous study by screened 23 individuals of P. clavata from nine colonies from Peru for three putative parasitic bacterial lineages Wolbachia Spiroplasma and Asaia and found no individuals infected with Wolbachia two individuals from two colonies infected with Spiroplasma and one individ- ual from one colony infected with Asaia.

These two studies together suggest that the diversity of bacteria from P. clavata is not well un- derstood and for those bacteria that have been screened it is not clear if they are persistent stable members of the microbiota of this species.In this study we investigate the diversity and per- sistence of the bacterial community of the digestive tract of the giant Neotropical bullet ant.
