the microbiota composition and metabolic activity have been shown to participate in the regulation of digestion nutrient transport satiety and host metabolism 14. therefore food structure may impact host digestive physiology and metabolism notably through regulation of the gut microbiota.recently we have designed two lipid-protein matrices of identical composition but with one being finely emulsified liquid fine emulsion lfe while the other one was coarsely emulsified and heated for gelation gelled coarse emulsion gce resulting in two matrices differing both in microstruc- ture fat droplet diameter ratio gce  lfe  26.5 soluble vs crosslinked proteins and macroscopic properties liquid or gelled 15. in vitro the initial rate of both proteolysis and lipolysis are slower for gce than for lfe related to the gel state of gce while the extent of lipolysis is higher in lferelated to the fat droplets small size and the extent of prote- olysis is higher in gce related to the denaturation of protein during heat treatment 15. in this context the objective of the present study was to evaluate in rats the effect of lfe or gce consumption on the gut microbiota composition and activity nutrient sensing and transport food intake and metabolism.materials and methodslipid-protein matrices preparationlfe and gce were prepared as previously described 15. both matrices had identical composition 10 wt  rapeseed oil lesieur and 15 wt  whey proteins isolate prolacta 95 lactalis.
