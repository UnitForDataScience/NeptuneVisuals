municiphila C and is associated to higher -diversity of the cecum mucus-associated bacteria D. In parallel cecum content was augmented in the LFE as well as the isovalerate total content and the total urease and cystein desulfhydrase activities E. LFE diet also increased glucagon expression in the cecum together with an elevated level of GLP-1 in portal plasma F. No modifications of food intake or of body weight gain were observed between the two diets G.A striking result of the present study is the decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in the cecum of rats fed the LFE diet when compared to rats fed the GCE diet.

In vitro the initial rate of both proteolysis and lipolysis are slower for GCE than for LFE related to the gel state of GCE while the extent of lipolysis is higher in LFErelated to the fat droplets small size and the extent of prote- olysis is higher in GCE related to the denaturation of protein during heat treatment 15.

Differ- ences with p-values  0.05 were considered as statistically significant.ResultsEmulsion structure modifies the microbiota in the ileum cecum and cecum mucusTo address the effects of emulsion structure on the micro- biota in the distal gastro-intestinal tract we first investigated the effects of the LFE and GCE diets on the ileum bacte- rial population Fig.

Therefore food structure may impact host digestive physiology and metabolism notably through regulation of the gut microbiota.Recently we have designed two lipid-protein matrices of identical composition but with one being finely emulsified liquid fine emulsion LFE while the other one was coarsely emulsified and heated for gelation gelled coarse emulsion GCE resulting in two matrices differing both in microstruc- ture fat droplet diameter ratio GCE  LFE  26.5 soluble vs crosslinked proteins and macroscopic properties liquid or gelled 15.

In this context the objective of the present study was to evaluate in rats the effect of LFE or GCE consumption on the gut microbiota composition and activity nutrient sensing and transport food intake and metabolism.Materials and methodsLipid-protein matrices preparationLFE and GCE were prepared as previously described 15.
