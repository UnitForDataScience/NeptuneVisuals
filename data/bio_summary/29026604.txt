After treatment fecal SCFAs and pH were unchanged in each group data not presented.The effect of TGD treatment on bowel movementsTo investigate the effect of TGD treatment on bowel movements bowel movements before and after treatment were analyzed.

Transglucosidase treatment significantly improved bowel movements compared with placebo treatment 46.2 95 con- fidence interval 19.2-74.9 vs. 0 95 confidence interval 0-33.6 p  0.05.

BMD includes BMs-C BMs-D and BMs-M.Before the treatment the study participants answered the following 'Do you think you have a con- stipation yes no' After the 12-week treatment the changes in bowel movement were subjectively assessed by the patients patient-reported outcome.

Considering the bowel movements before TGD treat- ment bowel movement was significantly improved in the BMD group after treatment compared with placebo treatment 46.2 95 CI 14.7-94.7 vs. 0 95CI 0-33.3 p  0.05 Figure 4.

Fecal bacterial communities and short-chain fatty acids were analyzed before and after the treatment.Results Transglucosidase treatment significantly p  0.05 affected fecal microbiota Prevotella spp.

Transglucosidase treatment alleviates bowel movement disorder symptoms in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients by increasing fecal acetate level.KeywordsTransglucosidase type 2 diabetes mellitus bowel movements intestinal microbiota constipation short-chain fatty acidsReceived 25 November 2016 accepted 8 January 2017IntroductionWe have recently developed a novel strategy employing Aspergillus niger transglucosidase TGD to produce oligosaccharides from starch in the human digestive tract.

This strategy aimed to decrease postprandial blood glucose levels in individuals with impaired glu- cose tolerance and at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM.1 Furthermore we demon- strated that TGD administration decreases glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c and insulin levels in T2DM patients.2 We subsequently proposed that the TGD treatment decreases blood glucose levels and prevents1Department of Gastroenterology Aichi Medical University School of Medicine Nagakute Japan2Department of Health and Nutrition Faculty of Health and Human LifeNagoya Bunri University Inazawa Japan3Department of Frontier Research Amano Enzyme Inc.

Email body weight gain in T2DM patients by inducing the production of oligosaccharides in the alimentary tract and modulating the composition of gut microbiota.3 We reported that TGD treatment is safe because of a lack of serious adverse events in the treatments.4-6Intestinal enteropathy which can cause diarrhea andor constipation is one of the major gastrointestinal complications in T2DM patients.

Patients took two capsules after every meal for 12 weeks and fecal and blood sampling was performed prior to and at the end of the study.Using simple randomization technique the patients were randomized into three groups 111 proportion according to treatment.
