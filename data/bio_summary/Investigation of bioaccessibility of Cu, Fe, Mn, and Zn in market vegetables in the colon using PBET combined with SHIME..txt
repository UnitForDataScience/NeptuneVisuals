Unfortunately regarding market vegetables there have been no data about the bioaccessibility of Cu Fe Mn and Zn in the colon phase.In this study the PBET method gastric and small intestinal phases combined with SHIME colon phase was used to thoroughly evaluate the oral bioaccessibility of Cu Fe Mn and Zn in the market vegetables of the Beijing city proper China.

To our knowledge this was the first ever report of the bioaccessibility of Cu Fe Mn and Zn in the market vegetables in the colon which suggested that the previous in vitro studies without simulating the colon phase could have overestimated the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of Cu while underestimated those of Fe Mn and Zn.

found Fe and Zn bioaccessibility were 23.6 and 39.2 in lettuce and 52.9 and 36.8 in cole.Following the transition from the small intestinal to the colon phase Cu bioaccessibility declined for mostof the vegetable samples whereas the bioaccessibility of Fe Mn and Zn showed an increase paired-samples T test p  0.05.

In the colon phase Cu bioaccessibility significantly declined while the bioaccessibility of Fe Mn and Zn slightly increased which could mainly be attributed to the gut microbiota inhabiting the colon.

Pan et al.found higher EDI of Cu 2.8 mg kg-1 d-1 from the vegetables grown in contaminated soils.Regarding the daily reference intake DRI for nutrition recommendations the average contributions of consuming 100 g of a fresh vegetable to meet DRI were 5.7 for Cu 4.5 for Fe 3.7 for Mn and 2.3 for Zn respectively.

A significant decline in Cu bioaccessibility 1.8-63.7 and slight increases in the bioaccessibility of Fe 16.7-56.4 Mn 21.2-71.6 and Zn 15.7-69.7 were revealed which could mainly be attributed to the effect of colon microbiota.

The oral bioaccessibility of Cu Fe Mn and Zn in fresh vegetables was investigated using PBET gastric and small intestinal phases combined with SHIME colon phase with the detailed procedures described by Fu et al.and Yin et al..
