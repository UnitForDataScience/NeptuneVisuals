zeevi et alfound large interpersonal differences in postprandial glyce- mic responses to dietary components in an elegant study of 800 participants.

a diet high in protein and fat in the long-term has been associated with enrichment of bacteroides whereas a carbohydrate-rich diet has been associated with prevotella.sonnen- burg et alreported that a western diet low in microbiota accessible carbohydrates leads to decreased diversity in the microbiota of human- ized mice which are largely reversible within a single generation but over several generations this leads to a progressive loss of diversity that cannot be recovered by diet alone and needs replacement of the microbiota.

in the study by zeevi et almentioned previously introduction of meals associated with low postprandial glucose response led to an increase in bacteria thought to be protective against type 2 diabetes mellitus such as roseburia inulinivorans eubacterium eligens and bacteroides vulgatus.
