dietary components present in a normal diet may contribute to prevention of allergies asthma rhinitis dermatitis atopy and food allergies promote the development of allergies food processing food allergy and more specialized foods can be used for the management or even the treatment of food allergy.maternal diet breastfeeding and infant nutrition  allergythe first 1000 days of life are crucial in the growth and development of infants.

the prevalence of food allergy is even lower when double blind placebo controlled food challenges dbpcfc are performed but only a limited number of studies have used this method to confirm the diagnosis of food allergy .nutrients 2017 9 762 doiit is clear that the development of ige mediated allergic diseases is influenced by many factors including genetic and environmental factors such as pollution and farming and also by nutrition.

heat processing induces maillard reactions gluing carbohydrates to food proteins which as a result become more immunogenic and probably also allergenic thus promoting the development of ige responses to food allergens.at present no identified antibody characteristics and no identified structural features of ige binding epitopes seem to be associated with the phenotype of the food allergic disease.

in addition linear epitopes have been suggested to potentially be biomarkers for a persistent form of food allergy .food allergy early introduction and immunotherapyeven though nutritional guidelines for food allergy and treatment of food allergies are not the scope in this special issue several developments deserve attention and will be mentioned briefly below.

despite relevant advances in the knowledge of food allergy during the last decades gaps in this area are evident especially in relation to introduction of allergenic foods and in relation to application of food immunotherapy.as the prevalence of food allergies in many countries continues to rise the question remains as to when to introduce specific allergenic solid foods in infants.

the intent of these guidelines is to prevent replacing breastfeeding with lower energy and nutrient dense foods certainly in malnourished communities beyond 6 months of age thereby inducing consequential malnutrition .however recent studies indicate that early introduction of food allergens into the diet of young children as well as the early introduction of diverse foods may actually prevent food allergy - suggesting that immune tolerance can be readily induced to food allergens in early life.

nevertheless some infants are sensitized to food allergens before any known ingestion of solid foods and future research needs to focus on strategies to prevent early-life food allergen sensitization prior to complementary feeding .the results from the learning early about peanut allergy leap study  have led to consensus statements from international pediatric allergy and dermatology societies encouraging and recommending the early introduction of peanut butter cooked egg dairy and wheat products to infants at even high risk of developing food allergy.

studies based on oral food challenges indicate that the prevalence of food allergy amongst preschool children is currently between 5 and 10 in some western countries e.g.

the prevalence of food allergy now ranges between 3 and 35 in self-reported studies being lower 2-5 when assessing for sensitization and symptoms to food.

in addition food can also be used as a tool to actively prevent via timing of introduction manage hydrolyzed formula or even treat immunotherapy food allergy figure .the purpose of this special issue of nutrients on nutrition and allergic diseases is to provide an overview of how nutrition can modify allergies.

these food components as well as the effects of food processing are also addressed in the papers by hosseini et al.

food allergy is an ige-mediated reaction to a food usually during the 2 h following its intake.it represents a health problem that can lead to life-threatening reactions and can even impair quality of life.

any food can potentially trigger an allergic response in fact more than 170 foods have been identified as being potentially allergenic but the vast majority of the clinically diagnosed food allergies are caused by only a few of these foods.

however besides effectiveness safety should also be considered when introducing potential allergens into the diet .finally for people who have already developed food allergies much has been done on the development of new immunotherapies for food allergy.

oral immunotherapy epicutaneous immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy for food allergy are increasingly being studied and some innovative approaches have been suggested such as modification of relevant food allergens to make them less allergenic while maintaining their immunogenicity or combining other non-specific treatments e.g.
