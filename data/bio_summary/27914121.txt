2016 explore the role of a physiochemical param- eter that has been largely ignored in mammalian gut microbiology - oxidationreduction redox potential.

now highlights however that diet-induced changes in redox potential may be an important parameter shaping the gut microbiome and that even in healthy animals differ- ences in oxidative stress defenses could determine the20 D. Berrysuccess of members of the microbiota.

Moving forward it will be interesting to explore to what extent differential sensitivity to redox potential shapes the gut microbiome of healthy humans and other animals.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF P27831-B28 and P26127-B20 and the Vienna Science and Technology Fund WWTF LS12-001.ReferencesDanielH.MoghaddasGholamiA.BerryD.

Therefore the reduced redox levels in the non-grain diet may give sen- sitive Methanomicrobium species an opportunity to bloom and outcompete other methanogens.In the gut microbiology field resistance to oxidative stress has been mostly studied in the context of intesti- nal inflammation and survival near the mucosal tissue where micro-oxic conditions can exist Winter et al.

A high fat diet can increase the abundance of oxidative stress response proteins in the mouse gut microbiome Daniel et al.

The study demonstrates the tremendous power of combining meta-omics approaches with comparative genomics and cultivation- based physiological experiments to achieve mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping the gut micro- biome.
