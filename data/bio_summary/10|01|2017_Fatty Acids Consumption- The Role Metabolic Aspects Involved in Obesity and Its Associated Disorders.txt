A high-MUFA diet also showed an improvement in insulin resistance when compared to a high-SFA diet in mice with significantly lower fasting glucose and insulin concentrations and attenuated insulin secretion in response to glucose challenge.

The data showed that a diet rich in SFA exerted a hyperlipidemic effect only on the 30th day but a long-term diet displayed beneficial effects on hyperlipidemia Table   which could be a consequence of the decrease in apolipoprotein synthesis and the formation of VLDL in the liver .SFA and n-6 PUFA showed a negative effect on TC HDL and TAG levels which increased in relation to the groups that received flaxseed oil including alfa-linolenic fatty acid ALA and SFO a combination of sesame and flaxseed oil n-3 and n-6 PUFA in wistar rats after 65 days of treatment with a standard diet poor in lipid sources at 7 fat .
