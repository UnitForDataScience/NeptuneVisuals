Abiotic stresses have the potential to restrict the growth of crop plants considerably therefore leading to significant yield losses and posing a potential threat to global food security  .Environmental stresses are detrimental to the growth of plants.

The stimulation of plant growth and nutrient acquisition by beneficial rhizobacteria has been correlated to the biosynthesis of plant growth regulators including auxins     gibberellins    cytokinins   and ABA  .

Based on important studies on the negative effect of abiotic stresses on plant growth regulators we have also presented some potential traits of microbial phytohormones that can be used to increase plant growth and tolerance to stress factors.
