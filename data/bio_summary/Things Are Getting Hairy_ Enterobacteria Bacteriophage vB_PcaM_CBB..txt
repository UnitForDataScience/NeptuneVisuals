terminal globular structures.transmembrane analysis it was possible to predict the possible role for 162 of these proteins see supplementary s3 table s1 with several others being categorized as hypothetical proteins47 conserved hypothetical proteins 291 putative lipoproteins 4 and putative membrane proteins 7 or conserved putative membrane proteins 43. no integrase excisionase or repressorgenes were detected in the genome which suggests that this phage follows an exclusively lytic lifestyle.it is understood that virulent phages can overcome codon utilization differences from their hosts by using encoded trnas a feature often observed in large genomes mesyanzhinov et al.

these shared proteins likely represent the core genome of the rak2-like phages given thatthey appear to be resistant to sequence deviation and horizontal gene exchange due to their importance for successful phage infection.it has been reported that the rak2-like phages possess a number of proteins that are homologous to those found within the superfamily of t4-like phages simolu-nas et al.

in addition these phages also possess a large number of proteins that have not been identified in other t4-like phages as illustrated with total protein comparison of the rak2-like phages to those of phage t4 and kvp40.with the sequence annotation and morphological data currently available for these phages it is justifiable thatthey would form their own genus rak2virus without any question and indeed the proposal of placing them within a new subfamily has very strong merit as suggested by abbasifar et al.

2014. total protein comparisons of phages cbb gap32 pebec04 rak2 with phage t4 nc000866and phage kvp40 nc005083.2 show that they share 41 homologous proteins with t4 14.75 of the total proteins of t4 and 46 homologous proteins with kvp40 12.07 of the total proteins of kvp40 at blastp cut value of 75. however despite this correlation to the tevenvirinae subfamily it is clear that the vast differences suggest these phages should be grouped separately.

however these two phages also possess their own phage-encoded groes-like proteins that can mimic bacterial host groes proteins keppel et al.

due to the lack of sequence identity the lack of an even distribution of homologs among their genomes with the t4-like phages and the possession of their own species-specific proteins it has been proposed that these phages should be placed within a new subfamily abbasifar et al.

the result suggests that the rak2-like phages are highly distinct from t4-like phages for which sequence data is available in the public databases see figure 4. the major capsid protein has also been used to conduct similar phylogenetic studies within the t4-like phages comeau and krisch 2008. a similar phylogenetic study was done with the major capsid protein of cbb cbb257 which also suggested the same conclusion to that obtained with the portal vertex protein see supplementary s2 figure s1.transcriptionwithin the genome of cbb eighteen rpod-like promoters were predicted with a consensus sequence preceded by an up- like element estrem et al.

cbb also has other dna-replication proteins that have no counterpart to phage t4 such as primase-helicase cbb291 and gyrase subunit cbb324.like the other rak2-like phages cbb has orfs coding for a number of enzymes apparently involved in nucleotidemetabolism including the aerobic class i nrda-nrdb cbb303305 and anaerobic class iii nrdd-nrdg cbb141 145 ribonucleotide reductase rnr enzymes for the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides dwivedi et al.

of these three proteins only cbb238 and cbb240 have been confirmed as structural proteins in the rak2-like phages.structural proteins of cbb and other rak2-like phagesto identify gene products involved in the maturation and structure of the capsid of cbb an in silico approach was first undertaken to identify homologs of the proteins with known functions.

1998 hendrix 2002. the order caudovirales the tailed phages make up the greatest majority of the phages types that have been studied and within this order are the phage families of myoviridae siphovirdae and podoviridae ackermann 2001. myoviridae have the most sophisticated virion design possessing a tail capable of contracting on infection and generally having the largest genomes when compared to the other families hatfull 2008. however only a small number of the known myoviridae phages have genomes greater than 200 kbp and these are often referred to as giant or jumbo phages hendrix 2009. the largest of these isolated to date are bacillus megaterium phage g 498 kbp accession no.

2001. possible functions of predicted proteins were predicted with blastp   pfam   finn et al.

detection of proteins with possible transmembrane domains and the lipoprotein cleavage signal was explored with tmhmm v.2  and lipop v.1  respectively kall et al.

these proteins range in function from dna replication repair and recombination auxiliary metabolism gene expression and phage morphogenesis petrov et al.

this motif resembles that of the t4 late promoter sequence namely tataaata geiduschek and kassavetis 2010.apart from the above-mentioned promoters 74 potential rho factor independent terminators were identified in the cbb genome supplementary s2 table s8.dna replication dna modification and nucleotide metabolismthere are eight proteins which form the t4 dna replisome these being dna polymerase gp43 clamp loaders gp44 gp62 and gp45 single strand dna binding protein gp32 primase gp61 helicase gp41 and loading protein gp59 nelson et al.
