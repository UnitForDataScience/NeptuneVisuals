Total protein comparisons of phages CBB GAP32 PEBEC04 RAK2 with phage T4 NC000866and phage KVP40 NC005083.2 show that they share 41 homologous proteins with T4 14.75 of the total proteins of T4 and 46 homologous proteins with KVP40 12.07 of the total proteins of KVP40 at BLASTP cut value of 75.

CBB like theCBB257Precursor of major head subunit2168.06other Rak2-like phages possesses a number of homologous core proteins found in T4-like phages a number of which play crucialCBB260Putative tail fiber protein1124.04CBB270Structural protein1291.32CBB271Structural protein956.40CBB276Structural protein821.70CBB286Structural protein429.70CBB292Structural protein110.90CBB294Structural protein433.10CBB298Structural protein1035.81CBB299Structural protein220.00CBB320Structural protein437.20Continuedfunctions suggesting that these proteins have not been acquired by horizontal gene transfer as seen with some phages Petrov et al.

In the genome of CBB it was also possible to identify 12 ORFs specifying putative homologs of these quasicore proteins see Supplementary S2 Table S2.To further investigate the relationship between CBB and the other Rak2-like phages and the T4-like phages the amino acid sequence of portal vertex protein CBB252 of CBB was used to construct a phylogenetic tree using the top BLASTP hits against CBB252 see Supplementary S2 Table S3.

These shared proteins likely represent the core genome of the Rak2-like phages given thatthey appear to be resistant to sequence deviation and horizontal gene exchange due to their importance for successful phage infection.It has been reported that the Rak2-like phages possess a number of proteins that are homologous to those found within the superfamily of T4-like phages Simolu-nas et al.

In addition these phages also possess a large number of proteins that have not been identified in other T4-like phages as illustrated with total protein comparison of the Rak2-like phages to those of phage T4 and KVP40.With the sequence annotation and morphological data currently available for these phages it is justifiable thatthey would form their own genus Rak2virus without any question and indeed the proposal of placing them within a new subfamily has very strong merit as suggested by Abbasifar et al.

Of these three proteins only CBB238 and CBB240 have been confirmed as structural proteins in the Rak2-like phages.Structural Proteins of CBB and Other Rak2-Like PhagesTo identify gene products involved in the maturation and structure of the capsid of CBB an in silico approach was first undertaken to identify homologs of the proteins with known functions.

terminal globular structures.transmembrane analysis it was possible to predict the possible role for 162 of these proteins see Supplementary S3 Table S1 with several others being categorized as hypothetical proteins47 conserved hypothetical proteins 291 putative lipoproteins 4 and putative membrane proteins 7 or conserved putative membrane proteins 43.

Examination of the CBB genome revealed that it has ORFs for proteins that appear to be homologs to these core proteins with 21 being identified with functions involved in DNA replication and recombination auxiliary metabolism as well as phage morphogenesis proteins with homology to those of T4 and KVP40 reference strains for T4likevirus and Schizot4virus respectively.

However it is still possible that a number of other structural proteins of CBB may not have been detected in the mass spectrometry assaysTABLE 4  Details of the proteins identified from ES-MSMS conducted on capsid proteins of phage CBB.TABLE 4  Continued ORFPredicted functionNumber ofSequenceORFPredicted functionNumber of unique peptidesSequence coverage unique peptidescoverage CBB29Structural protein829.55CBB38Structural protein956.61CBB322Structural protein3043.57CBB334Structural protein740.00CBB494Structural protein15.81CBB104ATP-dependent Clp14.51CBB496Structural protein417.50CBB224Structural protein2247.80CBB225Structural protein1668.54conducted for this article.

There are six structural proteins CBB144 247 536 537 551 and 552 that have been identified by mass spectrometry whosegenes are not present on GAP32 genome and four of these occur in a small 10 kbp cluster CBB534-553.One of the unusual features found with phage CBB when compared to GAP32 was a number of proteins containing Kelch-like domains for which there were no obvious homologs present in the other Rak2-like phages.
