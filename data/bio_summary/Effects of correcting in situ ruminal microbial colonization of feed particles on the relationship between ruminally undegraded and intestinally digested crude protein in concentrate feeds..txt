however only the use of corrected values may provide an accurate evaluation.c 2017 society of chemical industrykeywords protein ruminal degradability intestinal digestibility microbial contamination sheepintroductionthe feed protein evaluation in most current rationing systems for ruminants considers the supply of ruminally degraded and undegraded protein the synthesis of microbial protein in the rumen and the intestinal digestion of the post-ruminal flow of protein.

for dietary protein the rate and extent of ruminal degra- dation are major determinants not only of protein flow but also its composition and therefore its intestinal digestion.12 in situ methods are suitable for performing systematic measurements of ruminal and intestinal digestion of multiple feeds therefore the results obtained and especially those of ruminal degradability are used in numerous feed rationing systems such as nrc3 inra4 dveoeb5 and norfor.6 however these methods may present some accuracy problems such as the colonization of ruminal undigested residues with adherent microorganisms which will be largely digested during the intestinal incubations.

as the digestion site rumen or small intestine affects the quantity of feed protein absorbed as amino acids it is impor- tant to correct for ruminal microbial colonization in both rumen and intestine to obtain accurate evaluations of protein digestion.

based on the previously indicated inter-relationship between ruminal degradation characteristics and intestinal digestion the present study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between the contents of intestinally digested crude protein idp and ruminally non-degraded protein rup of concentrate feeds and to evaluate the effects of correcting the microbial colonization taking place in the rumen with respect to this relationship.

for this purpose the rumen was manually emptied and a representative sample of 1.2 kg was subjected to a dou- ble centrifugation procedure as described by rodriguez et al.11 degradation kinetics of dm were fitted to the single exponential model of orskov and mcdonald12 except in some feeds that needed specific models corn gluten feed which showed two con- secutive single exponential curves2 and dehydrated sugar beet pulp which showed a sigmoid evolution.13 estimates of rup were established by generating in each wether a composite sample representative of the feed by-pass based on the function describ- ing the feed rumen outflow developed by arroyo and gonzalez14 considering kc and kp particle transit rates and dm degradation kinetics.

as ruminal microorganisms that are adhered to feed particles are largely digested in the intestine21315 the overestimation of the ied of rup is not only defined by the magnitude of the ruminal colo- nization but mainly by the difference between the true intestinal digestibility of nitrogenous compounds from microorganisms and the truly undegraded feed fraction.215 thus the overestimation of ied as a result of the ruminal microbial contamination in the sample set of table 2 ranged from 0.7 to 43.7 being inversely proportional to noncorrected ied values as shown by the correla- tion coefficient between these parameters - 0.883. in addition it should be considered that any increase in ruminal degradation of a feed simultaneously increases the proportion of indigestible com- ponents in its post-ruminal outflow and thus causes a reduction in its true intestinal digestibility.

the close relationship found between the contents of intestinal digested cp and ruminal undegraded cp which is not affected by this microbial colonization allows a simpler evaluation of feed protein.acknowledgementsthis work was supported by the cicyt-funded project agl 2006-08300.referencesgonzalez j sanchez l and alvir mr estimation of intestinal digestibil- ity of undegraded sunflower meal protein from nylon bag measure- ments.

as a consequence of the extended degradation with the increase of the considered rumen residence time the use of kc is associated not only with a reduction of the estimates of the by-pass fraction but also with a higher microbial colonization and enrichment in indigestible compounds of this by-pass which also affect ied estimates.215 both microbial noncor- rected and corrected values of ied were lower than the predictionsof the inra4 and nrc3 systems for protein intestinal digestibil- ity with the exception of the distillers' dried grains with solubles ddgs of wheat values for ddgs of barley are not available in the literature and of palm kernel.

nevertheless these systems omit the microbial colonization correction as well as kc and as previously discussed this results in an overestimation of the intestinal digestibility.the lack of effect of the ruminal microbial colonization on the regression between idp and rup despite the large variation of the resulting overestimation of idp values from 5.33 in wheat distillers dried grains with solubles to 75.4 in rye grain can be attributed to the large intestinal digestion of the cp of adher- ent microorganisms.

the high determination coefficient r2  0.960 found for this prediction shows that values for protein rationing such as idp may be predicted from rup simplifying the feed protein value determination that can be limited to the ruminal degrada- tion studies.

thus values of the microbial fraction in rup as well as its associated overestimations were low in feeds rich in cp distillers dried grains with solubles or rapeseed meal or in fibre bound-n palm kernel whereas they were high in feeds with quickly degradable proteins rye and wheat grains orfigure 1. relationship in ten concentrates and by-products between the intestinal digested protein idp and the ruminal undegraded protein rup.

current colonization results of rup are in agreement with the indications of rodriguez and gonzalez21 who established that adherent microbial biomass is directly determined by the feed content in slowly degradable frac- tions such as corn-vitreous starch or fibre specially cellulose and inversely affected by the feed contents in undegradable compo- nents and lignin.

microbial corrected and noncorrected data may be used together for this prediction improving its accuracy.conclusionsruminal and intestinal in situ digestion studies should consider ruminal microbial colonization to avoid errors regarding the diges- tion site when considering accurate protein evaluations of feed- stuffs.
