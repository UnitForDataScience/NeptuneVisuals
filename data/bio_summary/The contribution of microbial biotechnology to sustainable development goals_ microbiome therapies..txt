lbps are concep- tually similar to probiotics hill et al.

for a review of lbp definitions and regulatory con- siderations see a recent review o'toole et al.

for example patients with ibd have a gut microbiome char- acterized by depletion or over-abundance of specific taxa compared to healthy controlspascal et al.

2017. based on observations that clostridia group iv and xiva species in particular are less abundant in patients with ibd manichanh et al.

2006 one such organism fae- calibacterium prausnitzii is being investigated as a candi- date lbp for ibd following up on promising findings in pre-clinical colitis models sokol et al.

lbps may also be useful for restoring a normal micro- biome interaction network in diseases characterized by an altered microbiota like ibs jeffery et al.

's olle 2013 o'toole et al.

single lbps being considered in development or under evalu- ation include blautia hydrogenotrophica for ibs eubacterium hallii for metabolic disease udayappan et al.

2016 lacto- bacillus reuteri for type 2 diabetes mobini et al.

2017 and bacteroides fragilis for autism abdollahi-roodsaz et al.

for example c3j therapeutics is developing therapeutics that prevent colonization of the oral cavity by oral pathogens while favouring the colonization by microbes associated with oral health in a different approach second genome is using analysis of microbiota alterations and host cellular transcriptional responses in patients with ibd to identify targets and small molecules to treat ibd abdollahi- roodsaz et al.

in contrast to testing small molecules through well- established production practices and trial designs taking lbps through the same process is more difficult because of the technological features of the organisms reviewed in o'toole et al.
