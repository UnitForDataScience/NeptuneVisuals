We are just at the very beginning to under- stand this.Sibylle C. Vonesch Allan Jones and Lars M. Steinmetz For us the biggest open challenges lie in data accessibility and data integration.

This would in turn make it easier to compare data collected in different labo- ratories or clinics.Integration of more than two data types e.g.

Given the explosion of possible data capture possible in people we envision growing interest in develop- ment of systems-level analyses that multi-omic datasets together with clinical data such as imaging and physiological measures of organ function for clinical use as personalized biomarkers.Marcus B. Noyes and Jef D. Boeke Ongoing technologic explosion in omics and associated computation will change how we do science.

Systems genetics therefore of- fers a different perspective into human disease processes compared to reduc- tionist approaches such as genome- wide association studies.Aldons J. Lusis Systems genetics data provide a resource that experimental sci- entists particularly those studying com- mon diseases can use to help guide their research identify new research targets or formulate new hypotheses.

Systems ge- netics data can be compared to results from a screen of cells with an shRNA li- brary or a chemical compound library except that the perturbations are natural genetic and environmental variations.Michael Boutros Systems genetics to date relied in many cases on simple or- ganisms that can be easily studied.

But there is of course also much knowledge in fields beyond genetic model organisms such as clinical genetics where phenotyp- ing is very important and more genome- and phenome-scale data becomes avail- able.

I would also expect that in the future we will see more collaborations between experimental scientists data scientists and clinicians.Nitin S. Baliga Solutions to a number of complex problems including in health- care renewable energy and environ- mental sustainability hinges on our ability to understand how genetic informationCell Systems 4 January 25 2017 a 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc. 7manifests in complex phenotypes--be it in how nutrients are cycled by microbial interactions in the ocean how differentiation and developmental pro- grams unfold to generate the body plan of a metazoan how pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis hide away from our immune system or how nutrient starvation causes algae to arrest growth and accumulate lipids.While a similar generalizable systems genetics approach will be necessary to study spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular and molecular interactions among different components of each of these sys- tems the specific technologies computa- tional methodologies and experimental testing frameworks will be vastly different and require a large multi-disciplinary team effort.

Thus re- searchers from many fields should be thinking about how to bring their own high quality data to the table for integrative analyses especially for biomedical appli- cations.

For example tissues from large deeply phenotyped individuals in epide- miological and clinical studies will be a great source for high quality data and col- laborations among basic and clinical research teams will be essential to fully realize the opportunities to learn from sys- tems biology approaches.Aime' e M. Dudley and Joseph H. Nadeau Biomedical researchers have traditionally sought to understand and improve human health by asking ''what went wrong'' in individuals with disease.

Systems genetics an- alyses are generally limited to the formula- tion of hypotheses and while the data can be a valuable resource for future studies most strong papers include some level of experimental validation.Michael Boutros A strong systems genetics paper should include genome- scale analysis preferably looking at many phenotypes and under many dif- ferent conditions or environments.
