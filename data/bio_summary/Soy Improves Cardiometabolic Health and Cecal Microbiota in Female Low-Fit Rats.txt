throughout the study ovx rats gained more p  0.05 weight than shm rats and soy-fed rats gained less p  0.05 weight than controls fig.

soy-fed rats had greater p  0.05 total cecum weight including cecal tissue and contents than controls 4.72 - 0.14 vs. 3.76 - 0.15. total white adipose tissue weight sum of pgat rpat omental and sqat fat pads was higher p  0.05 in the ovx than shm groups but soy-fed rats had lower p  0.05 total white adipose tissue weight compared to controls fig.

the initial mean bw of rats was not different among treatment groups data not shown but ovx rats had a greater p  0.05 final bw when compared to shm rats after 28 wk of feeding table .

rats fed a soy-rich diet had a lower p  0.05 relative abundance of firmicutes but higher p  0.05 relative abundance of bacteroidetes supplementary table  resulting in a lower p  0.001 firmicutes bacteroidetes ratio compared to those fed control diet fig.

alpha diversity measures suggested that the soy diet led to lower p  0.05 species richness than the control diet observed otus at the 97 level 430 - 44.1 compared with 471 - 22.0 soy diet compared with control diet p  0.01 chao 1 index 476 - 43.9 compared with 519.7 - 18.9 p  0.01 phylogenetic diversity whole tree matrix 29.3 - 1.89 compared with 30.7 - 1.23 p  0.05 fig.

similarly ovx rats gained more p  0.05 fat mass than shm rats.

ovx rats had greater p  0.05 fasting ldl-c concentrations than shm rats whereas hdl-c concentrations were not affected by diet or surgery interventions.

ipgtt glucose area under the curve auc revealed that ovx rats were less p  0.05 glucose tolerant than shm rats fig.

the matsuda index of insulin sensitivity calculated utilizing glucose and insulin concentrations obtained from ipgtt confirmed that ovx rats had lower p  0.05 insulin sensitivity than shm further soy-fed ovx rats experienced an improvement in ovx-associated in insu- lin sensitivity i.e.

in terms of white adipose tissue distribution visceral pgat and rpat and sqat fat pads were greater p  0.05 in the ovx rats than shm whereas soy reduced p  0.05 all fat pad weights fig.

data are least-squares means -sem n 8-10. denotes main surgery effect ovx vs. shm p  0.05 denotes trends in surgery effect p  0.1 denotes main diet effect control vs. soy p  0.05.steatosis but this effect only existed at a high dose of 500 mgkg diet.

we aimed to determine the impact of soy on cardiometabolic health adipose tissue inflammation and the cecal microbiota in ovariectomized ovx rats bred for low-running capacity lcr a model that has been previously shown to mimic human menopause compared to sham-operated shm intact control lcr rats.

soy-fed rats gained less p  0.05 fat mass than controls whereas lean mass was not different among treatment groups fig.

bat weight was lower p  0.05 in rats fed soy than those fed the control diet fig.

ovx had elevated p  0.05 liver triglycer- ide concentrations compared to shm rats and soy consumption did not significantly lower liver triglyceride con- tent in either group fig.
