Alpha diversity measures suggested that the soy diet led to lower P  0.05 species richness than the control diet observed OTUs at the 97 level 430 - 44.1 compared with 471 - 22.0 soy diet compared with control diet P  0.01 Chao 1 index 476 - 43.9 compared with 519.7 - 18.9 P  0.01 phylogenetic diversity whole tree matrix 29.3 - 1.89 compared with 30.7 - 1.23 P  0.05 Fig.

Rats fed a soy-rich diet had a lower P  0.05 relative abundance of Firmicutes but higher P  0.05 relative abundance of Bacteroidetes Supplementary Table  resulting in a lower P  0.001 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes ratio compared to those fed control diet Fig.

Throughout the study OVX rats gained more P  0.05 weight than SHM rats and soy-fed rats gained less P  0.05 weight than controls Fig.

Total white adipose tissue weight sum of PGAT RPAT omental and SQAT fat pads was higher P  0.05 in the OVX than SHM groups but soy-fed rats had lower P  0.05 total white adipose tissue weight compared to controls Fig.

In terms of white adipose tissue distribution visceral PGAT and RPAT and SQAT fat pads were greater P  0.05 in the OVX rats than SHM whereas soy reduced P  0.05 all fat pad weights Fig.

Glucose did tend to increase following OVX and decrease following soy consumption but these differences did not approach statistical significance P  0.2 and P  0.37 respectively.

In BAT OVX increased P  0.05 expression of UCP1 and lowered P  0.05 expression of IL-13.Soy decreases aortic stiffness but does not affect endothelium-dependent and independ- ent relaxation responses.

Aortic pulse wave velocity PWV a marker of arterial stiffness was lowered P  0.05 with soy feeding P  0.05 but not significantly affected by OVX Fig.
