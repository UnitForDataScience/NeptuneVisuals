Alpha diversity measures suggested that the soy diet led to lower P  0.05 species richness than the control diet observed OTUs at the 97 level 430 - 44.1 compared with 471 - 22.0 soy diet compared with control diet P  0.01 Chao 1 index 476 - 43.9 compared with 519.7 - 18.9 P  0.01 phylogenetic diversity whole tree matrix 29.3 - 1.89 compared with 30.7 - 1.23 P  0.05 Fig.

Phytoestrogen was not detected in the control soy-free diet whereas soy- rich diet contained 585 mgkg diet of total phytoestrogen.Soy consumption lowered weight gain and adiposity and increased cecal weight without affecting food intake.

The Matsuda Index of insulin sensitivity calculated utilizing glucose and insulin concentrations obtained from IPGTT confirmed that OVX rats had lower P  0.05 insulin sensitivity than SHM further soy-fed OVX rats experienced an improvement in OVX-associated in insu- lin sensitivity i.e.

Forty 27-wk-old LCR female rats generation 32 were either ovariectomized OVX or sham operated SHM and ad libitum fed either soy-rich soy or soy-free control diets for 28 wk in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement n 10group 1 OVXsoy 2 SHMsoy 3 OVX control 4 SHMcontrol.

Greater P  0.05 adipocyte hypertrophy was observed with OVX but was not affected by diet Fig.

OVX rats had greater P  0.05 fasting LDL-c concentrations than SHM rats whereas HDL-c concentrations were not affected by diet or surgery interventions.

Body weight and fasting blood parameters of ovariectomized OVX vs. sham-operated SHM rats bred for low-running capacity fed either a soy-rich Soy or soy-free diet Control.

Similar to beta-diversity species richness did not differ between OVX and SHM groups.Microbial taxonomic shifts due to ovariectomy and soy-rich diet.

OVX led to greater body weight gain a fat b and white adipose tissue mass d while rats fed soy diet gained less body weight fat and white adipose tissue mass.
