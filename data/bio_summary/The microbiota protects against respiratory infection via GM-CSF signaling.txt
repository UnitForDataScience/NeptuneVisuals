a-c IL-17A levels in lung tissue 12 h post-inoculation with K. pneumoniae a and S. pneumoniae b c. For microbiota transfer mice were intranasally inoculated with 10 mL of upper respiratory tract lavage fluid and orally inoculated with 200 mL of fecal suspension 72 h prior to S. pneumoniae infection.

f g. Furthermore intranasal administration of recombinant IL-17A to antibiotic-treated mice rescued defects in respiratory GM-CSF production during infection with either K. pneumoniae or S. pneumoniae Fig.

To do this we orally inoculated either consortium into antibiotic- treated mice prior to infection with S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae.

To test the role of GM-CSF mice were administered a GM-CSF- neutralizing antibody concomitant with S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae infection.

Studies using germ-free mice and mice given multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics have demonstrated that the microbiota as a whole protects against respiratory and systemic infection.

Antibiotic-treated mice given rGM-CSF showed significantly greater survival during bacterial lung infection compared to antibiotic-treated mice given vehicle control Fig.

Statistical comparisons were by Mann-Whitney a b d-g or by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Sidak's or Dunnett's test c h and j P  0.05 P  0.01 P  0.001 and NS not significantof non-antibiotic-treated mice into antibiotic-treated mice res- cued this defect in IL-17A production during lung infection Fig.

In mice treated with isotype control antibody there were still significant defects in GM-CSF production during lung infection of mice treated with antibiotics Fig.

l. Antibiotic-treated mice also suffered increased mortality during infection confirming the importance of the microbiota for protection against respiratory infection Fig.

To examine the role of IL-17A in regulating lung GM- CSF production during infection mice were treated with an IL- 17A-neutralizing antibody 3 days prior to and concomitant with lung infection.
