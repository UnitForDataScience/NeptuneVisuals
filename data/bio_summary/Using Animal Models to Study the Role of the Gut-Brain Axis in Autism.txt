The rate of constipation in the CHD8 cohort 15 children was higher when compared to children diagnosed with ASD but negative for the CHD8 mutation  suggesting involvement of the CHD8 gene in GI dysfunction.To determine the effects of mutating CHD8 on GI function Bernier and colleagues assessed dose-dependent effects of CHD8 mutations using a knockdown approach in zebrafish.

observed that the intestine length in mutant mice was reduced and intestinal transit in 9-week- old mice tended to be slower .Relevant to observations in rodent and zebrafish models mutations in the CHD8 equivalent homologous gene in dro- sophila kismet result in displaced expression of the hedgehog hh gene and alter the development of the central drosophila wing region .

Specifically the fre- quency velocity and contraction length of colonic migrating motility complexes CMMCs spontaneous coordinated con- tractile activity which propagates from the oral to the anal region of the colon  were reduced in mutant mice.Following examination of the small intestinal histological structure in these mice a reduction in villus height and crypt depth in SERT G56A mice was identified.

These findings were a catalyst for further phenotypic analysis in mice lacking CHD8 in order to advance the understanding of disease mechanisms.Fig.

and touchscreen tests    which provide a robust method to assess cognitive abilities that are clinically relevantRecently Katayama and colleagues examined mice hetero- zygous for mutations in CHD8 .

In contrast CHD8 heterozygous het mice are viable and show increased anxiety abnormal sensorimotor arousal and gating as tested by prepulse inhibi- tion paradigms altered social interaction in some parameters and increased brain weight .

CHD8 het mice had neurodevelopmental delay as identified using mouse brain gene set enrichment analysis and suppression of many neuro- nal genes via the RE-1 silencing transcription REST factor.

Somewhat surprisingly learning and memory tests did not show major differences in CHD8 het mice compared with controls.

In contrast another group found that social behaviour in CHD8 het mice was unchanged compared to wild-type littermates .

A neuroligin-3 mutation implicated in autism increases inhibitory synaptic transmission in mice.
