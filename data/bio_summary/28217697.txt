However several findings do indicate a possible association between urinary stones and bacteria including the high rate of urinary tract infections UTI in urinary stone patients and multiple case series of culture-positive urinary stones including stones composed of CaOx or CaPhos.

The association between bacteria and urinary stonesDNA in urinary stones studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to comprehensively characterize the bacteria typically present in urinary stones.Pyelonephritis and CaOx nephropathy potentiate each otherWhereas 16S rRNA gene sequencing and EQUC consistently detected the presence of bacteria in the limited number of urinary stones that we analyzed it is not known whether the association between bacteria and USD is causal disease modifying or merely coincidental.

These isolates can then be identified more precisely down to the species and even strain level and most importantly can be used to study biological relevance.Bacteria can be sequenced from urinary stonesIn 2015 we published a microbial study of five kidney stones along with both upper tract urine and bladder urine obtained during the stone removal procedures 31.

One in ten individuals will experience a urinary stone yet the mechanisms responsible for urinary stones remain largely unknown.

For example in a retrospective review of 1325 adults admitted for USD to a Swedish hospital over a 7-year period 28 had a positive standard urine culture 24.Bacteria can be cultured from urinary stonesIn addition to the aforementioned association between culture-positive urine and USD bacteria can be cultured from the stones themselves.

Since the EQUC-positive stones were the largest 15 mm it is possible that stones of a certain size are needed to obtain enough biomass for a positive EQUC result 31.From each individual the bacteria detected by sequencing were often similar in the stone and urine samples but the relative proportions differed.

Bacteria have long been recognized to contribute to struvite urinary stones however the role of bacteria in the development of the more common calcium oxalate CaOx and calcium phosphate CaPhos stones has not been extensively investigated.

Important future directions will include I sequencing a larger number of stones to determine if the bacteria present are consistent between stone composition and other covariates such as sex and age and II devising model systems to test mechanistic overlap between USD and the bacteria isolated from urinary stones.AcknowledgementsJohn Ketz's review of the manuscript is acknowledged.
