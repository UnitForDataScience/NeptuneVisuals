burgdorferi antibody in the guts of ds gfp or ds pixr RNA microinjected pathogen-free nymphs after repletion on B. burgdorferi-infected mice g Borrelia flaB levels in guts and h Visualization of B. burgdorferi burden by immunofluorescence using anti-B.

The guts were slit open longitudinally with a fine razor blade so as to expose the luminal side of the gut and processed as for TEM but after dehydrating guts were dried in Leica 300 critical point dryer glued to aluminum stubs and sputter coated with 15 nm of gold before visualization in a FEI ESEM using 5-10 kV at a working distance of 12 mm.Comparably infected mice three micegroup were challenged with approximately 10 pathogen-free dspixr or dsgfp-injected.

The Plasmid was lin- earized to generate sense and antisense RNA by in vitro transcription using T7 or SP6 polymerase with the Hi Scribe RNA synthesis kit New England Biolabs and Digoxigenin-11-UTP Roche according to the manufacturer's instructions.Nymphal ticks fed for 48 h were dissected in MEMFA 1M MOPS 20 mM EGTA 10 mM MgSO4 38 Formaldehyde fixed for one hour dehydrated in 100 methanol and used to assess presence of bacterial RNA in guts by whole-mount in situ hybridization using Digoxigenin-labeled sense or antisense essentially as described for Xenopus embryos.

The significance of the dif- ference between the mean values of the control and experimental groups in quantitative polymerase chain assays was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U- test and in all biofilm assays statistical significance was assessed using the ordinary one-way analysis of variance ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test using Prism 6.0 software GraphPad Software USA.

Total RNA was isolated from pools of 5 larvae and B. burgdorferi burden assessed byqRT-PCR as described earlier.To assess transmission at least 4 B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs were placed on each PIXR-immunized or Ova-immunized mouse and 5 mice used in each group and ticks were allowed to feed to engorgement weighed and guts and salivary glands SG dissected for mRNA isolation and B. burgdorferi flaB transcripts assessed by qRT-PCR as described above.

Decreased numbers of B. burgdorferi in the gut lumen and a more diffuse peritrophic matrix PM in the rPIXR-immunized or ds pixr-injected guts compared to the dense PM in the Ovalbumin-immunized or ds gfp injected guts.

The current study also suggests that changes in the gut micro- biome impact B. burgdorferi gene expression and raises the pos-sibility that tick gut microbiota and their metabolites might serveas additional cues that signal changes in the spirochete tran- scriptome during spirochete colonization of the tick gut.ResultsSubtractive hybridization of I. scapularis guts.
