The genome structure of strain CBA7126 was compared to those of B. licheniformis B4164 LQYQ00000000.1 B. licheniformis VTM3R78 FOFE00000000.1 B. licheniformis V30 LQRR00000000.1 Bacillus sp.

The genome of strain CBA7126 was aligned with more than 97 symmetric identity with those of strains B. licheniformis B4164 B. licheniformis VTM3R78 B. licheniformis V30 Bacillus sp.

The purity and concentration of the extracted genomic DNA were measured using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer NanoDrop Technologies UK.Genome Sequencing Assembly and AnnotationThe genome of B. licheniformis CBA7126 was sequenced using a 20-kb SMRTbell library and PacBio RS II system Pacific Biosciences USA and de novo assembly was performed using the HGAP2 protocol in PacBio SMRT Analysis version 2.3.0. rRNAs and tRNAs were analyzed using RNAmmer 1.2 Lagesen et al.

The genome of strain CBA7126 was closest to that of B. licheniformis VTM3R78 99.99 orthoANI followed by B. licheniformis B4164 99.98 Bacillus sp.

H15-1 CP018249.1 and B. licheniformis B4124 LKPQ00000000.1 having symmetric identity 97 with strain CBA7126 using the alignment program MAUVE Darling et al.

A total of 193 CAZyme- encoding genes were annotated using dbCAN including five for auxiliary activities AAs 39 for carbohydrate-binding modules CBMs 36 for carbohydrate esterases CEs 68 for glycoside hydrolases GHs 39 for glycosyl transferases GTs and 6 for polysaccharide lyases PLs.Comparative Genomic DataAnalysis of the orthoANI values among Bacillus genome sequences with symmetric identity of 97 revealed that B. licheniformis CBA7126 has higher than 99 genome sequence similarity with other species.

2004.The annotated genome sequence of B. licheniformis has been previously analyzed to assess the biotechnological importance of the organism Veith et al.

licheniformis NVH1023 F5520 CCUG41412 NVH1111 NVH1113 LMG17661 and M3.Stress Response Genes and Resistance to Toxic CompoundsComparison with NCBI PGAP 4.1 showed that the genome of strain CBA7126 harbors several stress response genes and various genes required for resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds Tatusova et al.

The structure of strain CBA7126 was similar to that of B. licheniformis B4124 and B. licheniformis V30 Supplementary Figure 3.

In this study genome sequencing of B. licheniformis CBA7126 isolated from a human fecal sample was performed to understand bacterial specificity.
