Notably several lupus susceptibil- ity genes have also been associated with RA and with psoriatic arthritis PsA Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.

Accordingly sphingosine kinase and S1PR- mediated signaling have been targeted for the treatment of autoimmunity in patients with multiple sclerosis those with lupus those with RA and those with inflammatory bowel disease Table 2 specific source citations are listed in Supplementary Table 2 available on the Arthritis  Rheumatology web site at t.Contribution of oxidative stress to the immuno- genicity of autoantigens.

Studies both in humans and in animals have shown that a high-calorie and high-fat diet predispose individuals to the develop- ment of RA and lupus and its serious comorbidities glomerulonephritis and atherosclerosis Table 3 and Sup- plementary Table 3.

The lysosomal receptor SLC15A4 which transports histidine has been genetically linked to lupus via the mTOR pathway-mediated activation of B cells and den- dritic cells Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1.

As noted in Table 1 see also Supple- mentary Table 1 most autoimmune disease susceptibil- ity genes transduce metabolic signals.Influence of the environment on the host immunometabolomeDisease concordance rates in identical twins are only 15 for RA 15 and 25 for SLE 16 which sug- gests that environmental factors have an important role in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases 9.

fish oil extra-virgin olive oil and terpenoids have antioxidant properties and reduce the severity of nephritis in patients with SLE Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3.
