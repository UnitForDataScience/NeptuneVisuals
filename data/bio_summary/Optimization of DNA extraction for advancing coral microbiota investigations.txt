symbiodinium dinoflagellates and coral cells reviewed within while symbiodinium are critical for provid- ing carbon to the coral bacteria and archaea may also play important roles by enhancing nutrient cycling inducing coral settlement and preventing coral diseases via production of antibiotic compounds the roles that bacteria and archaea may play in coral health and functioning have encouraged comprehensive investigations into the taxonomic identities and func- tional genes of microorganisms associated with globally distributed coral species.

in addition lysis of microbial cells embedded within the matrix of larger eukaryotic coral cells may be particularly dif- ficult to achieve because of the presence of the mesoglea a supportive tissue layer comprised of strong collagen fibers that is sandwiched between the epidermal and gastroder- mal coral tissue layers moreover lysis affinity for cells of a certain size or structure during sample homogenization could bias interpretation of microbial community compos- ition from sequence-based data -differential lysis of cells during the extraction process may also compound biases associated with pcr amplification.for example lysis methods with affinities for disrupting coral cells over microbial cells may increase the amount of eukaryotic dna within the extract therefore diluting the concentration of microbial relative to eukaryotic dna.

in particular kits designed by mo bio laboratories inc. have been commonly used to extract dna from coral biomass for downstream analysis -however as described above not all dna extracts from coral biomass are amenable to pcr amplification and this may be intensified for particular coral species.

in this study significantly higher dna yields were ob- tained from treatments that homogenized samples for 15 min vg pb on a vortex adaptor in comparison to 45 s pg using a powerlyzer and this result aligns with the reported observation that dna concentration in- creases with bead-beating duration  furthermore larger beads are more likely to lyse eukaryotic coral cellsand release more dna 420 mbp coral genome-1 whereas smaller beads are probably targeting the smaller microbial cells containing less dna 0.9-9.7 mbp mi- crobial genome-1 in this study lower concentra- tions of dna may have been obtained because the beads were either too large in diameter to effectively dis- rupt coral and microbial cells pp or so small that they could not sufficiently rupture eukaryotic cells pg vgl.

this observation can possibly be explained by the idea that extracts from p. lobata and p. verrucosa may be prone to more eukaryotic dna swamping recent efforts for circumventing dna swamping and nonspecific amplification involve select- ively enriching genomic extracts for prokaryotic dna or designing new pcr primers  alternatively as the cost of sequencing declines deep sequencing of shot-gun metagenomic dna has increasingly been used to circumvent the issues associated with amplicon-based methods while this approach may work well for some study systems -it proves difficult to use for studying complex communities within the coral holo- biont the abundance of coral and symbiodinium genomic material requires deep sequencing and even size-fractionation may not effectively enrich the target communities of interest microbial community analysis revealed that most of the variation in microbial community composition cor- responded with coral species or colony rather than dna extraction method.

subsequent microbial community analysis revealed that at a large-scale overall microbial community structure was significantly determined by coral species ra- ther than dna extraction treatment a result that validates the use of either the powerbiofilmr or ultracleanr tissue and cells and permutations dna isolation kits for broad coral microbiota comparisons of globally distributed coral species.

dna extraction begins with a series of steps designed to rupture cells using chemical enzymatic physical or mechanical means  inves- tigators seeking to understand coral-associated micro- organisms need to strive for representative lysis of morphologically diverse prokaryotic cells embedded within coral tissue  and elution of high-quality nucleic acids.dna extraction from coral biomass for investigation of associated bacteria and archaea is particularly subject to technical challenges and potential biases.

coral tissue is rife with polymerase chain reaction pcr inhibitors including humic acids and ca2 ions from the re- sidual coral skeleton.

several studies have reported these methodological issues and a few attempts have been made to optimize coral dna extraction   to date no large-scale studies have evaluated both the utility of and potential biases associated with different dna extraction treat- ments for extraction of dna from disparate coral species.

these amplicons were generated from 65 discrete coral colony and extraction treatment combinations represent- ing all seven coral species.

because ca2 ions compete with magne- sium mg2 ions as cofactors for dna polymerase higher concentrations of ca2 in d. strigosa extracts could have resulted in greater inhibition of dna poly- merase baker  kellogg also offered this hypothesis to explain differential pcr amplification be- tween coral species and emphasized the importance of using multiple coral species for optimization experi- ments.

for future experiments it may be appropriate to increase the mg2 concentration used during pcr to overcome this inhibition  unfortunately neither dna concentration nor pcr efficiency alone serve as definite indicators of sequence data quality a concept not demonstrated in past coral dna optimization studies but supported by previous coral microbiota sequencing studies and the disparities between dna concentration pcr ef- ficiency and p. lobata and p. verrucosa sequence qualityreported in this study.

this agrees with the results of a hu- man microbiome study that attributed most of the vari- ation in microbial community composition to different human subjects rather than dna extraction method as a whole this result suggests that the chosen dna extraction method either the powerbiofilmr or the different permutations of the ultracleanr tissue and cells dna isolation kit should not impart significant biases on microbial community composition if the aim of the study is to elucidate large differences in microbial community composition that correspond with changes in coral health coral species or other factors.

because many investigations are interested in making these larger comparisons we recommend that both the powerbiofilmr or the different permutations of the ultracleanr tissue and cells dna isolation kit are suitable for broad investi- gations of coral microbial dynamics.this recommendation is verified by the finding that the dominant taxonomic classes of bacteria and archaea recovered in this dataset support the results of other coral microbiota taxonomic surveys.
