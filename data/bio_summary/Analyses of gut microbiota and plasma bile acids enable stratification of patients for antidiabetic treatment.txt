to explore the possible impact of acarbose on gut bacterial ba metabolism we performed functional annotations of genes using a manually built reference library which includes 1011 annotated amino acid sequences mapped to 16102 genes implicated in bacterial ba metabolism supplementary table 8. the relative abundances of genes encoding enzymes involved in bacterial ba modification including ba deconjugation ba transport hydroxysteroid dehydrogenation and 7ab dehydroxylation were thus calculated and compared between pre-treatment and post-treatment sam- ples supplementary table 8. the relative abundances of baie encoding ba 7a-dehydratase the rate-limiting enzyme for 7a- dehydroxylation and baii encoding ba 7b-dehydratase were significantly decreased after acarbose treatment while the baig encoding ba transporter and genes encoding 7b-hsdh 7b- hsdh showed significant enrichment after acarbose treatment paired wilcoxon rank-sum test p  0.05 fig.

together these results suggest that some of the therapeutic effects of acarbose-induced modulation of the gut microbiota are related to bacterial ba metabolism and therefore ba signalling.discussionthis study compared the effects of two antidiabetic drugs on the gut microbiota plasma bas and their relations with clinical outcomes in a clinical trial-based cohort.

however takentogether our results clearly point to the importance of acarbose- induced changes in the composition of the gut microbiome and the observed alterations in ba profiles.with the increased attention on the metabolic significance of ba signalling the discovery of an acarbose-gut microbiota-ba axis may aid the identification of novel modalities for therapeutics intervention targeting the gut microbiome or plasma bas.

the implication of gut microbiota-plasma ba axis underlying ther- apeutic effects of acarbose is further supported by the finding of more pronounced changes in plasma ba composition and clinical benefits of acarbose treatment in patients where the baseline microbiomes belonged to an enterotype-like cluster driven by bacteroides cluster b vs. those belonging to an enterotype-like cluster driven by prevotella cluster p.in conclusion our results suggest that the differential ther- apeutic responses are related to distinct abilities of the microbial communities in the two microbiome clusters to metabolise bas and more importantly our findings demonstrate that stratifica- tion of patients according to baseline gut microbiota composition may provide a tool for selecting medication strategy and pre- dicting antidiabetic metabolic benefits.methodstrial design.

it is possible that the significantly reduced level of fgf19 which conveys the main inhibitory intestinal ba signal for hepatic ba neo-synthesis  or an altered intestinal ba reabsorption after acarbose treat- ment may contribute to the discrepancy between the unconba conba ratios in plasma and faecal samples.

the notion that similar changes in ba composition and correlations between metabolic traits and plasma bas after both acarbose treatment and gut reconstruction surgeries despite differences in populations sample size and follow-up time points to the importance of ba signalling in metabolic control in t2d treatments.acarbose treatment led to increased abundances of speciespossessing high bsh activity mainly b. longum l. gasseri and reduced abundance of the sba producers b. plebeius b. vulgatus dorei and c. bolteae.

thus the level of taurine-conjugated bas taurineba the sum of all taurine- conjugated bas is elevated in t2dand the ratio of 12-a oh to non-12a oh bas 12-a ohnon-12a oh ba ratio in the total ba pool has been linked to insulin resistance.

further the ratios of pbas to sbas pbasba ratio and unconjugated to conjugated bas unconbaconba ratio increased whereas the levels of taurineba and the 12-a ohnon-12a oh ba ratio decreased after acarbose treatment supplementary table 3 paired wil- coxon rank-sum test p  0.05.a multivariate correlation analysis based on the generalised estimated equation gee revealed that the acarbose-induced improvements of glycaemic control and other metabolic para- meters were correlated with the changes in plasma ba composition fig.

the results of plasma ba profiling and the multiple correlations between changes of plasma bas and clinical parameters including bw homa-ir lipid profile and fli indicate that the modulation of ba signalling may contribute to the unique metabolic effects of acarbose.

a gee analysis corrected for age sex and bmi was performed to explore acarbose-induced longitudinal associations between changes in 1 ba species and clinical parameters 2 ba species and the motus significantly altered in relative abundance by acarbose and 3 the motus significantly altered in relative abundance by acarbose and clinical parameters.

accordingly only genes exhibiting highly consistent annotation bsh baie baig baii and 7b-hsdh have been included in the analyses for more detailed description and discussion see supplementary methods functionalannotation of genes involved in ba synthesis based on blastp and blastkoala and supplementary data 4-7.to identify dominant species harbouring ba-metabolising enzymes we summed the total relative abundances of genes with a potential to encode enzymes involved in ba metabolism and calculated the cumulative relative abundances of these genes according to the contribution of each species harbouring the genes relative gene x abundance in one speciestotal relative abundances of gene x x 100.if the species contributed more than 0.5 of the total pool this species was considered as a dominant contributor.statistical analyses.

acarbose increases the relative abundances of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota and depletes bacteroides thereby changing the relative abundance of microbial genes involved in ba metabolism.
