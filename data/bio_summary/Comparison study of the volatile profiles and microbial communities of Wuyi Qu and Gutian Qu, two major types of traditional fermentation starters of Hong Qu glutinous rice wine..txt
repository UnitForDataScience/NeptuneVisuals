Good's coverage estimation values were within the range of 98.9e100 indicating adequate sequence coverage to reliably describe the full bacterial and fungal communities presented in all the samples Supplementary Table S1.The bacterial and fungal communities within the two types of starters were compared by using PCA analysis based on the total OTUs' relative abundance information B and C. Both PCA score plots depicted 2 divided groups which revealed relatively low similarities in bacterial and fungal communities between GTQ and WYQ.

Unsurprisingly the clustering depicted two clear separated groups in both bacterial and fungal communities which indicated that these taxa were the most representative microbial groups in WYQ or GTQ.Correlation analysis between major volatile components and representative microbiota in Hong QuThe relationship of the 13 major volatile components 14 representative bacterial taxa and 10 representative fungal taxa of the both types of starters were explored by using PLS-DA algorithm and visualized by using R software.

They jointly constituted from 86.40 to 94.31 of the total peak area and thus covered the major information con- tained in the volatile profiles.Overall bacterial and fungal structures comparison of WYQ and GTQThe bacterial and fungal components in the traditional fermentation starters WYQ and GTQ were investigated by Illumina HiSeq sequencing analyses.

Moreover it was also revealed that the bacterial com- munities within WYQ were dramatically distinct from one another while the GTQ patterns were quite well clustered which indicated more similarity of bacterial profile within GTQ samples.Bacterial and fungal profiles of Hong QuThe bacterial OTU sequences were annotated into different taxa from the GreenGene Database.

A PCA plots based on the normalized peak area percentages of volatile components B PCA plots based on the relative abundance of bacterial 16S gene OTUs C PCA plots based on the relative abundance of fungal ITS gene OTUs.WYQ had a significantly higher Bacillus proportion P0.000.The ITS1 regions of fungal ITS rRNA genes facilitated the species level taxonomic annotation of fungi from the Unite Database.

The fungal group enriched in GTQ was only Monascus purpureus with an LDA score of 5.02.Based on the relative abundance of these 14 bacterial taxa and10 fungal taxa heatmap plots and hierarchical clustering were then employed so as to provide a visual and overall comparison for differentiating the two types of starters as reflected in B andD.

Subse- quently the possible relation between the major volatile compo- nents with relative content over 1.0 and the representative bacterial and fungal taxa was explored by utilizing a PLS-DA modelling and plotted in a concatenation panel by using Rsoftware with the mixOmics package.Other data are expressed as mean - SD.

Thus the color value fermentative power volatile profiles and more importantly the bacterial and fungal community structures of WYQ and GTQ were investigated and compared in the present study.In general WYQ has darker appearance  but lower con- tent of Monascus pigments than GTQ .
