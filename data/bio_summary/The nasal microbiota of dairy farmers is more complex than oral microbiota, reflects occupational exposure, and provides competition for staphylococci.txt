Thus occupational as well as personal microbial exposures differed between farmers and non-farmers in our sample population.Microbiota analyses at the phylum family and genus levelWe sampled the oral and nasal mucosa to determine the respective microbiota from the four targeted groups nasal dairy farmer NDF oral dairy farmer ODF nasal non-farmer NNF and oral non-farmer ONF using the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

We compared the nasal and oral microbiota of dairy farmers NDF ODF respectively with nasal and oral microbiota of NF in the same geo- graphical area.

A study of bacterial assemblages along the nasal passages by Wos-Oxley et al reported the presence core bacterial community regardless of whether they have chronic nasal inflam- mation CNS or not .

However the number of studies that have investigated associations between environmental microbiomes and disease susceptibility in rural and urban populations are limited .The goal of this study was to identify and characterize the baseline nasal and oral microbiota of dairy farmers and compare these with the nasal and oral microbiota of non-farmers.

The sam- ples were coded in the following manner oral samples from dairy farmers ODF oral sam- ples from non-farmers ONF nasal samples from dairy farmers NDF and nasal samples from non-farmers NNF.

Oral samples did not have as much microbial diversity as nasal samples regardless of farming or non-farming status.High beta diversity was seen between the oral and nasal microbiota regardless of the occu- pation status.

Boxplot representation of Shannon diversity index evenness for NDF NNF ODF and ONF groups NDF  Nasal dairy farmer NNF  Nasal non-farmer ODF  Oral dairy farmer ONF  Oral non-farmer.Further the nasal samples of dairy farmers had distinct nasal microbiomes at the phylum level compared to the non-farming cohort.

Streptococcaceae and Pasteurellaceae dominated the ONF group whereas Staphylococcaceae Corynebacteriaceae and Moraxellaceae dominated the NNF group.Hundreds of exclusive genera present in nares of dairy farmersThe nasal microbiota of the dairy farmers group had 2.15 fold more genera 1189 genera vs. 552 genera when compared to the nasal samples of non-farmers no cut off.
