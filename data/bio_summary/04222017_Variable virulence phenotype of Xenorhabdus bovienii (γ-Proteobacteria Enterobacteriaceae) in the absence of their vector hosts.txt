Infection kinetics of X. bovienii strains and X. nematophila in G. mellonella and S. littoralisHazard ratios for each X. bovienii strain were generated from the time-to-death data at a the dose of 10 cells per insect in G. mellonella and at b the dose of 1000 cells per insect in S. littoralis.

Competi- tion between Xn and X. bovienii T6SS- strains was consid- ered as a positive control since X. nematophila is known to produce bacteriocins active against X. bovienii .

Furthermore we used a comparative genomics approach to identify candidate genes andor genomic regions that may contribute to the variable virulence of X. bovienii strains.METHODSIsolation and rearing of bacterial culturesNine X. bovienii strains XbfFL XbfM XbfSN Xbi Xbj XbkBU XbkCA Xbp and Xbo isolated from six different Steinernema spp.

First it could target the insect's gut microbiota which is known to translocate into the haemocoel when the nem- atodes migrate from the insect gut into the haemocoel .Second it could help protect the insect cadaver from necrotrophic microbial competitors keeping it preserved until the Xenorhabdus-Steinernema life cycle is complete .

The inability of X. bovienii CS03 to infect the tested insects alone was attributed in part to its susceptibility to cationic antimicrobial peptides which are produced by the insect host as a response to bacterial infection .

In general doses greater than 10 cells per insect did not show substantial differences in mortality between the X. bovienii strains .

These results indicate that virulence in X. bovienii varies at the intraspecific level in two different insect hosts.

In this respect we speculate that differences in metabolic path- ways could reflect specialization of X. bovienii for certain hosts - both nematode and insect - and could also contrib- ute to the relative success of virulent strains.Intriguingly one set of syntenic genes we identified as pres- ent in the virulent strains and absent in the attenuated ones appears to encode a T6SS.

Thus we speculate that the T6SS in X. bovienii may be another addition to the arse- nal of antibacterial mechanisms expressed by these bacteria in an insect where it could potentially play one of three roles.

Once IJs enter a susceptible insect host they release Xenorhabdus bacteria into the insect haemocoel leading to septicaemia.
