c Bar chart showing the mean BC dissimilarity within control subjects within MECFS without IBS and within MECFS with IBS subjects as well as between control vs. MECFS without IBS between control vs. MECFS with IBS and between MECFS without IBS vs. MECFS with IBS subjects.

Additional file Table S1A and Additional file Table S2A.Evidence from TDA that IBS was linked to differences in disease severity microbiota and immune profiles led us to stratify the patient cohort into MECFS  IBS and MECFS without IBS and test for group-specific differ- ences in the microbiota using linear statistical models.In comparisons of the MECFS  IBS and control groups LEfSe identified 12 bacterial species genera or families enriched in the MECFS  IBS and 26 bacterial taxa enriched in the controls Fig.

PC1 12.67 MECFS  IBS vs. control p  0.05 MECFS without IBS vs. control p  0.001 however only ME CFS without IBS showed separation along PC2 PC2 10.69 MECFS without IBS vs. control p  0.030.

Compari- son between MECFS without IBS vs. MECFS with IBS showed higher dissimilarity than control vs. MECFS without IBS but similar dissimilarity as between control vs. MECFS with IBS.

The decreased relative abundance of Bacteroides vulgatus distinguished the MECFS without IBS group from the MECFS  IBS group based on all statistical tests TDA LEfSe nonparametric and reduction model tests.MECFS patients with IBS were distinguished from MECFS patients without IBS by the relative abundance of eleven bacterial species ROC AUC  0.956 cross- validated AUC  0.604.Distinct bacterial metabolic pathways in MECFSBacterial metagenomic data were used to predict differ- ences in functional metabolic pathways in the MECFS subgroups.

Although the clusters did distinguish a range of cytokine profiles in individuals ranging from high to low cytokine profiles there was no distinct clus- tering observed between disease groups Additional file Figure S2.A predictive logistic regression model restricted solely to immune data showed little accuracy in distinguishing between the MECFS diagnostic groups and controls total MECFS MECFS  IBS or MECFS without IBS vs. controls data not shown.Table 2 Predictive selection model defined different bacterial composition in MECFS diagnostic groupsTable 2 Predictive selection model defined different bacterial composition in MECFS diagnostic groups ContinuedFirmicutes Ruminococcus lactarisFirmicutes Eubacterium halliiFirmicutes Anaerotruncus colihominisFirmicutes Faecalibacterium cfFirmicutes Clostridium methylpentosumBacteroidetes Bacteroides vulgatus0.9560.60441.5127.3262.80Bacteroidetes Prevotella buccalisFirmicutes Ruminococcus lactarisFirmicutes Eubacterium halliiFirmicutes Anaerotruncus colihominisFirmicutes Faecalibacterium cfFirmicutes Clostridium methylpentosumFirmicutes Faecalibacterium prausnitziiProteobacteria Klebsiella pneumoniaeBacteroidetes Parabacteroides distasonisBacteroidetes Prevotella copriThe arrows represent the increased or decreased relative abundance of bacterial species in total MECFS MECFS  IBS MECFS wo IBS compared to controls.

Thus if bacterial metabolic pathways con- tribute to these observed host metabolite changes such changes could be restricted to the IBS subgroup.Enriched pathways for the degradation of atrazine in MECFS were also found in our analyses and may be in- dependent of IBS as the predicted pathway of atrazine degradation was a biomarker of both MECFS without IBS and MECFS  IBS.

Comparisons involving the MECFS  IBS subgroup vs. controls and vs. MECFS without IBS showed stronger associations with bacterial taxa and meta- bolic pathways than any of the other comparisons.Four networks defined by IBS co-morbidity and BMI Add- itional file  Figure S1 Additional file Table S1B were asso- ciated with a distinct metagenomic and immune profile.MECFS and MECFS subgroups are associated with an altered microbial compositionCompositional taxonomic analysis based on metage- nomic sequencing indicated that the two dominant phyla in both MECFS and control individuals were Bacteroidetes 64.9 and 63.4 respectively and Firmi- cutes 26.6 and 29.7 respectively Fig.

While controls had significantly lower within-group dis- similarity compared to within-group dissimilarities of both the MECFS without IBS and MECFS  IBS ME CFS  IBS had the highest within-group dissimilarity Fig.

Thus there was as much dissimi- larity between the two subgroups of MECFS defined by IBS co-morbidity as between control and MECFS with IBS and even greater dissimilarity between the subgroups of IBS.
