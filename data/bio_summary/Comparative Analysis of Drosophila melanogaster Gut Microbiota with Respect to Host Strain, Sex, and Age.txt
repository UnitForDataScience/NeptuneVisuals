By using various bioinformatic tools we uncovered several character- istic features of microbiota corresponding to specific catego- ries of the flies host-sex-bias association of specific bacteriaGangsik Han and Hyo Jung Lee contributed equally to this study.age-dependent alteration of microbiota across host species and sex and uniqueness of the microbiota of female w1118 flies.

Strain- and sex- specific characteristics of microbiota composition were observedSamplingSamplingSamplingChronological age dayothers Staphylococcus Shigella RalstoniaPropionibacterium Escherichia Corynebacterium Leuconostoc Enterococcus Acetobacter LactobacillusResults and DiscussionWe investigated whether the microbiota in the gut is differentiated by sex and age in two commonly used laboratory Drosophila species w1118 and Canton S. The flies whose microbiota had been thoroughly bal- anced and stabilized with that of our rearing food con- dition standard yeast-glucose medium see B  section were used for the analysis.

However other trends of age-dependent changes in microbiota composition were not so obvious.To identify the host factors that determine microbiota com- position among different host types we used a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analysis to quantify the compositional dissimilar- ity of the microbiota between two different sites .

These results indi- cate that despite several limitations for understanding human gut microbiota due to the difference in immune system and intestinal structure D. melanogaster can serve for an ideal model system for understanding the influence of commensal bacteria on the physiology and development of its host.Several studies have examined Drosophila gut microbiota using the 16S amplicon strategy the results of which have generally indicated that the fly supports a rather simple bacte- rial composition roughly comprised of a relatively small num- ber of bacterial families including the Lactobacillaceae Acetobacteraceae Enterococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae.

Recent analyses of fly gut microbiota sampled from different geographical locations and laboratory sources have demonstrated that bacterial community richness is dependent on the fly's food consumption suggest- ing that microbiota composition in the gut of adult Drosophila is shaped primarily by the host's diet and nutritional environ- ment -.

As such rigorous and comprehensive descriptions of the gut microbiota of D. melanogaster with respect to factors such as host age sex and strain are absent.In this study pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes derived from bacterial metagenomes was performed for comparative analysis of the gut microbiota of two commonly used laboratory strains of D. melanogaster w1118 and Canton S based on the sex and age of the host individual.

a this analysis revealed that host sex marginally affected the composition of the microbiota in both host strains implying that other thansex-specific bacterial genera such as Enterococcus overall composition of microbiota were similar between male and female hosts.

b which may be because of the uniqueness of the microbiota of female w1118 hosts see below.The effects of D. melanogaster age on microbiota compo- sition were then examined.

For this microbiota from young 95 flies remained alive in the population and middle- aged 70 flies remained alive in the population flies were compared as were microbiota from young 95 flies remained alive in the population and old 20 flies remained alive in the population flies using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity analyses.

c d. Weak effect of host age on microbiota seen within w1118 and within female flies may again be due to masking effects caused by the uniqueness of the microbiota of w1118 female host see below Fig.
