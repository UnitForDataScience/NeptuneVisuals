Generally HG feeding increased colonic fermentation and altered colonic mucosal bacterial communities which eventually caused colonic mucosal damage and led to colonic dysfunction and these changes occurred gradually over at least 4 weeks.Keywords colon microbiota high grain diet mucosal injury sheepINTRODUCTIONIn modern ruminant production systems feeding high grain HG diets to high producing ruminant animals has become a common strategy for increasing milk yields and maximizing economic efficiency      .

Previous studies have reported that the complex microbiota of the hindgut is highly responsive to diet changes     thus the coordinated change in gene expression of environmental adaptation may suggest that the HG diet was stressful to colonic mucosal bacteria at the initial feeding stageand that long-term exposure to HG diet can result in the adaption of the bacterial community to an HG diet.

In general our data showed that HG feeding increased colonic fermentation and dynamically altered the composition and function of colonic mucosal bacterial communities which eventually caused colonic mucosal damage and resulted in colonic dysfunction and 4 weeks is not sufficient to complete the adaptive response to an HG diet.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSYW carried out all the experiments and analyzed the data LX participated in animal care JL revised the manuscript SM and WZ were responsible for study design YW and SM were responsible for writing the manuscript.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China No.

An increase in the expression of claudin-1 linear P 0.038 and claudin-4 cubic P 0.009 was observed with number of days fed an HG diet.The Correlation between Colonic Inflammatory Cytokine Expression and MicrobiotaThe correlative relationships between the abundant bacteria in colonic mucosa relative abundance 1 in at least one treatment colonic pH and the colonic inflammatory cytokine expression are shown in .

We also hypothesized that feeding an HG diet may result in excessive colonic fermentation and a dynamic shiftin the composition of colonic mucosal bacterial communities which may contribute to local inflammatory responses in the colon of sheep.

A plausible explanation for the gradually adaptation in colonic bacterial community may be the higher and gradual changes in starch content as well as other nutrients in colonic digesta in comparison with the forage diet given to CON group.

In addition the increase in the concentration of VFA and a low pH in colonic digesta of HG groups may make a contribution to the shift in the mucosa-associated bacterial community in sheep.In accordance with earlier reports that studied the hindgut bacterial communities of goats   and cows    the present study showed that members of the phylum Firmicutes were dominant in samples from colonic mucosa of sheep fed an HG diet emphasizing their role in polysaccharide degradation.

Thus in the current study the higher percentage of Prevotella Oscillibacter Roseburia Bifidobacterium unclassified Lachnospiraceae and unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae in the colonic mucosa of sheep fed an HG diet may be explained by the increased starch content that reached the colonic lumen.

Previous studies have found that massive hindgut fermentation led to inflammation and laminitis which may be induced by amines endotoxins or bacteria that are able to across through a breach in the intestinal barrier    .Although many studies to date have assessed the adaptation of the bacteria associated with ruminal epithelium in response to dietary changes in cows       and goats   as well as the morphological and functional      adaptation of the ruminal epithelium in ruminants little information is available on the time course of the mucosal microbial communities and epithelial functional adaption of hindgut to an HG diet despite the fact that the hindgut of a ruminant also plays an important role in the animal's overall health productivity and welfare  .Here we hypothesized that there is a time course of adaptation of colonic mucosa-associated microbiota composition to an HG diet.

Our results also showed that the concentration of total VFA linearly increased with number of days fed an HG diet which may contribute to the colonic mucosal injury.Consistent with the previous studies that HG feeding resulted in colon inflammation in goats     the current study showed that the expression of inflammation cytokines and TLRs such as IL-1b IL-6 TNF-a and TLR3 increased linearly with days fed HG diet.
