The poultry-associated E. coli had many of the same virulence factors as human extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli ExPEC which could facilitate human colonization and extraintestinal infections .To investigate if poultry-associated strains existed among hu- man clinical E. coli isolates with pAmpC production we screened isolates from microbiology laboratory and national strain collec- tions.

However to what extent consumption of chicken meat contaminated by resistant bacteria affects human health has not been established .With the exception of coccidiostats not classified as an anti- biotic in Europe Norwegian broiler production has a very low usage of antimicrobials e. In spite of this cephalosporin- resistant E. coli were detected in approximately one-third of the broilers and retail chicken fillets produced in Norway in the period from 2011 to 2014 e. A recent study showed that cephalosporin-resistant E. coli originating from Norwegian chicken fillets had low genetic diversity mainly limited to a few multi-locus sequence types STs and typically carried the plasmid-mediated AmpC pAmpC blaCMY-2 gene on an IncK plasmid .

The aim of the study was to compare human- and poultry-associated cephalo- sporin-resistant E. coli by use of single nucleotide polymorphism SNP analyses to determine the genetic relatedness of selected AmpC-producing strains from the two reservoirs with the highest possible resolution.Materials and methodsBacterial isolatesThe scheme for selection and analysis of the isolates in the present study is illustrated in .Escherichia coli isolates from broilers.

The poultry-associated E. coli strains were a subset of isolates originally collected from retail chicken meat fillets in 2012 n 4 and 2014 n 10 and from chicken faecal samples in 2011 n 3 as a part of the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in the veteri- nary and food production sectors NORMNORM-VET e. The monitoring program reported the following prevalence of pAmpC- positive E. coli isolates from broilers 43 108252 from intestinal flora of healthy broilers in 2011 and from chicken filet samples 32 66205 and 29 58201 in 2012 and 2014 respectively.

A selection of completed E. coli reference genomes downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI   was included in the analysis to limit the SNP calling to the phylogenetic informative genomic sequences assumed to be representative for the E. coli core genome .

This indicates that the majority n 182 of our blaCMY-2-positive clinical ExPECs have acquired the pAmpC from other sources than the cephalosporin- resistant E. coli found in chicken fillets and were therefore unre- lated to the chicken meat E. coli.

Sequence analysis after WGS confirmed that all of the 29 clinical isolates selected in the screening carried a plasmid backbone with high similarity to the IncKblaCMY-2 plasmid in the poultry-associated E. coli.The WGS-based in silico low-resolution E. coli genotyping of the 29 clinical strains showed that most of these ExPEC isolates were distantly related to the poultry E. coli.

Extrapolation and comparison of our findings to similar studies using E. coli core genomes derived from proteome analyses indicate that our ten poultry and five UTI isolates were as closely related as would be expected for clones in a foodborne E. coli outbreak .
