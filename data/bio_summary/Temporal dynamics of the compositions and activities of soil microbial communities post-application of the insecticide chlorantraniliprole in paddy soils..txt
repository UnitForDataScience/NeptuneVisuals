The effects of CAP on microbial activities microbial biomass carbon-MBC basal soil respiration-BSR microbial metabolic quotient-qCO2 acid phosphatase and sucrose invertase activities in the soils were peri- odically evaluated.

The half-lives DT50 of CAP were in the range of 41.0-53.0 days in the three soils.

The results showed that CAP did not impart negative effects on MBC during the incubation.

These soils were 1 JS a paddy soil derived from lacustrine deposits in Xinzhuang Town Changsu City Jiangsu Province 31deg33' N 120deg38' E 2 HN a paddy soil developed from quaternary red clay and plate shale in Wangcheng District Changsha City Hunan Province 28deg15' N 112deg49' E and 3 CQ a paddy soil developed from Jurassic purple shale and sandstone in Beibei District Chongqing City 29deg50' N 106deg25' E. The topsoils 0-25 cm depth were taken from each field in triplicate sam- ples.

The soil samples were air-dried and sieved  2 mm to remove extraneous material prior to further experimentation.

The physico- chemical parameters of the soils were determined by standard proce- dures using air dried soil samples .

The treat- ments were recorded under the designation JS-1 HN-1 and CQ-1.

The microbial activities were analyzed in the first 50 days.

The samples collected on the day 14 and 50 were used for mi- crobial community analysis.CAP extractionQuick easy cheap effective rugged and safe method QuEChERS which was introduced by has been used for the extraction and cleanup of the CAP residues in soil  .

The samples were centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min.
