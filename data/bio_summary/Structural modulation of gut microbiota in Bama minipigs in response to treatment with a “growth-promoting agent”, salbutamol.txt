Two phyla Firmicutes 79.12 84.4 and 43.57 in the control group the SAL30 group and the SAL60 group re- spectively and Bacteroidetes 14.23 1.76 and 16.73 in the control group the SAL30 group and SAL60 group re- spectively were the most dominant in the faecal samples.

None of the pigs received any additional antimi- crobial treatments.The pigs in the SAL60 group received SAL 5 mgkg in their feed for 60 days the pigs in the SAL30 group received SAL 5 mgkg in their feed for 30 days and subsequently received a basal diet for another 30 days and the pigs in the control group received only the basal diet for 60 days.Fresh urine and hair samples were collected at desig- nated time points 1 3 5 7 10 14 17 21 25 30 3133 35 37 40 44 47 51 55 and 60 days for urinesamples and 1 7 14 21 25 30 31 33 35 37 4044 47 51 55 and 60 days for hair samples in the SAL30 group and stored at -20 degC until analysis.

The aver- age number of sequences generated by per pig was 1999 2458 and 3265 in the SAL60 group SAL30 group and control group respectively Table S2.The diversity of the microbial communities in three groups was measured via the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices.

The PCoA scores clearly separated the control group and the SAL60 group and the SAL30 group values were distributed in between.

Both diversity indi- ces were higher in the 60-day SAL treatment group than in the 30-day SAL treatment group or in the control group Table S3.An overview of the gut microbiota compositions in the three groups after 60 days was provided by weighted UniFrac principal coordinates analysis PCoA Fig.

The relative weights of the heart lung liver spleen and kidney were significantly decreased in the SAL60 group when compared to those in the control group P  0.05.Biochemical indices of the pigs in the three groupsThe effects of SAL on serum indices are presented in Fig.

The Shannon and Simpson indices were 6.11 - 0.08 and 0.019 - 0.0089 for the SAL60 group3.61 - 0.51 and 0.092 - 0.0008 for the SAL30 group and3.88 - 0.43 and 0.065 - 0.0015 for the control group.

When compared to the control group the SAL60 group showed significant enhancement in the levels of ALT 63.9 - 6.41 vs 169.66 - 23.96 IUL P  0.01 AST 25.05 - 1.16 vs98.88 - 1.43 IUL P  0.01 CRE 34.58 - 4.09 vs73.86 - 13.01 mmolL P  0.05 and GLU 4.18 - 0.11 vs7.73 - 0.15 mmolL P  0.01.

However in the SAL30 group when compared to the control group there were no significant differences in serum indices P  0.05 except for the GLU index P  0.05.

c. HDL-C 2.21 - 0.03 vs 1.86 - 0.02 P  0.01 was reduced by 60-day SAL treatments SAL60 group and the group showed significant improvements in serum TCFig.
