in the framework of the multipurpose international project ''biology and mars experiment biomex'' a vari- ety of organo-mineral samples were integrated into the expose-r2 platform to study the vitality of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and the stability of organic biomolecules as putative biomarkers de vera et al.

2012. the definition of biomarkers may vary in the context of a number of disciplines but here the definition includes molecules or compounds of biological origin that are indicative of life-associated activities lovelock 1965 aerts et al.
