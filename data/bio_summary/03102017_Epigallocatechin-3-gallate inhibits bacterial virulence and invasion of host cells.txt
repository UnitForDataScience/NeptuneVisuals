C Dose-dependent effect of EGCG epicatechin gallate chrysin INP0007 and baicalein on the levels of SPI-1 T3SS secreted proteins SipA SipB SopB SipC and SipD and flagella components in S. Typhimurium growth media.Epigallocatechin gallate inhibits secretion of S. Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS substrates in vitroAs epigallocatechin gallate EGCG is the major polyphenolic components among the tea derived catechins we compared the activities of EGCG and ECG with previously reported T3SS inhibi- tors baicalein and INP0007 on endogenously secreted SPI-1 T3SS effectors from the growth media of S. Typhimurium C. With chrysin as the inactive control all active compounds treated S. Typhimurium growth media exhibited dose-dependent reduction of SPI-1 T3SS substrates such as SipA SipB SopB SipC and SipD C. In addition both EGCG and ECG also exhibited a pronounced effect on the level of FliC and FliD two proteins asso- ciated with bacterial flagella.

To alleviate the concern of bacterial tox- icity by EGCG we showed that EGCG did not affect S. Typhimurium growth at 100 lM D. Taken together these data show thatEGCG is a non-bactericidal and potent plant-derived metabolite that inhibits SPI-1 T3SS substrates.Epigallocatechin gallate inhibits SPI-1 T3SS-mediated invasion of host cellsWe then investigated the invasion of S. Typhimurium into HeLa cells with the presence of EGCG.

The inhibition of bacterial invasion could also be readily observed by immunofluorescence analysis of intracellu- lar S. Typhimurium C. Collectively our results demonstrated that EGCG did not affect bacterial growth but could potently inhi- bit SPI-1 T3SS-dependent S. Typhimurium invasion of host cells.ConclusionThe flavonoid EGCG is most abundant and bioactive catechin in green teawith diverse pharmacological activities in mammalian cellsand virusesbut its effects on Gram-negative bacte- ria T3SS-mediated virulence have not been described.

Here we demonstrate that EGCG targets bacterial virulence with potent inhibitory activity in blocking SPI-1 T3SS-dependent S. Typhimur- ium invasion of host cells.

EGCG inhibits SPI-1 T3SS-mediated bacterial invasion of epithelial cells.

As EGCG also contains polyphenolicfunctionality similar to baicalein and quercetin the uptake and reactivity of these plant metabolites may covalently react with T3SS substrates and inactivate these secreted bacterial protein effectors to attenuate pathogen virulence pathways.

Here we show epigallocatechin-3-gallate from green tea extracts also inhibits the activity of S. Typhimurium type III protein effectors and significantly reduces bacterial invasion into host cells.

In the absence of T3SSs bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium S. Typhimurium cannot inject ''effector proteins into host cells to manipulate sig- naling pathways for invasion and intracellular replication.

Beyond Salmonella T3SSs are also crucial for the pathogenesis of other Gram-negative bacterial pathogens including Shigella Pseu- domonas enteropathogenic Escherichia coli EPEC enterohemor- rhagic Escherichia coli EHEC Chlamydia and Yersinia.To identify T3SS inhibitors we have explored traditional medic- inal extracts and discovered that specific flavonoids could attenu- ate S. Typhimurium invasion of epithelial cells through covalent inactivation of the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island -1 SPI-1 T3SS substrates and effectors.
