however to emphasise the role of exposure to nonpathogenic beneficial microbes 'the microbial deprivation hypothesis' has been proposed as a more appro- priate term 16. as other immune-mediated dis- eases such as type 1 diabetes multiple sclerosis and crohn's disease also show rising incidences in affluent countries 12 17-21 a theory of microbial deprivation syndromes of affluence has been pro- posed 16. although most studies investigating the underlying immunomodulatory mechanisms have focused on postnatal microbial exposure 2 22- 36 it is becoming increasingly evident that the maternal microbial environment during pregnancy is also important in childhood immune program- ming 9 12 13 37-41. here the influence ofmicrobial and immune interactions within the mother-offspring dyad on childhood allergy devel- opment will be discussed and implications for strategies to reduce the high prevalence of allergy will be considered.co-evolutionary interdependency of the microbiome and the immune systemno animal has evolved independently of microbial symbionts 42-44. microbes were the pioneers of life and the only life form on earth for most of its history in addition multicellular life arose in a world dominated by prokaryotes 42-44. microor- ganisms have played critical roles in the evolution and functioning of all other organisms 42-44. intimate complex and dynamic interactions between animal hosts and microbes have thus profoundly influenced and indeed continue to influence animal evolution 42-46. nearly half a billion years of co-evolution with vertebrates has reciprocally shaped the repertoire of the microbial symbionts and the immune system 43 47. how- ever our modern and affluent lifestyle and the declining biodiversity diminish the exposure to microbes with which we have co-evolved 48-52. thus our establishment of microbial communities differs substantially from that of our ancestors 48-52.the immune system shapes homeostasis between the host and the microbial symbionts 43 47 53 54. this allows for a mutualistic partnership where the microbiota provides digestive and protective advantages to the host in a sheltered environment with abundant nutri- tion whilst pathogenic and invasive behaviour of microbes evokes eliminatory measures 43 47 53. it is likely that our immune system has evolved as much to preserve protect and pro- mote beneficial microbes as to defend against pathogens 42 43 47 55. when the adaptive immune system evolved in vertebrates the capacity to recognize and remembers beneficial as well as pathogenic microbes and the ability to both suppress and promote innate inflammatory mechanisms allowed more sophisticated rela- tionships with increasingly complex microbial communities 42 43 47 54-56. the mam- malian intestine is the ecological site with the highest density of bacteria on earth 57. encounters between microbes from this complex ecosystem and immune cells may have profound effects on immune maturation particularlya 2017 the association for the publication of the journal of internal medicine485journal of internal medicine 2017 282 484-495during critical time windows of developmental programming 12 13 38 39 58-60.the first microbial encounterscontrary to previous assumptions of a 'sterile womb' paradigm in which the acquisition of bac- teria first occurs at birth recent evidence suggests that the first interactions between the microbiota and the host may be initiated in utero 38 61-68. any microbial presence in utero was assumed to be a danger for the foetus and intra-uterine infection may indeed cause preterm delivery 65 69. how- ever intracellular bacteria have been histologically visualized in the placental basal plate at a similar rate in preterm and term pregnancies without overt infection 69. the basal plate is the peripheral region of the placenta on the maternal side in contact with the uterine wall 69. furthermore bacterial dna has been detected in amniotic fluid 63 70 placenta 62 63 66 70 umbilical cordblood 71 and meconium 63 72-74 after 'sterile' term elective caesarean section cs deliveries following apparently normal pregnancies without any indication of inflammation or pathology.

furthermore establishment of adequate mucosal barrier function for example by increasing secre- tory iga production during infancy seems impor- tant to counteract allergic responses 60 163- 165. thus low levels of salivary and intestinal secretory iga are associated with an increased risk of allergic manifestations during early life 163- 165 and aberrant iga responses to the gut microbiota during infancy were recently found to precede asthma and allergy development during the first 7 years of life 117.appropriate pre- and postnatal microbial stimula- tions may be needed to avoid the pathophysiolog- ical process leading to allergy 9 12 13 37-40. in this respect the gut microbiota is quantitatively the most important source of microbial stimulation and may provide a primary signal for the matura- tion of a balanced postnatal innate and adaptive immune system 13 22. in support of this hypoth- esis allergy development is associated with differ- ences in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota during the first months of life 13 23- 26 28-34 36 166. early establishment of a diverse gut microbiota providing repeated expo- sure to new bacterial antigens and a consistent immunomodulatory impact may be more impor- tant than the distribution of specific microbial species in shaping normal mucosal and systemic immune maturation 13.conclusionevidence from intervention trials epidemiological studies and experimental animal models suggests that perinatal microbial and immune interactions within the mother-offspring dyad influence child- hood allergy development.

nonetheless the presence of microbial dna in the intra-uterine compartment suggests that the foetus may be in direct contact with microbial components during gestation 38 65 67.the placental microbiome composition deter- mined in the extensive deep sequencing study most closely resembled the oral microbiome when compared with the oral skin nasal vaginal and gut microbiomes from nonpregnant controls 62. although paired microbiota sampling and characterization at multiple sites from the same pregnant women implementing strict validated collection techniques to account for potential contamination would be important for furthervalidation it has been speculated that the pla- cental microbiome is partially established by haematogenous spread of oral microbiota 38 62 65 67. another hypothesis is that maternal bacteria may reach the placenta via the blood- stream after dendritic cell-facilitated transloca- tion across the gut epithelium 38 61 65 67. maternal to foetal transfer of labelled enterococ- cus faecium via the gastrointestinal tract was demonstrated in mice 71 and enhanced translocation of gut bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes has been demonstrated during pregnancy and lactation in experimental models 38 65 67 75. in support of an entero-mammary pathway maternal intestinal microbes have been detected in immune cells circulating in peripheral blood and in breastmilk in both lactating mice and humans 75.do prenatal microbial exposures affect immune programmingdirect presentation of maternal bacterial compo- nents to the foetus has been recognized as a potential route for immune imprinting 12 38 39 as a way to prepare the neonatal immune system to respond appropriately to the much larger inoculum transferred during vaginal deliv- ery 31 61 64 74 76-85 and breastfeeding61 64 81 86-88. in line with this suggestion exposure of germ-free mice to bacteria only during pregnancy increased the numbers of monocytes and group 3 innate lymphoid cells in the intestinal mucosa of the offspring 89. the use of a genetically engineered escherichia coli strain that can persist in the intestine for only 3 days unless continuously supplemented allowed for the transient colonization from day 4 to 15 of the 21-day gestation period.

it is interesting that the presence of live bacteria in utero was not required for the immunomodula- tory effects in this model and transfer of micro- bial molecules to the offspring during gestation seemed to be facilitated by maternal antibodies 89. microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands may also exert immunomodu- latory effects 41 89 90. also in support of a role of the prenatal environment in shaping immune development treatment of maternal mice with lipopolysaccharide 91 92 or com- mensals such as acinetobacter lwoffii 93 and lactobacillus rhamnosus 94 during gestation attenuates allergic sensitization and airway inflammation in the offspring.486a 2017 the association for the publication of the journal of internal medicine journal of internal medicine 2017 282 484-495whether prenatal exposures to maternal microbial components also exert immunomodulatory effects in humans are presently not known but would be in line with allergy intervention studies demon- strating that a combined prenatal and postnatal supplementations seem to be important for the preventive effect of probiotics on infant eczema 37-39 58 95 table 1. moreover maternal exposure to a traditional farm environment during pregnancy confers stronger protection against allergic disease and sensitization than postnatal exposure alone 40. furthermore maternal antibi- otic use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of development of allergic disease 96-98 and asthma 96 99-102 in child- hood table 1. speculatively more pronounced effects of prenatal microbial exposures on adaptive immune responses in humans as compared with mice may be envisioned as the immune system matures at a faster rate in humans than in rodents prior to birth 103 104. thus whereas mature t cells can be detected in human foetal peripheral tissues as early as 10-12 weeks of gestation 105 and circulate in significant numbers by the end of the second trimester 106 they do not fully populate the periphery in mice until after birth 103 104. furthermore b and t cells appear in peyer's patches of developing intestinal tissue at gestational day 18.5 in mice 107 this is muchtable 1 intervention trials and epidemiological studies suggesting that prenatal microbial exposures affect allergy developmentlater than in humans 103 with intestinal b and t cells present from 12-14 weeks of gestation 108 109. moreover functionally active regulatory t cells and regulatory t cell-promoting dendritic cells have also been demonstrated in human mesenteric lymph nodes at this age 110-112. of interest at birth up to 5-10 of neonatal t cells are differen- tiated into either memory or effector cells suggest- ing activation in utero 113. furthermore somatic hypermutations have been observed in the b-cell receptor repertoire at gestational week 22 114. it is tempting to speculate that foetal immune prim- ing with maternal microbial products could be at least partially responsible for this activation 12 38 39 table 2.microbial transmission from mother to offspring during deliverymaternal to offspring transmission of microbes is an evolutionarily preserved phenomenon in the animal kingdom which may play a critical role in evolutionary development by providing a geneti- cally tailored microbiota and optimal mutualism 48 61. in addition the microbial transmission may be accompanied by maternal immunomodify- ing factors such as antibodies transferred via placenta and milk fig.

deeper understanding of these interac- tions between the maternal and offspring micro- biome and immunity is needed to identify efficacious preventive measures to combat the allergy epidemic.keywords allergy immune development infancy maternal influences microbiota pregnancy.introductionallergic diseases including atopic dermatitis food allergy allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma have become a major public health problem in affluent societies affecting up to one-third of the popula- tion 1-3. these diseases are characterized by inappropriate immune responses to innocuous foreign proteins that is allergens 3. atopy is defined as an inherited tendency to produce ige antibodies to allergens after ordinary exposure that is to become sensitized 3 4. atopic individ- uals show excessive t helper th2-like responses to allergens including production of ige-inducing il-4 and il-13 and eosinophilia-enhancing il-5 5- 8. during the early phase of the ige-mediated allergic reaction allergen cross-linking of igeantibodies on mast cells triggers release of inflam- matory mediators 6-8. cytotoxic mediators from eosinophils play an important role in the late- phase reaction causing chronic inflammation 6-8.allergic diseases typically manifest in early child- hood with the so-called allergic march generally beginning with the development of ige antibodies to food allergens accompanied by symptoms of atopic dermatitis and food allergy 3 9 10. the ige reactivity to food allergens such as egg and cow's milk usually declines after infancy when tolerance to these allergens develops 3 9 10. later in childhood inhalant allergen sensitization develops together with symptoms of asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis 3 9 10. sensitized484a 2017 the association for the publication of the journal of internal medicinechildren with eczema and food allergy are at increased risk of developing airway allergies 3 9 10. asthma is the most common chronic disease amongst children with a major impact on the physiological and psychological well-being of young children 11 as well as on socio-economic costs due to treatment expenditures hospital admittance and parental sick leave 1.although genetic factors play an important role in individual susceptibility changes in the genotype cannot explain such a rapid increase in the allergy prevalence 2 9 12 13. thus loss of protective factors or appearance of risk factors in the envi- ronment must underlie the increasing prevalence of these diseases since the middle of the last century 2 9 12 13. reduced intensity and diversity of microbial stimulation have been pro- posed as major factors promoting abnormal post- natal immune maturation 2 9 12 13. as early as 1976 the canadian paediatrician john gerrard and co-workers suggested that allergic disease is the price for relative freedom from diseases caused by viruses bacteria and helminths 14. this hypothesis was based on the observation of low- allergy prevalence in indigenous populations in northern canada where helminth infection and untreated viral and bacterial diseases were com- mon compared with caucasian canadians living in urban environments 14. it was not until 1989 when the british epidemiologist david strachan demonstrated an inverse relationship between the risk of hay fever and the number of older siblings 15 that the notion that infections early in life might prevent allergy development was generally considered of interest.
