In support of an entero-mammary pathway maternal intestinal microbes have been detected in immune cells circulating in peripheral blood and in breastmilk in both lactating mice and humans 75.Do prenatal microbial exposures affect immune programmingDirect presentation of maternal bacterial compo- nents to the foetus has been recognized as a potential route for immune imprinting 12 38 39 as a way to prepare the neonatal immune system to respond appropriately to the much larger inoculum transferred during vaginal deliv- ery 31 61 64 74 76-85 and breastfeeding61 64 81 86-88.

Increased colonization with the opportunistic pathogen Clostridium difficile which expands when gut microbiota niches are vacant 126 has also been reported amongst infants born by CS in several studies 31 76 77.Impact of maternal immunity and the early infant microbiota on immune and allergy developmentThe effector functions of the innate and adaptive immune system are not yet fully developed at birth 119 127.

Encounters between microbes from this complex ecosystem and immune cells may have profound effects on immune maturation particularlya 2017 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine485Journal of Internal Medicine 2017 282 484-495during critical time windows of developmental programming 12 13 38 39 58-60.The first microbial encountersContrary to previous assumptions of a 'sterile womb' paradigm in which the acquisition of bac- teria first occurs at birth recent evidence suggests that the first interactions between the microbiota and the host may be initiated in utero 38 61-68.

The infant's own adaptive immune capabilities then gradually mature 12 119 131 concurrent with the estab- lishment of a gut microbiota of increasing com- plexity 64 142.The neonatal Th2 skewing is even more marked in infants who later develop allergic disease 131 134 143 144 corroborating the notion that theprenatal immune environment can influence allergy development 9 133.

Early establishment of a diverse gut microbiota providing repeated expo- sure to new bacterial antigens and a consistent immunomodulatory impact may be more impor- tant than the distribution of specific microbial species in shaping normal mucosal and systemic immune maturation 13.ConclusionEvidence from intervention trials epidemiological studies and experimental animal models suggests that perinatal microbial and immune interactions within the mother-offspring dyad influence child- hood allergy development.

Here the influence ofmicrobial and immune interactions within the mother-offspring dyad on childhood allergy devel- opment will be discussed and implications for strategies to reduce the high prevalence of allergy will be considered.Co-evolutionary interdependency of the microbiome and the immune systemNo animal has evolved independently of microbial symbionts 42-44.

Speculatively more pronounced effects of prenatal microbial exposures on adaptive immune responses in humans as compared with mice may be envisioned as the immune system matures at a faster rate in humans than in rodents prior to birth 103 104.

Development of immune organs and functioning in humans and test ani- mals Implications for immune intervention studies.

Deeper understanding of these interac- tions between the maternal and offspring micro- biome and immunity is needed to identify efficacious preventive measures to combat the allergy epidemic.Keywords allergy immune development infancy maternal influences microbiota pregnancy.IntroductionAllergic diseases including atopic dermatitis food allergy allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma have become a major public health problem in affluent societies affecting up to one-third of the popula- tion 1-3.

It is tempting to speculate that foetal immune prim- ing with maternal microbial products could be at least partially responsible for this activation 12 38 39 Table 2.Microbial transmission from mother to offspring during deliveryMaternal to offspring transmission of microbes is an evolutionarily preserved phenomenon in the animal kingdom which may play a critical role in evolutionary development by providing a geneti- cally tailored microbiota and optimal mutualism 48 61.
