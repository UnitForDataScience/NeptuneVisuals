the monomeric sugar com- positions of pectin extracts and the sample purity were assessed using high-performance anion-exchange chroma- tography coupled with pulsed electrochemical detection hpaec-pad chromatography and nuclear magnetic res- onance nmr spectroscopy table s1 available in the online version of this article  .cell morphology motility and the presence of capsular pol- ysaccharides were investigated using transmission electron microscopy tem and phase-contrast microscopy.

the g-c content of dna was determined as part of whole- genome sequencing using an illumina hiseq 2500 macro- gen. pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene of strain 14t was achieved using universal primers 8f 5c-agagtttga tcctggctcag-3c and 1510r 5c-ggttaccttgttacgactt-3c .

pcr was performed using an appliedbiosystems geneamp pcr system 9700. pcr products were purified using qiaquick pcr purification kit qia- gen according to the manufacturer's instructions.

with the exception of d-fructose strain 14t utilized a narrow spectrum of substrates which were either pectin or monosaccharides of pectin and hemi- cellulose arabinose xylose and galacturonic acid.

fresh stool was weighed and 5 g of stool was mixed with anaerobically prepared phosphate buffered saline pbs solution to make a 10  faecal slurry.

pectin is a major non-cellulosic component of plant cell wall polysaccharides comprising approximately one third of the cell wall dryweight of dicotyledons and non-poales monocotyledon plants and 0.5-4  of the fresh weight of edible plant mate- rials .

current understanding of the microbial degra- dation of pectin in the human colon is limited to a narrow taxonomic spectrum of organisms almost exclusively species .

as a result our knowledge of the pro- cess of pectin degradation is largely derived from studying the sequestration system of species.
