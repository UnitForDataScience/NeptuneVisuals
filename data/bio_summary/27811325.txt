Five experimen- tal wheat-based diets were formulated as follows soy- bean meal SBM diet high CM diet with normal AA concentration and high CM diets with 3 6 or 9 additional AA concentration Lys MetCys Thr Ile Arg and Val.

Thus high inclu- sion of CM in the diet may influence microbiota profile of the gut through alterations to the flow of unabsorbed nutrients in the GIT although the implications of these changes have not been reported in the literature.Therefore in view of the dearth of data the objec- tives of this study were to determine if reduced feed intake of birds fed high CM diets per se accounts for growth depression and whether this lower growth rate can be attenuated by increasing dietary digestible amino acid levels and to evaluate the effect of experi- mental diets on nutrient digestibility carcass traits ce- cal microbiota composition and serum metabolites.MATERIALS AND METHODSFeed IngredientsCold-pressed canola meal was obtained from Coota- mundra Oilseeds in New South Wales Australia.
