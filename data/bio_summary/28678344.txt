Similarly 16 strains of Lactobacillus species consist- ing of 12 strains recovered from human intestinal contents and 4 ATCC Lactobacillus type strains were studied.

These and other microbial metabolites were found to selectively inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and stimulate the growth of beneficial microorganisms Madureira and others 2016.Growth stimulatory effectTable 2 illustrates the growth stimulatory effect of spice extracts on 17 strains of Bifidobacterium and 16 strains of Lactobacillus.

Data revealed that all spice extracts were inactive against all Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus isolates with MIC of 9 mgmL except that BLP was active against 1 Lactobacillus acidophilus and 1 Lactobacillus gasseri strain with MIC of 6.82 mgmL and 1 L. gasseri and 1 L. johnsonii strain with MIC of 9 mgmL.

Further the concen- trations resulting in the change of the appearance of growth as compared to the control plate were recorded to establish for each test strain the concentration where the tested spice had no effect on the growth where the spice stimulated the growth and where the growth stimulation by the test spice reached a plateau Li and others 2015a.Statistical analysisChemical analysis and antioxidant assay were carried out in trip- licate and data were presented as mean standard deviation SD.

Altogether 17 strains of Bifidobacterium species consisting of 11 strains recovered from human intestinal contents and 6 ATCC Bifidobacterium type strains were studied.

At 2.25 mgmL 1 strain was stimulated by BLP 4 by GIN and 6 by ORE. At4.5 mgmL 7 strains were stimulated by BLP 10 by CAP 6 by GIN 4 by ORE and 1 by TUR.Of the 16 Lactobacillus strains tested the growth of 1 strain was enhanced by BLP and another one by CAP at the concentration of 0.56 mgmL.

U.S.A. plates containing serial dilutions of each spice extract and control plates without the tested spice were prepared Hecht and others 2012 Jousimies- Somer and others 2012.

The antioxidant capacity of spice extracts correlated well with the total chemical concentration r 0.86 r2 0.74.Results from our chemical investigations indicated that most spice extracts contain either moderate or high content of spice- specific phytochemicals.
