In the periodontitis BoP The 13 communities that passed the neutrality exact tests with Etienne sampling formula with 1000 artificially simulated communities.J the total number of reads in the sample S the number of species in the sample th fundamental biodiversity number m migration probability p-value calculated from the log-likelihood ratio test and p-value adjusted the p-value adjusted with multiple testing correction procedure.treatment 22.73 522 of the samples satisfied the neutral prediction in the periodontitis non-BoP treatment 27.27 622 of the samples passed the neutrality exact test and in the healthy control treatment 17.65 317 of the samples passed the test.

The p-value calculated follows a Chi-Squared distribution with the degree of freedom of one.After the comparison we adopted an exact neutrality test method  to test the neutrality of samples i.e.

The parameters and test results of the community samples that passed the neutrality test were listed in below and the results of all samples were listed in the online Supplementary  Tables.

The BoP is likely caused by the formation of plaque at the gingiva due to multiple reasons such as poor oral hygiene condition and improper tooth brushing.The culture-dependent method for studying the oral microbiome is neither effective nor efficient though it is often considered as the most reliable method.

The dysbiosis asso- ciated with periodontitis may simply be the sufficiently dramatic phenotypic changes but the direction of the link between dysbiosis and disease is yet to determine by future studies.DiscussionIn early days oral diseases were attributed to a handful of specific pathogens in the oral micro- bial community.

The parameter th can be estimated via maximum likelihood estimation MLE method .The second formula was developed by Etienne  and is considered as one of the best per- formed sampling approach to test the neutral theory.

The test is 'exact' since type I error can be exactly specified .Computationally we utilized a standard R-package UNTB Unified Neutral Theory of Bio- diversity freely available at  that implemented the MLE method for estimating the parameters of both Ewens and Etienne for- mulae in terms of the observed samples.

iii The meanvalue of the likelihoods Ps of 100 artificial datasets for each sample and the likelihood P0 of the corresponding observed sample are compared using the log-likelihood ratio test under the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between P0 and Ps.
