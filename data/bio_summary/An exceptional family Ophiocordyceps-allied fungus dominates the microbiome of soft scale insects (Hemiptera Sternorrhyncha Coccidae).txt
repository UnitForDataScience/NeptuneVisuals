a few microscopy studies found yeast-like symbionts yls in the hae- molymph and fat body of a few coccid species as well as evidence of vertical transmission brues  glaser 1921 steinhaus 1955. several yls species were reported in the mediterranean black scale saissetia oleae olivier with different life stages differing in symbiont composition zacchi  vaughan-martini 2002 2003. a recent study found bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae in several coccid species as well as in species belonging to other families in the superfamily coccoidea rosenblueth sayavedra samano-sanchez roth  martinez-romero 2012. despite these pieces of informa- tion the identity of the ps of soft scale insects remains unknown.

the pcr conditions for both primers were optimized and are specified in table 2. pcr products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5 agarose gels stained with gel red and visualized under uv light.2.3.1  phylogenetic analysesto test whether the phylogenies of the coccid hosts and oaf the fungus that has emerged as the main primary symbiont candidate as will be detailed below in the results section are congruent we sequenced fragments of oaf 18s ribosomal dna 400-600 bp oaf 18s-its 800-900 bp and oaf rna polymerase ii largest sub- unit rpb1 genes 730-740 bp and a 700-800 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i coi gene of the coccid hosts.

in both nymphs and eggs oaf exhibits a single-celled yeast-like anamorph growth stage very similar to the fungi found in other species of coccidae steinhaus 1955 tremblay 1997. it looks like oaf stopped pro- ducing stromata remaining in an anamorph-like state sacrificing its filamentous morphology undergoing evolutionary convergence that has left it resembling saccharomycetes resembling again the yls of planthoppers cheng  hou 2001. the presence of oaf in the eggs figure 4 strongly suggests vertical transmission of this symbiont from mother to offspring.

thus further research is needed to elucidate the exact transmission mechanism of oaf in coccids.how the oaf symbiont affects its soft scale insects is currently unknown.

notably some of the otus were identified as buchn- era the primary symbiont of aphids tremblaya and moranella the primary symbionts of mealybugs and uzinura the primary symbiont of armoured scales.

2016 lavy sher malik  chiel 2015. here no specific bac- terium was ubiquitous in all the tested coccid species in the high- throughput sequencing table 3 whereas oaf was prevalent in all the species and was the most dominant fungus i.e.

further research is required to know if o. coccidiicola and the oaf found in our study represent the same species or two closely related species.

18s rrna sequence places them within one of two previously recovered clades of yeast-like symbionts of leafhoppers nishino tanahashi lin koga  fukatsu 2016 planthoppers noda naka- shima  koizumi 1995 and one species of aphid fukatsu  ishi- kawa 1996 marked with asterisks in figure 2. interestingly oaf from our samples appear to also be closely related to o. coccidiicola and o. cochlidiicola previously reported as coccid and moth para- sites respectively nikoh  fukatsu 2000.we also constructed a phylogram of soft scale mitochondrial coi gene figure 3. relationships among scale taxa within the genus ceroplastes and related genera are well resolved at this marker and are not congruent with the relationships shown in the fungal phylo- genies although the latter are considerably less resolved.

2016. one additional option is that oaf has been acquired by one or a few coccid species and then horizontally transferred to other lineages.with the exception of one lineage of aphids gibson  hunter 2010 hongoh  ishikawa 2000 vogel  moran 2013 each family in the large suborder sternorrhyncha relies on a bacterial primary symbionts to supplement its dietary needs including closely related families within the diverse superfamily coccoidea baumann 2005dhami turner deines beggs  taylor 2012 douglas 2015 michalik szklarzewicz kalandyk-kolodziejczyk jankowska  micha- lik 2016 moran et al.

the first records of fungal symbionts in coccids go back to the second half of the 19th century including some publications by paul buchner in the early 20th century see summary in tremblay 1997. brues and glaser 1921 isolated fungal symbionts from pulvinaria innumerabilis rathvon and found that this symbiont produces proteolytic and lypolytic enzymes suggesting a nutritional andor metabolic role.
