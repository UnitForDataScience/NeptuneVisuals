PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5 agarose gels stained with Gel Red and visualized under UV light.2.3.1  Phylogenetic analysesTo test whether the phylogenies of the coccid hosts and OAF the fungus that has emerged as the main primary symbiont candidate as will be detailed below in the results section are congruent we sequenced fragments of OAF 18S ribosomal DNA 400-600 bp OAF 18S-ITS 800-900 bp and OAF RNA polymerase II largest sub- unit RPB1 genes 730-740 bp and a 700-800 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I COI gene of the coccid hosts.

Despite the obligate nature of the association replace- ment of a PS is not uncommon Husnik  McCutcheon 2016 Koga Bennett Cryan  Moran 2013 Sudakaran Kost  Kaltenpoth 2017 including an example of several aphid species within the sub- family Cerataphidinae in which the bacterium B. aphidicola has been replaced by a yeast-like symbiont as a PS Fukatsu Shigeyuki Utako Ishikawa 1994 Vogel  Moran 2013.While bacterial symbionts of sap-sucking insects have been extensively studied in the last 25 years fungal symbionts have received less attention.

The Wolbachia and Rickettsia that were found in high relative abundance in C. flori- densis and M. mangiferae respectively are likely secondary sym- bionts of these species as they often are in other sternorrhynchan families e.g.

The mould fungus Cladosporium which was also found in all the species in the high-throughput sequencing was much less abundant 1-26 of the total OTUs than OAF and was not detected in all individuals.

The common transmission mechanism of PS in other sternorrhynchan families is trans-ovarial but in coccids the mechanism may be different due to i identity--OAF is a fungus not a bacterium ii distribution--bacterial PS in other sternorrhynchan insects are intracellular and are aggre- gated in bacteriomes whereas OAF may be extracellular and scat- tered throughout most of the host's body.

Here no specific bac- terium was ubiquitous in all the tested coccid species in the high- throughput sequencing Table 3 whereas OAF was prevalent in all the species and was the most dominant fungus i.e.

Further research is required to know if O. coccidiicola and the OAF found in our study represent the same species or two closely related species.
