The three-dimensional structure of Est8 was determined at 1.85-A resolution allowing theElectronic supplementary material The online version of this articledoi4 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.characterization of the substrate-binding pocket and features that rationalize the preference of Est8 for short-chain sub- strates.

The functional and structural characterization of Est8 is explored in comparison with orthologues.Keywords Esterase .

The DNA of PL17.E10 was subcloned se- quenced and annotated.

The three-dimensional structure of the protein was solved by crystallography and compared with other esterases in terms of residues from the ligand-binding site catalytic activity and characteristics of internal cavity.

The alignment file was submitted to Mr. Bayes 3.2 Ronquist et al.

The tree was constructed using maximum likelihood method with a bootstrap of 1000 repli- cates and the Whelan and Goldman WAG matrix of amino acid substitution.

The forward 5' CGCGGAAT TCACA ATG GCACTCG ATC 3 '  and reverse  5 ' CGGG AAGCTTCCTCACGCCAGCGCC 3' oligonucleo- tides were used for the fragment amplification and insertion of the EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes sites underlined respectively in the start and final of the gene.

The PCR product was directly cloned into pET28a plasmid Novagen Gibbstown NJ USA to generate the pET28a-est8 vector.

The expressed protein from this construct presented a N-terminal His-tagged for further purification confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis.

The mutagenesis was performed using two overlapping oligonucleotides 5' GACGGCGT GATCTGGTTCGGCGATC 3' and 5' GATCGCCGAACCAGATCACGCCGTC 3' that introduced the muta- tions in two steps of PCR reaction.
