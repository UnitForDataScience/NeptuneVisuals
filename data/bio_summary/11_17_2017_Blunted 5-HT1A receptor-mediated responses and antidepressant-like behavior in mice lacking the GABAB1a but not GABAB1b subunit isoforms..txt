In the present study there was a lack of or negligible influence of deletion of either GABAB1 isoforms on 5-HT1A receptor bind- ing density as determined with either a 5-HT1A receptor ago- nist or antagonist despite the demonstrated complete loss of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor physiological function in the GABA -- mice.

Furthermore the influence of GABAB1a isoform ablation on 5-HT1A receptor desensitization appeared to be largely independent from the level of 5-HT1A receptor expression.

Neither changes in 5- HT1A receptor expression nor postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor G-protein coupling appear to contribute to these differences.It is interesting to consider the possibility that the GABAB1a isoform may also be expressed at serotonin neuron terminals and gating 5-HT release as is the case in the gluta- matergic system Perez-Garci et al.
