at overdosed fe and al concentrations theincreased cod removal and decreased oxygen uptake might be due to the inhibitionof catabolism and metabolic uncoupling with increased adsorption of cod -imparting substrate components onto the bacterial cell walls .different from the micronutrients of zn co and mo the chemical effects of fe and alin terms of flocculation were observed during the experimental process.

moreover little is known about the role of micronutrients onmicrobial community during activated sludge treatment of dyeing wastewater.the objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the individual effects ofmicronutrients on cod removal and respiration rates specific oxygen uptake ratessour during activated sludge treatment of dyeing wastewater 2 evaluate thecombined effects of micronutrients on cod removal rate with response surfacemethodology rsm 3 characterize the microbial community in biomass dosed withmicronutrient by high-throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing.

the experimental results of combinedcod removal efficiency are shown in table s2.with cod reduction as the response the response surfaces and the contour plots ofthe quadratic model with one variable kept at a constant level and the other twovarying within the predetermined ranges are shown in figure 2.as to the individual effects of added trace element concentration at constant znconcentration of 0.2 mgl 0.35 mgl and 0.5 mgl the overall cod removal ratesachieved at 0.35 mgl zn was higher than those at 0.2 mgl zn and 0.5 mgl znfigure 2a 2b and 2c.

for individual co dose the highest cod removal 88and oxygen uptake rate 179 mg o2  g mlss hr were attained by the dose of 4mgl co to the mixed liquor figure 1b.for individual mo dose the largest improvement in dyeing wastewater treatment wasachieved with the dose of 0.3 mgl mo to the mixed liquor resulting in a 85 codremoval rate and oxygen uptake rate of 176 mg o2  g mlss hr figure 1c.

the effects of combing zn co and mo at different doses wereinvestigated using response surface methodology with a second order polynomial12equation y  78.19 0.17x1  37.33 x2 20.20x3 - 5.58x1x2 -63.05 x2x3 where ymeans cod removal rate  x1 means co concentration x2 means znconcentration x3 means mo concentration.

at constant mo concentration of 0.2 mgl and 0.5 mgl the overall codremoval rate at 0.2 mgl mo was higher than that at 0.5 mgl mo figure 2f and 2g.the range change of zn co and mo concentrations associated with different codremoval efficiency indicated a range of stimulatory and toxic effects and this can besupported by the results of burgess et al.

the whole acclimation period was divided into three phases 1 phase 1 theorganic loading is 20 mg cod  g mlss d for 8 days d 2 phase ii the organicloading is 50 mg cod  g mlss d for 4 d 3 phase iii the organic loading is 120mg cod  g mlss d for 5 d pala et al.

the organic loading was 120 mg cod  gmlss d. to investigate micronutrients combined effects on cod removal efficiencyall the similar operation conditions as described above were applied except for thedosed micronutrient type and concentration as listed in table s2.the volume of mixed liquor activated sludge dyeing wastewater and micronutrientsolution was 370 ml with mlss of 1500 - 60 mgl and dissolved oxygen do of7.98 mgl.

triplicates were conducted for each sample.results and discussion3.1 individual effect of micronutrients on treatment efficiencythe trends of cod removal and sour were relatively similar for tests withmicronutrients doses of zn co and mo figure 1a 1b and 1c.

a summary of interactive of added micronutrients isshown in table 1.by applying least squares regression analysis the cod removal efficiency was fittedcorrelated with the three independent variables zn co and mo concentrations basedon the actual value using a polynomial equation eq.1.
