However P. intermedia was showed a statisti- cal difference between the case group and control group with positive rate of 94.73 in cases and 31.58 in controls P0.01 T. forsythia was detected in 63.16 of case group and 26.31 of control group with a significant difference P0.05.At T2 the frequencies of pathogens in the case group were 89.50 for A. actinomycetemco- mitans 73.68 for P. gingivalis 52.63 for P. intermedia 47.39 for T. forsythia and no sig- nificant difference between the two groups P0.05.

However PD was still higher in case group than that in control group P0.01.DiscussionThe previous studies on the periodontal pathogens of orthodontic patients mostly focused on the prevalence of pathogens using regular PCR with very little information on the exact quantitative variation.

intermedia T. forsythia and total bacteria with the 16S rRNA based real-time PCR and tested the clinical parameters in adolescents among different time points after orthodontic treatment to assess whether the microbial and periodontal parameters could be reversible after removal of orthodontic appliances.Materials and methodsEthics statementThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Jinan Stomatological Hospital and School of Stomatology Shandong University.

The tubes were stored at -20C until analyzed.We selected the lower incisors as sampling sites because 1 it's been reported that both upper posterior teeth and anterior teeth had higher prevalence of periodontopathogens and could be the representative for study of oral microbiology  moreover it is relatively conve- nient and easy to avoid inclusion of saliva when collecting samples from anterior teeth 2Gingival hyperplasia often occurs at the posterior and canine teeth in orthodontic patients with teeth extraction which is attributed to teeth movement and orthodontic force rather than the gingivitis so the clinical periodontal parameters and microbial parameters might be incon- sistent on this occasion.

Nevertheless taking into account the small sam- ple size in the present study there is a need to further investigate clinical and microbiologic changes after orthodontic therapy with large samples.ConclusionRemoval of orthodontic appliances resulted in significant reduction in P. intermedia P. gingi- valis and T. forsythia in subgingival plaque associated with an obvious improvement in clinical periodontal parameters.

Thus it is reasonable to focus on the numbers of peri- odontopathogens to prevent periodontal diseases in orthodontic patients.In terms of sampling time different reports mainly focused on changes of periodontal path- ogens at 1 month  3 months  or 6 months period  at different sites of denture following appliances removal.

The prevalence and counts of periodontopathogens tend to be normal P0.05 while PD and the amount of P.interme- dia were still significantly higher compared with that of the control group P0.05 or P0.01.ConclusionAfter removal of appliances the periodontal changes induced by orthodontic therapy are only partially reversible at 3 months after removal.conflict of interest.

All parameters were reassessed after 1 month T1 and 3 months T2 in the case group and compared with that of the controls.ResultsAt baseline T0 clinical parameters including GI PD SBI of the test sites in the case group were significantly higher than that of the control group P0.05 or P0.01.

Therefore it is crucial to understand the composition and changes of periodontopathogens during orthodontic therapy in order to avoid potentially irreversible inju- ries caused by orthodontic appliances.In this study we quantify subgingival pathogens of A. actinomycetemcomitans P. gingivalisP.
