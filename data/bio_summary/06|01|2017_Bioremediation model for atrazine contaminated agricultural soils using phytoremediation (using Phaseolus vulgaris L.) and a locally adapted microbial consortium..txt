Two atrazine concentrations Gesaprim 50FWTM technical grade were prepared as follows i 1000 mg L1 16.6 mg 50 g1 soil and ii 2000 mg L1 33.3 mg 50 g1 soil.In total there 35 experimental groups were used comprised of seven treatments with five replicates each.

BT was the best treat- ment for herbicide removal.Atrazine removal from the 2000 mg L1 33.3 mg atrazine 50 g1 soil treatment was greater compared to that from the 1000 mg L1 16.6 mg atrazine 50 g1 soil treatment in terms of concentration and time .

was consistently the best candidate for bioremediation of atrazine over time removing 447.1 mg L1 of atrazine from an initial concentration of 500 mg L1 which is the equivalent of 8.9 mg of atrazine per 50 g of soil.

Finally the negative control NC eliminated 6.5 mg and posi- tive control PC eliminated 14.74 mg of atrazine 50 g1 soil after 40 days  .The results obtained in this study are comparable to otherControl PC2.940recent experiments from Dehghani et al.where they reportedInitial concentration 16.6 mg 50 g1 soil greenhouse BeanTrichoderma sp.

Working solutions for the atrazine calibration curve were 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 and 0.8 mg mL1 prepared from the stock solution of 1 mg mL1 98 atrazine standard analytical reagent by dilution with HPLC grade acetonitrile.Obtained HPLC values were adjusted to Eq.

the greatest rate of degradation occurred on day 10 decreasing at day 20 and peaked at8.35 mg 50 g1 soil 417.5677 mg L1 at day 40.

is different from that reported by Przybulewska and Sienicka where the same microorganism mineralized atrazine to NH3 and CO2 from an initial concentration of 2.5 mg 50 g1 soil to 1 PS 103 mg g 1Table 1.
