is different from that reported by przybulewska and sienicka where the same microorganism mineralized atrazine to nh3 and co2 from an initial concentration of 2.5 mg 50 g1 soil to 1 ps 103 mg g 1table 1. atrazine removal from soil by different bioaugmentation treatments at different time.figure 2. atrazine removal percentage initial concentration 10 mg atrazine 50 g1 soil by rhizobium sp.

finally the negative control nc eliminated 6.5 mg and posi- tive control pc eliminated 14.74 mg of atrazine 50 g1 soil after 40 days  .the results obtained in this study are comparable to othercontrol pc2.940recent experiments from dehghani et al.where they reportedinitial concentration 16.6 mg 50 g1 soil greenhouse beantrichoderma sp.

two atrazine concentrations gesaprim 50fwtm technical grade were prepared as follows i 1000 mg l1 16.6 mg 50 g1 soil and ii 2000 mg l1 33.3 mg 50 g1 soil.in total there 35 experimental groups were used comprised of seven treatments with five replicates each.

bt was the best treat- ment for herbicide removal.atrazine removal from the 2000 mg l1 33.3 mg atrazine 50 g1 soil treatment was greater compared to that from the 1000 mg l1 16.6 mg atrazine 50 g1 soil treatment in terms of concentration and time .

the greatest rate of degradation occurred on day 10 decreasing at day 20 and peaked at8.35 mg 50 g1 soil 417.5677 mg l1 at day 40. this result places the bacteria second in terms of bioaugmentation treat- ments and the mixed culture of rhizobium trichoderma ranked third overall.proportionally as seen in  trichoderma sp.

the decision to interrupt the greenhouse experiment was made due to the physical stress responses exhibited by the bean plants since experimental duration proved to be limited by the plants ability to survive.table 3. atrazine removal at laboratory and greenhouse assays.treatmentsatrazine removal mg 50 g1 daysinitial concentration 10 mg 50 g1 soil laboratorytrichoderma sp.

was consistently the best candidate for bioremediation of atrazine over time removing 447.1 mg l1 of atrazine from an initial concentration of 500 mg l1 which is the equivalent of 8.9 mg of atrazine per 50 g of soil.

the treatments were carried out as follows three pre-ger- minated seeds were used per bag and were planted in 1000 mg l1 of atrazine contaminated soils inoculated with the respective microorganisms biomass 33 ml of rhizobium sp.

in both cases the given values are similar to the experimental results presented here.the negative control nonsterile soil showed a progressive growth decrease from 1 104 to 1 102 cfu g1 of soil after 15 days.bioremediation of atrazine contaminated soiltreatments of 10 mg of atrazine 50 g1 soil under laboratory conditions showed significant differences a 0.05 between treatments from the fifth day and until day 20. at the end of the experiment 40 days the amount of atrazine eliminated by trichoderma sp.

the results can be summarized as follows i significant differences were found among the four treatments beantrichoderma bt beanrhizobium br beanrhizobiumtricho- derma brt and bean b compared to the controls ii the treatment of that included only the bean plant b eliminated 24.44 and 52.02 of the atrazine in the soil which corre- sponds to 16.6 and 33.3 mg of atrazine 50 g1 soil respectively and iii a combination of phytoremediation bean plant bioaugmentation with trichoderma sp.
