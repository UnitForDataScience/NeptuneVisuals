Several studies demonstrated that a single orally administrated bacteriophage or bacteriophage cocktail reduced the levels of pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of sheep or mice experimentally infected with E. coli     and decreased the rate of diarrhea and the mortality of poultry in farms  .Rabbits have suffered from colibacillosis caused by enteropathogenic E. coli EPEC since the beginning of the 1980s  .

In this study 45 rabbits were equally divided into three groups after they were orally inoculated with pathogenic Escherichia coli to induce gut infection.

The result of microscopic examination of the ileum showed that E. coli ZR1 adhered to villi and caused hemorrhage inside the villi.

The results demonstrated that oral administration of bacteriophage can cure gut infection with minimal impact on the cecal microbiota.Keywords bacteriophage phage therapy rabbit colibacillosis microbiotaINTRODUCTIONColibacillosis caused by pathogenic Escherichia coli and characterized by diarrhea or systematic infection is a common bacteriosis and generates huge economic losses in the animal husbandry industry.

The control group Group C comprised 15 rabbits free of experimental infection with E. coli.

coli ZR1.

Three days after treatments all rabbits were weighed bled for blood samples and killed for cecal contents collection.Histology of Ileum after E. coliExperimental InfectionAnother two rabbits were sacrificed 3 days after oral infection with E. coli in order to investigate whether ZR1 could adhere to the villi of the small intestine.

The LPS concentrations were calculated by the standard curve method .Quantitative Real-Time PCR qRT-PCR of eaeADNA from 0.2 g of cecal contents from each sample was extracted using a QIAampQR fast DNA stool mini kit QIAGENQR Co. Ltd Germany according to the manufacturer's instructions.The target sequence quantified was a fragment 384 bp of eaeA gene from E. coli ZR1.

85-23 revised 1996 and was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.RESULTSAdhesion of E. coli ZR1 to the Ileal EpitheliaIntestinal sections from the two rabbits used to investigate ZR1 adherence demonstrated colonization of the ZR1 on villi .

The integrity of the epithelia was indistinct and debris attached to E. coli was observed which indicated inflammation and hemorrhage.Status of Rabbits in Stage 1Slight reduction of body weight was observed in the infected group.
