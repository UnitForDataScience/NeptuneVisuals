c. Among them Bacteroides 18.83 - 1.98 and Escherichia-Shigella 13.52 - 1.66 were the most abundant bac- terial genera in the hindgut of newborn calves.Taxonomic composition of the hindgut mucosa-attached microbiota and shifts during pre-weaningIn total 16 phyla were identified from mucosa-attached com- munities of the hindgut Dataset S2a Supporting Informationand seven were considered as detected phyla Table S3a Sup- porting Information in the hindgut of pre-weaned calves.

In addi-tion the relative abundances of Bacteroides 9.28 - 0.59 at D7 4.64 - 0.59 at D21 4.51 - 0.59 at D42 P  0.01 Megasphaera2.72 - 0.24 at D7 0.32 - 0.24 at D21 0.26 - 0.24 at D42P  0.01 Escherichia-Shigella 3.67 - 0.33 at D7 0.98 - 0.33 atD21 0.98 - 0.33 at D42 P  0.01 and Salmonella 0.51 - 0.05at D7 0.13 - 0.05 at D21 0.12 - 0.05 at D42 P  0.03were highest at D7.

Values represents mean of three hindgut regions.0.33 - 0.06 for D42 P  0.01 and Ruminococcus 10.14 - 0.02for D7 0.22 - 0.02 for D21 0.27 - 0.02 for D42 P  0.01P  0.01 were higher at D21 and D42 than those at D7 Table .Comparison between mucosa- and digesta-associated bacterial communitiesAmong all the bacterial genera detected in the hindgut 45 of them were present in both mucosa- and digesta-associated communities.

It was surprising that no significant cor- relation was found between the relative abundance of digesta- associated bacteria and SCFA concentration in this study sug- gesting that future analysis using the quantitative approach is needed to verify the relationship between lumen microbes and SCFA and to verify whether the lumen SCFA is important in the potential cross-talk between microbes.The higher SCFA concentrations at D21 compared with D42 and D7 including acetate butyrate and total SCFA in the hindgut indicate the stronger fermentation ability of hindgut microbiota at D21 compared with D7 and D42.

Among all the detected families the relative abundances of Bacteroidaceae 9.28 - 0.59 at D7 4.64 - 0.59 at D21 4.51 - 0.59 at D42P  0.01 Enterobacteriaceae 4.99 - 0.45 at D7 1.35 - 0.45at D21 1.39 - 0.45 at D42 P  0.01 and Bifidobacteriaceae1.06 - 0.14 at D7 0.18 - 0.14 at D21 0.15 - 0.14 at D42P  0.06 were higher at D7 compared with D21 and D42.

Therefore the lower concentration of SCFA in the hindgut at D7 suggests po- tential lower immune function and the importance to enhance gut health at this stage.Microbial amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism are crucial functions in the hindgut which provide energy to the host McNeil .

coli was the highest at D7 0.07 - 0.01 while the proportion of Clostridium cluster XIVa was higher at D21 2.90 - 0.32 and D42 compared with that at D7 2.75 - 0.29.Predicted function of the hindgut microbiota in pre-weaned calves using Tax4FunTax4Fun-based functional prediction revealed top 10 micro- bial functions of the mucosa- and digesta-associated hindgutSong et al.9communities.

On the other hand the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae 17.46 - 1.03 at D7 25.07 - 1.03 at D21 23.85 - 1.03 at D42P  0.01 and Ruminococcaceae 15.59 - 0.84 at D7 20.10 - 0.84at D21 19.67 - 0.84 at D42 P  0.03 were higher at D21and D42 compared with those at D7 Table S3e Supporting Information.At genus level 50 genera were considered as detected out of the 249 identified genera.
