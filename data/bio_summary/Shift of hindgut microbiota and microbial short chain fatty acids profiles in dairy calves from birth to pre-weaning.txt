Among them Bacteroides 18.83 - 1.98 and Escherichia-Shigella 13.52 - 1.66 were the most abundant bac- terial genera in the hindgut of newborn calves.Taxonomic composition of the hindgut mucosa-attached microbiota and shifts during pre-weaningIn total 16 phyla were identified from mucosa-attached com- munities of the hindgut Dataset S2a Supporting Informationand seven were considered as detected phyla Table S3a Sup- porting Information in the hindgut of pre-weaned calves.

It was surprising that no significant cor- relation was found between the relative abundance of digesta- associated bacteria and SCFA concentration in this study sug- gesting that future analysis using the quantitative approach is needed to verify the relationship between lumen microbes and SCFA and to verify whether the lumen SCFA is important in the potential cross-talk between microbes.The higher SCFA concentrations at D21 compared with D42 and D7 including acetate butyrate and total SCFA in the hindgut indicate the stronger fermentation ability of hindgut microbiota at D21 compared with D7 and D42.
