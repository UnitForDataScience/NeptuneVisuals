The TANFAN values in all reactors were found to be very high 5.6-6.9 NH4AN g L-1 0.50-0.84 NH3AN g L-1 and suchhigh values cause inhibitory effects on the activity of microorgan- isms .

The results obtained by various researchers show that the addition of zeolites to reactors can stimulate the biomass destruc- tion and methane release however most studies were performed in batch treatments and in the presence of lower values of TAN FAN than those detected in our reactors 5.6-6.9 g L-1 and 0.5-0.8 g L-1 for TAN and FAN respectively.

In the research described herein we found that an increase of zeolites concentra- tion up to 5.0 g L-1 increased the SBP in the CSTR running at con- stant high OLR of 3.5 gVS L-1 d-1 but again the TANFAN removal from 6.7 to 6.2-6.3 g L-1 was not very significant perhaps for ammonia removal the ammonium saturated zeolite should be replaced more frequently andor higher concentration of zeolites should be added.

Control reactor RC andreactor RH with the decreasing hydraulic retention time HRT had the comparable specificAvailable online 8 November 2016biogas production SBP with maximum values of 334-351 mL g-1during days 84-93 whilethe SBP from reactor with zeolites RZ was higher and achieved 426-432 mL g-1.Keywords Zeolites BiogasChicken manure Illumina sequencing 454 pyrosequencing T-RFLP analysisVS addedAttachments of microorganisms to zeolite particles as the operational environment exchanged cations released from zeolites as well as lower total ammonium nitrogen TAN levels observed in RZ 6.2-6.3 g L-1 days 71-93 compared to RC 6.6-6.9 g L-1 days 71-93 resulted in a more effective process in RZ.

In RZ thezeolites at concentrations of 5-10 g L-1 in mesophilic batch exper- iments stimulated the anaerobic digestion of poultry manure with the increase in volumetric biogas production the TAN and FAN levels in these experiments were below 4.5-4.0 and 0.3-0.4 g L-1 respectively.

Ammo- nium mitigation of liquid digested chicken slurry was also investi- gated in another work  where authors reported the reduction of TAN levels from 5.0 to 3.0 g L-1 at OLR of 2.0-3.0 gVS L-1 d-1.

demonstrated the effective biogas production from chicken manure at OLR of 1.9-4.7 gVS L-1 d-1 with the SBP rate of 420-550 mL g-1 in a mesophilic-thermophilic 37-53 degC two stage anaerobic system however the TAN values were detected at lower levels 4.0 g L-1 than observed in our study.

In another study found that mesophilic 38 degC CSTRs can be successfully oper- ated over the course of mono-digestion of chicken wastes at OLR of3.2 gVS L-1 d-1 and high TAN and FAN levels 4.9 and 0.52 g L-1 accordingly resulting in the SBP rate of 360-380 mL g-1.
