in the research described herein we found that an increase of zeolites concentra- tion up to 5.0 g l-1 increased the sbp in the cstr running at con- stant high olr of 3.5 gvs l-1 d-1 but again the tanfan removal from 6.7 to 6.2-6.3 g l-1 was not very significant perhaps for ammonia removal the ammonium saturated zeolite should be replaced more frequently andor higher concentration of zeolites should be added.

in rz thezeolites at concentrations of 5-10 g l-1 in mesophilic batch exper- iments stimulated the anaerobic digestion of poultry manure with the increase in volumetric biogas production the tan and fan levels in these experiments were below 4.5-4.0 and 0.3-0.4 g l-1 respectively.

ammo- nium mitigation of liquid digested chicken slurry was also investi- gated in another work  where authors reported the reduction of tan levels from 5.0 to 3.0 g l-1 at olr of 2.0-3.0 gvs l-1 d-1.

demonstrated the effective biogas production from chicken manure at olr of 1.9-4.7 gvs l-1 d-1 with the sbp rate of 420-550 ml g-1 in a mesophilic-thermophilic 37-53 degc two stage anaerobic system however the tan values were detected at lower levels 4.0 g l-1 than observed in our study.

in another study found that mesophilic 38 degc cstrs can be successfully oper- ated over the course of mono-digestion of chicken wastes at olr of3.2 gvs l-1 d-1 and high tan and fan levels 4.9 and 0.52 g l-1 accordingly resulting in the sbp rate of 360-380 ml g-1.

the tanfan values in all reactors were found to be very high 5.6-6.9 nh4an g l-1 0.50-0.84 nh3an g l-1 and suchhigh values cause inhibitory effects on the activity of microorgan- isms .

the results obtained by various researchers show that the addition of zeolites to reactors can stimulate the biomass destruc- tion and methane release however most studies were performed in batch treatments and in the presence of lower values of tan fan than those detected in our reactors 5.6-6.9 g l-1 and 0.5-0.8 g l-1 for tan and fan respectively.

in our previous work we revealed that zeo- lites added to a mesophilic cstr 2.5 g zeolites l-1 during an increase of the olr from 1.0-3.5 gvs l-1 d-1 partially removed tan however its removal was not so extensive enough to observe the increase in sbp .

differences in operating conditions of biogas reac- tors in particular the substrate differences as well as the higher ammonia concentrations up to 0.83 g nh3an l-1 or 6.92 g nh4- an l-1 are likely the reasons for the different effects of anaerobic parameters on these microorganisms.archaeal community structure and methanogenic activitythe taxonomic composition of the sampled three reactors in terms of archaea composition based on data obtained using pyrosequencing of archaeal 16s rrna gene amplicons v3-v4 16s rrna gene profiles is demonstrated in a. a total of 36279 ranging from 5391 to 7309 sequences without chi- meras were obtained after processing from six samples subsam- pled samples to the similar size 5400 reads.

compared to other methanogenic archaea methanosarcina species with their unique surface structure are quite robust towards different impairments of anaerobic systems they were also reported to be tolerant to high ammonia values up to 7.0 g l-1 and 0.8 g l-1 for tan and fan respectively  which is in the similar range as in the research described herein.

however aceticlastic methanogenesis accomplished by acclimatized methanosarcinaceae at high ammonium 5-7 nh4an g l-1 con- centrations was also demonstrated in batch tests   indicating the need for further investigation regarding the impact of various ammonia levels on the microbial community activity.in order to maximize the anaerobic digestion processes it isimportant to investigate the anaerobic microbiome and to clarify how these microbial communities respond to operational changes of biogas reactors.

in rc the tan and fan levels were higher than in rh and rz during the experimental period  6.9 and0.8 g l-1 at days 78-93 respectively.
