The risk of persistent wheeze or asthma was reduced by one third in the first 5 years of life among the children born to women who received fish oil supplementation .In light of the broad evidence of environmental dietary and genetic factors that affect the risk of develop- ing asthma the contribution of variations in early micro- biota of children associated with delivery route remains unknown.Microbiota Restoration in the Newborn Infant Born by Cesarean DeliveryThe microbiota of all infants born by cesarean delivery cannot be considered uniformly because some infants are born by cesarean delivery after onset of labor or the rup- ture of membrane whereas other infants are born before the onset of labor or before the rupture of membranes.

As the increase in the frequency of asthma atopic disease and immune disorders mirrors the increase in the rate of cesarean delivery the theory of vaginal seeding is to allow for proper colonization of the fetal gut and therefore reduce the subsequent risk of asthma atopic disease and immune disorders.

At this time vaginal seeding should not be performed outside the context of an institutional review board-approved research protocol until adequate data regarding the safety and benefit of the process become available.RecommendationsThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG makes the following recommendationsThe American College of Obstetricians and Gyne- cologists does not recommend or encourage vaginal seeding outside of the context of an institutional review board-approved research protocol and it is recommended that vaginal seeding otherwise not be performed until adequate data regarding the safety and benefit of the process become available.The American College of Obstetricians and Gyne- cologists only supports the performance of vaginal seeding in the context of an institutional review board-approved research protocol.Should a patient insist on performing the procedure herself a thorough discussion with the patient should be held acknowledging the potential risk of transfer- ring pathogenic organisms from the woman to the neonate.

Childhood exposure to environmental allergens air pollution and particulate matter and viral respiratory tract infections are all associated with an increased risk of developing childhood asthma .The risk of developing asthma has also been associ- ated with the type of bacteria contributing to the gut microbiota during the first 100 days of life.

Cesarean delivery also was associated with subsequent diagnosis of asthma OR 1.24 95 CI 1.01-1.53 this association was gen- der specific with a positive association restricted to girls OR for asthma in girls 1.53 95 CI 1.11-2.10 OR for asthma in boys 1.08 95 CI 0.81-1.43.

Children born by cesarean deliv- ery had a significantly increased risk of asthma systemic connective tissue disorders juvenile arthritis inflamma- tory bowel disease immune deficiencies and leukemia.

Infants born by cesarean delivery are known to have greater colonization with Clostridium within the first 3 weeks of life though not at 180 days 11.Recently factors have been identified that may reduce the risk of developing asthma including envi- ronmental exposures after birth and increased intake of n-3 fatty acids.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists only supports the performance of vaginal seeding in the context of an institutional review board- approved research protocol.ConclusionIt has been hypothesized that the increasing prevalence of childhood asthma atopic disease and other immune disorders may be the result of the increasing incidence of cesarean delivery which may prevent natural coloniza- tion of the neonatal gut with maternal vaginal flora.

This association between cesarean delivery and increased risk of several chronic immune diseases suggests a shared environmental risk factor in early life.
