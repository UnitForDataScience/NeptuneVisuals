the risk of an allergic rhinoconjunctivitis diagnosis wassignificantly higher in the children born by cesarean delivery than in those delivered vaginally adjusted odds ratio or 1.37 95 ci 1.14-1.63. cesarean delivery also was associated with subsequent diagnosis of asthma or 1.24 95 ci 1.01-1.53 this association was gen- der specific with a positive association restricted to girls or for asthma in girls 1.53 95 ci 1.11-2.10 or for asthma in boys 1.08 95 ci 0.81-1.43. children born to women who had repeat cesarean deliveries had an increased risk of developing allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or 1.78 95 ci 1.34-2.37. a similar increase was noted for asthma in girls or 1.83 95 ci 1.13-2.97 but not in boys or 1.08 95 ci 0.81-1.43 born to women with repeat cesarean deliveries .a retrospective review from the danish medical birth registry and the danish national patient registry analyzed health data of two million children born between 1977 and 2012. children born by cesarean deliv- ery had a significantly increased risk of asthma systemic connective tissue disorders juvenile arthritis inflamma- tory bowel disease immune deficiencies and leukemia.

the risk of persistent wheeze or asthma was reduced by one third in the first 5 years of life among the children born to women who received fish oil supplementation .in light of the broad evidence of environmental dietary and genetic factors that affect the risk of develop- ing asthma the contribution of variations in early micro- biota of children associated with delivery route remains unknown.microbiota restoration in the newborn infant born by cesarean deliverythe microbiota of all infants born by cesarean delivery cannot be considered uniformly because some infants are born by cesarean delivery after onset of labor or the rup- ture of membrane whereas other infants are born before the onset of labor or before the rupture of membranes.

as the increase in the frequency of asthma atopic disease and immune disorders mirrors the increase in the rate of cesarean delivery the theory of vaginal seeding is to allow for proper colonization of the fetal gut and therefore reduce the subsequent risk of asthma atopic disease and immune disorders.

a system- atic review of associations between mode of delivery and the diversity and colonization pattern of gut microbiota during the first year of infant life found that the diversity and colonization pattern were significantly associated with the mode of delivery from birth to 3 months of lifebut that the difference disappeared after 6 months .a small study of 60 randomly selected 7-year-old children 31 delivered by cesarean and 29 delivered vagi- nally assessed microbiota composition by determining fecal microbiota profiles using culture-independent fluo- rescent in situ hybridization and compared the respec- tive effects of delivery mode on gut microbiota .

a pilot study of 18 newborns 7 born vaginally and 11 by cesarean delivery and their mothers was conducted in an attempt to partially restore the microbiota of infants born by cesarean delivery using vaginal microbial transfer vagi- nal seeding .

four of the 11 infants born by cesarean delivery were exposed to vaginal fluids from gauze inocu- lated in the vaginas of their respective mothers who were negative for group b streptococci had no signs of vagi- nosis and had a vaginal ph less than 4.5 during the hour preceding cesarean delivery.

because this review did not identify differences in risk between children born by cesarean delivery with or without labor or by delivery with or without rupture of membranes the specific effect of the lack of fetal expo- sure to the maternal vaginal microbiota is unknown.

infants born by cesarean delivery are known to have greater colonization with clostridium within the first 3 weeks of life though not at 180 days 11.recently factors have been identified that may reduce the risk of developing asthma including envi- ronmental exposures after birth and increased intake of n-3 fatty acids.

this association between cesarean delivery and increased risk of several chronic immune diseases suggests a shared environmental risk factor in early life.

childhood exposure to environmental allergens air pollution and particulate matter and viral respiratory tract infections are all associated with an increased risk of developing childhood asthma .the risk of developing asthma has also been associ- ated with the type of bacteria contributing to the gut microbiota during the first 100 days of life.

this committee opinion has been prepared in response to this public interest.association between mode of delivery and allergic disordersthe incidence of cesarean delivery has increased dra- matically in the united states and in the rest of the indus- trialized world.

although the authors conclude that abnormal development of intestinal microbiota after cesarean delivery may continue beyond infancy the rela- tionship between vaginal birth clostridial colonization and asthma remains unclear.childhood asthmaasthma is the most prevalent pediatric chronic disease and it affects more than 300 million people .

the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists only supports the performance of vaginal seeding in the context of an institutional review board- approved research protocol.conclusionit has been hypothesized that the increasing prevalence of childhood asthma atopic disease and other immune disorders may be the result of the increasing incidence of cesarean delivery which may prevent natural coloniza- tion of the neonatal gut with maternal vaginal flora.
