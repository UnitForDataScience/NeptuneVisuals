however the average raw read counts for prevotella were not significantly different p  0.05 between the fatal brd average 212 standard deviation 446 cases and the lesion-free animals average 498 standard deviation 610.comparison of otu abundance between lung samples preserved with rnalater and frozen lung samplesthere were no differences in the relative abundances or the presence of bacterial otus within post-mortem lung tissue samples which were frozen at -80 degc immediately following collection and post-mortem lung tissue samples preserved with rnalater.comparison of otu abundance between dairy calves which died from brd and clinically healthy calves bacterial otus associated with brd including fusobac- terium mycoplasma trueperella and bacteroides and anotu not yet associated with brd leptotrichiaceae had greater relative abundances and were present more often among the lung tissue samples collected from the dairy calves which died from brd compared with the lung tis- sue samples collected from the clinically healthy h-f calves with no lung lesions p  0.05 additional file .leptotrichiaceae mycoplasma and pasteurellaceae had greater relative abundances p  0.05 additional file and were present more often p  0.05 among the lymph node tissue samples collected from the dairy calves which died from brd compared with the lymph node tissue samples collected from the clinically healthy h-f calves with no observable lung lesions.comparison of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and rvl qpcrthis 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing assay identified many more bacteria present in post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue from calves which died from brd thanwere identified from the same calves at the rvls using both culture and uniplex pcrs on swab samples from the pneumonic lungs additional file .

a detailed recent study was conducted on the lung microbiome in sheep but to our knowledge the present report is the first high throughput 16s amplicon sequencing study in lung and corresponding mediastinal lymph nodes in multiple cattle with brd.the cranial lung lobe tissue was chosen for investigation as it is the most common site of brd lesions  mediastinal lymph node tissue was also examined as re- spiratory disease causing viruses and bacteria often dis- seminate to these lymph nodes from the lungs - to gain an understanding of the bacteria associated with brd cases in ireland we analysed lung tissue from 'real' brd fatalities on a number of farms in three different regions of the country.

furthermore although mycoplasma arginine and mycoplasma bovirhinis did not cause pneumonia following inoculation into gnotobiotic calves these species have also been isolated from lav- age fluids of calves with recurrent respiratory disease and pneumonic lungs  and have been suggested to act as co-pathogens which may intensify respiratory disease symptoms  .ureaplasmaureaplasmas also belong to the same family as the mycoplasmas and are pathogenic bacteria which were initially associated with urogenital tract infections but have also been isolated from pneumonic bovine lungs the species ureaplasma diversum has been associated with clinical respiratory disease  as ureaplasma was found to be present in pneumonic lung tissue samples from calves which died from brd this genus may be an important contributor to brd which is often overlooked.bacterioidesbacterioides species are associated with bacterial pneu- monia they had high relative abundances within the post-mortem lung and lymph node tissue samples taken from beef and dairy calves which died from brd.

all otus with only a single read count in any sample were removed from the analysis.statistical analysisdifferences between relative abundances and the presence of bacterial otus between post-mortem lung tissue frozen at -80 degc upon collection and post-mortem lung tissue preserved with rna-later from beef calves which died from brd were calculated in graphpad prism 6 version 6.04 using the mann-whitney u test and the fisher's exact test respectively.the mann-whitney u test and the fisher's exact test in graphpad prism 6 version 6.04 were used to determine if differences existed between the relative abundances and the presence respectively of bacterial otus in the lung and lymph node tissues between dairy calves which diedfrom brd and clinically healthy dairy calves without lung lesions present at slaughter.stacked bar charts displaying relative abundances of bacterial otus in the specific tissue types were prepared in graphpad prism 6 version 6.04.microbial dna enrichment and metagenomics shotgun sequencinga lung sample from calf number 23 was chosen for shotgun sequencing as it had a high prevalence of a genus of interest leptotrichiacea and did not con- tain many other different bacterial genera.

this in- dicates that in the clinically healthy animals the 16s primers were amplifying a sequence in the lung and lymph node that was not on the 16s greengenes database.otu abundance in lung tissuethe top 5 most abundant otus in the post-mortem lung samples from the beef calves which died from brd were classified by qiime as pasteurellaceae mean relative abundance s.e.m 22.4 5.84 mycoplasma 15.15.03 leptotrichiaceae 14.9 4.40 clostridium 6.44.04 and fusobacterium 5.1 2.14. the top 5 most abundant otus in the post-mortem lung tissue samples from dairy calves which died from brd were classified as leptotrichiaceae 26.0 14.0 mycoplasma 22.011.00 pasteurellaceae 16.0 7.40 fusobacterium15.0 8.70 and bacteroides 8.1 6.00. the most abundant otus within the lung tissue samples from the clinically healthy h-f calves with lung lesions were classi- fied as leptotrichiaceae 20.0 9.90 mycoplasma 15.57.42 prevotella 12.3 4.31 pasteurellaceae 10.26.44 and actinobacillus 4.6 4.59. leptotrichiaceae and fusobacterium were undetectable in the lesion-free lung samples from the clinically healthy h-f calves.

additionally it was one of the most abundant otus identified within tissue samples from beef and dairy calves which died from brd and was absent in samples from clinically healthy h-f calves which had no lung lesions.the prevalence of otus that were classified as the bacterial family leptotrichiaceae in lung and lymph node tissue from fatal brd cases and lung lesions from clini- cally healthy cattle was of particular interest as members of this family were recently proposed to be associated with lung disease in humans.

to our knowledge this is the first report of detection of this putative leptotrichiaceae species in bovine lung lesions in cattle with brd and also the first report of ngs 16s amplicon analysis of lung tissue and lung-associated lymph nodes in cattle with brd.methodspost-mortem tissue sample collectionthirty-eight cranial lung lobe tissue samples were col- lected post-mortem from 32 beef calves and 6 dairy calves which were submitted from farms in three different re- gions in ireland.

following pcr amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis no amplicon bands were observed in the gel additional file a and no peaks were observed on the electropherogram images obtained from the dna 1000 chip on an agilent 2100 bioanalyser additional file c. in contrast bands of the expected amplicon size 467 bp were observed on the gel for the selected lung tissue dna libraries and the pooled lung and lymph node tissue dna libraries additional file a. furthermore the electropherogram images for the selected lung tissue dna libraries and the pooled lung and lymph node tissue dna libraries also confirmed that these libraries contained dna fragments corresponding to the expected amplicon size additional file b.taxonomic classificationone hundred and fifteen bacterial otus were identi- fied overall.

the most abundant otus in lesion-free samples were prevotella 30.7 7.56 bacteroides 7.4 7.38pasteurellaceae 6.6 5.03 s24-7 6.0 5.24 andclostridium 5.5 3.78.otu abundance in lymph node tissuethe most abundant otus in lymph node tissue from beef calves which died from brd were classified as pasteurellaceae 18.0 5.66 clostridium 9.6 5.30fusobacterium7.32.84leptotrichiaceae6.82.66 and prevotella 6.0 2.90. clostridium 21.919.11 fusobacterium 21.7 14.81 mycoplasma21.3 19.67 leptotrichiaceae 13.7 10.68 and pasteurellaceae 8.1 5.46 were the most abundant otus in post-mortem lymph node samples from dairy calves which died from brd.

these authors suggested that many cases of brd can be missed or may be sub-clinical .leptotrichiaceae fusobacterium mycoplasma true- perella and bacteroides were more abundant among post-mortem lung tissue samples from dairy calves which died from brd compared to the lesion-free lungtable 2 assembled bacterial contigs description and top blast hitsdatabase  non redundant nr nucleotide collection nt.

this could result in increased morbidity increased mortality and decreased performance in beef and dairy calves.the present study shows that further ngs study of large numbers of healthy and brd lung and lymph node tissue samples to generate a comprehensive view of the microbiome of healthy and diseased bovine lungs is warranted.additional filescannot be identified by culture and pcr tests currently carried out at veterinary diagnostic laboratories.next generation sequencing can revolutionise brd bac- terial diagnostics.

however the frequency of the detection of bacteria asso- ciated with brd is lower in the lungs and lymph nodes of clinically healthy calves compared with calves which died from brd.furthermore we have identified bacterial sequences cor- responding to an unidentified species which is classified as a member of the bacterial family leptotrichiaceae that was a dominant species in bovine lung lesions in brd cases and absent in healthy lesion-free lung tissue.

.undetected and detected genera in clinically healthy lesion-free lungs and lymph nodesotus that were classified as leptotrichiaceae fusobac- terium pasteurella trueperella helcococcus and urea- plasma were abundant in lung and lymph node tissue samples from both beef and dairy calves that died from brd but these genera were not detected in either lung or lymph node tissue samples from the subset of clini- cally healthy h-f calves which had no observable lung lesions n  8 figs.

sequences that were classified as pasteurellaceae a family containing species that are commonly associated with brd were detected in three lung tissue and one lymph node tissue sample fromthe lesion-free calves fig.
