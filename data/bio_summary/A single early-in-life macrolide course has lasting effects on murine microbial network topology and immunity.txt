nucleotides were quality filtered with a phred score  20 reads were clustered into 97 identity otus using uclust program followed by taxonomy assignment using the rdp classifier and chimeras were removed using chimeraslayer.samples with a sequencing depth  1000 were excluded and otus with a relative abundance  0.01 were removed.

using graphlet correlation distance as a global measure comparing networks and using isometric mds as an analytic tool we inferred low-dimensional embedding of the microbial association net- works fig.

we show that even a single antibioticcourse given early in life leads to profound and long-lasting immunological changes in mice and that an altered microbiota with altered keystone taxa is both necessary and sufficient to explain these effects.resultseffect of macrolide courses on the intestinal microbiota.

this study provides evidence that a pat-perturbed microbiota regardless of sfb status is sufficient to impair host immunological development in recipient mice involving both humoral and cell-mediated immune characteristics.dynamics of antibiotic-perturbed microbiota after transfer.

however the transfer experiment indicated that an altered microbiota was sufficient to convey delayed siga secretion monitored over the course of the experiment as well as immunological abnormalities 11 weeks after the conventionalization in contrast to prior transfer studies withmore brief observation periods .sex-specific differences in taxonomic profiles observed in the pat-conventionalized group highlight the potential influence ofsex hormones on the microbiota which has been previously demonstrated in a mouse model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes and several human and other animal models- and should be further studied.

using iga-seq we identified siga-coated bacteria after the conventionalization with control or pat microbiota.

uncovering effects of antibiotics on the host and microbiota using transkingdom gene networks.

using this ranking to generate an roc curve we compared the ranked edges from the transfer experiment against the 'true' corresponding edges from the dosing experiment using the set of otus common to both experiments.

filtered reads were clustered into 97 identity otus using uclust program followed by taxonomy assignment using the rdpclassifier.
