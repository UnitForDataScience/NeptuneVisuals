Apart from the microbiological aspects of table olive fermentation olive tree varieties could present different behaviors during brining because of the different fruit dimensions and physicochemical characteristics that would in turn affect the microbiota responsible for olive fermentation and influence the sensory profile of the final product .Table 1.

Moreover studies have shown that the microbiota of fermented table olives exhibits specific probiotic properties and thus olives are considered to be good matrices to deliver probiotics to the host while at the same time being free of lactose and cholesterol .Table olive fermentation occurs spontaneously by the microbiota of the olive without adding any starter culture.
