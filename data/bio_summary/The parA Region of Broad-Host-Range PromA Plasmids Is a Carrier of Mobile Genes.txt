Interestingly the bulk soil- derived sequences were highly affiliated with an esterase- encoding gene gene Aes band 9 and a gene encoding a subunit of an endo-14-beta-xylanase gene XynA band 10.

Thus a certain functional redundancy exists across partitioning systems .With respect to the PromA plasmid group insertions of accessory genes have been empirically observed to occur ex- actly in the parA region exemplified by the luxAB-tet gene cassette inserted into plasmid pIPO2 yielding plasmid pIPO2T  mercury resistance genes found on plasmid pSB102  and heavy metal response genes on plasmid pMOL98 .

With respect to partitioning parB appears to be key it is found on all plasmids of the PromA group and the protein encoded by this gene is important for the proper formation of the partitioning complex.The goal of this study was to explore the PromA plasmid parA gene region as a potential insertional hotspot for mobi- lized genes.

This sequence affiliated with gene regions found in Betaproteobacteria revealed high iden- tity with that of the Ralstonia solanacearum narG partial gene which encodes the alpha subunit of nitrate reductase an enzyme involved in the conversion of nitrate into nitrite.

The methodology developed in this work was effec- tive sensitive and practical allowing detection of mobilized genes between microorganisms.Keywords Horizontal gene transfer .

Probably environmental characteristics drive and select the respective genes in their genetic and host context.Identification of parA Gene Insertions Obtained from Soil DNARepresentative dominant bands considering the cluster anal- ysis for each habitat were excised from gel reamplified cloned and sequenced in order to assess the nature of the parA gene insertions see Fig.

Expectedly these sequences were affiliated to those of Alphaproteobacteria band 9 and Gammaproteobacteria band 10 as detected with complete genes see Table .In conclusion the extent to which horizontally acting gene transfer agents provide adaptive value to members of natural microbiomes is an understudied area of research.

Furthermore such habitats could be differentiated based on patterns of parA-inserted genes and the genes carried by these plasmids.

Thus a suite of dioxygenase-related genes and transposase elements were found in oil-affected mangroves whereas genes involved in nitrogen and carbon cycling were detected in salt marsh and soils.

Horizontal gene transfer HGT promoted by plas- mids provides a rapid adaptive strategy to microbiomes an interesting feature considering the constantly changing condi- tions in most environments.
