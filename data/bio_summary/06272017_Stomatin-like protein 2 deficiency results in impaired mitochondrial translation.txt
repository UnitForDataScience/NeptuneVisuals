Altogether these data document an important post-transcriptional function for SLP-2 in the production of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides.The impaired synthesis of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides in the absence of SLP-2 correlates with decreased T cell activationTo determine whether the defect in mitochondrial translation occurring in activated SLP- 2-deficient T cells was functionally relevant we measured interleukin IL-2 production inIL-2 production is decreased in SLP-2 T-KO T cells following activation.

Given our previous finding that overexpression of SLP-2 in human T cells increased mtDNA content   it was possi- ble that a lack of SLP-2 in mouse T cells would have a negative impact on mtDNAmaintenance.

These data identify SLP-2 as a key regulator of mitochondrial translation during T cell activation a function that may extend to other tissues or cell-types.ResultsDe novo synthesis of mitochondria-encoded polypeptides is dependent on SLP-2 in activated T cellsTo investigate whether SLP-2 functions to directly or indirectly regulate mitochondrial transla- tion we measured de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis in resting or stimulated T cellsMitochondrial translation is impaired in SLP-2-deficient T cells upon stimulation.

This implies that SLP-2 is not by itself responsible for monosome assembly or the potential association of prohibitins with the mitoribosome.Finally we found that although T cells lacking SLP-2 were able to produce each mito- chondria-encoded polypeptide efficient mitochondrial translation was dependent on SLP-2 only following T cell activation.

However upon stimulation SLP-2-deficient T cells failed to upregulate the translation of many mito- chondria-encoded polypeptides to the same extent as stimulated WT T cells with de novo COXI Cytb COXII COXIII and ATP6 protein levels being significantly lower than in acti- vated WT T cells.

We have previously reported thatSLP-2 overexpression increased PGC-1a gene and protein expression in human T cells and that SLP-2 was upregulated prior to PGC-1a upregulation in control human peripheral blood mononuclear cells following stimulation .

To determine whether the disparity in mito- chondrial translation between activated WT and SLP-2 T-KO T cells was due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis in SLP-2-deficient T cells we measured the gene and protein expres- sion of PGC-1a under resting conditions and upon T cell activation.

However SLP-2 deficiency did not affect PGC-1a abundance at the gene or protein levels indicating that mitochondrial biogenesis was not a contributing factor to the defective mitochondrial translation observed in SLP-2-deficient T cells upon activation.Since there were no apparent defects in mtDNA stability or PGC-1a expression in resting or activated SLP-2-deficient T cells we next examined whether mitochondrial transcription was occurring normally under these conditions.

Stimulated SLP-2 T-KO T cells exhibited a similar lack of differences in mitoribo- some assembly as compared to WT T cells under the same conditions .

Interestingly however though the absence of SLP-2 impaired mito- chondrial translation in activated T cells both mitoribosome assembly and the migration of PHB2 were unchanged relative to activated WT T cells.
