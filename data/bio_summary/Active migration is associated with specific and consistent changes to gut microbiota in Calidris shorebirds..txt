Collectively these analyses allowed us to elucidate the relationship between the gut microbiota and long-distance migration in shorebirds.2  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Sample collectionMicrobiota samples were collected across three migrant-resi- dent conspecific comparison groups 1 Curlew sandpiper in NW Western Australia 12 migrants and six residents 2 Red-necked stint in NW Western Australia 13 migrants and 16 residents and3 Red-necked stint in SE Victoria 15 migrants and 15 residents.

For Red- necked stint in SE Victoria there was no difference in either meas- ure of diversity between migrants and residents Red-necked stint migrants  143 - 62 SD residents  140 - 62 SD t301  1.8 p  .88.4  DISCUSSION Long-distance migratory birds have evolved numerous physiological adaptations that enable them to perform some of the longest and fastest migrations found within the animal kingdom Hedenstrom 2008 Piersma Perez-Tris Mouritsen Bauchinger  Bairlein 2005.Identifying whether these adaptations encompass alterations to the gut microbiota offers unique insights into the relationship between hosts and their microbes under specific physiological challenges.

After rarefying a total of 4406 OTUs were identified from cloacal samples of 18 Curlew sandpipers 12 migrants and six residents and 29 Red-necked stints 13 migrants and 16 residents sampled in NW Western Australia and 30 Red-necked stints 15 migrants and 15 residents from SE Victoria.
