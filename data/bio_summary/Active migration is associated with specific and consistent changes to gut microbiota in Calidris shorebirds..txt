collectively these analyses allowed us to elucidate the relationship between the gut microbiota and long-distance migration in shorebirds.2  materials and methods  sample collectionmicrobiota samples were collected across three migrant-resi- dent conspecific comparison groups 1 curlew sandpiper in nw western australia 12 migrants and six residents 2 red-necked stint in nw western australia 13 migrants and 16 residents and3 red-necked stint in se victoria 15 migrants and 15 residents.

after rarefying a total of 4406 otus were identified from cloacal samples of 18 curlew sandpipers 12 migrants and six residents and 29 red-necked stints 13 migrants and 16 residents sampled in nw western australia and 30 red-necked stints 15 migrants and 15 residents from se victoria.

these physiological challenges may either temporarily disrupt gut microbial ecosystems or alterna- tively promote predictable host-microbe associations during migration.to determine the relationship between migration and gut microbiota we compared gut microbiota composition between migrating and non-migrating resident con- specific shorebirds sharing a flock.

this study provides a rare example of a repeatable and specific response of the gut microbiota to a major physiological challenge across two species and two distant populations.keywords gut microbiota host-microbe interactions microbiome migration physiology428  c 2017 the authors.

201887428-437.1  introduction interactions between animals and their gut microbiota play an inte- gral role in regulating host physiological processes including metab- olism tremaroli  backhed 2012 and immune function round  mazmanian 2009 sommer  backhed 2013. yet despite our increas- ing understanding of these interactions detecting consistent asso- ciations between the gut microbiota and host physiology has proved challenging.

this may benefit the host because a resilient gut microbial commu- nity decreases host susceptibility to infection by excluding pathogens via niche competition whereby commensal bacteria out-compete po- tential pathogens kamada chen inohara  nunez 2013 sommer anderson bharti raes  rosenstiel 2017. on the other hand the extreme physiological challenges faced by migrating shorebirds may feasibly disrupt gut microbial ecosystems potentially leading to stochastic and unpredictable alterations in the gut microbiota during active migration.although a small number of studies have assessed gut micro- bial composition in migrating birds the absence of conspecific non-migrating controls has not allowed for the identification of migration-specific gut microbiota profiles e.g.

age is an important factor determining gut microbiota compo- sition when young with chicks having different gut microbiota to adult birds in penguins kittiwakes and barn swallows barbosa et al.

2014 ranjitkar lawley tannock  engberg 2016 and studies of two wild migratory shorebird species grond lanctot jumpponen  sandercock 2017 dunlin calidris alpina and red phalarope phalaropus fulicarius suggest that microbiota diversity stabilises in 3- to 10-days-old chicks grond 2017. on this basis and given that both our resident and migrant groups consist of fully grown birds that have completed at least one siberia-to-australia migration we do not believe that differences in gut microbiota should existbetween second-year birds at 15 months old and birds that are 3 years old due to age per se.in broome cloacal samples were taken from stints using sterile swabs copan 170ks01 placed in sterile plastic tubes without me- dium and kept refrigerated for 3-5 hr before being stored at -20degc.

2003. for example migrants must regain body stores quickly after completing a migratory leg during which they can lose up to 50 of their body mass piersma gudmundsson  lilliendahl 1999. moreover partial atro- phy of the gastrointestinal tract during long-distance flights is com- mon both for shorebirds and passerines mcwilliams  karasov 2001 piersma  gill 1998. such extreme physiological challenges may alter host-microbe interactions to generate shifts in gut microbiota composition during active migration in comparison to non-migratory periods.

this association is likely to be temporary with another study finding corynebacterium decreased over the non-breeding season for red-necked stint sampled over time risely waite ujvari klaassen  hoye 2017. functional interactions between animals and their gut microbiota are highly complex and our current understanding of such interactions is largely based on human or mouse models sommer  backhed 2013 tremaroli  backhedfigure 2 fold changes for otus circles that significantly differed between migrants and residents for a curlew sandpiper in broomeb red-necked stint in broome and c red-necked stint in victoria.

2017 sug- gesting differences in recent diet may potentially explain some of the small amount of remaining variation in gut microbiota composition between migrants and residents.migrating shorebirds maintained similar community diversity to resident conspecifics although they tended to have fewer rare spe- cies.

firstly if migrants form predictable associations with the gut micro- biota we would predict repeated differences in specific bacterial taxa between migrants and residents across the three migrant-resident comparison groups.
