In general bacterial strains isolated from P6-P10 Morgat were more involved in antagonistic interactions asproducer or inhibited mainly those strains isolated from sea urchin stomach.Among isolates P1-P5 from Aber eight of the strains isolated of intestine were involved in at least one antagonis- tic interaction four strains as antimicrobial producers and four strains as inhibited by the activity of at least one other strain Fig.

No strains from sea urchin stomach was observed as producer or inhibited.Among strains isolated P6-P10 from Morgat 35 were involved in at least one antagonistic interaction being 13 strains as antimicrobial producers and 30 strains as inhibited by the activity of at least one other strain Fig.

f shows OTUs shared by both gastrointestinal tract sections and both collect sites of the sea urchins.Antagonistic Interactions Among Bacterial IsolatesThe 180 bacterial strains TableS1 were selected and screened for antimicrobial substance production by cross- inhibition tests among bacteria isolated from the sea urchins collected from the same location Aber P1-P5 strains or Morgat P6-P10 strains.

The strains were named with the P letter plus 1-5 for bacteria isolated from the sea urchin samples collected from Aber or 6-10 from Morgat plus E for bacteria isolated from the stomach or I for bacteria isolated from the intestine of the sea urchins finally followed by the order of isolation of colony-forming units CFUs.

From the Morgat samples 22 specific OTUs were identified as belonging to the genus Enterococ- cus Firmicutes to the families Moraxellaceae and Entero- bacteriaceae and finally one sequence unassigned.When the distribution of OTUs was analyzed between the sections of the gastrointestinal tract 13 were shared 42 OTUs were specific to the stomach and 39 OTUs were found only in the intestine Fig.

Hereafter bacterial strains tested for antimicrobial substance production will be termed producer strains whereas those used as targets will be called indicator or inhibited strains.

Among the chosen isolates from the sea urchins 208 strains P1-P5 from the Aber site being 85 from the stomach E and 123 from the intestine I sections and 159 strains P6-P10 from the Morgat site being 85 from E and 74 from I sections.On the basis of morphological characteristics 180 strains were selected and sequenced based on 16S rRNA gene sequences targeting the V3-V5 region.

Two strains P5I -23 OTU32 and -29 OTU25 both affiliated to the genus Psychro- bacter were strong producers against strains isolated from other sea urchin samples Peptoclostridium P2I-2 OUT Unassigned and P3I-5 OTU11 and Vibrionaceae P3I-12 OTU8.

Color figure onlinestrains isolated from the intestine sections were only inhib- ited while eight strains isolated from the stomach sections were classified as active and inhibited.

In the network diagram Aber samples and their corresponding OTUs from the intestine are shown in pink and from the stomach are in blue Morgat samples and their corresponding OTUs isolated from the intestine are presented in red and from the stomach are in green.
