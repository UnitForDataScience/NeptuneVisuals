Average methane concentrations in the mixed cave waterand in the cave atmosphere were 6000 and 3000 p.p.

Furthermore the abundant detection of putatively sulfur-oxidizing and iron- oxidizing  as well as iron- reducing  members of the Betaproteobacteria especially in spring and mixed cave waters points toward active sulfur and iron cycling in the cave.

The biofilms completely cover the walls and ceilings of the cave giving rise to speculations about their metabolism.

Stable isotope analysis indicated that thermogenic methane emerging into the cave served as an important driver of biofilm formation.

Nonetheless a number of caves and karstic systems have been reported to host biofilms rich in microbial diversity and with elevated mostly lithotrophic biogeochem- ical activities .In this study we report on an exceptionally extensive and massive biofilm formation that has recently been discovered in a semiartificial cave of a historic medicinal spring in Sulzbrunn situated in prealpine southern Germany.

Subaerial and submersed microbial biofilms com- pletely cover the walls and ceiling of this semina- tural cave 1 giving rise to extensive pendulous mucous structures of up to 15 cm in length also known as snottites  To date microbial snottites have mostly been described to harbor low-diversity communities of lithotrophs in acidophilic thermophilic or sulfidic habitats Such extreme conditions do not seem to prevail in Sulzbrunn.

Thus our objective was to understand the primary biogeochemical drivers of this peculiar microbial habitat.The Sulzbrunn cave is located in the Allgau Alps Bavaria Germany at an altitude of 875 m above sea level.
