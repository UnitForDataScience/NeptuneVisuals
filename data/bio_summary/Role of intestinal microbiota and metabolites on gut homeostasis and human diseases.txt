Reintroduction of a complex microbiota into the murine host could to some degree rectify microglia properties Furthermore SCFAs a category of gut microbiotal products as described earl- ier in this review were found to be able to modulate microglia homeostasis Thus it is not surprising that mice lacking the SCFA receptor FFAR2 would mimic the impaired microglia as previously observed in GF mice 4.Impaired immune system impacts intestinal microbiota compositionThe mucosal immune system --- constituting adaptive innate immune cells and the epithelium --- is consider- ably affected by its microbial milieu There is accu- mulating evidence to reveal vice versa that the impaired immune system influences the intestinal microbiota composition and in turn links to diseases.Disruption of innate immune pathways is able to cause alterations in intestinal microbiota.

Butyrate a kind of microbiota- originated SCFAs containing four carbons has been recently reported to have immunomodulatory effects on intestinal macrophages and thereby conferring them hyporesponsive to commensal microbiota resid- ing in the colon  Notwithstanding the underlying mechanisms as to how intestinal microbiota as a whole educates host immune system within the gut and beyond as well as the identification of bacterial species-specific contribution during the microbiota- host immunity interaction still await to be elucidated.

Another study proposed that the char- acteristic manifestation of T1D --high Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio a lack of butyrate-producing bac- teria reduced bacterial diversity and weak community stability-- occurred after the appearance of autoanti- bodies suggesting the possible involvement of in- testinal microbiota in the progression from pancreatic b-cell autoimmunity to clinical disorder but not in the onset of disease process .Although the exact mechanism about local tolerance in-duction by the microbiota remains elusive the finding that the normal intestinal microbiota could attenuate the pro- gression of autoimmune T1D in a MyD88-independent manner would provide a different viewpoint into diseaseetiology.

Rational utilization of live microbial strains or microbial products thereof may represent new therapeutic promises for T1D Continued endeavor to define the specific role of intestinal microbiome the collective ge- nomes of microbiota in the onset of T1D is urgently needed for the design and development of novel disease preventative or therapeutic regimen.T2D and obesity Apart from T1D extensive studies show that the intestine microbes affect host energy har- vest in mammals suggesting a link of gut microbiota with obesity 5.

MyD88-- NOD mice possessed high abundance of Bacteroidetes and thereby circumventing the host from T1D development Furthermore more SFB were observed in the small intestines of MyD88-- mice than wild-type counterparts 1 suggesting that the depletion of MyD88 signals could alter the intestinal microbiota composition.Recent studies have shown that Crohn's disease CD patients with impaired immune system displayed a de- clined biodiversity and prevalence of intestinal bacteria.

Dietary alterations such as feeding of meat which could substantially vibrate the composition of the microbiome have been illustrated to promote memory and learning in mice In addition to bacterial biosynthesis and sensing of similar neurohormones found in the mammals it is postulated that the bacterial symbiosis with the intes- tine plays a predominant role in the postnatal deve- lopment and maturation of the host immune and endocrine system which underpins CNS function Recent studies have demonstrated that host microbiota controls maturation and function of micro- glia in the CNS Microglia as the tissue macro- phages of the brain are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis for scavenging dying cellscomponents and for eradicating pathogens through microbial associated molecular pattern receptor-dependent and-independent mechanisms Apart from their aforementioned functions microglia are central to axon pruning and remodeling during development and adulthood indicating them as an essential player in brain development Host microbiota are manifestly associated with micro- glia homeostasis as supported by the GF mice displaying global defects in microglia with altered cell percentages and an immature phenotype which leads to impaired in- nate immune responses.

The exceptional characteristic of intestinal microenvir- onment necessitates host immune system not only to avoid the hyper-immune reactivity to the gut lumen laden with commensals and dietary components etc but also to retain the capacity of fighting pathogenic microbes.Extensive studies in germ-free GF mice in the past decades have demonstrated an indispensable role of microbiota in shaping host intestine immune system In contrast to conventionally raised mice GF mice have hypoplastic Peyer's patches decreased numbers in IgA-secreting plasma cells and lamina propria CD4 T cells relatively structureless secondary lymphoid tissues i.e.

These findings collectively unravel another circuit of the complex array of host transitions whereby opportunistic bacteria down- regulate host immune responses to thrive and to estab- lish a chronic infection.In addition to QS signals produced by G- bacteriasuch as P. aeruginosa those derived from Gram-positive G bacteria are found to exert immunomodulatory actions on hosts A kind of QS signal from Bacillus subtilis also termed competence and sporulation factor CSF has been demonstrated to be stimulant of the key survival pathways including p38 MAP kinase and pro- tein kinase B Akt in mammalian intestinal epithelial cells Moreover CSF seems to induce HSPs for pro- tecting intestinal epithelial cells from oxidant stress and for avoiding the loss of barrier function.
