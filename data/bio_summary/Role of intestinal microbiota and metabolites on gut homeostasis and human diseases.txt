reintroduction of a complex microbiota into the murine host could to some degree rectify microglia properties furthermore scfas a category of gut microbiotal products as described earl- ier in this review were found to be able to modulate microglia homeostasis thus it is not surprising that mice lacking the scfa receptor ffar2 would mimic the impaired microglia as previously observed in gf mice 4.impaired immune system impacts intestinal microbiota compositionthe mucosal immune system --- constituting adaptive innate immune cells and the epithelium --- is consider- ably affected by its microbial milieu there is accu- mulating evidence to reveal vice versa that the impaired immune system influences the intestinal microbiota composition and in turn links to diseases.disruption of innate immune pathways is able to cause alterations in intestinal microbiota.

rational utilization of live microbial strains or microbial products thereof may represent new therapeutic promises for t1d continued endeavor to define the specific role of intestinal microbiome the collective ge- nomes of microbiota in the onset of t1d is urgently needed for the design and development of novel disease preventative or therapeutic regimen.t2d and obesity apart from t1d extensive studies show that the intestine microbes affect host energy har- vest in mammals suggesting a link of gut microbiota with obesity 5. firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria are known to dominate the human intestinal microbiota of adults 5. it is well accepted that host body habitus is relevant to the composition of the gut microbiota.

any unequili- brium between the host and commensals would lead to the passage of the luminal contents into the underlying tissues and thus into the bloodstream triggering the immune response activation and the ensuing gut inflammation which may contribute to various diseases including infec- tious enterocolitis ibd obesity diabetes irritable bowel syndrome small intestinal bacterial overgrowth hepatic fibrosis food intolerances and atopic manifestations .t1d and autoimmunity data heretofore underpin the evolving theory that gut microbiota serve as an organ with a myriad of previously neglected or poorly-understoodmetabolic immunologic and endocrine-like effects on human health 5. an evident correlation has been validated between the altered intestinal microbiota com- position with the onset of autoimmune disorders such as t1d 6. gut microbiota is found to participate in the progression of early incidence of t1d which is originated from t-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic b-cells.

butyrate a kind of microbiota- originated scfas containing four carbons has been recently reported to have immunomodulatory effects on intestinal macrophages and thereby conferring them hyporesponsive to commensal microbiota resid- ing in the colon  notwithstanding the underlying mechanisms as to how intestinal microbiota as a whole educates host immune system within the gut and beyond as well as the identification of bacterial species-specific contribution during the microbiota- host immunity interaction still await to be elucidated.

dietary alterations such as feeding of meat which could substantially vibrate the composition of the microbiome have been illustrated to promote memory and learning in mice in addition to bacterial biosynthesis and sensing of similar neurohormones found in the mammals it is postulated that the bacterial symbiosis with the intes- tine plays a predominant role in the postnatal deve- lopment and maturation of the host immune and endocrine system which underpins cns function recent studies have demonstrated that host microbiota controls maturation and function of micro- glia in the cns microglia as the tissue macro- phages of the brain are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis for scavenging dying cellscomponents and for eradicating pathogens through microbial associated molecular pattern receptor-dependent and-independent mechanisms apart from their aforementioned functions microglia are central to axon pruning and remodeling during development and adulthood indicating them as an essential player in brain development host microbiota are manifestly associated with micro- glia homeostasis as supported by the gf mice displaying global defects in microglia with altered cell percentages and an immature phenotype which leads to impaired in- nate immune responses.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.similar conserved ligands --pamps drives us to address such question as to how host immune system differentiates pathogens from commensals at the intestinal mucosal interface exposed to continuous microbial stimuli.severe host tissue damage may be resulted from immune hypersensitivity towards intestinal flora or dietary nutrients.

the exceptional characteristic of intestinal microenvir- onment necessitates host immune system not only to avoid the hyper-immune reactivity to the gut lumen laden with commensals and dietary components etc but also to retain the capacity of fighting pathogenic microbes.extensive studies in germ-free gf mice in the past decades have demonstrated an indispensable role of microbiota in shaping host intestine immune system in contrast to conventionally raised mice gf mice have hypoplastic peyer's patches decreased numbers in iga-secreting plasma cells and lamina propria cd4 t cells relatively structureless secondary lymphoid tissues i.e.

these findings collectively suggest that sfb may benefit at least nutritionally from their inter- action with the host and have thus evolved adaptive strat- egies to cope with host immune responses for maintaining their intestinal niches -1. by using sfb-host cell co-cultivation system schnupf and co-workers 7 unraveled that single-celled sfb isolated from monocolo- nized mice underwent morphologic development and differentiation to release viable infectious particles termed the intracellular off-springs which enabled their colonization within the host for the induction of signature immune responses.

myd88-- nod mice possessed high abundance of bacteroidetes and thereby circumventing the host from t1d development furthermore more sfb were observed in the small intestines of myd88-- mice than wild-type counterparts 1 suggesting that the depletion of myd88 signals could alter the intestinal microbiota composition.recent studies have shown that crohn's disease cd patients with impaired immune system displayed a de- clined biodiversity and prevalence of intestinal bacteria.

paneth cells a key compo- nent of the intestinal innate immunity are known to secrete an arsenal of antimicrobial peptides and proteins into the gut lumen indigenous inhabitant b. thetaiotaomicron is thus pinpointed to be involved in both the mucosal barrier reinforcement and immune modulation.the colonization of sfb as previously described in the context of barrier functionality of intestinal epithelium may also direct post-natal maturation of the gut mucosal lymphoid tissue trigger a potent and broad iga re- sponse stimulate the t-cell compartment and upregu- late intestinal innate defense mediators suggesting immune-stimulatory capacities of sfb apart from their abilities to educate the gut immune system it becomes evident that sfb colonization may act as anadjuvant on systemic responses and thereby exacerbating pathologies in the murine models of encephalitis and arth- ritis while conferring the genetically-predisposed mice protection from the development of t1d  -8. sfb are thought to be species between obligate and facul- tative symbionts due to their high auxotrophic demands as evidenced by genomic sequencing of these symbionts with the rodents.

these findings collectively unravel another circuit of the complex array of host transitions whereby opportunistic bacteria down- regulate host immune responses to thrive and to estab- lish a chronic infection.in addition to qs signals produced by g- bacteriasuch as p. aeruginosa those derived from gram-positive g bacteria are found to exert immunomodulatory actions on hosts a kind of qs signal from bacillus subtilis also termed competence and sporulation factor csf has been demonstrated to be stimulant of the key survival pathways including p38 map kinase and pro- tein kinase b akt in mammalian intestinal epithelial cells moreover csf seems to induce hsps for pro- tecting intestinal epithelial cells from oxidant stress and for avoiding the loss of barrier function.

another study proposed that the char- acteristic manifestation of t1d --high bacteroidetes to firmicutes ratio a lack of butyrate-producing bac- teria reduced bacterial diversity and weak community stability-- occurred after the appearance of autoanti- bodies suggesting the possible involvement of in- testinal microbiota in the progression from pancreatic b-cell autoimmunity to clinical disorder but not in the onset of disease process .although the exact mechanism about local tolerance in-duction by the microbiota remains elusive the finding that the normal intestinal microbiota could attenuate the pro- gression of autoimmune t1d in a myd88-independent manner would provide a different viewpoint into diseaseetiology.

owing to the advances in genome- wide epigenetic analysis for instance chromatin immu- noprecipitation sequencing chip-seq researchers can determine and analyze these epigenetic modifications thereby deciphering the intrinsic intestinal microbiota- host interactions and unraveling the impacts of microbiota within and beyond the gut such as liver cardiovascular system and even cns.abbreviationsgamma-g-pga poly-g-glutamic acid 3o-c12-hsl n-3-oxododecanoyl-l- homoserine lactone ahls n-acylhomoserine lactones bft bacteriodes fragilis toxin cd crohn's disease chip-seq chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing cns central nervous system cpg cytidine-phosphate-guanosine damp damage-associated molecular pattern dcs dendritic cells dss dextran sodium sulfate eae experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis ecs epithelial cells ffar2 free fatty acid receptor 2galts gut-associated lymphoid tissues gc-fidms gas chromatography coupled with flame ionization detectormass spectrometry gf germ-free gfdna gut-floral-derived dna gi gastrointestinal glp-1 glucagon-likepeptide-1 gpr 4143 g protein-coupled receptor 4143 haqs 4-hydroxy- 2-alkylquinolines hfd high-fat diet hhq 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinolinehsp heat shock protein ian indole-3-acetonitrile ibs irritable bowel syndrome ido indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase iecs intestinal epithelialcells ipa indole 3-propionic acid itf inulin-type fructans itreg induced tregulatory cells ldlr low-density lipoprotein receptorlps lipopolysaccharide lsp1 leukocyte specific protein 1 mapk mitogen activated protein kinase mat mesenteric adipose tissue mdcs myeloiddcs mddcs monocyte-derived dcs myd88 myeloid differentiating factor 88 nafld non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nash non-alcoholicsteatohepatitis nmr nuclear magnetic resonance nod non-obesediabetic octn2 organic cation transporter-2 odn oligonucleotiodespamps pathogen-associated molecular patterns pbmcs peripheral blood mononuclear cells pdcs plasmacytoid dendritic cells pparg peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g pqs pseudomonas quinolone signalprrs pattern recognition receptors psa polysaccharide a pxr pregnane x receptor qs quorum sensing scfas short-chain fatty acids sfb segmented filamentous bacteria siga secretory iga sle systemic lupus erythematosus spf specific pathogen-free t1d type 1 diabetes t2d type 2 diabetesteff effector t th1 t-helper type i tlrs toll-like receptors tnbs 2 4 6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid tregs regulatory t cellsacknowledgmentsthis work was co-supported by the national key basic research program of china 973 program grant no.

indole present at high amounts 250-1100 mm in the gut probably serves as an inter-kingdom signal during the interactions of commensals and host intestinal cells  previous work demonstrated that indole secreted by commensal e. coli could lower the chemotaxis motility and adherence of pathogenic e. coli to host intestinal epi- thelial cells .
