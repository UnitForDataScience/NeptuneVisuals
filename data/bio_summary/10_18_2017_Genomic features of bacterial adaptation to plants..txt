Only genomes that were at least 95 complete and no more than 5 contaminated were used.High-quality gene annotation genomes that passed this filter had at least 90 genome sequence coding for genes with an exception--in theBartonella genus most genomes have coding base percentages below 90.Nonredundancy we computed whole-genome average nucleotide identity and alignment fraction values for each pair of genomes.

We combined the newly sequenced genomes with existing genomes to create a dataset of 3837 high-quality non- redundant genomes.

Finally the remaining genomes were labeled as NPA genomes these were iso- lated from diverse sources including humans non-human animals air sediments and aquatic environments.We carried out stringent quality control to remove low-quality or redundant genomes Methods.

Comparison of the size of plant-associated soil and NPA genomes showed that plant-associated andor soil genomes were signifi- cantly larger than NPA genomes P  0.05 PhyloGLM and t-testsSupplementary Fig.

All new genomes Supplementary Table 3 were submitted and are publicly available in at least one of the following databanks see accessions in Supplementary Table 3IMGM Genbank ENA A dedicated website for the Dangl lab The dedicated website contains nucleotide and amino acid FASTA files of all datasets used proteindomain annotations COG KO TiGRfam Pfam metadata phylogenetic trees OrthoFinder orthogroups orthogroup hidden Markov models full enrichment datasets correlation between orthogroups and predicted operons URLs.Links to different scripts that were used in analysis are included in the URLs section.

Isolate genomes also provide genomic and evolutionary context for individual genes as well as the poten- tial to access genomes of rare organisms that might be missed bymetagenomics because of limited sequencing depth.

In addition to the newly sequenced genomes noted above we collected 5587 bacterial genomes belonging to the four most abundant phyla of plant-associated bacteria from public databases Methods.

This led to a final dataset of 3837 high-quality and nonredundant genomes including 1160 plant- associated genomes 523 of which were also root-associated.

We grouped these 3837 genomes into nine monophyletic taxa to allow comparative genomics analysis among phylogenetically related genomes Fig.

The outer ring shows the taxonomic group the central ring shows the isolation source and the inner ring shows the root-associated RA genomes within plant-associated PA genomes.
