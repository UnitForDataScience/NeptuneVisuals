This is seen i in the simulation model we employ to calibrate and test our method section Method for testing the analysis method using simulated data ii in the computational technique we use to distin- guish between cooperative and competitive interactions sections Boolean abundance analysisand Analysis of simulated data as well as in iii the possibility to treat some of the properties of the binarized abundance vectors analytically section Background.For the simulation model we construct random graphs of positive and negative interac- tions simulate time courses starting from random initial abundance patterns and thus obtain a set of attractors i.e.

The histogram for negative interactions is clearly centered at negative z- scores while the positive interactions are predominantly in the positive range even though some values are in the negative z-score range as well.

Furthermore we analyze networks with the same number of positive and negative interactions M  M-.Examples of normalized pair probabilities pdijThmindpdiTh pdjThTh with k l 2 0 1 for six links of the network from  Three positiveklklinteractions lhs and three negative interactions rhs.Even on the level of the pair probabilities pdijTh the difference between positive and negative interactions is clearly seen.

Here we presented data on 822 microbiome compositions from a community-based sample together with a novel analysis method called ESABO based on the entropy shift of pairs of--binarized--abundance vectors under Boolean operations.Histogram of abundance values extracted from the 822 microbiome compositions see  for the two high-abundance phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as well as the three phyla with the highest degree k in the network of positive interactions shown in  namely Tenericutes k  16 Acidobacteria k  16 and Spirochaetes k  14.

.. Then the ESABO score for operation OP of species i with respect to spe- cies j is defined as the z-score compared to a null model of shuffled abundance vectors of the entropy of abundances after pointwise application of a Boolean operation xi OP j -bdiThOP bdjThd1Thwhere the z-score is obtained from comparison to an ensemble of xi OP j -bdiThOP bdjThd2Thwhere bdjTh for each fixed j is an abundance vector randomly reshuffled in k. The entropyH  -i pi ln pi in physics with prefactor kB or in Shannon theory of information with base 2 of any normalized set of probabilities pi is a measure of uncertainty.

The method called Entropy Shifts of Abundance Vectors under Boolean Operations ESABO evaluates the information content of pairs of binary abundance vectors when combined via Boolean operations.

However their detection is more challenging as network reconstruction methods based on abundance tend to priorize interactions involving the high-abundance species.In this work we present and analyze a comparatively large dataset consisting of 822 sam- ples and introduce a new network inference method based on Boolean networks.

Phylogeny based alpha-diversities Faith PD and beta-diversities weighted and unweighted Unifrac were calculated with FastTree produced maximum-likelihood tree and Mothur.Histogram of z-scores of entropy shifts obtained with the ESABO method Boolean AND applied to simulated binary abundance patterns from 20 species interaction networks consisting of 15 nodes and 15 positive and negative interactions respectively.

Values are given for the ten positive and ten negative interactions of the network from .intended to produce 'data' which are in all aspects similar to the true microbial abundance data.

The sample of absent links yields a narrow distribution of z-scores around zero confirming that we can expect only a small contribution from false positives in the ESABO method.In the subsequent analysis we will condense the information contained in the ESABO score even further and define the prediction quality in the following way see also Supporting Information The prediction quality of positive interactions is the number of times a z-score larger than 1 is observed minus the number of times a z-score smaller than -1 is found divided by the number of positive interactions.
