further clarification that arterial blood pressure did not have a dividing line between normal blood pressure and hypertension was provided by pickering and co-workers 273 280 281 who studied larger populations to study the frequency distributions of arterial blood pressure in populations and emphasized that there is a continuous relationship between arterial pressure and mortality over a full range of arterial pressure.

dublin and a. j. lotka who were demogra- phers working for a life insurance firm in the united states 71 72. soon thereafter the medical community followed with evidence from the studies in populations such as the framingham study to conclude that essential hypertension is a condition qualitatively distinct from normotension and that elevated blood pressure was not just in those able to afford life insurance 189. there was however the question of whether there was a dividing line between normal blood pressure and hypertension.

as early as in 1906 long before the clinical concept of hypertension as a risk factor became accepted several insurance companies required medical examiners to docu- ment applicants' blood pressures 44 190. the extent of blood pressure being a good predictor of serious illness from stroke heart failure or renal disease was first recog- nized by l.i.

to provide some perspective this study was published in 1954 which is over half a century after mendel's ideas on inheritance wereapplied to medicine by archibald garrod 110. beginning in 1902 garrod had studied alkaptonuria cystinuria and albinism in relatives of patients and found that genetics explained these inborn errors of metabolism as mendelian heritable traits but he also speculated that genetics may play a role in common diseases 110 -114.more precise evidence for genetic factors to influence bp came from correlative observations of a history of hyper- tension in parents of hypertensive subjects in various pop- ulations in europe and north america 158 251 333 334 378. additional evidence was obtained through popula- tion studies wherein a greater concordance of blood pres- sure was observed within families than between families 226 but such studies also raised the question of additional shared nongenetic environmental factors such as food hab- its within a family that could influence blood pressure.
