on the other hand the association between total scfa and total ffa levels mirrored this situation a positive cor- relation being found in individuals with metabolic alterations inanalysis ffa levels being selected as the dependent variable after stratifying our populations by the clusters obtained in the previous analysis.interestingly whereas only age p  0.038 and bmi p  0.050 were identified as predictors of ffa levels in individuals within cluster i r2 model  0.407 lactobacillus abundance p  0.032 fiber intake p  0.021 scfa acetate p  0.008 propionate p  0.018 and butyrate p  0.003 and gender p  0.008 were associated with ffa levels in subjects within cluster ii r2 model  0.646.in summary different factors were found to be associated withtotal ffa levels depending on the levels of akkermansia.

in addition the analysis of inflammatory mediators showed that akkermansia was negatively associated with il-6 serum levels r  -0.233 p  0.032 whereas il-6 levels and c1 were in turn associated r  0.220 p  0.032. no associations were found for akkermansia with ifng r  0.056 p  0.604 or mcp-1 r  -0.028 p  0.802 serum levels.therefore all these results suggest a relationship between intestinal akkermansia and serum ffa levels in humans.

akkermansia abundance was negatively associated with some ffa stearic r  -0.218 p  0.039 pal- mitic r  -0.321 p  0.002 oleic r  -0.261 p  0.013 pal- mitoleic r  -0.297 p  0.004 linoleic r  -0.272 p  0.010 and g-linolenic r  -0.232 p  0.028 but no association was observed with epa dha aa or linoleic levels.

cluster ii was characterized by decreased levels of akkermansia and increased lactobacillus group counts as well as higher acetate propionate and total fecal scfa concentrations than cluster i. moreover increased total ffa 0.48 0.24 vs 0.26 0.13 mm and il-6 752.40 1155.22 vs 411.77 636.85 pgmlbut not ifng p  0.252 or mcp-1 p  0.541 serum levels were also registered in cluster ii .finally some statistical analyses performed independently within each cluster revealed particular interesting features for each group thereby stressing the existence of important differ- ences between groups.

on the one hand il-6 serum levels were negatively correlated to akkermansia abundance r  -0.312 p  0.034 and acetate r  -0.344 p  0.014 in subjects included in cluster i whereas no associations were observed in cluster ii characterized by higher il-6 and acetate levels.

r2 model  0.303. the p-value highlighted in bold represent statistically significant differentes.mufa and w6-pufa to a lower degree r  -0.266 p  0.011 and r  -0.244 p  0.020 respectively whereas no association was observed for w3-pufa r  -0.104 p  0.330. thus our findings point to a negative association between akkermansia abundance and levels of sfa mufa and w6-pufa all of them pro-inflammatory.

interestingly akkermansia levels remained associated with c1 after perform- ing this adjustment b 95 ci p -0.286 -1.999 -0.315 p  0.008 whereas no association was observed with c2 -0.052 -0.152 -0.092 p  0.625 thereby confirming our previous findings.

divergent patterns in the associations between dietary intakes with microbial populations and scfa were also observed.microbial imbalanced populations as predictors of impaired ffa levelsfinally although akkermansia abundance was identified as the only microbial predictor of serum ffa levels in the whole popu- lation analyzed n  101 striking differences in akkermansia levels were evidenced between clusters i and ii.

this observation supports a gradual relationship between akkermansia abundance and ffa serum levels and therefore aligns with the concept proposed by other authors   that a threshold for akkermansia levels may exist.

similarly an altered ffa profile identified by cluster analysis was related to imbalanced levels of akkermansia and lactobacillus as well as increased fecal scfa enhanced il-6 serum levels and higher prevalence of subclinical metabolic alterations.

as previously com- mented different parameters were found to be predictors of total ffa serum levels depending on the akkermansia levels.

to this end associations between akkermansia and the levels of individual ffa g-linolenic pal- mitic oleic stearic linoleic palmitoleic linoleic aa epa andtable 2  akkermansia as predictor of free fatty acids ffa serum levels.dha were assessed.

this finding is in line with the negative association observed between akkermansia and il-6 serum levels.associations between ffa profiles microbial populations and scfaour results from the pca analysis and the differences found in the associations with akkermansia and il-6 levels point to the existence of different ffa profiles among individuals.

on the other hand the balanced immune responses promoted upon akkermansia colonization may also account for the increased il-6 levels found in our study in sub- jects with diminished abundance of akkermansia.

although a slight correlation between total ffa and the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 was observed r  0.240 p  0.020 no effect was evidenced when il-6 was introduced in the previous multiple regression analysis.next we aimed to evaluate whether this finding was due to a general effect on total ffa levels or it could be also associated with individual ffa species.
