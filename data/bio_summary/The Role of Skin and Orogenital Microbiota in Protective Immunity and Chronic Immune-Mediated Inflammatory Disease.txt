Skin-resident Th17 cells that are affected by the skin microbiota are also independent of those from the gut microbiota suggesting that Th17 cells of the barrier sites are regulated in a compartmentalized manner by local commensals .In the skin of both mice and humans Foxp3 regulatory T Treg cells are present in the dermis especially surrounding the hair follicles where skin-resident microorganisms also reside .

As inhibition of complement component C5a receptor in germ-free mice leads to decreased levels of AMPs and proinflammatory factors the skinmicrobiome closely interacts with the complement system.A recent study using a Leishmaniasis skin infection model demonstrated that human skin microbiota is altered following infection with Leishmania and that this dysbiosis is transmissible and capable of exacerbating skin inflammation via recruitment of neutrophils and production of interleukin IL-1b  .

In this review we describe current evidence for the basis of the interactions between pathogens microbiota and immune cells on surface barriers and offer explanations for how these interactions may lead to chronic inflammatory disorders.Keywords immune response microbiota skin mucosa orogenital mucosa inflammationiNTRODUCTiONThe skin and mucosae constitute complex protective barriers against infection and injuries.

The difference between skin microbiota and that of the large intestine stems largely from the direct contact of the skin with the sur- rounding environment.

During puberty the skin microbiota goes through a major transition with domination of lipophilic bacteria such as Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium.The Skin immune SystemThe immune system of the skin is composed of complex network of keratinocytes and immune cells including the skin-specific antigen-presenting cells the Langerhans cells.
