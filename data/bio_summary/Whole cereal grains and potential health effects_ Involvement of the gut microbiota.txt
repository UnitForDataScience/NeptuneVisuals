they found that the consumption of durum wheat flour and whole-grain barley pasta resulted in increased levels of several scfas 2-methyl- propanoic acid acetic acid butanoic acid and propanoic acid as well as increase of clostridiaceae roseburia hominis and ruminococcus sp.

although whole cereal wheat did not lead to a significant change in the composition of the microbial community the ferulic acid released in the gut after whole cereal wheat consumption was significantly related to the increased abundance of firmicutes bacteroidetes as well as the genus lactobacillus.

acetic acid c2 pro- pionic acid c3 and butyric acid c4 represent 90-95 of the scfas present in the colon .

in another study of whole wheat intervention the results demonstrated that more bifidobacterium and lactobacillus were present in fecal samples in response to whole grain wheat con- sumption than for wheat bran consumption.

it is widely known that cereal processing technologies may change the structure and biological effects of bioactive components to enhance their health benefits  .thus appropriate processing technologies to change the accessibility of microbiota-accessible substrates in whole cereal grains may improve the prebiotic properties of the final whole cereal products .in vitro studiesseveral in vitro strategies have been applied to elucidate the func- tions of wcgs on the gut microbiota.

although whole wheat supplementation caused several statistically significant differ- ences in the gut microbiome of obese diabetic mice daily whole wheat supplementation for 8 weeks may not be sufficient to influence bodyweight or to produce a lean-like microbiome .human trialsseveral trials were conducted to prove the effect of wcg on the composition of the gut microbiota in humans .
