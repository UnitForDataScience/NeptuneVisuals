They found that the consumption of durum wheat flour and whole-grain barley pasta resulted in increased levels of several SCFAs 2-methyl- propanoic acid acetic acid butanoic acid and propanoic acid as well as increase of Clostridiaceae Roseburia hominis and Ruminococcus sp.

Although whole cereal wheat did not lead to a significant change in the composition of the microbial community the ferulic acid released in the gut after whole cereal wheat consumption was significantly related to the increased abundance of Firmicutes Bacteroidetes as well as the genus Lactobacillus.
