We mapped the libraries to a hard-masked hg38 refer- ence genome downloaded from the UCSC genome browser  and recorded the number of reads mapping to chrX chrY mitochondrial genome and all autosomes.

Damage patterns and fragment length distribution of ancient DNA mapped to mitochondrial genome can be found in -.Human nuclear genome analysesReads from four shotgun libraries three from the nodules Nod11 hrUDG Nod2-UDG Nod2-nonU one from the ulna Ulna-UDG were mapped and processed as described for the mitochondrial genome above.

Fragment length distributions for all pooled libraries and damage plots for the non-UDG treated libraries Nod11h-nonU and Nod2-nonU were calculated through mapDamage2   .Human mitochondrial genome analysesCASAVA processed reads see directly above from enriched ulna extractions UlnaEnr1-nonU UlnaEnr2-nonU shotgun reads from the UDG treated nodule extraction Nod11h-UDG and cor- responding extraction blanks EblkDEnr1-nonU EblkDEnr2-nonU and EblkA-UDG were processed as described above but mapped to the rCRS mitochondrial genome NC012920  .

For all libraries we additionally mapped to the S. saprophyticus ATCC 15305 NC007350 and G. vaginalis ATCC 14019 NC014644 with a customized version of the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner  obtained from with a maximum edit distance of 0.01 -n 0.01 allowing for no more than two gaps -o 2 and with seeding effectively disabled -l 16500 retaining only those mapped reads which were merged or properly paired  Molecules that were less than 35 bp in length had a mapping quality score of less than 30 or were marked as duplicates based on both 5' and 3' coordinates were removed We then pooled all nodule reads DNA originating from the shotgun DNA libraries Nod11h-UDG Nod11h-nonU Nod2-UDG Nod2-nonU and the S. saprophyticus and G. vaginalis mappings and further removed any duplicated molecules found between libraries .
