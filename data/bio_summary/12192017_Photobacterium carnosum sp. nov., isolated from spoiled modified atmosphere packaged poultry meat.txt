phosphoreum subclade Furthermore the four strains of proposed P. carnosum displayed distinct genotypes in the MLSA.FingerprintingTwo different fingerprinting analyses were performed with strains of proposed P. carnosum sp.

Analyses of respiratory quinones and cellular fatty acids were carried out by the Identification Service Leipniz-Institut DSMZ-- Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zekllkulturen GmbH Braunschweig Germany.Phenotypic characterizationThe four strains of the proposed P. carnosum sp.

All strains were tested positive for alkaline phosphatase leucine arylamidase acid phosphatase naphtol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and N-acetyl--glucosaminidase.

Based on phylogenetic genomic phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data strain TMW 2.2021T and further strains represent a novel species of the genus Photobacterium for which the name Photobacterium carnosum sp.

Analysis was performed on a Microflex LT spectrometer Bruker Corporation Billerica MA USA using a direct transfer method Amplification of genes for MLSAAll strains were grown aerobically for 72 h at 15 C in marine broth.

Reference strains were obtained from German DSMZ and Belgian BCCMLMG strain collections as indicated by strain designations respectively.Cell morphology was investigated with a Zeiss Axiostar Plus microscope with 100 magnification and documented with an Axio Cam ICc1 and the Axio Vision Rel.

carnosum strains TMW2.2021T TMW2.2022 TMW2.2029 TMW2.2030 are MF622943 MF622944 MF622945 MF622946 respectively.

These analyses indicated that four different strains of the proposed Photobacterium carnosum sp.
