Recent research has investigated the numerous bacterial species residing in the body and their role in diseases in preterm infants.

This review examined the transfer of the microbiome to the human fetus and its potential relationship with NEC.Key words Microbiome Preterm infants Fetus Necrotizing enterocolitisCorresponding author Yong-Sung Choi MD PhD Department of Pediatrics Kyung Hee University School of Medicine 26 Kyungheedae-ro Dongdae- mun-gu Seoul 02447 KoreaTel 82-2-958-2921Fax 82-2-958-8299E-mail Received 6 June 2017Revised 13 August 2017Accepted 17 September 2017IntroductionTo date research to increase our understanding of the extensive profiles of microorganisms has been limited.

For preterm infants and full term newborns breastfeeding or breast milk is strongly recom- mended for various reasons24.

oligosaccharides as immune mo- dulators26.Gregory et al.21 recently conducted a study on the role of breastmilk ingestion on acquisition of the intestinal microbiome in pre- term infants.

Cong et al.22 stressed similar points but found that patterns differed between maternal milk-fed infants and those fed human donor milk.

However NEC currently targets preterm infants.

When is the gut most prone to be affected by NEC What is the most common causative organism In the early 1990s Lucas and Cole30 found that exclusively formula-fed infants had 6 to 10 times greater risk of developing NEC.

In particular infants older than 30 weeks of postmenstrual age seldom had the disease.

The pattern is associated with decreased relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes but increased numbers of Proteobacteria these findings are asso- ciated with strikingly decreased microbial diversity in infants with NEC.
