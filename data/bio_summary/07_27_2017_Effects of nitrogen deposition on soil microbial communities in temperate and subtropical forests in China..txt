To explore which environmental variables explained most of the variation in microbial community composition we included soil depth soil moisture pH soil C content soil N content soil P content mi- crobial biomass C and N as explanatory variables.All statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software R version 3.2.2.  using the package asreml   and the package vegan  with the Ado- nis and envfit functions.ResultsEffects of N fertilization on soil C N and P content and pHSoil C N P and pH differed strongly among different soil depths be- tween subtropical and temperate forests and Fig.

MAT mean annual temperature degC MAP mean annual precipitation mm Soil C soil total C content of 0-10 cm soil Soil N soil total N content of 0-10 cm soil Soil P soil total P content of 0-10 cm soil.

Second each sample was separated into four subsamples to measure soil moisture contents of carbon nitrogen phosphorus and pH microbial biomass and community composition respectively.Measurements of soil contents of C N and P and soil moisture and soil pH2.1.

However N fertiliza- tion generally decreased soil pH and  p  0.04 especially at the 0-10 cm soil depth in subtropical forests where the value of soil pH was below 5 a-b for WYS 0-10 cm soil p  0.07.Table 2 Effects of predictors i.e.

Fur- thermore we found that pH together with other soil properties soil N and C content soil moisture etc.

Although many studies have documented effects of N deposition on plant growth  it still re- mains uncertain how N deposition affects soil microbes and soil nutrient cycling .A previous meta-analysis of 82 field studies revealed that N deposi- tion has negative effect on microbial biomass across different biomes .

twelve for each treat- ment and the control.Soil samplingAt the end of July 2015 4-5 years after the start of the fertilizer ap- plication we took soil samples from 3 depths of the mineral soil layer after moving the surface litter layer in nine plots at each site.

A second subsample of 30 g was air-dried and then used to deter- mine soil nutrient content including soil total C total N total phosphorus P and pH.

During chloroform fumigation the time of soil incubation in gaseous CHCl3 was extended from 24 h to 48 h in our experiment to fully kill all soil mi- croorganisms.
