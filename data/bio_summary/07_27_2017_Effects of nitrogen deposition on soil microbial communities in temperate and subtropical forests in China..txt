In this study we investigated the responses of microbial biomass C MBC and N MBN and microbial community composition to 4-5 years of experimentally simulated N deposition in temperate needle-leaf forests and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests in eastern China using chloroform fumigation extraction and phospholipid fatty acid PLFA methods.

In the subtropical forests N addition showed a significant negative effect on microbial biomass and community composition while the effect of N ad- dition was not significant in the temperate forests.

These results showed that microbial biomass and commu- nity composition in subtropical forests compared with the temperate forests were sensitive to N deposition.

Further as most previous inves- tigations and observations focused on a single site or a single forest type mainly in temperate and boreal forests and few in subtropical and trop- ical forests  multi-site N-fertilization ex- periments across different forest types in different climate zones are needed in order to improve our understanding of microbial responses to N deposition.For these reasons we set up a multi-site N-fertilization experimentin China in 2010 Network of Nutrient Enrichment Experiments in China's Forests NEECF .

These two subtropical forests have three-layer vertical structures which are representative of typical subtropical evergreen forests.

Soil C and N content and pH in temperate forests were significantly higher than that in subtropical forests while soil P showed the opposite pattern.

Effects of N fertilization on soil pH in subtropical forests and temperate forests among three soil depth levels.

Moreover soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi content significantly de- creased with increasing N fertilization at 0-10 cm soil depth in the sub- tropical forests  p  0.02.Effects of N fertilization on microbial community compositionThe results of redundancy analysis RDA showed that overall mi- crobial community structure and specific taxonomic groups of bacteria fungi and actinomycetes in subtropical forests responded significantly to both N50 and N100 fertilization  except d and h all cases with p b 0.05.

Specifically no significant effects of N fertilization on microbial biomass and community composition emerged in temperate forests while sub- stantial reduction of microbial biomass and shift of microbial communi- ty composition appeared in subtropical forests.
