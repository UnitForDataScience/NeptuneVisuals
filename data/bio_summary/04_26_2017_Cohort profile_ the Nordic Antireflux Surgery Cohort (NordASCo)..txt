Other tumours of potential interest are cancer of the larynx pharynx and lung which might beassociated with GORD although fewer studies support these associations and any association with lung cancer is controversial.Additionally the NordASCo will be used to evaluate whether antireflux surgery decreases the risk of non-malignant conditions that might be caused by aspiration of acidic gastric contents for example asthma pneumonia and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Due to a general decrease in the number of antireflux procedures performed with one explanation being the risk of postoperative mortality and complica- tions following antireflux surgery further studies are needed to assess these risks and to identify individuals who would benefit most from such surgery.Findings to dateIn total 945 153 individuals with a GORD diagnosis have been included in the NordASCo.

An alternative but less often used treatment is antireflux surgery during which the fundus of the stomach is wrapped partly or completely around the lower oesophagus mechanically hindering GORD.Antireflux surgery should be considered in patients with severe GORD or poor response to medical treatment especially in young physically fit and healthy adults in whom pharmacological treatment otherwise would be necessary for a long period of time.Maret-Ouda J et al.

Virtually all diagnoses and surgical procedures with defined codes are available for the members of the NordASCo.Among the main weaknesses is the potential variation in clinical practice and coding of diagnoses and proce- dures between countries including the codes associated with GORD and antireflux surgery.
