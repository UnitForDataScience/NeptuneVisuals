future plans the nordasco will initially be used to analyse the risk of developing known or potential gord- related cancers that is tumours of the oesophagus stomach larynx pharynx and lung and to evaluate the mortality in the short-term and long-term perspectives.additionally the cohort will be used to evaluate the risk of non-malignant respiratory conditions that might be caused by aspiration of gastric contents.introductionthe nordic antireflux surgery cohort nordasco was set up with the purpose of examining the consequences of surgery for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease gord.

other tumours of potential interest are cancer of the larynx pharynx and lung which might beassociated with gord although fewer studies support these associations and any association with lung cancer is controversial.additionally the nordasco will be used to evaluate whether antireflux surgery decreases the risk of non-malignant conditions that might be caused by aspiration of acidic gastric contents for example asthma pneumonia and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.due to a general decrease in the number of antireflux procedures performed with one explanation being the risk of postoperative mortality and complica- tions following antireflux surgery further studies are needed to assess these risks and to identify individuals who would benefit most from such surgery.findings to datein total 945 153 individuals with a gord diagnosis have been included in the nordasco.
