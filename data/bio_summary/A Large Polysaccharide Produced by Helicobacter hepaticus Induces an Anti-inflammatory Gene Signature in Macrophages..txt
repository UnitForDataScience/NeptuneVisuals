H. hepaticus Produces a Large Soluble Polysaccharide-Inducing IL-10 Production in MacrophagesA-G M-CSF-differentiated BMDMs were stimulated for 3 hr with different culture fractions of H. hepaticus.A mRNA and protein induction of the cytokines IL-10 and IL-6 after stimulation with control medium TSB H. hepaticus whole bacteria Hh or H. hepaticus- filtered cultured supernatant SNHh.B-D Induction of B IL-10 C IL-6 and D IL-10IL-6 ratio after 3 hr stimulation with SNHh treated with enzymes and heat SNHht SNHht fractionated by size SNHht  30 kDa and SNHht  30 kDa and LPS UP.Induction of IL-10 after stimulation with TSBt or SNHht treated with buffer - or sodium metaperiodate  NaIO4.

hepaticus Induces IL-10 in Gut-Resident MacrophagesAs blockade of IL-10 signaling induces colitis in mice colo- nized with H. hepaticus   we first assessed whether H. hepaticus interacts directly with the innate immune compartment within the intes- tinal mucosa to trigger IL-10 production.

hepaticus Produces a Large Soluble Polysaccharide that Can Induce IL-10 Production by MacrophagesTo investigate whether H. hepaticus directly induces IL-10 in macrophages we generated M-CSF differentiated bone marrow-derived macrophages BMDMs and subjected them to stimulation with whole bacteria Hh strain ATCC51449 a filtered supernatant of H. hepaticus culture medium SNHh or the control culture medium TSB.

Stimulation with TSBt - NaIO4 and LPS ST is used as a positive control for IL-10 production by BMDMs.Induction of IL-10 after stimulation with TSBt LPS ST SNHht or SNHht depleted using increasing concentrations of ConA-lectin beads 0.8 1.5 3 and 6 vv.Induction of IL-10 and IL-6 after stimulation with SNHht crude polysaccharide fraction extracted by a cold-ethanol precipitation method CPHht.Data from three independent experiments.

CPHht recapitulated SNHht activity on BMDMs with induction of high IL-10 but low IL-6 production G and S2B.Collectively these data indicate that H. hepaticus releases a large polysaccharide into the culture medium that induces mac-rophages to produce a selective response with large amounts of IL-10 and smaller amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFa.H.

hepaticus can be considered as a pathosymbiont based on its ability to live in harmony with its murine host in the presence of an IL-10 response and its potential to drive IL-23-driven intesti- nal inflammation in IL-10 deficiency.

H. hepaticus Induces IL-10 in Gut-Resident MacrophagesA-D SPF WT mice were infected with Helicobacter hepaticus Hh for 3 or 5 days.Experimental design.B and C FACS analysis of caecum and colon LPL after 3 days of infection with Hh.

hepaticus Supernatant Is Sufficient to Induce IL-10In VivoTo assess the activity of H. hepaticus polysaccharide in vivo we orally administered TSBt SNHht or live H. hepaticus to SPF mice daily for 2 days and analyzed the colon and caecum LPL by flow cytometry on day 3.

Pam3CSK4 Pam3 and LPS UP injections induced similar Il10 mRNA but higher amounts of Il6 C and Tnf non-significant Figure S3C in total peritoneal cells after 6 hr.SNHht Signals through TLR2 and MyD88 to Induce IL-10 To determine which sensing pathways were used by macro- phages for IL-10 induction we stimulated a panel of knockout BMDMs deficient in signaling proteins or PRRs--such as TLRs NOD-like receptors NLRs and C-type lectin receptors CLRs--with SNHht or TSBt.

As expected the crude polysaccha- ride fraction CPHht and the canonical TLR21 ligand Pam3 were not able to induce IL-10 in Tlr2-- BMDMs contrary to the TLR4 ligand LPS UP C. By contrast BMDMs defi- cient for CLRs MINCLE CLEC4E DECTIN-1 CLEC7A MCL CLECSF8 DNGR1 CLEC9A MICL CLEC12A other receptorsIFNAR interferon-ab receptor MR Mannose Receptor SRA Scavenger Receptor A MARCO NOD2 or signaling proteins RIP2 CARD9 were still able to produce IL-10 after stimulation with SNHht A.As a complementary approach a TLR2 blocking monoclonal antibody or an isotype control was added prior to BMDM stim- ulation with SNHht or different canonical TLR ligands.
