S2.DiscussionThis study provides novel information on the composition of the skin bacterial communities of two newts from theAmphibian skin bacterial communities differ between larvae and adultsThis study showed that the skin bacterial community of L. boscai differed in composition and alpha diversity between larvae and adults Fig.

So far it is unknown whether Bsal infection can be facilitated or mitigated by particular cutaneous bacteria but a better understanding of the microbiota composition of salamandrids might facilitate the search for such interactions in the mucosal ecosystem and thereby contribute to informed risk assessments.In this study we focus on two species of Western Euro-pean newts Lissotriton boscai and Triturus marmoratus and explore whether bacterial communities differ 1 between larvae and adults 2 between adult life-phases aquatic vs. terrestrial and 3 temporally in aquatic and terrestrial adults.ResultsDifferences in skin bacterial communities between larvae and adultsWe compared cutaneous bacterial communities of larval and adult newts focusing on aquatic adults living in the same pond as the larvae to avoid phase- or habitat- specific confounding factors.

For T. marmoratus the per- centages were of 51.9 SD 5 17.2 for larvae and 29.4 SD 5 2.6 for adults however no statistical differences were detected between groups t-test p-value 5 0.11.Differences in skin bacterial communities between aquatic and terrestrial adultsThe skin bacterial communities of terrestrial and aquatic adults of L. boscai and T. marmoratus differed in both com- position and structure PERMANOVA L. boscai - Binary Jaccard Pseudo-F 5 9.681 p-value 5 0.001 Bray-CurtisPseudo-F 5 17.947 p-value 5 0.001 Fig.

These variations can lead to temporally different skin environ- ments allowing different bacteria to survive andor establish.Future directionsThe overall importance of skin bacterial communities to the host's health is well accepted Sanford and Gallo 2013.

This is further sup- ported by the fact that terrestrial and aquatic adults although distinct shared a large fraction of the skin bacte- rial communities and at the same time showed consistency in the percentage of reads associated with Bd inhibitory bacteria.Adult life phase affects amphibian skin bacterial communitiesAlthough many amphibians live at the interface of terres- trial and aquatic habitats only few undergo drastically distinct adult life phases for extended periods of time like salamandrid newts.

In addition and as discussed in the previous section some of these bacteria appear to persist also in the aquatic adult phase of the newts.Temporal changes on the amphibian skin bacterial communitiesExamining the seasonal variation of skin bacterial commu- nities in more detail for the two target species we found significant differences in their composition and structure over the study period Fig.

Future studies on the variation in functional properties of these communities via metage- nomic or metatranscriptomic approaches will further contribute to a deeper understanding on the skin bacterial communities' stability and on how to efficiently manipulate them for conservation purposes.Experimental proceduresSamplingFrom March 2015 until February 2016 275 individuals of two Caudata species were captured in the region of Monte Xalo A Coruna Galicia Spain.

1d.There was an overlap in the bacterial families found in the skin bacterial communities of the terrestrial and aquatic adults but the abundances of these families varied between groups Fig.

The skin bacterial communities of larvae and aquatic adults shared many bacterial families however they differed in relative abun- dances Fig.

And finally when analysed through time skin bacterial communities tended to change suggesting some temporal dynamism related to variations in the abundance of particular bacterial families and in alpha and beta diver- sity throughout the seasons and months.Fig.
