In contrast to B cell-deficient mice infected animals that lack ab T cells or were depleted of CD4 cells failed to accumulate naive B cells in their draining mesLNs Figure 3B C.MesLN from Hp-infected DO11.10 mice containing a monoclonal population of CD4 Tcells specific for chicken ovalbumin also failed to accumulate naive B cells Figure 3D indicating that not just CD4 T cells per se but activation of this population by cognate antigen was required.King et al.Page 4Lymphotoxin-b receptor signaling is required for naive lymphocyte accumulationBecause naive lymphocyte accumulation required CD4 T cell activation but was not required for the increase in IL-4 effector CD4 T cells after 1 week of infection we sought to identify factors that regulated naive T cell accumulation independent of the Th2 response.

To test whether the naive lymphocyte redistribution occurred in an antigen-independent manner OVA-specific CD4 T cells were purified from DO11.10 mice and transferred into Thy1 congenic uninfected mice or mice infected with Hp 11 days prior.

These events could not be separated in mice unable to receive IL-4 signals because both naive T cell accumulation and consistent with our previous studies15 the Th2 response was compromised following Hp infection of IL-4Ra KO 4get mice Figure 4AB.

In addition experiments using mice deficient in TNFa or Type I interferon receptor IFNAR signals two pathways previously shown to promote LN hyperplasia1617 demonstrated that these factors were not only dispensable for naive lymphocyte accumulation following Hp infection but may actually exert regulatory effects at least on T cell accumulation Figure 4C D and supplemental Figure 3A B.Lymphotoxin b receptor LTbR has been previously shown to play a role in Type 2 immunity following Hp infection and mice deficient in the LTbR ligands experience compromised LN hyperplasia following subcutaneous immunization with CFA18-20.

one day before infection and CD4 T cell depletion after 2 weeks was still greater than 98 as determined by staining for TCRb CD8a and anti-CD4 RM4-4.T cell transfersCD4 T cells were FACS sorted from the lymph nodes of Thy1.2 DO11.10 mice and 5x105 cells were transferred i.v.

CD4 T cell activation is required for naive B lymphocyte accumulationA B cell deficient JhD mice and BALBc WT controls were infected with Hp or remained uninfected and the number of naive phenotype CD4 T cells in the mesLN was analyzed 2 wk later.

Our results provide one potential explanation for this clinical benefit andmay inform vaccination strategies in regions of the world where helminth infections are endemic.MATERIAL AND METHODSAnimalsBALBc 4get12 4get x Il4ra KO Tcra KO JhD and OVA-TCR transgenic DO11.10 mice all on a BALBc background and Ifnar KO and Tnfa KO mice on a C57BL6 background were bred and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 8-12 wk of age.

IFNAR KO mice C or TNF-a KO mice D as well as C57BL6 WT controls were infected with Hp or remained naive.

B OVA-specific CD4 T cells from Thy1.2 DO11.10 mice were transferred into uninfected or day 11 Hp infected Thy1.1 congenic mice.

Subsequent experiments were performed to understand 1 the relevance of naive lymphocyte accumulation to the primary effector cell response 2 the mechanisms underlying this accumulation and 3 its impact on the systemic distribution of the naive lymphocyte pool and response to secondary challenge.RESULTSNaive lymphocytes accumulate in the Th2 reactive mesenteric lymph nodes following enteric helminth infectionInfection of mice with the enteric helminth parasite Hp results in a robust Th2 and Type 2 humoral response initiated in the mesLN910.
