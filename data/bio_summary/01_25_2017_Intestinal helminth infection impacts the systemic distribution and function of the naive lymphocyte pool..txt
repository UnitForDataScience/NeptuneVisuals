In contrast to B cell-deficient mice infected animals that lack ab T cells or were depleted of CD4 cells failed to accumulate naive B cells in their draining mesLNs Figure 3B C.MesLN from Hp-infected DO11.10 mice containing a monoclonal population of CD4 Tcells specific for chicken ovalbumin also failed to accumulate naive B cells Figure 3D indicating that not just CD4 T cells per se but activation of this population by cognate antigen was required.King et al.Page 4Lymphotoxin-b receptor signaling is required for naive lymphocyte accumulationBecause naive lymphocyte accumulation required CD4 T cell activation but was not required for the increase in IL-4 effector CD4 T cells after 1 week of infection we sought to identify factors that regulated naive T cell accumulation independent of the Th2 response.

CD4 T cell activation is required for naive B lymphocyte accumulationA B cell deficient JhD mice and BALBc WT controls were infected with Hp or remained uninfected and the number of naive phenotype CD4 T cells in the mesLN was analyzed 2 wk later.

Comparing immunized mice with or without concurrent Hp infection the frequency of class-switched IgD- NP-specific B cells was similar between groups suggesting that activation of antigen-specific B cells on a per cell basis was not compromised Figure 6A and supplemental Figure 2.

B T cell deficient TCRa KO mice and BALBc WT controls were infected with Hp or remained naive and the number of naive phenotype CD19 B cells in the mesLN was analyzed 2 wk later.

To determine whether B cells also contribute to naive T cell accumulation in a Th2-dominanted immune response BALBc or B cell-deficient JhD mice were infected with Hp and naive T cells were enumerated in the mesLN 2 weeks later.

Collectively these data indicated that the accumulation of naive T cells in the reactive mesLN beginning one week after infection does not affect IL-4 effector CD4 T cell response and that the reactive mesLN represents a sustained reservoir for naive lymphocytes due to an increased homeostatic set-point.CD4 T cell activation is required for naive B lymphocyte accumulationA previous study using subcutaneous immunization with antigen in Th1-polarizing CFA adjuvant demonstrated that B cells were important for LN enlargement4.

However we also found B cells to be dispensable for naive T cell accumulation indicating an additional source of LTbR ligand that compensates for B cell production of LTb.

Using CD19IgDCD44lo B cells as a readout for naive lymphocyte accumulation BALBc TCRa -deficient BALBc and CD4 T cell-depleted BALBc mice were infected with Hp and the number of naive B cells was determined 2 weeks later.

Although the thymus generates new naive T lymphocytes and the spleen contains a large number of naive T and B cells that could potentially be recruited to inflamed sites neither thymectomy nor splenectomy of adult mice prior to infection affected the accumulation of naive T and B cells unpublished observations.

Lymphotoxin-b receptor signaling is required for naive lymphocyte accumulation A B IL-4Ra deficient and WT BALBc 4get mice were infected with Hp or remained naive and the number of naive A or IL-4GFP effector B CD4 T cells in the mesLNwas analyzed at 2 wk post-infection.
