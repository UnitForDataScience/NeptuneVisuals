These primers amplify a 322-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene which we have previously shown is well suited to classify the DD- associated treponemes at the species level  since these primers do not amplify nontreponeme DNA.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDD is a polymicrobial disease and Treponema phagedenis-like Treponema denticola Treponema pedis-like Treponema mediumTreponema vincentii-like and Treponema refringens-like phylotypes are the most prevalent species found in the lesions  .

unclassified.tionally we tested if specific environmental variables influenced the composition of the slurry microbiota.We sequenced a 310-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene of 135 slurry samples 3 of the138 samples were negative from 22 dairy herds with primers targeting general bacteria V1-V2 region and the Treponema group specifically V3-V4 region.

except for T. berlinense which is presently not associated with DD in the slurry samples from dairy farms with no known problems of DD Negative dairy farms with DD-infected cows Positive and dairy farms with unknown status No info.Spirochaetaceae are natural inhabitants of the bovine rumen  and include commensal species such as Treponema bryantii and Treponema saccharophilum both of which have been isolated from the rumen of cows  .

This study applied next-generation sequencing technology to decipher the microbial compositions of environmental slurry of dairy herds with and without digital derma- titis.KEYWORDS deep amplicon sequencing digital dermatitis slurry Treponemaovine digital dermatitis DD is an inflammation of the skin around the digits and the main cause of lameness in cattle .

In addition DNA amplicons from DD-associated bacteria such as P. levii and D. nodosus were not detectable in the slurry samples tested in the present study.TABLE 1 Herd variablesaNN not known.Spirochetes appear to make up a very small part of the slurry microbiota in dairy herds and DD-associated treponemes an even smaller fraction.

Since then however we have been able to detect small amounts of DNA from DD-associated Treponema species in slurry through a targeted deep-sequencing approach .

Of these 74 of the sequences in the general bacterial pool and 92 of the sequences in the Treponema group pool were taxonom- ically classifiable to the family level and genus level according to the RDPII database .We further investigated the unclassified Treponema reads by clustering the unclas- sified sequences at 97 similarity and using BLAST with the Nucleotide Collection nt database which revealed several large clusters in each sample that matched between 80 and 98 uncultured and unclassified ruminant treponemes the most frequently observed being an uncultured bacterium clone KO1aai43a12 identified by Ley et al.

Many of the unclassified Treponema reads resembled those associated with a not-yet- cultivated ruminant clone Treponema KO1aai43a12 which was isolated from red kangaroo feces .

ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGYMicrobiota Analysis of an Environmental Slurry and Its Potential Role as a Reservoir of Bovine Digital Dermatitis PathogensKirstine Klitgaard Mikael L. Strube Anastasia Isbrand Martin W. NielsenNational Veterinary Institute Technical University of Denmark Frederiksberg DenmarkABSTRACT At present very little information exists regarding what role the envi- ronmental slurry may play as an infection reservoir andor route of transmission for bovine digital dermatitis DD a disease which is a global problem in dairy herds.

To investigate whether DD-related bacteria belong to the indigenous microbiota of the dairy herd environment we used deep amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in 135 slurry samples collected from different sites in 22 dairy farms with and with- out DD-infected cows.
