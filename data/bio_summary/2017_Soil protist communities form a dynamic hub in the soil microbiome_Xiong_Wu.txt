However we lack an understanding of how protist communities are structured how targeted soil management can alter protist communities how such changes might affect protist functioning and how they are in turn linked to their potential bacterial and fungal prey.

a UniFrac-weighted principle coordinate analysis PCoA of soil protist community in the four fertilizer treatments and b relative abundance of five main protist taxonomic groups Stramenopiles Alveolata Rhizaria Excavata and Amoebozoa with coarse phylogenetic affinities in the four fertilizer treatments.

Members of this genus are known to produce a broad range of bioactive secondary metabolites that can inhibit soil organisms .Changes in protist taxonomic community compo- sitions induced by fertilizer regime subsequently resulted in shifts in the relative proportion of protist functional groups Fi 2.

Soil amendments strongly impacted protist communities 1-year after application with addition of organic material and beneficial microbes leading to profound changes of protist community composition and eventually function.

Here we investigated how soil amendments affect protist communities and inferred potential interactions with bacteria and fungi.

Specific fertilization treatments impacted both the structure and function of protist communities.

The addition of individual biocontrol bacteria and fungi further altered the soil protist community composition and eventually function.

Network analysis integrating protist bacterial and fungal community data placed protists as a central hub in the soil microbiome linking diverse bacterial and fungal populations.

Further soil protist communities encompass a range of plant- and animal-pathogenic species .
