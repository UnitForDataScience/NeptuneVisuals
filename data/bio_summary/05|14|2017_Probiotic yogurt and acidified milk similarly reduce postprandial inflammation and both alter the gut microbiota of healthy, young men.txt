the change in abundance of i. bartlettii was also associated with the acidified milk intake rather than the pro- biotic intervention with significant differences in the abun- dance of the otu for the strain after acidified milk intake compared with baseline assessments fc  -17 p  004.in addition this analysis revealed further modulation of bacteria by the acidified dairy product interventions.notably significant reductions in abundance for the species bilophila wadsworthia were observed after both acidified milk and probiotic yogurt intakes with respect to baseline assessments fc  -15 padj  005 after acidified milk intake fc  -13 padj  003 after probiotic yogurt intake 3d.

no significant differences in the inflammatory response to the hfm were observed after probiotic yogurt compared with acidified milk intake however both products were associated with significant reductions in the inflammatory response to the hfm compared with the baseline tests assessed by il6 tnfa and chemokine ligand 5 p  0001. these observations were accompanied by significant changes in microbiota taxa including decreased abundance of bilophila wadsworthia after acidified milk log 2-fold-change fc  -15 padj  005 and probiotic yogurt intake fc  -13 padj  003 increased abundance of bifidobacterium species after acidified milk intake fc  14 padj  004 and detection of lactobacillus delbrueckii spp.

in addition energy expenditure assessed by actigraph accelerometers showed no significant changes between test phases for sedentary low moderate- vigorous activity or for total accelerometer counts by test phase p  005 however a trend of higher levels of moderate- vigorous as well as total counts was observed during the run-in phase online supplementary table s4.fasting analysesno changes in fasting metabolic and inflammatory markers were observed after 2 weeks' probiotic yogurt intake compared with acidified milk intake except for ccl2 which showed a greater increase after acidified milk intake p  001 online supplementary table s5.

the modulation of the microbiota during the acidified milk intervention could be a mechanism for the unexpected effects of this dairy product on the inflammatory response.we explored postprandial inflammation using a hfm modeland observed that daily intake of probiotic yogurt and acidified milk similarly moderate this response.

the relatively low abundance of lgg in the probiotic yogurt culture explains the absence of significant increases of this strain after the probiotic yogurt test phase despite the inoculation count exceeding that which has been previously established in dairy products as adequate to ensure faecal recovery of the probiotic.

the first type of test evaluated the postprandial response to a single dose of the assigned dairy product 800 g of probiotic yogurt or acidified milk.

p  0001.padj  001. the strain intestinibacter bartlettii was also more abundant after probiotic yogurt intake than after acidified milk intake fc  21 padj  001. conversely the bifidobacterium kashiwanohense or bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum strains and the megasphaera genus were less abundant after probiotic yogurt intake than after acidified milk intake fc  -17 padj  001 and fc  -17 respectively padj  003. these differ- ences were consistently observed at the different taxonomic levels analysed.analysis of each intervention phase separately with respect to the baseline normal milk phases confirmed the specificity of the differences observed between the interventions online supplementary tables s7 and s8.

nevertheless in view of the nutritional qualities of bovine milk the distinct effects of both probiotic yogurt and acidified milk on inflammation remain an interesting finding.the concept of modulating the intestinal microbiota in a targeted manner is important in view of the wide number of diseases that are associated with dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota.

the trial was registered at clinicaltrial.gov registration number nct02230345.interventionstwo dairy products were tested during the study yogurt con- taining the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg lgg atcc 53103 and milk acidified with d--glucono-d-lactone 2  in order to mimic texture ph and physical properties of the yogurt.

the use of gluconic acid transformed from glucono-d-lactone in combination with a probiotic dairy product could be an interesting symbiotic approach to maximise the action of the probiotic.the impact of our probiotic yogurt on the gut microbiota washighly specific to the strains that were present in the product with limited effect on the commensal microbiota.

urine samples were collected as a fasted 'spot test' and as a single pooled sample for the 6 h of each test day usinga tube with no additives.metabolic and inflammatory marker analysesclassical parameters of metabolic health and selected circulating inflammatory markers were analysed at selected time points on the test days 1b.
