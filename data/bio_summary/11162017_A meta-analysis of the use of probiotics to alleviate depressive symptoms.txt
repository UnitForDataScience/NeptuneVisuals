A separate subgroup analysis of studies conducted in healthy versus depressed individuals found significant im- provements in the moods of individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms SMD -0.684 95 CI-1.296 to -0.0712 P0.029 and non-significant effects in healthy individuals SMD -0.0999 95 CI-0.235 to 0.0348 P0.146.Limitations Inter-study discrepancies with respect to probiotic dosing bacterial strains and strain combinations limit the comparability of current clinical trials.

It was found that probiotic supplementation pro- duced significant improvements in the moods of individuals with mild- moderate depressive symptoms SMD-0.684 95 CI -1.296 to-0.0712 P0.029 but had non-statistically significant effects in healthy individuals SMD-0.0999 95 CI -0.235 to 0.0348 P0.146 perhaps owing to the generally good baseline mood of many healthy individuals in the sample.
