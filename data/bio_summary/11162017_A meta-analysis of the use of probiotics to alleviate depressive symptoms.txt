despite promising pre-clinical data a range of unresolved concerns regarding the administration and pharmacody- namics of probiotic supplements have made it difficult to confirm and quantify their clinical application and efficacy.inter-study discrepancies with respect to probiotic dosing and treatment durations have impaired the comparability of current clinical trials and reduced the capacity to draw meaningful conclusions through meta-analyses.

a separate subgroup analysis of studies conducted in healthy versus depressed individuals found significant im- provements in the moods of individuals with mild to moderate depressive symptoms smd -0.684 95 ci-1.296 to -0.0712 p0.029 and non-significant effects in healthy individuals smd -0.0999 95 ci-0.235 to 0.0348 p0.146.limitations inter-study discrepancies with respect to probiotic dosing bacterial strains and strain combinations limit the comparability of current clinical trials.

furthermore majority of existing rcts were conducted in healthy individuals making it difficult to extrapolate the results to depressed individuals.conclusion probiotic supplementation has an overall insignificant effect on mood.

preclinical trials in animal models have found that probiotic consumption downregulates the hypothala- mic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis thought to be overactive in depres- sion  promotes biosynthesis of gaba known to be reduced in depressed patients  and boosts serotonin levels through increased production of tryptophan a serotonin precursor .with increasing evidence on the benefits of probiotics in a host of diseases there has been a surge in the number of clinical trials ex- amining their application in mental health illnesses such as depression.

results from a previous meta-analysis have indicated that probiotic formulations do have a positive psychological impact   and may offer a paradigm shift in the treatment of depression as either an adjunct to standard therapy or as a stand-alone treatment.

the inclusion criteria for this review were 1 pub- lished randomized controlled trial 2 specified dose of probiotic was administered as an active intervention and 3 mood symptoms were quantified using a validated rating scale e.g.

it was found that probiotic supplementation pro- duced significant improvements in the moods of individuals with mild- moderate depressive symptoms smd-0.684 95 ci -1.296 to-0.0712 p0.029 but had non-statistically significant effects in healthy individuals smd-0.0999 95 ci -0.235 to 0.0348 p0.146 perhaps owing to the generally good baseline mood of many healthy individuals in the sample.

preclinical studies in animal models have found that probiotic administration downregulates the hpa axis thought to be overactive in depression   promotes biosynthesis of gaba known to be reduced in de- pressed patients  and boosts serotonin levels through increased production of tryptophan a serotonin precursor .

more re- search is needed to identify the ideal dose treatment duration and bacterial speciesstrains that are most likely to have the greatest impact on mood.another major drawback to probiotic use is their in vitro and in vivo stability and viability.

with a wide range of preparations available for probiotic delivery it is important to consider the advantages and drawbacks of each method.
