knowledge of the metabolic pathways affected by this surgical procedure is important when bariatric surgery is indicated and ensures successful obesity treatment .the role of bariatric surgery on microbiotaaccording to several studies bariatric surgery as a strategy to achieve weight loss plays a crucial part in functional and taxonomic changes observed in the gut microbial communities after surgery -.

fiber and caloric restriction with significant weight loss influence tl and possibly have a preventive effect on telomere shortening .the fact that weight loss induced by bariatric surgery does not restore short tl after one year was one of the first signs that bariatric surgery impact tl .

interestingly a study that investigated subjects before and six months after bioenteric intragastric balloon found that individuals who present greater weight loss show greater telomere lengthening .further studies are necessary to assess and to establish interactions between these genetic variants and bariatric surgery outcome so that biomarkers can be determined for more personalized weight loss management.epigenetic signatures related to bariatric surgery outcomesdna is a highly dynamic biomolecule which is reflected in its diverse and complex regulation .

epigenetic changes related to bariatric surgery may be due to weight loss per se or to other factors related to the surgical procedure such as the daily use of vitamin-mineral supplements and alterations in hormone secretion and dietary intake after the procedure .table 2. recent studies evaluating epigenetics modifications after bariatric surgery.il-6 interleukin 6 pdk4 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 tnf tumor necrosis fator scd-1 stearoyl coa desaturase-1 pgc-1a proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator-1 a adk adenosine kinase ptpre protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type e etp early t-cell precursor foxp2 forkhead box protein p2 hdac4 histone deacetylase 4 dnmt3b dna methyltransferase 3 beta line-1 long interspersed nuclear elements rygb roux-em y gastric bypass.furthermore a specific gene methylation profile can be used to predict weight loss after rygb.

a recent study on whole transcriptome analysis evidenced that about 1366 genesare differentially expressed 1188 upregulated and 178 downregulated genes in the postoperative period as compared to the preoperative period of rygb and that these genes are associated with gene transcription lipid and energetic metabolism immunological processes cell differentiation oxidative stress substrate oxidation and adipocyte differentiation .table 3. some interactions between bariatric surgery and the gene expression profile.genemodification typerelated metabolicsurgerytimeref.ggt1 camp defa1 lcn2 tp53 pdss1 olr1 cntnap5 dhcr24 and hhatil-6 il-8 and tnf-alpha glut4 irs1 and adiponectin-increase decreaselipid metabolism and obesity developmentinflammation glucose metabolismsix to twelve months after bariatric surgery sg and rygbacutely postoperative rygbcideaglutathionelipid droplet formationincreasein the adipose tissue glutathione metabolism12 months after bariatric surgery sg and rygbucp2 plin1increase unchangedthermogenesis lipolysissix months after rygbtnf casp3increaseinflammation12 months after bariatricleptin pparg1 pparg2decrease increase unchangedinsulin metabolism12 months after rygbucp1 ucp3unchangedthermogenesissix months after rygbggt1 gamma-glutamyltransferase camp cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide defa1 defensin alpha 1 lcn2 lipocalin 2 tp53 tumor protein p53 pdss1 decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 1 orl1 oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 cntnap5 contactin- associated protein like 5 dhcr24 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase hhat hedgehog acyltransferase il-6 interleukin 6 il-8 interleukin 8 tnf tumor necrosis factor glut4 glucose transport irs1 insulin receptor substrate 1 cidea cell death-inducing dffa-like effector a ucp2 uncoupling protein 2 plin1 perilipin 1 casp3 caspase 3 pparg1 peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 1 pparg2 peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2 ucp1 uncoupling protein 1 ucp3 uncoupling protein 3.ortega et al.

some studies compared patients' pre- and postoperative rygb microbiota to non-operated control individuals' microbiota to detect alterations in intestinal bacteria after surgery more specifically increased proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and decreased firmicutes table .table 4. alterations of bacterial phyla after bariatric surgery.new studies aiming at better understanding the interactions between microbiota and obesity and the possible ways to modulate gut microbiota could benefit bariatric surgery patients in the future.conclusionssurgical management of obesity requires understanding the genetic and epigenetic factors that play a crucial key role in obesity development and weight loss response.

we also present reports on how significant weight loss induced by bariatric surgery impacts telomere length and we discuss studies on the existence of an epigenetic signature associated with surgery outcomes and specific gene methylation profile which may help to predict weight loss after a surgical procedure.

2016  showed that dna methylation patterns behave differently according to the adopted weight loss strategies.in the bariatric surgery context genome-wide dna methylation analysis shows that weight loss is associated with changes in methylation at cpg and exonic regions close to transcription start sites .

every year about 500000 bariatric surgical procedures are performed worldwide sleeve gastrectomy sg 49 and roux-en y gastric bypass procedure rygb 43 are the most commonly performed techniques -.long-term excess body weight reduction is a major goal of bariatric surgery.

in this paper we summarize the main literature findings relating nutritional genomics and bariatric surgery.figure 1. algorithm of personalized nutrition in bariatric surgery.

we include investigations that demonstrate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with obesity phenotypes and their influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery.

the role nutritional genomics plays in responses to weight loss after bariatric surgery is evident.

despite the positive effects of bariatric surgery weight regain that is recovery of 10 to 20 of the minimum weight achieved by the patient  occurs in between 30 and 50 of the patients at the late postoperative period between one and a half and two years after the surgical procedure .just as genetic and epigenetic signatures influence the obesity phenotype  genetics recognizably underlies weight loss percentage resistance and maintenance after surgical treatment .

several genes as well as singlenucleotide polymorphisms snps are associated with obesity phenotypes and weight loss after bariatric surgery -.novais et al.
