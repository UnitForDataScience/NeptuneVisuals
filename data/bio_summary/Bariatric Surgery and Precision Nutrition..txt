fiber and caloric restriction with significant weight loss influence TL and possibly have a preventive effect on telomere shortening .The fact that weight loss induced by bariatric surgery does not restore short TL after one year was one of the first signs that bariatric surgery impact TL .

Knowledge of the metabolic pathways affected by this surgical procedure is important when bariatric surgery is indicated and ensures successful obesity treatment .The Role of Bariatric Surgery on MicrobiotaAccording to several studies bariatric surgery as a strategy to achieve weight loss plays a crucial part in functional and taxonomic changes observed in the gut microbial communities after surgery -.

Alterations of bacterial phyla after bariatric surgery.New studies aiming at better understanding the interactions between microbiota and obesity and the possible ways to modulate gut microbiota could benefit bariatric surgery patients in the future.ConclusionsSurgical management of obesity requires understanding the genetic and epigenetic factors that play a crucial key role in obesity development and weight loss response.

We also present reports on how significant weight loss induced by bariatric surgery impacts telomere length and we discuss studies on the existence of an epigenetic signature associated with surgery outcomes and specific gene methylation profile which may help to predict weight loss after a surgical procedure.

Interestingly a study that investigated subjects before and six months after bioenteric intragastric balloon found that individuals who present greater weight loss show greater telomere lengthening .Further studies are necessary to assess and to establish interactions between these genetic variants and bariatric surgery outcome so that biomarkers can be determined for more personalized weight loss management.Epigenetic Signatures Related to Bariatric Surgery OutcomesDNA is a highly dynamic biomolecule which is reflected in its diverse and complex regulation .

2016  showed that DNA methylation patterns behave differently according to the adopted weight loss strategies.In the bariatric surgery context genome-wide DNA methylation analysis shows that weight loss is associated with changes in methylation at CpG and exonic regions close to transcription start sites .

Every year about 500000 bariatric surgical procedures are performed worldwide sleeve gastrectomy SG 49 and Roux-en Y gastric bypass procedure RYGB 43 are the most commonly performed techniques -.Long-term excess body weight reduction is a major goal of bariatric surgery.

We include investigations that demonstrate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with obesity phenotypes and their influence on weight loss after bariatric surgery.
