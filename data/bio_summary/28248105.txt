however glucomannans gm and their derived oligomers denoted glucomannoligosaccharides or gmos could also play a role as prebiotics but before they must fulfill as for the rest of the candidates several requirementsi they cannot be hydrolyzed or absorbed inthe best-known raw material for gm and gmos production is konjac amorphophallus konjac which has been employed for centuries with health purposes although there are other potential natural resources that contain these kind of components such as eastern white pine higanbana orchid or redwood.it is necessary to remark that the konjac glucomannan kgm has been approved as a gras generally recognized as safe food additive in the united states and canada and it is also accepted by the european union as an emulsifier and thickener with the e-number e425.research studies on gm are limited and especially focused on its production from konjac and on both its structural characteristics and physical properties.- however other properties such as the impact of this polysaccharide and itsthe upper gastrointestinal tract ii they have to encourage the development of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and iii they must induce beneficial physiological effects on the host's health that have to be clearly demonstrated through well-conducted human trials.received december 2 2016revisedfebruary 10 2017accepted february 14 2017published february 14 2017c 2017 american chemical society2019doi journal of agricultural and food chemistryderived oligomers on human intestinal microbiota have not been yet deeply investigated.to contribute to the development of new mannan-derived prebiotics this paper summarizes the scientific literature regarding especially the manufacture and biological properties of gm and their derived oligosaccharides.basic structure and composition of mannansfour types of mannan polysaccharides can be distinguished pure mannan glucomannan galactomannan and galactogluco- mannan.
