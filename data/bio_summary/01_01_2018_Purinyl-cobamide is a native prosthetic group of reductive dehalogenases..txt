based on this informa- tion we estimated the molecular mass of the lower base compound in the dsf cobamide to be 120.15 1329.54 mh of cyanated dsf cobamide - 1355.58 mh of cyanocobalamin - 146.19 dmb which is suggestive of unsubstituted purine.confirmation of the novel lower base structurethe cobinic acid skeleton in the cyanated form carries a constant number of 12 nitrogen atoms.

genome sequence analysis corroborates that dsf strains possess the complete set of genes required for cobinamide biosynthesis and lower base activa- tion and attachment but the identity of the lower base of native dsf cobamides remains elusive.here we report the discovery and characterization of purinyl-cba as the native cobamide produced in axenic pce-dechlorinating dsf cultures and demonstrate its distinct functionality in differ- ent corrinoid-auxotrophic organohalide-respiring bacteria.
