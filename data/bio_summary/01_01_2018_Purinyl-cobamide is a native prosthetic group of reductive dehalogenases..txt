Cobamide standards 5 mgL each were norpseudo vitamin B12  11.23 min Bza-Cba  13.34 min 5-OMeBza-Cba  13.88 min p-cresol-Cba  17.23 min and 17.64 min 5-OHBza-Cba  13.13 min 5-MeBza-Cba  13.89 min vitamin B12  15.02 min.

Briefly each reaction 300 mL contained 30 mg CobT corresponding to a final enzyme concentration of 2.6 mM 2 mM NaMN 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.25 mM of either purine or DMB in 50 mM pH 7.5 Tris-HCl buffer.

3c-e. As the molec- ular mass of the a-ribazole-5'-phosphate a-RP moiety in natu- ral cobamides ranges from 306.2 with phenol as the lower base to 425.31 Da with 2-methylsulfonyladenine as the lower base a mass difference of 312.42 Da between the measured molecular mass of the Dsf corrinoid and the calculated molecular mass of Cbi 1016.12 Da in the monocyano form indicated that the predomi- nant Dsf corrinoid was a cobamide carrying an a-RP moiety with a yet-unidentified lower base.

Dhc strain BAV1 and strain GT cultures were amended with 5 mM acetate as a carbon source 10 mL hydrogen as an electron donor neat cDCE 79 mmol per bottle 0.60 mM aqueous concentration as an electron acceptor and a cobamide for example vitamin B12 as described.

Purinyl-Cba was the only corrinoid detected in this gel slice confirming that the Dsf PceA RDase uses purinyl-Cba as the native prosthetic group.Dsf CobT substrate specificity and phylogenetic analysis The nicotinate-nucleotide-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribo- syltransferase CobT activates lower bases to their respective a-RP forms  and the CobT substrate specificity determines the type of cobamide produced.

2.Mass spectra of the D. hafniense strain Y51 corrinoid and of vitamin B12 standard obtained using LC-MS displayed strong base peaks with mz values of 1329.54 and 1355.58 respectively corresponding to intact corrinoid ions MH Supplementary Fig.

Cells were collected by centrifugation at 9000 x g for 20 min suspended in HEPES buffer 50 mM HEPES 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole pH 7.5 and sonicated in an ice bath for 45 min 3-s on and 4-s off.

CobT sequences encodedinsequenced Dsf genomes are highly conserved 81.3-100 amino acid identity except for Desulfitobacterium metallireducens strain DSM 15288 whose CobT shares no more than 58.5 amino acid identity with other available Dsf CobT sequences.

Dsf cobT locus  DSY2114 and Dhc cobT locus  DehaBAV10626 were amplified using Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix Thermo Fisher and primer sets NJ459-NJ460 and NJ461-NJ462 Supplementary Table 4 respectively using genomic DNA from Dsf strain Y51 and Dhc strain BAV1 axenic cultures.

CobT enzymes of other members of the Peptococcaceae may share catalytic features with the Dsf CobT and activate purine as a lower base for cobamide biosynthesis indicated by the dashed line-enclosed pink area.
