Evidence that antibiotic resistance develops in diverse bacterial taxa following prolonged triclosan exposure suggests that triclosan resistance may be mediated by specific genes Forbes et al 2016 Hartmann et al 2016 Khan et al 2016 and that these genes may be horizontally transferred Ciusa et al 2012.

Microbial diversity did not correlate with urinary triclosan levels at 6 months Infants R2  0.024 P  0.40 Mothers R2  0.015 P  0.49 Fig EV4.Species richness measured by Chao1 was also not affected by TC exposure P-values for 2 6 and 10 months for infants 0.61 0.51 1mothers 0.68 0.49 0.84.Intestinal exposure to triclosan through toothpaste rather than wash products is associated with Proteobacteria enrichment in TC householdsGiven a minor but statistically significant difference between mater- nal gut compositions between the TC and nTC arms from permuta- tion tests we hypothesized that TC exposure affected a small proportion of taxa within the community.

The low contri- bution to variance of factors known to influence microbial coloniza- tion in infants by 2 months of age such as delivery method R2  0.068 P  0.011 and breast feeding R2  0.13 P  0.041 in the household Fig EV3 is consistent with previously reported data Chu et al 2017.Randomization to TC-containing products does not decrease gut microbial diversity or species richness in infants or mothersRandomization to the TC arm was not associated with decreased gut microbiota diversity for infants or mothers at any of the 2- 6- or 10-month visits after infant birth Fig 3.

Despite the minimal effects of TC exposure from wash products on the gut microbial community of infants and adults detected Proteobacteria enrich- ment highlights the need for consumer safety testing of consumer antimicrobial products on the human microbiome and antibiotic resistance.Materials and MethodsStudy designSubjects in this study were recruited to participate in Stanford's Outcomes Research in Kids STORK a prospective cohort study of healthy mothers and infants Ley et al 2016.

Triclosan exposure restructures the juvenile fish microbiome Narrowe et al 2015 but results in recov- erable alterations following short-term perturbation in adult fish Gaulke et al 2016.

Triclosan exposure is known to play a role in allergen and food sensitization Hampton 2011 Savage et al 2012 topical skin application of triclosan is sufficient to induce peanut sensitivity in mice Tobar et al 2016.

Statistical comparisons of treatment arms with permu- tational multivariate analyses PERMANOVA showed no significant association between TC exposure and microbiome composition for infants R2  0.012 P  0.17 but did demonstrate a minor but significant association between TC exposure and microbiome composition in the mothers R2  0.028 P  0.001.

Disruptions to the microbiota early in development by extrinsic factors such as antibiotics can have long-term impacts on metabolic regulation Cox et al 2014 and can delay normal microbiota maturation Nobel et al 2015.

In a small randomized crossover human study TC wash product exposure did not induce major perturba- tions of the oral and gut microbiomes Poole et al 2016.
