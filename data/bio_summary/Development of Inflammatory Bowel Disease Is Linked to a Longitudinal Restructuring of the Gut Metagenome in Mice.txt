In addition to these physiological similarities the DNR line serves as an effective model of human IBD because i human IBD is associated with mutations in SMAD3   a direct downstream target of TGF-l3 RII required for Foxp3 induction in the gut  and ii DNR mice model the documented effect of Smad7 overexpression in human IBD .To obtain insight into how the longitudinal dynamics of the microbiome associate with IBD onset and progression we followed DNR and littermate wild-type WT controls from weaning through severe disease.

As a result our insight into how the gut microbiome operates dynamically in association with disease development is limited.Mouse models of disease present an opportunity to quantify the longitudinal covariation between gut microbiome functions and IBD development while overcom- ing the challenges associated with a prospective human study and reducing the extensive genetic lifestyle and microbiome variations among humans.

Our work indicates that the microbiome may contain biomarkers of IBD development clarifies mechanisms through which the microbiome may contribute to disease development and reveals how gut microbes operate to succeed in an inflamed intestinal environ- ment.RESULTSAge-matched female WT and DNR littermates were monitored longitudinally for IBD development over a period of 9 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age upon being weaned from their mother.

Additionally future research should use this model and build upon our findings to clarify how TGF-l3-induced differentiation and function of T cells interact with the taxonomic structure and function of the gut microbiome.Overall our results indicate that the development of IBD is associated with corre- sponding changes in the operation of the gut microbiome.

Elucidating the cryptic etiology of IBD would enable new preventative measuresdiagnostics and therapies.Recent work has implicated the gut microbiome in the development and severity of IBD .

These results show that the functional diversity of the mouse gut microbiome is relatively constrained early in life but increases over the lifetimes of WT but not DNR individuals.We then investigated how the composition of gut microbiome functions varies over time and between cohorts DNR mice versus WT mice by using an abundance- weighted beta-diversity metric Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.

Collectively these analyses indicate that i the diversities and structures of the gut microbiome differ over time in WT and DNR mice that are between 4 and 15 weeks of age ii the WT and DNR microbiomes are generally consistent with each other prior to immune activation in DNR mice but diverge afterward and iii immune activation isassociated with changes in the subsequent successional diversification of the gut microbiome.On the basis of these observations we assessed how specific components of the microbiome associate with disease development.

As this is a T cell-mediated IBD model we quantified peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell activation by flow cytometry and measured the longitudinal change in the CD44hi activated fraction which includes both effector and memory T cells see Fig.
