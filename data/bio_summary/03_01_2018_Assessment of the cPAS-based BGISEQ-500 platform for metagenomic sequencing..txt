c d density histograms showing the coefficients of a robust linear model for relative abundance of genes from the top 20 species and their gc content for genes that differed significantly in abundance between the 2 platforms c and for all hr genes d. d e density curves e and 2-dimensional plot f showing the gc content distributions of hr genes that differed significantly in abundance between the bgiseq-500 and hiseq 4000 platforms.in summary despite that the hiseq 2000 platform showed a slight enrichment of reads on a relatively small number of high- gc content genes metagenomic datasets from bgiseq-500 and hiseq 2000 exhibited comparable cross-platform consistency regarding gene detection and quantification.

quality assessment by base position revealed lower-quality scores in the beginning of raw reads from the hiseq 2000 platform com- pared with bgiseq-500 and a gradually decreasing trend of qual- ity toward the 31-end of reads on both platforms additional file 1. considering that a routinely tail-trimming qc pipeline would not be sensitive to detection and filtering of reads with randomly distributed low-quality bases we developed an overall accuracy oa control strategy for quality adjustment additional file 2. by using this approach 96.06 of the raw reads remained as high- quality reads which attained an average length of 85 bp with 90.56 of bases scoring q30 and above.

b. in accordance with the taxonomic anno- tation of igc 25.37 of the genes that differed in relative abun- dance were assigned to known species additional file 6.assuming that the abundance of most genes from a species should be even and independent of their gc content we con- ducted robust linear regression analysis of the correlation be- tween the abundance of genes and their gc content for each species supplementary methods.

the same bimodal distribution patterns in gc content were ob- served among these 6323 hr genes with an enrichment of gc- rich genes in the hiseq 4000 dataset as well as a slight enrich- ment of at-rich genes in bgiseq-500 dataset.

genes with greater than or equal to 10 mapped reads per sample were retained as highly reproducible genes and used for spearman correlation analysis.

the dashed line indicates that at 99 ci genes with greater than or equal to 10 reads in replicate 1 x-axis could be detected with mapped reads great than or equal to 1 in replicate 2 y-axis.

after qc and removing poten- tial human-related reads an average of 95.98 and 97.91 of raw reads were obtained from bgiseq-500 blue and hiseq 2000 red respectively and were defined as clean reads left panel.

collec- tively these findings demonstrate that the bgiseq-500 platform across the entire process of library preparation and sequencing of metagenomic dna samples provides highly reproducible and well-controllable results.cross-platform consistencypreviously shotgun metagenomic dna sequence reads have mostly been generated using illumina platforms warranting evaluation of data consistency between the bgiseq-500 and illu- mina platforms 91.89 of the genes in the bgiseq-500 datasets showed expected read count fluctuations in hiseq 2000 99 ci that were less than intra-platform replicates fig.

the hiseq 4000 dataset showed comparable high-quality and igc mapping ra- tios close to that of the bgiseq-500 and hiseq2000 datasets ad- ditional file 3. because of the low number of sequencing reads from the hiseq 4000 platform all igc uniquely mapped reads for each subject ranging from 13.18 to 21.54 million were used for validation analyses without downsizing.

based on this cutoff 96.06 of the raw reads were retained as high-quality reads with an average oa value greater than 90.additional file 3 summary of data production and quality control.additional file 4 assessment of reference coverage for metagenomic sequencing data.

the high cross- platform quantitative consistency was further documented us- ing a hiseq 4000 dataset with a lower number of genes exhibit- ing differences in abundance between the platforms and ex- hibiting the same bimodal distribution pattern of gc content of these genes.discussionthe bgiseq-500 platform has lately proven its robust perfor- mance in connection with several sequencing applications in- cluding whole-genome sequencing rna-seq and small rna- seq  8-10. unlike these applications which focus on a single organism metagenomics deals with a complex mix- ture of dna from multiple organisms.

a log-linear model was used to model the total number of species in each of the 8 categories abundance highlow gc content highlow bgiillumina and a likelihoodratio test then suggested that the association between relative species abundances and their gc content did not vary across the bgiseq-500 and hiseq 2000 sequencing platforms p  0.323 chi-square test supplementary methods.to further document the quantitative consistency and per- formance regarding gc content observed for the bgiseq-500 and hiseq 2000 platforms the same 20 dna samples were processed to construct libraries and sequenced on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform using the hiseq 30004000sbs kit 300 cycles for 100 bp of paired-end reads.the raw sequencing reads were filtered as described above.

only a low percentage 2.02-3.25 of genes exhibited significant differences in relative abundance comparing the bgiseq-500 and hiseq platforms with a bias toward genes with higher gc content being enriched on the hiseq platforms.

both library and sequence replicates showed very high correlations at the gene levels 0.930 and 0.926 and species levels 0.984 and 0.989.cates a high reproducibility of gut microbial gene detection using the bgiseq-500 platform.to assess the consistency of relative abundance identifica- tion of gut microbial genes we performed spearman correlation analysis based on highly reproducible hr genes and species profiles supplementary methods.
