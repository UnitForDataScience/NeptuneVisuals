The common end pathway of uncontrolled inflammation is macrophage activation syndrome which can be associated with one or more of these phenotypes or an inability to remove the source of inflammation for other reasons or the presence of other pediatric hyper-inflammatory syndromes including the CAPS Cryopyrin Associated Autoinflammatory Periodic Syndromes spectrum.HLA - Human leukocyte antigen TNF - Tumor necrosis factor LPS - LipopolysaccharideTAMOF - Thrombocytopenia associated multiple organ failure Plt Ct - Platelet count AKI- Acute kidney injury DIC - Disseminated intravascular coagulation SMOF - SequentialCarcillo et al.Page 21multiple organ failure EBV - Epstein Barr Virus sFASL - Soluble Fas ligand IL - InterleukinCarcillo et al.Page 22Figure 3.Phenotype specific therapies reported as effective in resolving inflammation and facilitating MODS recovery.HLA - Human leukocyte antigen TNF - Tumor necrosis factor LPS - LipopolysaccharideTAMOF - Thrombocytopenia associated multiple organ failure Plt Ct - Platelet count AKI- Acute kidney injury DIC - Disseminated intravascular coagulation SMOF - Sequential multiple organ failure IVIG- Intravenous immunoglobulin PTLD - Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder HLH - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis sFASL - Soluble Fas ligand IRAP - Interleukin-1 IL-1 receptor antagonist proteinCarcillo et al.Page 23Figure 4.The dynamic immune response in MODS.

Full recovery of organ functions is noted six to eighteen weeks later when epithelial endothelial mitochondrial and immune cell regeneration and reprogramming is completed.KeywordsDamage Associated Molecular Pattern molecules DAMPS Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern molecules PAMPS Cytochrome P450 metabolism mitochondria Thrombocytopenia associated MOF Sequential MOF Immunoparalysis Macrophage Activation SyndromeSTATE OF THE SCIENCEOverviewBaue et al first described Multiple System Organ Failure MSOF in a case series of general surgery patients who died after three days in the intensive care unit ICU with sequential respiratory and then hepato-renal organ failures rather than from shock in the first three days of critical illness 1-6.

The 'Danger Hypothesis' 17 posits that injury to endogenous cells releases damage-associated molecular patterns DAMPS that alter antigen presenting cells responses to exogenous antigens or pathogen-associated molecular patternsCarcillo et al.Page 3PAMPS in a way that amplifies the cytokine response.
