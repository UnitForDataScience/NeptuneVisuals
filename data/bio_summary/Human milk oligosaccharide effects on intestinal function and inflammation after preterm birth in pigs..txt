Mixtures of HMOs were investigated in intestinal epithelial cells and in preterm pigs n112 fed IF supplemented without CON or with a mixture of four HMOs 4-HMO or N25 HMOs 25-HMO 5-10 gL given for 5 or 11 days.

Diarrhea and reduced absorption of water might shorten the contact time between the HMOs and the epithelium and bacteria and the increased intestinal transit may have reduced the ability of HMOs to exert prebiotic and decoy effects.The trend toward higher SCFA levels in the colon of 4-HMO pigs relative to CON pigs in Experiment 3 suggests that the HMOs were subject to colonic fermentation at least at 11 days after preterm birth.

Diet effects and regional differences on NEC outcome and other functional parameters and the relationship between diarrhea and onset of NEC were evaluated using the accumulated NEC severity scores continuous in a linear mixed model lmer.

There are individual variations in the relative abundance of specific HMOs as the in vivo synthesis of HMOs is dependent on the mother's genotype for fucosyltransferases reflected in specific blood group determinants and secretor status.

Both single HMOs and mixtures of HMOs may have important functions that are central for maturation and immuno- logic capacity of the GIT.

It is unknown however if the effects of HMOs are similar between normal infants and preterm infants which have an immature GIT with a highly unstable bacterial colonization.With recent advances in synthetic chemistry a wide range of pure oligosaccharides structurally identical to HMOs are now becoming available in amounts relevant for in vivo investigations.

n3.When stimulating cells with individual HMOs only the acidic HMOs induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion both Pb.05 at levels similar to that induced by LPS.

Co- stimulation of LPS and acidic HMOs further elevated IL-8 secretion compared with corresponding HMOs alone both Pb.05 or LPS alone Pb.05.

The protective effects of HMOs may differ depending on the gut development and degree of bacterial coloniza- tion and specific HMOs may work in concert to exert their immune modulating effects.

In these studies oligosaccharide profiling of pooled HMOs revealed that one specific isomer disialyllacto-N-tetraose DSLNT was responsible for the NEC-protective role of HMOs.
