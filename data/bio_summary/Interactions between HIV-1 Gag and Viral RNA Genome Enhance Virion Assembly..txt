Thus the MLV packaging signal is functional in the context of MW-RNA.These packaging experiments showed that 1-RNA can be efficiently packaged by HIV-1 Gag but not MLV Gag whereas MW-RNA can be packaged more efficiently by MLV Gag than HIV-1 Gag.

During the initiation of HIV-1 RNA dimerization the RNA-RNA interaction either exposes or increases the number of specific Gag binding sites which allows binding of multiple Gag proteins effectively increasing the local Gag concentration this process facilitates a switch in Gag conformation making key surfaces of Gag more accessible for Gag-Gag interactions leading to particle assembly.

To test this hypothesis we examined the effects of an HIV-1 RNA with deletion in the packaging signal on HIV-1 particle production and the effect of HIV-1 RNA on the particle production of MLV Gag which does not efficiently package HIV-1 RNA  .

Furthermore 1-RNA was efficiently packaged into the Gag particles because most of the CeFP particles from the samples cotransfected with 1-RNA contained YFP signals  the results of RNA incorporation into HIV-1 particles from three sets of independent experiments are summarized in .Plasmids 1-GagPol 1-GagCeFP and 1-RNA were all derived from HIV-1 molecular clone NL4-3 and RNAs expressed from these constructs contain largely HIV-1 se- quences.

A General structures of HIV-1 helper constructs that express HIV-1 GagGagPol or HIV-1 Gag tagged with CeFP.

We also tagged HIV-1 Gag with cerulean fluorescent protein CeFP when Gag-CeFP is coexpressed with untagged Gag particles that are morphologically indistinguishable from immature HIV-1 particles can be gen- erated  .

Briefly this construct expresses an 3-kb packageable HIV-1 RNA that harbors the 5 UTR 350 nucleotides of gag RRE BSL and the 3 UTR but does not express any viral proteins.Plasmid MW-RNA is similar to 1-RNA except for the following modifications the HIV-1 LTR and 5 leader sequence were replaced with the CMV promoter from pCMVDR8.2 as a result most of the HIV-1 leader sequence is deleted and gag contains a frameshift mutation.

In this report we examined the role of HIV-1 RNA in virus assembly and found that packageable HIV-1 RNA enhances particle production when Gag is expressed at levels similar to those in cells containing one provirus.

To examine the effect of viral RNA on assembly we uncoupled these two functions of HIV-1 RNA by using separate plasmids to express HIV-1 Gag and packageable viral RNA.

These results indicate that packageable HIV-1 RNAs enhance HIV-1 particle pro- duction and this activity is independent of the expression of Tat and Rev but is due to the presence of packageable RNA.RNA genome-mediated enhancement of particle production is dependent on Gag expression levels.
