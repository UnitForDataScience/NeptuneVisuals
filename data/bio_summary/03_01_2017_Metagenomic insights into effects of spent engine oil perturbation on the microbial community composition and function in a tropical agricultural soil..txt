To un- derstand the impact of spent engine oil SEO contamination on microbial community structure of an agricultural soil soil microcosms designated 1S agricultural soil and AB1 agri- cultural soil polluted with SEO were set up.

Variance anal- ysis of the physicochemical variables of both microcosms indicates significant difference at P  0.05.Kinetics of SEO degradation in soil microcosm AB1The degradation of the SEO in AB1 soil microcosm was mon- itored using GCFID as shown in the gas chromatograph depicted in Fig.

c.Analysis of taxonomical distribution among the sequences functionally annotated using the GhostKOALA showed that in AB1 the genera Pseudomonas Sphingobium Dyella Klebsiella Paraburkholderia Cupriavidus Sphingomonas Stenotrophomonas Novosphingobium and Xanthomonas present the highest contribution for the observed functional differences while in 1S the main genera found were Aeromonas Stenotrophomonas Lactobacillus Roseiflexus Propionibacterium Mesorhizobium and Ruigeria.KEGG Orthology KO was also used to further elucidate the metabolic profile of the AB1 metagenome in relation to the enzyme systems responsible for the degradation of the SEO detoxification of the heavy metals and transport of in- organic nutrients in the soil microcosm.

It is instructive that this period coincides with the period spanning remarkable utilization of phosphorus which is a very important mineral element in the synthesis of informational macromolecules and coenzymes.The degradation of more than 72 of the SEO in the AB1 soil is remarkable bearing in mind that there was no nutrient addition and stimulation was only achieved via addition of water to maintain the soil at its water holding capacity and mixing for aeration.

Subsystems such as metabo- lism of aromatic compounds n-phenylalkanoic degradation chlorobenzoate degradation benzoate degradation catechol branch of ketoadipate pathway and resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds beta-lactamase bacterial cyanide pro- duction and tolerance mechanisms copper homeostasis copper tolerance resistance to chromium compounds the mdtABCD multidrug resistance cluster arsenic resistance cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance are well highlighted in AB1 microcosm Fig.

after functional analyses of the protein sequences of AB1 metagenome using the KEGG tool GhostKOALAcontent of AB1 from days 14 to 28 and subsequent mainte- nance at high level during the remaining treatability period contrasts markedly with the trend in 1S where after an initial spiking during days 14-21 there was reduction to a very low level subsequently.

Our study on SEO impacted agricultural soil draws on the routine analytical method and metagenomic studies to elu- cidate the structural and metabolic shifts consequent upon spent engine oil perturbation.The significant drop in pH observed in the AB1 microcosm is attributable to the production of acidic metabolites includ- ing organic acids by the hydrocarbon degrading populations in the soil.

For the soil mi- crocosm with agricultural soil contaminated with SEO AB1 genomic DNA was extracted 6 weeks after contamination to determine the effects of the SEO contamination on microbial community structure and function.
