in contrast at the end of 42 days significant increase in organic matter and nitrogen contents were observed in both microcosms though the increase is much more remarkable in ab1 with exponential increase in organic matter content observed at days 14-28. variance anal- ysis of the physicochemical variables of both microcosms indicates significant difference at p  0.05.kinetics of seo degradation in soil microcosm ab1the degradation of the seo in ab1 soil microcosm was mon- itored using gcfid as shown in the gas chromatograph depicted in fig.

to un- derstand the impact of spent engine oil seo contamination on microbial community structure of an agricultural soil soil microcosms designated 1s agricultural soil and ab1 agri- cultural soil polluted with seo were set up.

in ab1 the subsystems with the highest representation are glycerolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism in bacteria 1.93 serine glyoxylate cycle 1.69 ygfz 1.45 and potassium homeostasis 1.45. subsystems such as metabo- lism of aromatic compounds n-phenylalkanoic degradation chlorobenzoate degradation benzoate degradation catechol branch of ketoadipate pathway and resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds beta-lactamase bacterial cyanide pro- duction and tolerance mechanisms copper homeostasis copper tolerance resistance to chromium compounds the mdtabcd multidrug resistance cluster arsenic resistance cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance are well highlighted in ab1 microcosm fig.

it is instructive that this period coincides with the period spanning remarkable utilization of phosphorus which is a very important mineral element in the synthesis of informational macromolecules and coenzymes.the degradation of more than 72 of the seo in the ab1 soil is remarkable bearing in mind that there was no nutrient addition and stimulation was only achieved via addition of water to maintain the soil at its water holding capacity and mixing for aeration.

c.analysis of taxonomical distribution among the sequences functionally annotated using the ghostkoala showed that in ab1 the genera pseudomonas sphingobium dyella klebsiella paraburkholderia cupriavidus sphingomonas stenotrophomonas novosphingobium and xanthomonas present the highest contribution for the observed functional differences while in 1s the main genera found were aeromonas stenotrophomonas lactobacillus roseiflexus propionibacterium mesorhizobium and ruigeria.kegg orthology ko was also used to further elucidate the metabolic profile of the ab1 metagenome in relation to the enzyme systems responsible for the degradation of the seo detoxification of the heavy metals and transport of in- organic nutrients in the soil microcosm.

for the soil mi- crocosm with agricultural soil contaminated with seo ab1 genomic dna was extracted 6 weeks after contamination to determine the effects of the seo contamination on microbial community structure and function.

our study on seo impacted agricultural soil draws on the routine analytical method and metagenomic studies to elu- cidate the structural and metabolic shifts consequent upon spent engine oil perturbation.the significant drop in ph observed in the ab1 microcosm is attributable to the production of acidic metabolites includ- ing organic acids by the hydrocarbon degrading populations in the soil.

involved in catabolism of various aromatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons and several others indicated in table .as expected anaerobic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation was very uncommon in ab1 microcosm as only twoenzymes 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-coa dehy- drogenase and 2-hydroxycyclohexanecarboxyl-coa dehy- drogenase involved in anaerobic benzoate degradation path- way were detected.

the sieved soil was thoroughly mixed in a large plastic bag to avoid variability among the results of replicate soil sam- ples and was used without air-drying.

genomic dna was extracted from the agricultural soil 1s immediate- ly after sampling to determine the microbial community struc- ture of the soil prior to seo contamination.

genomic dna were ex- tracted from the sieved soil samples 0.25 g using zymo soil dna extraction kit model d 6001 zymo research usa following the manufacturer's instructions.

this is demonstrated in this study where the representative genera of the two archaeal phyla euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota completely disappeared after seo contamination.contamination of the soil with seo imposes many stressors on the soil ecosystem such as acidic ph heavy metals pahs and aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons which inadvertently affect not only the abundance and richness of the microbial community but also its functional diversity.
