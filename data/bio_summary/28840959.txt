For example the CRISPR-Cas9-based forward genetic screen will help future studies of plant-micro- biome interactions to transcend individual genes and become more holistic in approaches to elucidate plant- microbiome interactions and discover novel genes for biotechnological applications Barakate and Stephens 2016.A wealth of genome information dramatically expandsour understanding of a variety of microbial metabolic pathways available for novel traits.

Certain metabolites can for instance directly trigger enhanced plant growth as signal molecules others can indirectly support plant growth by inhibition of plant pathogens or by shaping a beneficial microbiome around the plant.The integration of microbial biofertilizers biocontrolmicrobes optimized microbiomes soil amendments and matching microbe-optimized crops for different soil types would be the ultimate goal for enhancing plant-microbe interactions.

Therefore elucidating the interactions between miRNA and the microbiome may provide a valuable toolkit to engineer a defined ben- eficial plant microbiome or transfer miRNA from a target soil to recipient soils for desirable outcomes.Plant ecological engineering e.g.

Similar approaches can expedite the isolation of 'keystone' microbial species and develop synthetic microbial communities that promote plant performance.

While the optimization of microbial biofer- tilizers and biopesticides is advancing rapidly to enable use in various soils crop varieties and envi- ronments crop breeding programmes have yet to incorporate the selection of beneficial plant-microbe interactions to breed 'microbe-optimized plants'.

Emerging efforts exploring microbiome engineering could lead to microbial consortia that are better sui- ted to support plants.

This host-mediated microbiome engineering approach selects upon microbial communities indirectly through the host and leverages host traits that evolved to influence microbiomes.

Over- all existing microbial technologies along with emerging microbiome and associated approaches offer new andmore sustainable practices to increase agriculture pro- ductivity.
