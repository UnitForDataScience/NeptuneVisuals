in total data were generated from samples from 133 individuals in family a 18 individuals in family b and 27 controls.using minimum entropy decomposition see materials and methods we found 271 phylotypes in the total microbiome data set all of which were present when consid- ering just family a. of these 271 phylotypes 49 were present in 95 of individuals within family a with the firmicutes the most abundant phyla  as observed in previous oral microbiome studies  .

mds1 to mds5 are the five axes of metric multidimensional scaling mds.cpermutations stratified by city in this analysis.individual n  26  individuals who had cohabited with at least one other individual either at the time of sampling or beforehand n  61  individuals living in four different cities who were not necessarily cohabiting with another indi- vidual n  82 table s1 and individuals with host genetic information available n  111 .shared household is the dominant factor affecting salivary microbiome com- position.

therefore we assumed that individuals aged 18 or younger at the time of sampling were living with their parents and individuals aged 25 or older were not.for analysis of the effects of household we included only households with two or more individuals so as to remove the possibility that we were measuring only interindividual differences which can be large in the salivary microbiome  .

the relative importance of these factors for the oral microbiome is still under debate with the majority of previous studies focusing on the gut microbiome  although it seems reasonable to assume some potential interaction between the salivary microbiome and microbial communi- ties in other parts of the human body including the intestinal tract .there is evidence that genetically related individuals tend to share more gut microbes than unrelated individuals do whether or not they are living in the same house at the time of sampling  .

it appears that household-level differences in the salivary microbiome may also apply to genetically unrelated individuals and nonpartners with a similar pattern observed in analysis of 24 household pairs of genetically unrelated individuals only half of whom were considered romantic couples at the time of sampling .the establishment of the oral microbiome appears to proceed rapidly in the first few years of life with a notable increase in diversity from 0 to 3 years  especially after the eruption of teeth .

nmds1 nonmetric multidimensional scaling axis 1.to be detected in the salivary microbiome even after individuals are no longer living in the same household .a recently described large ashkenazi jewish family  offers an opportunity to investigate the effect of both environment and genetics in closely related individuals.

salivary microbiome samples cluster somewhat by household shown by different colors despite large overlap between them shown by a nonmetric multidimensional scaling based on bray-curtis dissimilarity between samples from individuals in a particular subfamily n  44 within family a a. this figure includes individuals who are currently living together filled circles those who had moved out of their childhood home empty circles and those for whom data were missing faint circles.

an exploratory analysis of microbiome variation across a subfamily within family a n  44 showed that individuals from the same household had a more similar microbiome composition as measured by bray-curtis dissimilarity mean - standard deviation sd 0.623 - 0.088 compared with individuals from different households 0.652 - 0.084 and this difference was significant p  0.001 by two-sided t test.

we confirmed that city-level effects were small by extending our sample to 82 individuals across the four cities who were not necessarily cohabiting with others 48 individuals for city i 13 for city ii 12 for city iii and 9 for city iv and found that city still had a small effect although it was significant r2  0.053 p  0.01. in this analysis we also found no significant effect of genetics but age was significant r2  0.028 p  0.0101 table s1.spouses share taxa at the subgenus level.

to see whether the effects of household persisted we repeated analysis of variance with these individuals included along with the cohabiting individuals n  61 .

the microbial composition of sites within the mouth has been previously observed to be persistent within individuals over periods of months  to a year  and we see similar strain-level variation between spouses and their young children as observed between individuals by utter et al.

because all individuals in our main cohort were members of the same extended ashkenazi jewish family the genetic variation in our data set is therefore much lower than between individuals from a wider population.

comparison to human microbiome project hmp samples from various sites in the mouth also indicated that ashkenazi jewish individuals do not have a significantly different oral microbiome from those of other populations with ashkenazi jewish saliva samples clustering with nonplaque samples from individuals in the hmp fig.
