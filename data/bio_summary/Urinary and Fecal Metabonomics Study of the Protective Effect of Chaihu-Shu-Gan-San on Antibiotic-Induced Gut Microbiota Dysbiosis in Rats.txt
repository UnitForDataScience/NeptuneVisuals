The metabolites are adenine F1 D-lactic acid F2 succinic acid F3 5-methoxydimethyltryptamine F4 L-homoserine F5 2-ketobutyric acid F6 2-keto-glutaramic acid F7 guanidoacetic acid F8 indolea- crylic acid F9 N-lauroylglycine F10 5-L-glutamyl-taurine F12 aspartyl-histidine F14 cholic acid F15 3-oxocholic acid F16 deoxycholic acid F17 chenodeoxycholic acid F18 nutriacholic acid F19 12-ketodeoxycholic acid F20 and allodeoxycholic acid F21.

They are leucyl-hydroxyproline U1 3-oxodecanoic acid U2 glycolic acid U3 hydroxypyruvic acid U4 acetylglycine U5 aspartyl-Histidine U6 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine U7 2-methylbenzoic acid U8 3-indole carboxylic acid glucuronide U9 2-indolecarboxylic acid U10 3-methyldioxyindole U11 niacinamide U12 5-L-glutamyl-taurine U13 xanthosine U15 2-ketobutyric acid U17 and ascorbic acid U18.

The PCA and PLS-DA model were performed to evaluate the metabolic patterns of antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis rats after CSGS treatment and The metabolic profile of rats in CSGS treated group fairly differed from the antibiotic group but was similar to the control group indicating the deviations induced by antibiotic were significantly improved after CSGS treatment.Identification of potential fecal biomarkers associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis.

In this study decreased levels of cholic acid F15 deoxycholic acid F17 chenodeoxycholic acid F18 nutriacholic acid F19 and allodeoxycholic acid F21 were observed in feces samples of gut microbiota dysbiosis rats which can be explained bile acid metabolism involved in the dysbiosis of gut microbiota.

Pattern recognition with multivariate statistical analysis allowed the metabolic pro- files of urine and feces of antibiotic-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis group clearly separated from the control group and the CSGS treated group was closer to the control group.

The gut microbiota patterns of control group C antibiotic group A and CSGS  antibiotic group AC differentiated by PCoA A.

The rats were housed individually in cages and maintained 20-25 degC and 40-60 humidity under controlled conditions of 12 h light-12 h dark cycles lights on from 600 a.m.-600 p.m. and water available ad libitum.The rats were randomly divided into three groups n  8 1 Control group C orally normal saline 2 Antibiotic group A dosed with antibiotic imipenemcilastatin sodium at a daily dose of 50 mgkg of body weight from day 1 to day 21 3 CSGS  antibiotic treated group AC rats received the same dose of antibiotic imipenemcilastatin sodium for 21 days and orally CSGS water extracts at the dose of 7.0 g kg-1 once daily for 21 days.

Taken together the decreased urine levels of hydroxypyruvic acid U4 acetylglycine U5 and 2-ketobutyric acid U17 and increased feces levels of L-homoserine F5 guanidoacetic acid F8 and 2-ketobutyric acid F6 indicated the dysbiosis of gut microbiota.

C Control group A antibiotic group AC CSGS  antibiotic group QC quality control samples.antibiotic treatment resulted in significant reduction in levels of Firmicutes and increase levels of Bacteroidetes whereas these two disturbed gut microbiota phyla could be regulated after CSGS treatment 1B.

The orthogonal to partial least squares-discriminate analysis OPLS-DA method was employed to sharpen an already established separation between the antibiotic group and control group in PLS-DA 3C.
