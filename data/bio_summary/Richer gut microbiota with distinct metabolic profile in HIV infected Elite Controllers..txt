Thus we pres- ent that their microbiota is richer and differs in predicted functionality from treatment naive HIV progressors resembling the microbiota of HIV negative controls.

In conclusion EC have richer gut microbiota than untreated HIV patients with unique bacterial signatures and a distinct metabolic profile which may contribute to control of HIV.Progressive HIV-1 infection is characterized by depletion of CD4 T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue followed by immune activation gut microbiota dysbiosis and microbial translocation-.

In a previous work differences in the bacterial com- position of gut microbiota between ART naive HIV patients and EC were observed at the phylum level with an enrichment of Bacteroidetes and a reduction of Actinobacteria in EC.

inter-individual variation in the gut microbiota than the viremic patients and principal coor- dinate analysis PCoA revealed that EC clustered separately indicating a different gut microbiome compared to other HIV-infected individuals.Use of metagenomic techniques has illuminated the complex interactions between the host metabolic activ- ities and gut microbial species in several diseases.

Outliers are represented by a single data point a. LASSO regression analysis with AUROC ROC curves AUC used for estimation of model accuracy curve was used for classification of gut microbiota composition between groups and lowest accuracy was found between EC and negative patients AUC 0.77 suggesting that the similarity of microbiota composition was highest between these groups b.Genera of Sutterella Oscillospira Rhizobium Anaerofilum Alistipes Anaerotruncus and Odirobacter had all at least two inverse correlations with some of the cellular immune activation markers CD38 HLA-DR.

Furthermore IDO-1 activity measured by KT-ratio correlated with NMDS2 axis separating naive patients from the other groups supporting that the gut microbiota composition affects systemic metabolism of tryptophan through kynurenine pathway.

Our observation indicates that alternative therapeutic interventions modulating gut microbiota richness and not only composition are warranted in order to reduce HIV-related inflammation.As illuminated by Moya and Ferrer not only the bacterial composition is important in a given microbiota.

Additionally improved gut microbiota composition and positive immunomodulatory effects have been associated with oral supplementation of the nutritional mixture including several prebiotic oligosaccharides and omega-36 fatty acids in ART naive HIV-infected subjects .

Spearman's correlation was applied for testing correlations between metabolites and NMDS plot axis coordinates.Up till now only a few studies included functional analysis of gut microbiota in HIV patients  .
