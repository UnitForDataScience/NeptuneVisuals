The percentage of cell viability was calculated as follows cell viability  Absorbance of treated cells Absorbance of untreated cells x 100Cell apoptosis analysisTo detect apoptosis cells were incubated with culture of BI87 or AD05 for 6h.

The leukemia cells in the leukocyte layer were transferred to a fresh 15 ml sterile centrifuge tube washed with PBS and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum in an incubator at 37degC with 5 CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.Morphological assessmentMorphological changes of cells treated with fecal supernatant or extractions of the metabolites from the bacterial cultures were inspected by phase contrast inverted microscopy Zeiss Axiocam Erc 5s Germany.

The cells treated with the same volume of Gauze No.1 medium and the cells without treatment served as control groups.Bacterial genomic DNA extractionGenomic DNA from bacterial strains that showed strong anti-cancer activities was isolated for 16S rDNA sequencing.

In the control the interstitial tissue of the left thigh was heavily infiltrated with cancer cells Figure 9D even though no tumor growth was seen by naked eyes in AD05-treated mice infiltrated cancer cells were only seldom found Figure 9E and in BI87-treated mice no infiltrated cancer cells were found Figure 9F.

A control without fecal supernatant B through F fecal supernatant from five different individuals Magnification 200 X.Table 1 Percentages of individuals whose fecal specimens exhibit positive anti-cancer activities in different age populationsNote The P value indicates comparison between different age groups with the chi-square test by SPSS.detection of the producers of the anti-cancer substances would yield more direct evidence for the existence of the malignancy-killers and can also provide the materials for further studies or applications.Isolation of malignancy-killing bacterial strainsTo isolate and identify the microbes that are responsible for the detected anti-malignancy activities we spread diluted fecal specimens onto agar plates see Materials and Methods picked single colonies and grew the bacteria in liquid medium for up to 168 hours before inspecting their effects on cancer cells.

B The subcutaneous xenograft tumor models by transplanting human ovarian cancer ES-2 cells into nude mice.C Body weight changes over the 19 days of tumor growth.

The score 0 to 5 used here depended on the percentages of cancer cells stained by HE 0 0 1 5 2 5-25 3 25-50 4 50-75 and 5 75.

The chosen colonies were transferred into fresh Gauze No.1 liquid medium for further culture and saturated pure cultures were obtained for tests as well as for preservation in 25 vv glycerol at -80degC.Cell cultureHuman solid cancer cells of several cell lines including cervical cancer cell line HeLa ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and A2780 and colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW620 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium DMEM with 10 fetal bovine serum.

The plasma was removed and the blood cells were mixed with equal volume of cell culture mediumwithout serum.

The extraction was dried by rotary evaporator at 40degC and stored at 4degC.MTT assayCultured cells were distributed into 96-well plates in 100 mL of medium incubated overnight and then treated with the compounds over a range of concentrations for the indicated time.
