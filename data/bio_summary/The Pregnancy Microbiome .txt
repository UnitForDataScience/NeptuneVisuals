Nonetheless direct effects of progesterone and estrogen on the microbiota and the effects of the microbiota on these hor- mones have not yet been proven 6.Additionally significant immune changes occur during pregnancy and these are likely to affect the microbiota.

Fur- ther comparisons between the microbial signatures of pregnancy and disease states such as the metabolic syndrome may highlight common as well as unique pathways and microbial involvement in each condition.When starting to dissect the roles of the gut microbiota during pregnancy the third-trimester microbiota was shown to cause increased weight gain insu- lin resistance and a greater inflammatory response compared to the first-tri- mester microbiota when transferred to germ-free mice 8.

On the other hand the microbiota can also produce and secrete hormones emphasizing the bidirectional nature of the interplay be- tween microbiota and hormones.

Therefore the metabolic changes occurring during pregnancy are expected to influence the microbiota composition.Pregnancy Leads to Changes in the Gut MicrobiotaSeveral alterations in the gut microbiota have been associated with pregnancy progression.

Gut microbiota have also been suggested to play a role in host weight gain during pregnancy via increased absorption of glu- cose and fatty acids increased fasting-induced adipocyte factor secretion induc- tion of catabolic pathways and stimulation of the immune system 8 10.Since the microbial communities are greatly affected by the host diet and ini- tial weight the microbiota of pregnant women differ accordingly 10.

While most studies show significant alterations in gut microbiota during pregnancy DiGiulio et al.did not detect any changes in gut or vaginal microbiota composition includ- ing richness indexes during gestation.Antibiotics administered during pregnancy were shown to affect the micro- biome composition and diversity as well as to promote weight gain in rodents 12.

Therefore it is not surprising that there are dis- tinct alterations in the microbiota at multiple sites within the body during preg- nancy.

We hypothesize that an appropriate microbiota is essential for the healthy early development of the fetus and pregnancy mainte- nance.

Yet there remains much to be discovered regarding the precise microbial alterations dur- ing pregnancy their timing and potentially their further effects.Studying the microbiota in pregnancy opens another fascinating question of whether the fetus is exposed to microbes and if so at what stage of develop- ment.

The enig- ma of whether a placental microbiota exists as well is still not fully resolved.The Healthy MicrobiomeThe human microbiome is a collection of bacteria archaea fungi and viruses all residing within our bodies and including their genetic material.
