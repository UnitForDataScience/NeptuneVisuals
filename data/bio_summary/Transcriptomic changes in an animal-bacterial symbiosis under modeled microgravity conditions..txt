For example during the initial 3 h of the symbiosis V. fischeri changes the host gene expression to upregulate a host chitinases which degrades chitin and leaves a chitobiose gradient for V. fischeri to chemotactically migrate through the pores on the surface of the light organ and colonize the crypt spaces.

Additionally we examined light organ morphology of animals exposed to natural space conditions aboard the space shuttle to demonstrate that V. fischeri can effectively colonize the host light organ rendering it a useful model for microgravity-related studies.

Colonization of the light organ attenuates the RONS signals in the light organand therefore V. fischeri may be critical for controlling the oxidative environment of the light organ during microgravity conditions.The data provided here suggest that the presence of symbiotic bacteria help maintain homeostasis of the innate immune and oxidative environment of the host animal during modeled microgravity conditions.

These results suggest that at hatching the host animal is poised to receive the bacterial signal and that in the absence of V. fischeri the stress of being in a microgravity environment may trigger elements of the innate immune system as an adaptive response.A similar effect was seen regarding the host oxidative stress response in the light organ.

In the absence of the V. fischeri symbiont extended exposures to protease and oxidative stress responses may have negative health effects on the host animal.In summary the use of the E. scolopes - V. fischeri symbiosis provides an ideal platform to examine how healthy beneficial associations with microbes are initiated regulated and potentially altered during space flight.

First animals inoculated with V. fischeri aboard the space shuttle showed effective colonization of the host light organ the site of the symbiosis during space flight.

Aposymbiotic flight animals were not colonized and showed no hemocyte trafficking into the crypt epithelial spaces 1h.To ensure that colonization of the host light organ under spaceflight conditions was not the product of a high dosage of V. fischeri 1 x 105 cells per ml FSW in LMA replicate experiments were conducted using modeled microgravity in a rotary culture system and High Aspect Ratio Vessels HARVs over a range of bacterial concen- trations.

Here the sequenced transcriptomes derived from the light organ suggest that as in the nervous system the light organ might also be a hot spot for RNA editing enabling the host to respond to V. fischeri colonization or changing environmental conditions.

For example NO production in conjunction with the production of hemocyanin is critical for selection of V. fischeri in the aggregate outside of the light organ whereas ROS are detected along the ciliated ducts that V. fischeri have to pass through to reach the crypt spaces.
