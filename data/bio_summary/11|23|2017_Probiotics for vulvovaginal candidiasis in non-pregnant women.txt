Diagnosis of VVC was confirmed by the presence of clinical symptoms and signs and a positive microscopic examination or positive vaginal culture or both.We excluded trials of women with RVVC diabetes mellitus im- munosuppressive disorders taking immunosuppressant medica- tion or trials that recruited women with evidence of coinfection with other vulvovaginal infections.Types of interventionsAny probiotic single or multiple strains any preparation type dosage regimen or route of administration.Used alone versus conventional antifungal drugs.Used as adjuvants to conventional antifungal drugs before during or after antifungal treatment versus conventional antifungal drugs alone.Conventional antifungal drugs described here refer to the com- mon drugs for VVC treatment such as azole drugs triazoles and imidazoles and nystatin.Types of outcome measuresPrimary outcomesClinical cure rate disappearance of symptoms and signs and no evidence of fungal infection proved by microscopic examination or vaginal culture split into 'short-term clinical cure rate' zero to 14 days after treatment and 'long-term clinical cure rate' one three and six months after treatment.Mycological cure rate no evidence of fungal infectionproved by microscopic examination or vaginal culture split into 'short-term mycological cure rate' zero to 14 days after treatment' and 'long-term mycological cure rate' one three and six months after treatment.Relapse rate symptom recurrence confirmed bymicroscopic examination or vaginal culture at one three and six after mycological cure.Rate of serious adverse events death internal organ injurysevere skin and mucosal injury.Secondary outcomesTime to first relapse.Rate of non-serious adverse events mild symptoms include vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain abnormal urination pelvic cramps paresthesia rhinorrhea headache dizziness fever chills vaginal burning stinging itching and irritation.Need for any additional treatment at the end of therapy.Patient satisfaction with treatment.Cost effectiveness.Search methods for identification of studiesWe attempted to identify as many relevant RCTs as possible of probiotics for VVC regardless of language publication date or publication status published unpublished in press and in progress.

One trial compared oral fluconazole and vaginal fenticonazole antifungal medicines with oral fluconazole plus vaginal fenticonazole plus probiotic.Key resultsCompared with conventional antifungal drugs used alone probiotics as adjuvant therapy could enhance their effect in improving the rate of short-term within five to 10 days clinical cure short-term mycological cure no abnormal laboratory results and relapse atone month recurrence of problems but does not seem to influence the rate of long-term within one to three months clinical cure long-term mycological cure serious and non-serious side events.However because of the low quality of evidence available there is insufficient evidence for the use of probiotics as adjuvants to conventional antifungal medicines or used alone for the treatment of VVC in non-pregnant women.Quality of the evidenceThe quality of the evidence was low or very low in this review so we have very little confidence in the results.S U M M A R Y O F F I N D I N G S F O R T H E M A I N C O M P A R I S O N Probiotics used as adjuvants to conventional antifungal drugs compared with conventional antifungal drugs for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in non- pregnant womenPatient or population non-pregnant wom en with vulvovaginal candidiasisSettings outpatient clinics in Brazil Bulgaria Iran and ChinaIntervention probiotics used as adjuvants to conventional antif ungal drugsComparison conventional antif ungal drugsOutcomesIllustrative comparative risks 95 CIRelative effect 95 CIAssumed riskCorresponding riskNo of participants studiesQuality of the evi- denceGRADECommentsConventional anti- fungal drugsProbiotics used as adjuvants to con- ventional antifungal drugsClinical cure rate short- termf ollow-up 5-10 daysM edium risk populationRR 1.14 1.05 to 1.24721 per 1000822 per 1000757 to 8946955OO-Low1635 per 1000679 per 1000546 to 8453monthsafter treatmentf ollow-up 3 m onthsM edium risk populationRR 1.30 1.00 to 1.70494 per 1000642 per 1000494 to 8401721OOO-Very low12M ycological cure rate short- termf ollow-up 5-10 daysM edium risk populationRR 1.06 1.02 to 1.10880 per 1000933 per 1000898 to 9689697OOLow1See 3 in f ootnotes.M ycologicalcure rate long- term1 month after treat- mentf ollow-up28-30 daysM edium risk populationRR 1.26 0.93 to 1.71706 per 1000890 per 1000657 to 10006273OOOVery low124See 5 in f ootnotes.3monthsafter treatmentf ollow-up 3 m onthsM edium risk populationRR 1.16 1.00 to 1.35741 per 1000860 per 1000741 to 10001721OOO-Very low12Relapse ratef ollow-up 30-37 days af ter treatm entM edium risk populationRR 0.34 0.17 to 0.68145 per 100049 per 100025 to 993883OOO-Very low16Rate of serious adverse eventsf ollow-up 5-90 days af ter treatm entM edium risk populationRR 0.80 0.22 to 2.9423 per 100018 per 10005 to 684402OO-Low12 The basis f or the assumed risk e.g.
