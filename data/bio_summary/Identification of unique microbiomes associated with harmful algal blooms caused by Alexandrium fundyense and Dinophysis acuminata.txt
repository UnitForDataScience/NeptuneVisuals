At the order level 'Unassigned' 41 Flavobacteriales 18 and SAR11 clade 13 account for 72 of the differences seen between the two bloom communities SIMPER average dissimilarity  22.36 C. The relative abundances of Flavobacteriales and the SAR11 clade were significantly t-test p  0.01 greater during the Alexandrium bloom compared to during the Dinophysis bloom C. At the genus level the NS5 marine group 11 and an uncultured bacterium Rhodobacteracea 11 were the dominant sequences during the peak of the Alexandrium bloom while the peak of the Dinophysis bloom was dominated by 'Unassigned' sequences 21 .Phytoplankton and bacterial assemblages differed across sizefractions 0.2 mm vs. 20 mm during the peak of the Alexandrium 9 May and Dinophysis 27 June blooms .

Identification of unique microbiomes associated with harmful algal blooms caused by Alexandrium fundyense and Dinophysis acuminataTheresa K. Hattenrath-Lehmann Christopher J.

In addition none of these studies has used experimental approaches to understand the factors driving changes in planktonic commu- nities associated with HABs and the bacterial assemblages associated with the DSP-producing dinoflagellate Dinophysis have yet to be described.Here high-throughput amplicon sequencing was used to assessbacterial 16S and phytoplankton assemblages 18S associated with the harmful algae Alexandrium fundyense and Dinophysis acuminata during successive toxic blooms in Northport Bay NY USA.

Select sample dates were used to compare phytoplankton and bacterial assemblages in the 0.2 and 20 mm size fractions at the peaks of both the Alexandrium 9 May and Dinophysis 27 Juneblooms to compare free-living and particle-associated bacterial assemblages.Cultures and culturing conditionsLocally isolated cultures Alexandrium fundyense NPB8 North- port Bay NY and Dinophysis acuminata Meetinghouse Creek NY were used for this study  .

The red and blue boxes represent the dates included in the peaks of the Alexandrium and Dinophysis blooms respectively.22.8 1.4 0C and 23.4 0.3 during the peak of the Dinophysis bloom 21 June-6 July.

In contrast to Alexandrium during the peak of the Dinophysis bloom Dinophysis represented the majority of algal sequences 24-70 .

The peak of the Dinophysis bloom 27 June was dominated by Dinophyceae 90 specifically Dinophysis acuminata 70 in both the 0.2 and 20 mm size fractions A and B.

The addition of Dinophysis filtrate caused no significant changes in the relative abundances among bacterial or phytoplankton sequences at any level of classification.Bacterial assemblages associated with culturesThe relative abundances of bacterial sequences differed between size fractions in both Alexandrium and Dinophysis cultures .

Further while the microbiome of Dinophysis prey in culture may alter the bacterial communities given the high similarity of the bacterial communities in the two size fractions in culture  it would seem the prey do not appreciably contribute to Dinophysis microbiomes.

The single exception to this was bacteria from the Dinophysis experiment DINOADD where the control and filtrate treatment grouped closely to each other and were not significantly different  supporting the hypothesis that Dinophysis has weaker control of bacterial communities compared to Alexandrium.
