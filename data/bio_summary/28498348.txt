Future developments may include maneuvers to modify gut processing or absorption of these nutrients or derivatives to improve CKD patient outcomes.Keywords chronic kidney disease caramboxin microbiota choline carnitine tryptophan tyrosine trimethylamine N-Oxide TMAO p-cresyl sulfate indoxyl sulfate gut-kidney axisCKD and Uremic ToxinsThe prevalence of chronic kidney disease CKD hovers around 5-15 of the adult population and increases with age .

From nutrients to toxins A Metabolic pathways for generation of the uremic toxin TMAO from dietary L-carnitine and choline B metabolic pathways for generation of the uremic toxins p-cresyl-sulfate and p-cresyl-glucuronide from dietary tyrosine and C metabolic pathways for generation of the uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate and indole-3-aldehyde from dietary tryptophan.

However CKD frequently remains undiagnosed it has been estimated that 9 of adults over the age of 80 years have been diagnosed with CKD but around 60 have undiagnosed CKD .

The figure represents some key recently described pathways by which they may contribute to the two key consequences of CKD CKD progression and accelerated cardiovascular aging.Choline and L-carnitine Are Metabolized to TMAOCholine is an essential nutrient and quaternary ammonium salt containing the NNN-trimethylethanolammonium cation.

For a solute to be considered a uremic toxin it should meet two criteria one related to the mechanism underlying accumulation in CKD and another related to the contribution to CKD manifestations.

Correspondence Received 14 March 2017 Accepted 9 May 2017 Published 12 May 2017Abstract In chronic kidney disease CKD accumulation of uremic toxins is associated with an increased risk of death.

Thus oral L-carnitine supplementation promotes the growth of L-carnitine metabolizing bacteria and may result in decreased L-carnitine absorption.

The low bioavailability depends both on transport kinetics and on L-carnitine metabolism by intestinal bacteria as the number of L-carnitine processing bacteria increases when L-carnitine is abundant .

Chronic hemodialysis may lead to progressive L-carnitine deficiency through a combination of loss of L-carnitine in dialysate and decreased L-carnitine synthesis by the injured kidney .
