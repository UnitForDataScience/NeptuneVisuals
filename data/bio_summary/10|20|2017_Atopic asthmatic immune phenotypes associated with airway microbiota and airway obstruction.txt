oral taxon 180 in either phenotype after fluticasone propionate treatment Tables H-J in .The airway microbiome is associated with differential cytokine production observed in asthmaticsTo further assess if the differences in the microbiome were related to differences in cytokines we performed multiple regressions with DC1 as a linear predictor for cytokines in controls asthmatics pre-FP and asthmatics post-FP.

Mod- ules of cytokines were identified using significant Pearson's correlations controlled for multi- ple hypothesis testing P  0.05 Q  0.05 and clustered using complete-linkage algorithm.Clusters were said to be modules if five or more cytokines had interactions with each other to control for clusters composed of spurious interactions.

There was no significant increase or reduction in IL-10 G-CSF IFN-g or IL-17F data not shown.Cytokine modules associate with asthmatic phenotypes and pulmonary functionTo determine if the cytokines that were differentially abundant between controls and asth- matic phenotypes have effects that are independent or are correlated with other cytokines we constructed a correlation network of cytokines across all subject samples n  30 using signifi- cant associations Pearson's correlations P  0.05 Q  0.05 .

We analyzed cytokine concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage of young adult atopic asthmatics n  13 and their relationship to the airway microbiome and lung function.In addition we tested the impact of a short term commonly used asthma medication flutica- sone propionate FP on airway inflammation and microbiome.

Bronchoalveolar lavage BAL cytokines and chemokines from asthmatic sub- jects were standardized using z-score and sample distances were determined using Euclidean distances.

We analyzed bronchoalveolar lavage BAL cytokines and chemokines associated with T-cell responses and found no significant differences between asthmatics and controls using principal coordinate analysis PCoA and permutational MANOVA PERMANOVA .

Additionally the associations between the microbiome composition and cytokine profiles were diminished after inhaled corticoste- roid therapy.Interestingly with regards to baseline pulmonary function AP1 and AP2 resemble cluster 1 and 2 from Moore WC et al.

In this large analysis asthma phenotypes were identified using unsupervised clustering of asthmatics based on clinical parameters .

Thus there is a strong link with the airway microbiome and local airway inflammation specifically with respect to T-cell phe- notypes in healthy individuals.Recently the relationship between the microbiome of the airways and immune response in the airway of asthmatics has been explored   .

We identified two mod- ules of cytokines Module 1 and Module 2 .
