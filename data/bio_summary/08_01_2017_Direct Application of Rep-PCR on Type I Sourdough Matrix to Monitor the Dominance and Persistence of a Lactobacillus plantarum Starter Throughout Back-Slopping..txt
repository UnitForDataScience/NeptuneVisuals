this practice allows the dominance of fewautochthonous strains reducing the risk of fermentation failure ehrmann and vogel 2005 hammes and others 2005. to a lesser extent some authors considered the use of starter cultures for sour- dough type i propagation corsetti and others 2007 siragusa and others 2009 vogelmann and others 2009 minervini and others 2010. selected starter strains were used as inoculum once a week followed by daily back-slopping.

however their main focus was the monitoring of microbiota throughout fermen- tation processes at species level without giving any information about the strains dominating the process meroth and others 2003 randazzo and others 2005 iacumin and others 2009 scheirlink and others 2009 vogelmann and others 2009.dna extraction was a critical point in the optimization of rep- pcr performance.

plantarum p1fmc mrs 37 degc and l. lactis lc71 m17 37 degc were extracted for dna using the method described by cocolin and others 2001. all dna samples were amplified by rep-pcr using a single oligonucleotide primer gtg5 versalovic and others 1994 according to the protocol described by dal bello and others 2010.co-inoculum and back-slopping trialsonce dna extraction conditions were optimized co- inoculum trials were performed.

plantarum p1fmc used as starter culture was inoculated in 400 g of flour added of 400 ml of water and incubated at 28 degc for 8 h. after starter fermenta- tion sourdough was propagated according to daily back-slopping protocol an inoculum rate of 10 ww was used to ferment 4 kg of fresh flour every day for 12 d. sourdoughs were fermented at 28 degc for 6 h and stored at 10 degc overnight before the sub- sequent inoculum.

plantarum was chosen for its robustness and competi- tiveness minervini and others 2010 while l. lactis was chosen to represent lactic acid cocci which can be found although with less frequency than lactobacilli in sourdough matrices corsetti and others 2001. the analysis of the three different flourringer's solution ratios was performed in order to find the best conditions for dna quality.

although this is not the most frequent case in sourdough fermentations this technological approach could be taken into account for other applications in food fermentations where one-strain starter cultures are used or for monitoring microbial biomass production in a bioreactor.introductionthe role and importance of lactobacilli in sourdough are known and well documented ganzle 2014 minervini and others 2014 brandt 2015. they may provide technological nutritional and organoleptic advantages besides producing antifungal compounds which could reduce contamination with mycotoxins and improve shelf life of bakery products.

although this is not the most frequent case in sourdough fermentations this methodological approach could be taken into account for other applications in food fermenta- tions where one-strain starter cultures are used or for monitoring microbial biomass production in bioreactor.conclusionsthe use of selected starter cultures is quite widespread in food fermentation industry and their monitoring in relatively short time in terms of persistence and dominance over the rest of micro- biota represents an undoubted advantage for the industrial routine and the quality of the final product.
