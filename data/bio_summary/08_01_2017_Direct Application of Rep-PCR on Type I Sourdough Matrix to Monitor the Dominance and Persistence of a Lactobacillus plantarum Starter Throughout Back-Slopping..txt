Direct inquiries to author Dolci E-mail paola.dolci unito.it.genomic profiling RAPD-PCR REA-PFGE ARDRA have been carried out by different authors Catzeddu and others 2006 Valmorri and others 2006 Corsetti and others 2007 Siragusa and others 2009 Minervini and others 2010.

However their main focus was the monitoring of microbiota throughout fermen- tation processes at species level without giving any information about the strains dominating the process Meroth and others 2003 Randazzo and others 2005 Iacumin and others 2009 Scheirlink and others 2009 Vogelmann and others 2009.DNA extraction was a critical point in the optimization of rep- PCR performance.

To a lesser extent some authors considered the use of starter cultures for sour- dough type I propagation Corsetti and others 2007 Siragusa and others 2009 Vogelmann and others 2009 Minervini and others 2010.

plantarum P1FMC used as starter culture was inoculated in 400 g of flour added of 400 mL of water and incubated at 28 degC for 8 h. After starter fermenta- tion sourdough was propagated according to daily back-slopping protocol an inoculum rate of 10 ww was used to ferment 4 kg of fresh flour every day for 12 d. Sourdoughs were fermented at 28 degC for 6 h and stored at 10 degC overnight before the sub- sequent inoculum.

Although this is not the most frequent case in sourdough fermentations this technological approach could be taken into account for other applications in food fermentations where one-strain starter cultures are used or for monitoring microbial biomass production in a bioreactor.IntroductionThe role and importance of lactobacilli in sourdough are known and well documented Ganzle 2014 Minervini and others 2014 Brandt 2015.

plantarum was chosen for its robustness and competi- tiveness Minervini and others 2010 while L. lactis was chosen to represent lactic acid cocci which can be found although with less frequency than lactobacilli in sourdough matrices Corsetti and others 2001.

plantarum P1FMC was present in flour with high loads as expected in sourdough back-slopping this method may allow for monitoring in the presence of other microbial pop- ulations which was the main purpose of our study.

Thus the approach proposed in this paper could be considered a methodological advancement based on a culture-independent one-step rep-PCR suitable for fast monitoring of starter performance.Keywords culture-independent method Lactobacillus plantarum repetitive element-PCR sourdough back-slopping starter dominancePractical Application In response to practical needs of a bakery factory a fast method was optimized to monitor the dominance of a starter culture in sourdough back-slopping in order to intervene quickly in the process in case of poor performance of the starter.

All DNA samples were amplified by rep-PCR using a single oligonucleotide primer GTG5 Versalovic and others 1994 according to the protocol described by Dal Bello and others 2010.Co-inoculum and back-slopping trialsOnce DNA extraction conditions were optimized co- inoculum trials were performed.
