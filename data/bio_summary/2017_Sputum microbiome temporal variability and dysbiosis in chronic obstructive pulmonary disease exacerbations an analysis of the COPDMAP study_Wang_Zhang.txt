However characterizing temporal variability of the microbiome fromlarge longitudinal COPD cohorts is needed to better understand this phenomenon.37MethodsWe performed a 16S ribosomal RNA survey of microbiome on 716 sputum samples collectedlongitudinally at baseline and exacerbations from 281 COPD subjects at three UK clinicalcenters as part of the COPDMAP consortium.42ResultsThe microbiome composition was similar among centers and between stable and exacerbationsexcept for a small significant decrease of Veillonella at exacerbations.

The variation of beta diversity significantly decreased in those subjects withfrequent exacerbations.55ConclusionsMicrobial dysbiosis is a feature of some exacerbations and its presence especially in concertwith eosinophilic inflammation is associated with more severe exacerbations indicated by agreater fall in lung function.60Key messagesWhat is the key questionHow does the lung microbial community vary over time within COPD subjects and how ismicrobial dysbiosis in exacerbations implicated in disease characteristics65What is the bottom lineDysbiosis of the sputum microbiome in COPD exacerbations particularly in concert witheosinophilic inflammation is associated with a greater decline in lung capacity during theexacerbation event.70Why read onThe presented study entails the largest COPD sputum microbiome cohort to date with multiplestudy centers aiming at in-depth examination of microbial temporal variability dysbiosis anddisease phenotypes.IntroductionChronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD is characterized by persistent symptoms andimpaired lung function as a consequence of small airway obliteration and alveolar destructionand is associated with chronic lung inflammation 1-3.

In light of theheterogeneous nature of COPD exacerbations the lung microbiome has potential as a biomarkerto assist in the precision medicine treatments for specific COPD patient subpopulations.97Although insightful results from these previous studies have limitations in terms ofunderstanding microbial dysbiosis during exacerbations as most of these studies comparing themicrobiome at stable and exacerbations involved only one single sampling point of each state.The lung microbiome is temporally dynamic and can vary even in stable state 10.Thus themicrobial changes during exacerbations are a mixture of both the disease associated disruption ofmicrobial community or dysbiosis and the regular temporal perturbations of the lung microbialcomposition.

Linking microbial temporal variation to disease characteristics andhost inflammatory profiles could potentially lead to monitoring and manipulating the stability ofairway microbial composition as a therapeutic strategy for COPD.A finer-grained longitudinal sampling of microbiome at multiple stable and exacerbation visits isnecessary to quantitatively measure temporal variability of the microbiome and assess thesignificance of microbial dysbiosis during exacerbations.

This entails one of thelargest COPD sputum microbiome cohorts to date aiming at in-depth examination of temporalvariability of the microbiome.

CRP was also significantly associated with alpha and beta diversity of the predictedfunctional profiles of the sputum microbiome using the software PICRUSt 28 Table S5.Increased disease severity in exacerbations with dysbiosisLongitudinal sampling of a large cohort over a two year period enables temporal variability anddysbiosis of the sputum microbiome to be quantitatively measured.

Our studyreveals a diverse sputum microbiome among the COPDMAP subjects and further validates theassociation of microbiome with specific exacerbation phenotypes.

Bacteria potentially play a key role in COPDpathogenesis  with respiratory bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae Moraxellacatarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae capable of driving host inflammatory responses 6-9.Since bacteria frequently interact with each other and respond to altered environmentalconditions the consortium of the lung microbial community known as the lung microbiomecould be important in the crosstalk between respiratory tract pathogens and host response .85Emerging studies collectively suggest that the lung microbiome differs between stable andexacerbations in COPD 11-15 for review see 16.
