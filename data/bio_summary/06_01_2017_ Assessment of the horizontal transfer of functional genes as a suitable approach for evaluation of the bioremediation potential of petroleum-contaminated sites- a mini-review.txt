This review tries to give evidence of successful experiences in studying the horizontal transfer of functional genes in the hydrocarbon- contaminated sites and whether horizontal gene transfer HGT can be used for assessment of the bioremediation po- tential of petroleum-contaminated site and as a monitoring approach for having a successful bioremediation process.Horizontal transfer of functional genes between Gram-bacteriain the petroleum-contaminated sitesIn the bioremediation of petroleum-polluted sites bioavail- ability is one of the most important factors.

They tested successfully the horizontal transfer of functional gene as an effective monitoring approach for evaluation of theTable 1Some aerobic aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading genes which are found on plasmids in bacteria and their substrate specificitiesbioremediation process in their project in petroleum- contaminated soil.

Furthermore since the occurrence of HGT in a contami- nated site represents the acquisition of biodegradation skills by microbial consortia evaluation of HGT in contaminated site can be used as bioremediation monitoring approach for assessment of a successful biodegradation process.qPCR as a highly sensitive tool for analyzing the quantity of given functional genes found in different bacterial genera is considered for assessment of the quantity of horizontally transferred genes in the contaminated sites.

Bacterial strains carrying pah genotype are more numerous in the contaminated soils than those carrying nah genes Laurie and Lloyd-Jones .HGT plays an important role in the successful adaptation of bacteria to the contaminated environment Boronin and Kosheleva .

Since the abiotic factors such as macronutrient availability affect the happening of horizontal gene transfer in contaminated sites the biodeg- radation capacity differs from one contaminated site to anoth- er.

evaluated the horizontal transfer of alkB nah and phnAc gene through a biostimulation practice of petroleum-contaminated soil and showed the transfer of alkB and phnAc genes under high nutrient concentrations.

Alk gene as a functional gene in alkane-degrading bacteria is present in the genomes of different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
