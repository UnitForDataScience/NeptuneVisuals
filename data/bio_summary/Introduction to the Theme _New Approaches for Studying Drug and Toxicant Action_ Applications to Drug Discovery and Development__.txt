7.Another recent related approach is to generate tissue-specific human cells using induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs now most commonly by the use of human fibroblasts and to use differentiated cells derived from iPSCs to assess cell physiology pathophysiology drug re- sponses and toxicity.

Of importance in the use of these cells and interpretation of data derived from such studies is the extent to which the iPSC-derived cells undergo differen- tiation that yields properties representative of adult cardiomyocytes so they can be appropriate models for assessing drug responses in cells that reflect their ultimate clinical use.

It is thus not surprising that the microbiome and in particular the gut micro- biome influences drug handling and response--an idea reviewed by Va'zquez-Baeza et al.

Almost 50 years after being introduced and validated as a technique radioligand binding remains useful for characterizing drug and hormone receptors and defining aspects of receptor biology including the identification of allosteric modulators an active area of research and discovery in academia and the drug industry 4 5.Radioligand binding is a reductionist approach that complements assessments of drug and toxicant responses in physiologic systems such as organ baths.

Progress in the creation validation and utilization of such systems is reviewed in the articles by Prantil-Baun et al.

We are hopeful that such efforts may aid in addressing the epidemic of opioid abuse that has become a crisis in the United States and for which Skolnick 11 proposes potential solutions.One potential source of not just genomics is the epigenome a topic reviewed by Lauschke et al.

A specific example of the role of epigenetics is in cancer discussed in two reviews--one by Bennett  Licht 13 who focus on the targeting of epigenetics in cancer and the other by Angus et al.
