These wide diversity levels within the analyzed bacterial communities could be explained by the high variability andTable 4Association between PM exposure Day -3 and bacterial families.Results from linear regression models after natural log-transformation of outcome variables and adjustment for age sex smoking habit never former current and car use in the 24 h before nasal swab only significant associations are reported N40.a D  exp b -1  100 percent increase in relative abundance of family level taxa for 1 mgm3 increase in PM concentration.Table 5Association between PM exposure Day -3 and genus level taxa.Results from linear regression models after natural log-transformation of outcome variables and adjustment for age gender smoking habit never former current and car use in the 24 h before nasal swab only significant associations are reported.a D  exp b -1 100 percent increase in relative abundance of family level for 1 mgm3 increase in PM concentration.dynamism of the nasal microbiota that might also be related to a broad range of environmental exposures which could contribute to a pro- gressive alteration of the normal bacterial interactions  .

To cover the entire week preceding nasal swab we collected information on PM exposure levels from two other sources available from the regional environmental protection agency ARPA Lombardiaa Chemical Transport Model CTM that estimates daily PM con- centrations at municipality resolution data available for PM10 onlyPM daily levels measured from the fixed monitoring stations MSUsing ArcGISr software by Esri we assigned to each subject the daily PM concentration of the MS closest to home address or of the municipality of residence for CTM in the 7 days preceding nasal sampling i.e.

First in the work by Yu and col- leagues microbiota analyses were focused on human lung microbiota which is most likely to differ substantially from the nasal microbiota as the authors acknowledge.

On the other hand we decided to use CTM data for PM10 exposure levels for Day -1 to Day -7 given the slightly higher correlation with PCIS and the better spatial resolution coverage.Sampling DNA amplification and 16s rRNA gene metabarcodingSample collections were self-performed through nasal swab by each subject and DNA was then extracted with QIAampr UCP Pathogen Mini QIAGen kit following developer's guidelines.
