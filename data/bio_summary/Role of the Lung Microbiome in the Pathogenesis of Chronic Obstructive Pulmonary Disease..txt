data also suggest that smoking could alter the upper airway microbiome resulting in enrichment for veillonella.2832lung microbiome in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasedisordered bacterial microbiome is believed to participate in the pathogenesis of copd it is reported that in about 29 of stable copd and 54 of acute exacerbation of copd aecopd patients ppms could be detected and the overgrowth of ppms and the appearance of pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower airway were associated with aecopd.12 lung is not a study site of body in the originalhuman microbiome project and lung microbiome research in the context of copd is still at its early stage where many reports are inclusive or inconsistent.proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria firmicutes streptococcus prevotella moraxella haemophilus acinetobacter fusobacterium and neisseria were the most common bacteria which may account for 60 of the total bacteria in airway.31 rutebemberwa et al.33 compared abundances of bacterial taxa in normal copd and cystic fibrosis cf patients and found different bacterial community composition among the groups and also found that novosphingobium spp was of the highest abundance in advanced copd patients which could trigger inflammation.

compared with the nonsmoker and smoker controls the lung bacterial communities of copd gold 4 group were changed indicating that a unique bacterial community existed in advanced copd while the bacterial diversity in lung tissue from the copd gold 4 group was the same as the nonsmoker and smoker control groups.in 2014 gronseth et al.41 established a longitudinal study to analyze the microbiota and the host immune system status from protected specimen brushes small-volume lavage bal and bronchial biopsies in individuals with or without copd 300 vs. 200. the cohort will be followed for at least 3 years.

this review aimed to summarize the recent advances in lung microbiome its relationships with copd and the possible mechanisms that microbiome contributed to copd pathogenesis.data sources literature search was conducted using pubmed to collect all available studies concerning lung microbiome in copd.

conclusions normal lung microbiome could be useful for prophylactic or therapeutic management in copd and the changes of lung microbiome could also serve as biomarkers for the evaluation of copd.key words chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lung microbiome pathogenesisintroductionchronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide the risk factors of copd include smoking indoor use of biomass fuels occupational exposures asthma and early-life infection.copd is a multidimensional disease having complex pathogenesis architecture.

immune response is also related with copd progression.45 in addition protease-antiprotease imbalance in the lungs of copd patients can break down connective tissue componentpathogenesis of copd involving many inflammatory cells and mediators.

the results of this large study will be helpful to address the lung microbiome in copd and its possible mechanism.involvement of lung microbiome in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasemost studies to date only demonstrate differences in lung microbial communities between health and copd the research of the role of lung microbiome in copd is rather preliminary.

disordered bacterial microbiome is participated in pathogenesis of copd there are also dynamic changes in microbiota during copd exacerbations.

erb-downward et al.18 showed that among the healthy smokers smokers with mild copd and nonsmokers there were no differences in total bacterial load while the moderate and severe copd patients lacked bacterial community diversity.

in another study the researchers observed a severity-related change of the bronchial microbiome in copd37 they showed that there was no difference between moderate-to-severe and advanced copd in microbial community but patients with moderate-to-severe disease showed greater microbial diversity than patients with advanced disease.wang et al.38 reported dynamic changes in microbiota during copd exacerbations 87 patients were recruited and followed up whose sputum samples were obtained at steady state during exacerbation 2 and 6 weeks after recovery.

lung microbiome dynamics may be a potential biomarker or an intervention target for copd.shotgun metagenomic sequencing enables analysis of the taxonomic composition and functional capacity of the whole microbiome.39 cameron et al.40 reported metagenomic sequencing of sputum samples from eight copd patients and ten healthy smokers finding differences in taxonomic composition between the two groups and microbiome in copd patients indicated an increased capacity for bacterial growth such as bacterial cell division nucleosides and nucleotides and amino acid protein and rna metabolism.

the changed lung microbiome would result to maladaptive inflammatory responses further impairment of lung defenses and further dysbiosis of the lung microbiome establishing a vicious circle and leading to copd progression.conclusionsit is recognized that bronchial tree is not sterile in healthy and copd individuals the lung microbiome plays a significant role in normal lung function and diseases.

the relationships of dysbiosis of lung microbiome and copd have investigated by many studies but whether manipulating the bacterial community could treat or prevent copd has notbeen well explored.

with the advance of sequencing technologies lung microbiome has become a new frontier for pulmonary disease research and such advance has led to better understanding of the lung microbiome in copd.
