In addition the sterilization may not be complete specifically if very stress tolerant microorganisms prevail in the soil Dry heat is a standard sterilization method with very good effects regarding sterilization.

However sterilization may also change metal mobilites soil structure and function as well as physical and chemical properties To be able to provide the method representing the conditions with least changes different soil types have to be taken into account.

In order to combine the advantages of plant-microbe interactions within the rhizosphere for effective in situ remedi- ation strategies the specific interactions with plants as well as with the soil environment need further study As only little is known about effects of soil microorganisms and their interac- tions with plants on metal availability in the rhizosphere laboratory experiments using sterile soil systems are recommened.

An improved understanding of the interactions taking place under controlled conditions in laboratory soil experiments will help to translate the results of experiments into field applications Suitable methods for sterilizing metal contaminated substrates and soil suspensions are the application of dry heat wet heat in combination with pressure see or gamma irradiation see Chemical sterilization using organic volatiles or solutions is not recommended since they may provide an additional energy and carbon source to some microbial taxa and thus change the outcome of microbial inoculation experiments.

For UV sterilization the material was spread on 25 cm2 surface and placed under UV light overnight in a sterile hood.The sterility of the substrates was tested for all treatments by plating of soil suspensions 5 g of substrate in 50 ml 0.9 NaCl Orbital Incubator 100 rpm 1 h. The suspensions were allowed to settle down for 30 min before plating in triplicates on standardmedium Std I Carl Roth and evaluated after 7 days at 28 C. Thetemperature was chosen to allow for growth of bacteria that do not experience higher temperatures in 5-10 cm soil depth where the samples had been taken.

Laboratory experiments using single strains in culture may lead to misinterpretation of effects observed in nature since the exper- imental conditions are not correctly simulating natural systems However soil sterilization is known to alter the physical and chemical properties of soil thereby changing the native conditions.Identification of four suitable metal contaminated substratesFig.

However especially clay minerals are prone to undergo changes due to elevated temperature for pro- longed periods of time Hence this method has rarely been used for soil sterilization.

This explanation is not usually considered when the treatment for sterilization is considered Substrate specific changes in metal mobilityThe substrate S2 had the highest Mn contents and very sig- nificant changes in Mn associations were observed after 180 C treatment.

Since however irradiation altered the bioavailability of metals this method should not be considered without prior testing of changes induced.The other sandy substrate S3 did show consistent changes with respect to Mn which was redistributed by any sterilization tech- nique from fraction F3 the manganese hydroxides very prominent in this substrate to the soluble fraction F1 and the residual frac-tion F7.
