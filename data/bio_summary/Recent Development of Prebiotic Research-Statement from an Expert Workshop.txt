these findings illustrate the sensitivity and value of data obtainable from in vitro gut models and emphasize the importance of considering that prebiotics may stimulate different bacterial groups and metabolic pathways according to the subject microbiota profile.figure 1. schematic representation of the culture systems developed to analyze the microbiota ecosystems.microbiome-modulating compounds that may impact host healththere are several compounds that appear to affect the composition of the gut microbiota via mechanisms that are apparently unrelated to a selective utilization by or nourishment of host microorganisms.

combining multiple in vitro approaches with in vivo studies is key to understanding the mechanisms of action of prebiotics consumption and their potential beneficial effects on the host.keywords gut microbiota healthy gut prebiotics and health benefitsintroductionthe human intestinal microbiota is composed of 1013-1014 microorganisms mainly bacteria whose collective genome is defined as the 'gut microbiome' .

a proof of principle is the recent developments of transplantation of entire fecal microbiota in the treatment of clostridium difficile .in addition nutritional interventions that can contribute to the establishment or maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota including the consumption of 'prebiotics' are gathering more attention.

a recent approach to solve these limitations has been developed as part of the polyferms system including a process of immobilization of fecal microbiota in gel beads mimicking cell density and competition of in vivo gut microbiota - figure .

therefore they represent a modular and highly adaptable model system for evaluating the molecular basis of the host-microbe interface .scientists will continue to evolve the concept of prebiotics based on the increasing understanding of the effects of various nutritional compounds on microbiota composition and metabolite production.this includes the most recent findings of non-carbohydrate compounds such as polyphenols minerals nutritional lipids and vitamins which so far have not been considered for their potential effects on gut microbiota.

indeed the technological developments observed in recent years provide scientists with powerful tools to investigate the complex ecosystem of gut microbiota.

the latter occurs also in the context of prevalent disorders such as obesity diabetes and metabolic inflammation  although it is not clear at the present time if this is association or causation.the concept that gut microbiota could be modulated to improve human health was proposed as early as the beginning of the twentieth century when elie metchnikoff reported that bulgarian peasantsnutrients 2017 9 1376 doilived longer lives because of their yogurt consumption .

indeed an increasing number of recent studies shows an association between human gut microbiota perturbations and pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease ibd  irritable bowel syndrome ibs  obesity  and inflammation .

if these associations prove to be causative relationships then this suggests that a targeted modulation of the gut microbiota may offer preventative and maybe even novel therapeutic approaches.

the pioneering concept as introduced by gibson and roberfroid in the 1990s emphasizes the importance of diet in the modulation of the gut microbiota and its relationships to human health.

although the main features have mostly been retained some of the criteria that need to be fulfilled for a food ingredient to qualify as prebiotic are still a matter of debate.considering our increasing knowledge of the intestinal microbiota and its importance to human health academic experts in the field of prebiotic research met with scientists from industry to discuss the progress of prebiotic research beyond the traditional concept and how these developments may stimulate the field.

according to the definition proposed in 2008 during the 6th meeting of the international scientific association of probiotics and prebiotics isapp in ontario canada a dietary prebiotic is 'a selectively fermented ingredient that results in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota thus conferring benefits upon host health'  and table .

it also first discusses substrates that although not defined as 'prebiotic' can affect composition of the microbiota through mechanisms not involving selective utilization by host microorganisms.

while the central concept of selective stimulation of part of the microbiota remains and is as valid today as it was in the 1990s the understanding of what this means in terms of microbial population and activity has developed .

in fact over recent years there has been a shift in focus away from a simplistic differentiation between beneficial and harmful bacteria towards research aiming to understand ecological and functional features of the microbiota relevant for host physiology -.in addition recent advances in understanding the wide functions that short chain fatty acids scfa play in human physiology  has resulted in a focus on manipulation of metabolite profiles in the gut rather than simply changing bacterial populations.
