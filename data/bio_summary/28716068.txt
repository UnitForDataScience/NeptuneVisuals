automated image analysis of cell density in non-small cell lung cancer nsclc tumor samples subsequently treated with durvalumab n  163 77 patients previously treated showed that high baseline combined cd8pd-l1 cell densities n  26 were as- sociated with higher overall response rate orr  42 95 confidence interval ci 23 63 than low combineddensities orr  7 95 ci 2 17. a high proportion of combined cd8pd-l1 cell densities was also associated with longer overall survival os median os  24.3 months 95 ci 14.5 not reached nr and progression-free survival pfs median pfs  7.3 months 95 ci 4.0 7.9 compared to high density of cd8 cells median os  17.8 months 95 ci 14.0 nr medianpfs  5.3 months 95 ci 3.1 7.4 or high pd-l1 statustc 25 median os  17.1 months 95 ci 9.8 25.3median pfs  3.6 months 95 ci 2.6 5.3 alone.in the third late-breaking abstract session joaquim bellmunt md phd dana-farberbrigham and women's cancer center discussed highly anticipated data from the phase iii keynote-045 trial of pembrolizumab versus investigators' choice of standard chemotherapy paclitaxel docetaxel or vinflunine for advanced urothelial carcin- oma nct02256436.

these results illustrate that the pd- l1pd-1 interaction accelerates t cell exhaustion and restricts t cell priming or expansion blocking this inter- action using agents such as atezolizumab may facilitate t cell primingexpansion and block or reverse exhaustion.dr.

these findings suggest that the effects of pd- 1pd-l1 inhibitors extend beyond overcoming t cell exhaustion in the tumor bed and highlight the importance of identifying additional biomarkers that can identify responders or non-responders.exploring the downstream signaling effects of the pd-1pd-l1 interaction a liposome-based fluorescence energy resonance transfer fret quenching assay along with dephosphorylation experiments determined that shp2 binds with high selectivity to pd-1 to preferentially down regulate signaling via the cd28 costimulatory path- way as opposed to signaling via the t cell receptor tcr.

leading this session jeffrey miller md university of minnesota highlighted a phase ii study of pembrolizu- mab in unresectable recurrent advanced merkel cell carcinoma nct02267603 which illustrated the highest response rates for an agent targeting programmed cell death protein 1 pd-1 in any solid tumor to date.

such biomarkers will necessarily be complex and multifactorial and patient-specific aspects such as t cell repertoire t cell functional state and the pres- ence of immune-suppressive myeloid cells will need to be taken into account.

compelling data on how neural pathways associate with intrinsic tumor cell behavior and specifically how stress signaling could promote tumor cell progression were shown.

indeed the first monoclonal antibody rituximab 1997 car t cell cd19-car 2010 and bispecific antibody blinatumo- mab 2011 therapies to demonstrate unequivocal antitu- mor activity were all in the setting of b cell malignancies.

among the factors that have allowed b cell malignancies to be on the cutting edge of immunotherapeutic advances include our relatively exquisite knowledge of the cell surface landscape of b cells as opposed to that of solid tumors.

dr. mackall used this back- ground to lead into a balanced presentation about which immunotherapy agent to use for the treatment of b cell malignancies blinatumomab versus cd19-car t cells.importantly no data from randomized controlled trials currently exist to indicate whether blinatumomab or car t cell therapy is the superior choice.

the durability of car t cell responses is specific to which car t cell is used as car.28.z have been shown to persist 1-2 months whereas car.bb.z persist 6-12 months.

the creative commons public domain dedication waiver applies to the data made available in this article unless otherwise stated.highlighting cytotoxic t lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ctla-4 and anti-pd-1programmed death-ligand 1 pd-l1 as negative regulators of the t cell response that are necessary to maintain immune homeostasis .

spe- cifically the pd-1pd-l1 interaction inhibits t cell activa- tion and attenuates effector function.

as such tumors and surrounding cells upregulate pd-l1 in response to t cell activity.

blocking the pd-1pd-l1 pathway prevents or reverses t cell exhaustion and has broad antitumor activ- ity in human cancers.
