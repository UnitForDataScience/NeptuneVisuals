In addition Dr. Miller highlighted a phase II trial of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory stage IB-IVB mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome NCT02243579 and three phase I studies pembroli- zumab in HIV-positive patients with relapsedrefrac- tory malignancies NCT02595866 neoadjuvant CD40 agonist alone or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with recently diagnosed resectable pancre- atic carcinoma NCT02588443 and a dose escalation study of subcutaneous recombinant IL-15 in advanced solid tumors NCT01727076.Continuing this session Lawrence Fong MD University of California San Francisco reported results from an ongoing multi-institution trial NCT01881867 testing sipuleucel-T in combination with subcutaneous IL-7.

This international study of 542 patients from 29 countries reported significantly longer OS in patients receiving pembrolizumab HR 0.73 median 10.3 vs. 7.4 months p  0.0022 irrespective of PD-L1 expres- sion.

Side effects in the combination treatment groups were in line with other studies with 30.8 of nivo 1ipi 3 patients and 31.7 of nivo 3ipi 1 patients experiencing a grade 3-4 treatment-related AE.

Targeting this pathway therapeutically has led to durable remissions in a subset of patients across a variety of malig- nancies hence the current challenge to enhance the im- pact of immunotherapy in larger numbers of patients.

Urelumab demonstrated particular benefit in patients with melanoma among checkpoint blockade-naive melanoma patients ORR was 50 and disease control rate was 70 irrespective of PD- L1 status.

Pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell PBMC samples were analyzed from 37 patients who re- ceived TRX-518 at increasing doses along with pre- and post-therapy tumor biopsies from eight patients.

Data from the randomized phase III OAK study in lung cancer also illustrated that PD-L1 can enrich for responders but PD- L1-negative patients still show benefit from atezolizumab therapy .

In a phase Ib trial combination cobimetinibatezolizumab led to objective or partial response in 20-25 of patients with colon cancer.

Automated image analysis of cell density in non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC tumor samples subsequently treated with durvalumab n  163 77 patients previously treated showed that high baseline combined CD8PD-L1 cell densities n  26 were as- sociated with higher overall response rate ORR  42 95 confidence interval CI 23 63 than low combineddensities ORR  7 95 CI 2 17.

This trial was halted prematurely due to the markedly superior survival benefit in patients treated with pembrolizumab.Preliminary data from an early phase study of a first- in-class antibody lirilumab which blocks inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors KIR on NK cells NCT01714739 were presented by Rom Leidner MD Earle A. Chiles Research Institute Providence Cancer Center.
