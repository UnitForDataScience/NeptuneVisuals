For instance more abundant of E. coli were found in active UC patients than in inactive UC patients or healthy people 87 88 93.Escherichia coli from ileal CD patients particularly adherent- invasive Escherichia coli AIEC strains have been reported to be enriched in UC patients 94 .

albicans is most often isolated in 91.7 patients in UC and can delay healing of UC 119 120.PaRT ii POTeNTial TaRgeTS FOR UC THeRaPYIn the above contents the roles and changes of several kinds of microbiota in UC have been fully discussed in above contents.

Moreover commensal bacteria includ- ing Fusobacterium varium that was one of mucosal organisms isolated from UC patients were found as a possible pathogen in UC 112 .Apart from those above microbiota there are some other spe- cies relate to the pathogenesis and progression of UC including Roseburia hominis Eubacterium rectale Listeria monocytogenes and Candida albicans     117-120.

Measurement of vitamin D levels in inflammatory bowel disease patients reveals a subset of Crohn's disease patients with elevated 125- dihydroxyvitamin D and low bone mineral density.

Unlike the well-researched CD our knowledge on UC is relatively deficit and there remain many contradictions to be elucidated.In this review the relationship between UC and several popular microbiota communities highly related as well as the potential therapeutic targets for UC involved in the regulation of microbiota will be discussed.PaRT i MiCRObiOTaThe colon has two mucus layers which is different from the small intestine with a single layer of mucus.

The temperature and nutrients in these environments can support the viability of saprophytic E. coli  .It has been reported that the number of E. coli is elevated in UC whether in mouse models or UC patients 21 -.

Considering the increased number of E. coli has connection with the activity status of UC patients the difference in the severity of UC may account for the reason.

Moreover it has been report that intestinal microbiota has a key role in inflammatory bowel disease IBD including UC and Crohn's disease CD .

Report on the vitamin D status of adult and pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease and its signifi- cance for bone health and disease.

In addition potential therapeutic targets for UC involved in the regulation of micro- biota including NLRPs vitamin D receptor as well as secreted proteins are discussed in this review.Keywords intestinal microbiota host immune response ulcerative colitis epithelial cells therapeutic targetsiNTRODUCTiONUlcerative colitis UC is a sort of chronic recurrent disorder with the characteristics of intestinal mucosa inflammation and ulceration -.
