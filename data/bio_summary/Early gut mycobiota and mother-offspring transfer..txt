In contrast to the adult gut mycobiota the establishment of the early gut mycobiota has never been described and there is little knowledge about the fungal transfer from mother to offspring.Methods In a prospective cohort we followed 298 pairs of healthy mothers and offspring from 36 weeks of gestation until 2 years of age 1516 samples and explored the gut mycobiota in maternal and offspring samples.

We report major shifts in the fungal abundance and diversity within these populations and it supports the idea of a succession of mycobiotic hosting from mother to child and over the first 2 years of life.MethodsMaterialWe selected 298 mother-offspring pairs with at least one pair of faecal samples from mothers and offspring who participated in the Probiotics in the Prevention of Al- lergy among Children in Trondheim study ProPACT Table The ProPACT study is a population-based randomised placebo-controlled and double-blinded trial on probiotics from Trondheim Norway and it has been described in detail elsewhere Briefly the preg- nant women who attended the regular Norwegian Ante- natal Care Programme were asked to participate by completing questionnaires on their health and risk fac- tors and by collecting faecal samples from themselves and their offspring.

Although we do not have details on the anti- biotic administration in the offspring before 10 days of life no offspring that were delivered by caesarean sec- tion received antibiotics during labour but one devel- oped septicaemia afterwards and was treated accordingly.

In the offspring the alpha diversity seemed to increase steadily from birth whereas the beta diversity was highest in 10-day-old offspring.The PCoA plot at 6000 reads distinguished the 10- day-3-month-old offspring breast-fed andor formula- fed from the other samples.

The intraclass coefficient ICC was 0.01 which indicates that the repeated measurements were largely unrelated.We found no significant associations between the offspring fungal DNA concentrations and the maternalfungal DNA concentrations probiotics mode of delivery or the offspring antibiotic use Additional file Table S4.

Bar charts of the relatively most abundant OTUs in a mothers b offspring from 10 days to 3 months and c offspring for 1-2 years.

Thus we find indications for the transfer of fungal hosting be- tween mothers and offspring that appear to be inde- pendent of the mode of delivery.The overlapping OTUs in the mother and offspring guts were mostly Saccharomycetaceae spp.

We quantified the fungal abundance of all the samples using qPCR of the fungal internal transcribed spacer ITS1 segment and we sequenced the 18S rRNA gene ITS1 region of 90 high-quantity samples using the MiSeq platform Illumina.Results The gut mycobiota was detected in most of the mothers and the majority of the offspring.

The offspring showed increased odds of having detectable faecal fungal DNA if the mother had detectable fungal DNA as well OR  1.54 p  0.04.

The fungal alpha diversity in the offspring gut increased from its lowest at 10 days after birth which was the earliest sampling point.
