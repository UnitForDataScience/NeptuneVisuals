a Mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated for different periods of time at 37 degC in a reaction medium containing the substrates 500 mM AMP white squares ATP dark circles and also ATP plus 50 mM POM-1 white triangles trace lines or ATP plus 100 mM POM-1 dark triangles dotted lines and the concentration of Pi in the supernatant was analyzed by the malachite green assay.

Currents evoked by 100 mM ATP in murine macrophages under voltage clamp at - 40 mV using whole-cell mode in the absence a or presence of 100 mM POM-1 b. Single-channel currents activated by 4 mM ATPunder voltage clamp at - 40 mV using cell-attached mode in the absencec or presence of 100 mM POM-1 d. Representative data of a single experiment are shown.

Calibration curves were assessed by the integration of peaks of each standard prepared as 2 mM stock solutions in PBS in the range of 1 mM and 1 mM r2  0.9982.Intracellular calcium measurementsMacrophages 2 x 105 plated on glass coverslips were loaded with 5 mM Fura-2 AM at 37 degC in supplemented medium containing 2.5 mM probenecid during 40 min.

Murine macrophages were exposed to zero or 5 mM ATP with or without addition of 100 mM POM-1 for 20 min washed and maintained in culture for 6 h. After that macrophages were incubated with apoptosis buffer containing EB and the nuclei were analyzed by flow cytometry.

p  0.01p  0.001consider the possibility that the LPS stimulation triggers ATP release by the macrophages as previously shown  .Peritoneal macrophages from Entpd1-- mice are more susceptible to ATP-induced necrotic cell death and release more IL-1b when stimulated with LPS plus ATP compared with macrophages from wild-type mice .

The fluorescent dyes CF 5 mM or SR-B 200 mM and ATP 5 mM were then added and the cells were kept under the same conditions for an additional period of 10 min.

c. POM-1 totally inhibited the Ca2 response induced by 1 mM ATP and par- tially inhibited the response induced by 10 and 100 mM ATP Fig.

Cells were pre-incubated or not with 100 mM POM-1 for30 min and treated with 100 ngmL LPS for 6 h and with 3 mM ATP for 2 h. Macrophages were also treated only with POM-1 for 8 h ATP for 2 h or LPS for 6 h. LDH activity was measured in the supernatants.

Controls to determine non-enzymatic Pi release were performed by incu- bating the cells in the absence of substrate or incubating the substrate in the absence of cells which were added after the reaction was stopped.For the HLPC-UV analysis macrophages 2 x 106 cells petri dish cultured as described above were incubated with 3 mM ATP for 30 min with or without 100 mM POM-1 in normal saline solution.

Data were ana- lyzed using GraphPad InsTat software GraphPad Software Inc. v5.0.ResultsEcto-nucleotidase activity in macrophage is inhibited by POM-1To characterize the ecto-nucleotidase activity on the surface of murine macrophages we incubated the cells with 500 mM ATP or 500 mM AMP at 37 degC and analyzed the time course of nucleotide hydrolysis using the malachite green assay.
