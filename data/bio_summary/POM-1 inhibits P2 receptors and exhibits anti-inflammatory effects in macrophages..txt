controls were obtained by using supernatants of un- treated cells 0 and cells treated with 1 saponin for 30 min 100. each reading was subtracted from the reading obtain- ed in medium containing pom-1 without cells in order to avoid any possible interference of this compound with the reagents in the ldh detection kit.light and scanning electron microscopyfor light microscopy images of macrophages 1 x 105 per coverslip were obtained using a differential interference con- trast dic system in an olympus bx 51 microscope with olympus dp-12 digital camera.for scanning electron microscopy sem cells adhered in glass coverslips were fixed in solution that consisted of 2.5 glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer ph 7.2. cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature and 12 h at 4 degc.

p  0.01p  0.001consider the possibility that the lps stimulation triggers atp release by the macrophages as previously shown  .peritoneal macrophages from entpd1-- mice are more susceptible to atp-induced necrotic cell death and release more il-1b when stimulated with lps plus atp compared with macrophages from wild-type mice .

the percentage of apoptosis was calculated according to the number of hypodiploid events considering the result obtained with 5 mm atp as 100 a. cells were pre-incubated or not with 100 mm pom-1 for30 min and treated with 100 ngml lps for 6 h and with 3 mm atp for 2 h. macrophages were also treated only with pom-1 for 8 h atp for 2 h or lps for 6 h. ldh activity was measured in the supernatants.

controls to determine non-enzymatic pi release were performed by incu- bating the cells in the absence of substrate or incubating the substrate in the absence of cells which were added after the reaction was stopped.for the hlpc-uv analysis macrophages 2 x 106 cells petri dish cultured as described above were incubated with 3 mm atp for 30 min with or without 100 mm pom-1 in normal saline solution.

a mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated for different periods of time at 37 degc in a reaction medium containing the substrates 500 mm amp white squares atp dark circles and also atp plus 50 mm pom-1 white triangles trace lines or atp plus 100 mm pom-1 dark triangles dotted lines and the concentration of pi in the supernatant was analyzed by the malachite green assay.

murine macrophages were exposed to zero or 5 mm atp with or without addition of 100 mm pom-1 for 20 min washed and maintained in culture for 6 h. after that macrophages were incubated with apoptosis buffer containing eb and the nuclei were analyzed by flow cytometry.

macrophages were also treated only with pom-1 for 8 h atp for 2 h or lps for 6 h. after this period the cells were cen- trifuged at 5600xg for 1 min and the supernatant was collect- ed to measure the lactate dehydrogenase ldh content.

however when cells were treated with pom-1 the atp hydrolysis was only 30 reducing the production of adp to 4.5 and amp to 24. the absence of amp hydro- lysis in macrophages was also confirmed by hplc analysis.

cells were incubated at 37 degc with sr-b for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm atp with or without pom-1 as indicated and the amount of dye taken up by the cells was measured by spectrofluorimetry as described in the b section.
