s. heidelberg and s. enteritidis both demonstrated suc- cessful internal migration for each time temperature and bacterial combination p  0.05. our data revealed that salmonella migration proceeded for 24 h but slowed at 48 h p  0.05. s. enteritidis with psychrotrophs showed a low amount of internal migration p  0.05. we therefore conclude that sal- monella spp.

despite the different factors that may facilitate or accelerate the bacterial migration into the meat it is known that intact chicken meat has a structure that is not resistant to bacterial penetration the susceptibility of chicken meat is increased when the meat is minced due to structural degradation at the time of cutting .

different kinetics were observed at 7 0c with the lowest meancounts at 6 h but then there was a consistent increase in counts at 12 h and 24 h before decreasing after 48 h. the kinetics of shp at 2 0c showed an increasing trend until 12 h then decreased at 24 and 48 h. this pattern was also found at 7 0c.

the inhibi- tion of migration of serovar s. enteritidis compared with that of s. heidelberg may be owing to more sensibility of s. enteritidis to proteolytic psychrotrophs that were isolated from the natural poultry meat microbiota and are thus well adapted to this sub- strate.

sam- ples of previously frozen chicken breast with skin and bone were then sterilized using gamma ray irradiation and a cobalt-60 source 11 kgy and them were inoculated with cultures of s. enteritidis s. enteritidis and psychrotrophs s. heidelberg or s. heidelberg and psychrotrophs.

penetration occurred within 40 h at 20 0c and within 16 h at 37 0c.in our current study we found that bacteria had already migrated to the most internal segment c within 6 h of entering storage even when stored at refrigeration temperatures 2 and 7 0c.

human salmonellosis caused by poultry meat has two primary routes of contamination cross-contamination of un- cooked food via utensils or direct handling and consumption of undercooked or raw meat.

in poultry meat showing that even small amounts of these bacteria are able to penetrate meat.

however the structure of poultry meat offers little resistance to bacterial pene- tration and further structural degradation of the meat either by fragmentation or by freezing only serves to make it more suscep- tible to bacterial proliferation .we also examined possible morphological changes in tissues that were caused by proteolytic psychrotrophs sep and shp.

this agarcover formed an isolating layer and prevent that bacteria migrated on the surface and not to the inside of the meat b and c and d.sample blocks were subjected to treatment with four different inoculates were incubated at different refrigeration temperatures 2 and 7 0c for various durations and were also frozen  30 0c for 168 h according to the table below .
