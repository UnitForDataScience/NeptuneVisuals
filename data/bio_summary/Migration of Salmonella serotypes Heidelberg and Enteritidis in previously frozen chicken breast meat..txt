Despite the different factors that may facilitate or accelerate the bacterial migration into the meat it is known that intact chicken meat has a structure that is not resistant to bacterial penetration the susceptibility of chicken meat is increased when the meat is minced due to structural degradation at the time of cutting .

Different kinetics were observed at 7 0C with the lowest meancounts at 6 h but then there was a consistent increase in counts at 12 h and 24 h before decreasing after 48 h. The kinetics of SHP at 2 0C showed an increasing trend until 12 h then decreased at 24 and 48 h. This pattern was also found at 7 0C.

The inhibi- tion of migration of serovar S. Enteritidis compared with that of S. Heidelberg may be owing to more sensibility of S. Enteritidis to proteolytic psychrotrophs that were isolated from the natural poultry meat microbiota and are thus well adapted to this sub- strate.

Sam- ples of previously frozen chicken breast with skin and bone were then sterilized using gamma ray irradiation and a cobalt-60 source 11 KGy and them were inoculated with cultures of S. Enteritidis S. Enteritidis and psychrotrophs S. Heidelberg or S. Heidelberg and psychrotrophs.

Penetration occurred within 40 h at 20 0C and within 16 h at 37 0C.In our current study we found that bacteria had already migrated to the most internal segment C within 6 h of entering storage even when stored at refrigeration temperatures 2 and 7 0C.
