naa depletion is indicative of neurolog- ical dysfunction and neuronal loss and diminished concentrations of naa in brain tissues are commonly associated with neurological disorders observed in certain young autism adult trau- matic brain injury huntington's disease and elderly alzheimer's disease parkinson's disease popula- tions.the hippocampus forms part of the limbic system and along with the frontal cortex has been associated with working memory tasks interestingly reports suggest that gf mice dis- play an absence of non-spatial and working memory although this is strain-specific this microbiome-memory associa- tion has been further demonstrated in mice through dietary manipulation where provision of a 50 lean ground beef chow diet increased the diversity of the gut bacteria and increased working and reference memory furthermore neonatal rats infected with escherichia coli and subjected to a peripheral immune challenge using lipopolysaccharide exposure exhibited impaired memory function with alterations to the astroglial architecture of the hippocampus astrocytes and neurons are consid- ered metabolically coupled and interactions between the two cell types are critical for memory formation.

lactateis a key energy substrate and its abundance in the brain significantly increases with brain activity similar observations were seen in the gf brain with creatine an alternative energy source for atp production and utilization.

whilst col- onization of gf nmri mice from early life prior to mating or in swiss webster mice up to three weeks of age has been demonstrated to restore the conventional-like behavioural phe- notype in two independent set of mice colonization of gf nmri mice at 10 weeks of age resulted in the persistence of gf associ- ated behavioural phenotype indicating that the window for microbially modulated behaviour is relatively short.

in addition the brain profiles of gf rats were compared against those of conventional rats while the gf mice were contrasted against spf mice.

functionally taurine is a neural osmolyte and is used by cells to compensate for changes in extracellular osmolality and regulate cell volume taurine also protects neurons from oxidative stress and is critical in brain development promoting neu- ral development in both embryonic and adult brain regions.

choline is also a source of methyl group donation and can impact on brain development through dna methylation with choline-deficient diets having been shown to directly alter gene methylation in the brain neu- rons obtain choline by de novo synthesis and from serum choline derived from the diet.

importantly choline is essential during the perinatal period for brain development and in rodents perinatal choline supplementation has been shown to permanently mod- ify brain structure and improve working spatial memory the bioavailability of dietary-derived choline is influenced by the microbiome with an estimated 60 of dietary choline converted to methylamines by the microbiota.

it has been suggested that the elevated amounts of taurine in gf animals arises from the absence or reduction of microbial taurine catabolism however elevated quantities of glucocorticoids have also been shown to increase the quantity of taurine in the brain since gf mice have an increased activity of their hpa axis including elevated concentrations of circulating glucocorticoids in plasma due to metabolic stress and their reduced capacity to extract energy from the food in the absence of microbes this may explain these eleva- tions in taurine.

in the mice choline concentrations were higher in the frontal cortex of gf animals but glycerophosphocholine was lower compared to spf mice.

of note is that in both rat and mouse brain extracts concentra- tions of hippocampal taurine were found to be greater in the absence of an established microbiome.

the results provide further evidence that brain biochemistry can be influenced by gut microbial status specifically metabolites involved in energy metabolism demonstrating biochemical dialogue between the microbiome and brain.c 2017 published by elsevier b.v.introductionevidence for the importance of the gut-brain axis in host devel- opment and metabolism continues to emerge and the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the communication between these two organs is of increasing interest.
