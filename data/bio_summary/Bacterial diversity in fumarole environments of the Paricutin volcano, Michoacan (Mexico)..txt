The extreme temperatures pres- ence of toxic heavy metals and low nutrient bioavailabilityfavor the development of extremophiles.

The sam- pling stations were characterized in a pH range from 5.34 to 7.89 and showed different temperatures soil 27-87 degC air 13.6-56 degC with high concentrations of metals such as iron and arsenic.

The most abundant bacterial populations confirmed by T-RFLP and 16S rRNA gene libraries were related to members of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla including sequences associated with thermophiles andsulfate reducing bacteria.

The Paricutin volcano fumaroles may rep- resent a hot spot for extremophiles inhabited by life forms adapted to the extreme environmental constraints such as high temperatures inside the fumaroles in contrast with a cool atmospheric temperature low water content unstruc- tured soil high radiation etc.

The bacterial diversity was characterized using culture-independent methods terminal restriction frag- ment length polymorphism T-RFLP and 16S rRNA gene library analyses.

The comparison of structures and com- position of the bacterial communities between the diverse fumarole stations led to the determination of specific bac- terial populations according to the physical-chemical conditions.Materials and methodsSampling site and chemical characterizationThe Paricutin volcano Supplementary Fig.

The characteristics of the stations are given in Table .

The samples were collected in January 2010 dry season.

The sampling stations are indicated as follows S1 19deg29''27 102deg15''21' S2 19deg29''27'102deg15''21' S3 19deg29''50' 102deg15''29' S4 19deg29''54' 102deg15''12' S519deg29''33' 102deg15''08' and S6 19deg29''25' 102deg15''23'The internal surface layer about 0.5 cm of the fuma- role walls was sampled with a sterile plastic spoon.
