genitalium mycoplasma hominis and hrhpv infections  or significant associations between m. genitalium m. hominis and hrhpv infections .

hominis in the vaginal microbiota.at baseline 72 139194 of the women were positive for hiv 30 43142 for m. genitalium 45 87194 for m. hominis and 40 77194 for hrhpv.

hominis positivity and prevalent hrhpv or 5.53 95 ci 1.08-55.2 p 0.03 compared to hiv and prevalent m. hominis negative women.

similarly there was significant association between hiv and persistent m. hominis positivity and persis- tent hrhpv infections or 3.28 95 ci 1.31-8.74 p 0.008 compared to hiv and persistent m. hominis negative women.

several bacteria particularly those capable of establishing persistent infections can alter host cell cycles affect apoptotic pathways and stimulate the production of inflamma- tory substances linked to dna damage thus potentially promote abnormal cell growth .table 6  association between sociodemographic characteristics and potential risk factors for mycoplasma hominis.table shows exact odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis based on logistic regression models n  number of women.table 7  multivariate association between m. genitalium and m. hominis and high-risk human papillomavirus hrhpv infections.table shows odds ratios ors and 95 confidence intervals cis for women with prevalent or persistent m. genitalium and m. hominis compared to women who were negative.

however other indicators of risky sexual behav- ior including earlier age at sexual initiation and number of life- time sexual partners were not associated between m. genitalium and m. hominis and either vaginal m. genitalium or m. hominis in this study.

because we evaluated m. genitalium and m. hominis and hrhpv infections at the same time we are unable to rule out reverse causation.inconclusion ourstudyshowssignificantassociationsbetween persistent m. hominis in the vaginal microbiota and persistent hrhpv infections.
