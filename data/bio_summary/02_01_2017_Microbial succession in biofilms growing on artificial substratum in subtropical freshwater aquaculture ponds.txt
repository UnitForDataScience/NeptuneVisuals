Each artificial substratum had a length and width of 5 mx 1 m. The short side was cut into strips 0.05 m x 0.8 m. Approx-imately 1000 m2 of artificial substratum was hung down into the pond water column from nylon lines at the water surface.

Therefore elucidating the process of microbial succes- sion in biofilms on artificial substratum is essential to char- acterize the metabolic processes occurring in the biofilm and for utilization of biofilms to maintain the health of aquaculture ponds.To elucidate the process of microbial succession that occurs in biofilms growing on artificial substrata in ponds artificial sub- strata were established in a grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus and tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus polyculture pond and the microbes in the biofilm were identified using high-throughput sequencing.MATERIALS AND METHODSExperimental designThe experiment was performed at the Aquaculture Base of Pearl River Fisheries Research Institute i.e.

Each artificial substratum or pond water sample was separated into two technical repli- cates before DNA extraction in the laboratory.DNA extractionEach 5-g sample of artificial substratum was weighed and added to 150 ml of sterile water.

Concentrations of total nitrogen TN total phosphorus TP NH4-N NO2--N and NO3--N in the pond water during the experiment.significantly higher in the biofilm than in the pond water.

In- terestingly although the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria 4.10 - 3.54 in pond water microbiota was low Cyanobacte- ria showed significantly higher abundance in the biofilm 17.4 - 10.2 than in the pond water at the beginning of the experiment t-test t  -3.01 P  0.02 Fig.

This study provided insight into how the use of artificial substrata could improve water quality and elucidated the environment-biofilm relationship in a subtropical freshwater pond.Keywords artificial substratum bacterial community biofilm denitrifiers microbiota succession pond aquacultureINTRODUCTIONIn recent years aquaculture especially in ponds has become a primary method for the production of various aquatic products such as fish and algae Naylor et al.

The pond has an area of approximately 20 000 m2 and a water depth of approximately 2.5 m. The culture density was ap- proximately 2.5 kgm-2.

The artificial substratum and pond water samples were transported to the laboratory at 4C.

The effects of artificial substrates on freshwater pond productivity and water qual- ity and the implications for periphyton-based aquaculture.
