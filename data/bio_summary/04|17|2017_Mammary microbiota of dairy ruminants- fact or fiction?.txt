Rainard Vet Res 2017 4825DOI 10.1186s13567-017-0429-2Mammary microbiota of dairy ruminants fact or fictionPascal RainardTable of contentsThe notion of mammary microbiota challenges the concept of mammary gland sterilityThere is currently a lively interest among biologists in the interactions between hosts and the microbiota asso- ciated with mucosal or cutaneous epithelia.

The proven efficacy of blanket dry cow therapy in reducing the incidence of new intramammary infections is another circumstantial evidence of the inefficiency of the putative intramam- mary microbiota and is compatible with the idea that such a microbiota does not exist.An implication of mammary microbiota use of probiotics for the mammary glandAccording to the concept of mastitis as a manifesta- tion of dysbiosis i.e.

This is in keeping with results showing the absence of bacterial DNA in the milk of non-infectious mastitis and the presence of DNA of many bacterial types in the milk of breast-infected women .In conclusion the existence of an intramammary microbiota seems incompatible with the established knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune system of the MG.Mammary microbiota compatibility with the five-point mastitis control planThe question arises of the compatibility of the concept of intramammary microbiota with the mastitis control practices developed and endorsed by researchers at the National Institute for Research in Dairying NIRD UK in the 1960s .

From the data establishing the existence of a milk sample microbiome some authors assumed the existence of a commensal microflora of human milk and of a mammary microbiota .The mechanism by which bacteria reach the mammary gland has been the subject of debate and speculation.

This possibility is discussed below.The concept of human mammary gland microbiota was proposed to be applied to the bovine mammary gland  and this idea was taken up in later studies.

The novel concept of mammary microbiota has not pre- viously been examined with regard to its implications in terms of mammary immunobiology.

It is speculated that bacteria taken up from the gut lumen by leucocytes such as dendritic cells or macrophages would be carried to the mammary gland by phagocytes migrating to the mammary gland by the haematogenous route then making their way to the mammary gland lumen to be finally shed in milk.

Most studies have dealt with the skin or gut microbiota but other body sites are now considered as harbouring their own microbiota such as the oro-pharyngeal urinary and genital tracts and evenCorrespondence ISP INRA Universite de Tours UMR1282 37380 Nouzilly Francec The Authors 2017.

Importantly beyond the sample contamination controversy it is necessary to take into account all the consequences and implications related to the existence of an intramammary microbiota in terms of pathogenesis of infectious mastitis immunobiology of the MG and dairy cow husbandry including good hygienic practices.Mammary microbiota and the innate immunity of the MGThe immune response that develops in reaction to pathogens is shaped by the host-bacteria interactions that prevail in the infected organ .

The very low concentration of sIgA 0.1-0.2 mgmL in milk of dairy ruminants is at vari- ance with the existence of an intramammary microbiota because microbiota generally stimulate multiple path- ways to drive secretory IgA production by plasma cells located in the lamina propria   .
