twenty three genera decreased in abundance from d 0 to d 7 table 4. interestingly 10 of the 23 genera that decreased in abundance by d 7 remained decreased at d 14 suggesting that the effect of the pine needles on decreasing some bacterial genera abundance had a longer lasting effect greater than 1 wk.most cows that abort after being exposed to pine needles will do so within 3 d of exposure james et al.

2012. therefore the objective of this study was to perform an analysis of the microbiome in the rumen of cattle before during and after ex- posure to pine needles to identify rumen microbial changes that occur during pine needle exposure.2314effect of pine needles on rumen microbiome.2315materials and methodsall protocols for animals used in this research were performed under veterinary supervision and reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee utah state university logan utah.plant materialponderosa pine needles were collected in december 2002 near custer south dakota n 43deg43.257' w 103deg37.509'.

pine needles 5 g needles x kg-1 bw were administered via stom- ach tube directly into the rumen as a ground needles water slurry twice daily morning and afternoon for 7 d. blood was collected 10 ml each morning im- mediately before each dose and again on d 10 and d 14 of the study after the final dose was administered.

2009. the toxin in ponderosa pine needles that induces abortions in cattle is the labdane resin acid isocupressic acid ica gardner et al.

1994. pine needles also contain lesser amounts of other related labdane acids including agathic acid aa imbricatoloic acid imb and dihydroagath-1the authors wish to thank scott larsen and rex probst for their expert technical support.2corresponding author received november 23 2016.accepted march 2 2017.ic acid dhaa which may also be abortifacient gardner et al.

2011.a previous study demonstrated that cattle condi- tioned to ponderosa pine needles can more efficiently metabolize the abortifacient compounds than naive cattle welch et al.

the physiological ad- aptation appears to include an alteration in the ability of rumen microflora to metabolize the pine needles welch et al.

differences were con- sidered significant at p  0.05.resultscattle were dosed twice daily with 5 g pine needlesx kg-1 bw which corresponded to approximately 2.5 kg of pine needles x d-1 for 7 d. as has been demon- strated previously gardner et al.

the concentration of aa rapidly increased in the serum of the cattle for the first 24 h. however after 24 h the concentration of aa in the se- rum declined for the following 48 h even though the cattle continued to be dosed with pine needles twice a day indicating that a physiological adaptation had oc- curred which was consistent with the previous report welch et al.

2012. these results suggest that extended exposure of cattle to pine needles results in a physiological change in cattle such that the known abortifacient compounds in ponderosa pine needles are metabolized more quickly.

in addition because concentrations of secondary compounds in pine needles are variable and complex it will be challenging to determine what specific compounds in pine needles are responsible for the shifts in the ruminal microbiome.we recognize that a shortcoming of this study was the small number of animals evaluated and as such the data should be interpreted with caution.
