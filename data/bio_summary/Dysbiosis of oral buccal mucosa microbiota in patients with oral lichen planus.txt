obviously the new 16s rdna pyrosequenc- ing technology may better reflect the changes of the local microbial community in buccal mucosa lesions of olp.oral cavity microbes of g. streptococcus including salivarius mutans millerianginosus and mitis are often cited as viridian group which are alpha-hemolytic oppor- tunistic pathogenic nobbs et al 2009. although blamed for all kinds of infection diseases the oral commensal streptococci also play an important role in maintaining not only oral but also systemic health wade 2013. strepto- coccus salivarius is suggested to be probiotic as it inhibits the growth of streptococcus pneumonia s. mutans and the gram-negative species which are reported to be associ- ated with periodontitis and halitosis in vitro wescombe et al 2012 and the absence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes wescombe et al 2009 santagati et al 2012. filkins et al 2012 showed that modest levels of streptococcus salivarius streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus milleri group may increase the micro- bial diversity of the cystic fibrosis lung and contribute to patient health.

recent studies reported an increased prolidase activity and oxida- tive stress in patients with olp implicating an imbalance in the antioxidant defense system ergun et al 2011 batu et al 2016. although the precise etiology is still unclear evidence points out that olp is an immunological process which is triggered by an unknown antigen that alters the basal keratinocytes of the oral mucosa and these changes make the keratinocytes susceptible to cell immune response ismail et al 2007 payeras et al 2013. this unknown antigen might have an intrinsic or an extrinsic origin or both.

toll-like receptors tlr-249 which can respond to most oral commensal microorganisms have been reported to be differently expressed in the oral epithelium cells of patients with olp ohno et al 2011 janard- hanam et al 2012 siponen et al 2012. janardhanam et al 2012 also considered that host recognition and response to the commensal or pathogenic microbe may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of olp.

other researches also sug- gested that v1-v3 region primers could detect higher richness huse et al 2012 and better classification consis- tency of oral microbiome dethlefsen et al 2008 zhou et al 2013. in our study v3 region was selected for characterizing buccal microbiome of olp and healthy control.segata et al 2012 and other hmp members explored the microbiota of 18 body sites including buccal mucosal surface in over 200 individuals by sequencing amplifica- tions of v1-v3 and the v3-v5 16s rrna hypervariable regions as part of the nih common fund human micro- biome project.

by means of 16s rdna sequencing this group of bacteria has recently been reported to be more prevalent and active in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy couturier et al 2012 bacteremia kumagai et al 2013 and early onset neonatal meningitis decroix et al 2013. langfeldt et al 2014 studied the immunomodulatory responses in oral epithelial cells by diverse bacterial species clusters and found that il-1b il-6 il-8 and il-10 mrna syn- theses were significant correlated with leptotrichia spe- cies.

scientists huse et al 2012 stahringer et al 2012 abusleme et al 2013 found that very few genus-level otus were present in all sub- jects sampled.

both positive and negative relations between h. pylori infection and olp occurrence have been reported by different detection methods attia et al 2010 pourshahidi et al 2012 kazanowska-dygdala et al 2016. in our research g. helicobacter the genus whichh.

it can cause discomfort and soreness in the mucosa which may hinder eating speaking and even oral hygiene maintenance schlosser 2010. histologi- cally olp is characterized by a dense band-like layer of lymphocytes subepithelial infiltration increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes and the liquefaction degen- eration of basal keratinocytes payeras et al 2013. since it is a refractory and recurrent disease which may pro- gress to oral squamous cell carcinoma oscc world health organization who has categorized this disease as an oral precancerous condition georgakopoulou et al 2011.in general several predisposing factors including immu- nity infection genetics stress and endocrine have been implicated in olp generating and progressing.

both clinical examination and histopathologic confirmation features were referred to the diagnosis criteria kramer et al 1978 ismail et al 2007. the inclusiveexclusive criteria of the subjects were as followsi good general health without tumor or systematic diseases ii good oral hygiene without removable or fixed denture in the mouth iii without sali- vary glands diseases iv periodontal depth  4 mm without aggressive caries untreated pulp disease or periapical problems v no smoking his- tory vi no drug abuse especially no antibiotics or any drug which might lead to lichenoid reaction in the last 1 month no glucocorticoids or immunomodifier in the last 6 months vii females should be out of preg- nancy or lactation.

nucleatum can form typical dental plaque on human teeth involve in periodontal diseases and cause invasive human infections of the neck and head chest lung liver and abdomen bashir et al 2016. chaushu et al 2012 found evidence that f. nucleatum can be directly recog- nized by the nk cell natural cytotoxicity receptor nkp46 which may aggravates periodontal disease.

it is a member of normal commensal but opportunistic pathogen eribe and olsen 2008. lep- totrichia buccalis was believed to be the only species- level member of the genus leptotrichia for many years until another four novel oral species l. shahii l. goodfel- lowii l. wadei and l. hofstadii have been assigned to this genus for 16s rdna-related reasons eribe et al 2004. it is difficult to identify these bacterial infections because these organisms are fastidious anaerobic and may retain crystal violet which can result in misidentification of those as gram-positive rods couturier et al 2012. hence the colonization prevalence and infection rate ofthis group of bacteria might be underestimated.

reports showed that antibiotics can relieve olp symptoms efficiently carbone et al 1999 backman and jontell 2007. bornstein bornstein et al2008 found significant differences in bacterial coloniza- tion patterns between sites with confirmed olp gingival and unaffected sites within the same subject.

by co- incubating oral biofilms with gingival epithelial cells langfeldt et al 2014 found that il-1b il-6 il-8 and il-10 mrna syntheses of oral epithelium cells were sig- nificantly correlated with leptotrichia species.recently high-throughput sequencing-dependent metagenomic technology has been successfully used in different fields.
