Unfortunately 4 weeks of voluntary 10 EtOH consumption in drinking water EtOH-DWfailed to produce major liver pathology in cHAP mice   suggesting a more aggressive regimen must be required.The study by demonstrated that cHAP as well as wild-type WT mice developed more severe liver injury while consuming the Lieber-DeCarli alcohol containing diet for 4 weeks followed by a single EtOH binge by gavage LD-EtOHB mice compared to animals maintained on a standard rodent chow and voluntary alcohol intake plus an EtOH gavage EtOH-DWB mice.

Thus an animal model in which the rodents voluntarily consume large amounts of alco- hol to achieve sustained blood alcohol concentrations BACs and subsequent liver injury which recapitulates human disease could theoretically be an attractive experimental model of ALD.The crossed high alcohol preferring cHAP mice were developedthrough selective breeding of high alcohol preferring lines.

A critical observation was that the cHAP mice on the EtOH-DW regimen consumed significantly more ethanol than cHAP or WT mice on the LD-EtOH diet however this difference did not result in more severe liver injury in these mice.

The liquid Lieber-DeCarli LD alcohol diet was a major advance in that the animals consumed alcohol with the liquid diet usually for a 4-week period of time.

An alcohol-preferring strain and WT mice were fed alcohol by different techniques and with different diet compositions.

Marked differences in the com- position of the diets used in this study may help explain why mice consuming the highest amounts of alcohol did not develop the most severe liver injury.

2013 Chronic free-choice drinking in crossed high alcohol preferring mice leads to sustained blood ethanol levels and metabolic tolerance without evidence of liver damage.

Interestingly the greatest alcohol consumers did not develop the worst ALD.

Rodents have a natural aversion to alcohol and thus creating an experimental model of ALD has been difficult.

Taken together these observations indicate that fac- tors other than the total amount of alcohol consumed can affect ALD development and progression in experimental animals.Only a limited number of patients who drink heavily go on to develop advanced liver disease.
