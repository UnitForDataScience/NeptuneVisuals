Although not signifi- cant there were general trends across the VBC in both VEC indi- cating increases in L. gasseri associated with the higher CO2 conditions .The substantial impact of higher CO2 on L. jensenii L. crispatus and L. gasseri appeared to mask other alterations leading to selec- tion of VBC that contained defined profiles for focused compari- sons.

Specifically CST I communities are dominated by L. crispatus CST II by L. gasseri CST III by L. iners and CST V by L. jensenii .

As shown in A V19I VEC cultures colonized by VBC1 dominated by G. vaginalis bright red and L. crispatus bright blue VBC2 dominated by G. vaginalis and L. gasser turquoise or VBC5 dominated by G. vaginalis and L. jensenii orange showed consistent but not significant proportional suppression ofG.

VBC organisms are designated by the same colors as indicated in the legend of .In contrast to the contraction of L. iners observed in V19Icultures BVEC02I VEC produced VBCs with enhanced L. iners pro- portions at higher CO2 A VBCs 8 3 and 4.

A VBC with native L. iners with or without G. vaginalis illustrated the observed expansion of L. iners in 10 CO2.

Remaining targets were used to create baseline gene expression values for sterile cultures at 5 and 10 supplemented CO2 and used as comparators for parallel cultures created with VBC with or without L. jensenii supplementation as shown in B. Up-regulated expression is depicted on the heat map in red down regulation by green and average fold change is shown in the table.Expression patterns for the immune response and signaling genes impacted by shifted VBC A clustered the samples based on CO2 supplementation 5 CO2 outcomes clustered on the left.

Some in vitro studies support this finding given that culture conditions affect the production of metabolites and anti- microbials associated with vaginal health such as H2O2 and lactic acid e. Understanding the impact of species relationships in the VBC will be a crucial step forward in the development of opti- mized probiotic approaches that have had mixed results to date .Specifically our results illustrated that L. jensenii absolute abundance expanded consistently and significantly during culti- vation with increased luminal CO2 in VBC tested in V19I and in BVEC02I cultures P 0.022 and 0.0001 respectively.

For this schema CT1 showed L. crispatus domination CT2 was dominated by L. iners CT3 by Gardnerella spp and CT4 containing mixed VMB communities that included Pre- votella spp .Additional NGS and other 'omic approaches correlated to clinicaldatasets have provided associative outcomes that implicate growing lists of environmental behavioral and genetic confounders influencing the VMB profile e. Such associations have linked inflammatory profiles and VMBs associated with symptomatic BV dominated by traditionally defined anaerobes includingG.

In contrast VBC3 dominated by G. vaginalis and L. iners orchid showed a distinct expansion of G. vaginalis average increase of 12 fold and a contraction of L. iners although not significantly different.
