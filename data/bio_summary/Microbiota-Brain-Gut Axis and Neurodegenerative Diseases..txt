Parkinson's disease .Alzheimer's disease .

This axis has now been extended to include the microbiota the microbiota-gut-brain axis and tantalizing evidence to suggest that bacteria resident in the gut could impact on the big brain has emerged  consequently the microbiome has emerged as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in disorders as diverse as Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease amyotro- phic lateral sclerosis autism stroke depression and drug ad- diction .It needs to be remembered that the microbiota-gut-brain axis is far from a novel concept and was clearly described over 60 years ago when relationships between gut bacteria their metabolic products and hepatic coma and the alleviation of the syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy by the administration of antibiotics were first described -.

That antibiot- ic administration in early life can not only profoundly impact on the microbiota but also predispose to the development of inflammatory and metabolic disorders later in life has been well demonstrated in relation to obesity  .The Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Disorders--the TheoryThough it must be emphasized that the overwhelming major- ity of the supportive evidence comes from animal models a hypothesis has emerged to link gut microbes to a number of neurodegenerative disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease PD and Alzheimer's disease AD to multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

It is also interesting to note that some of the other socio-personal factors that have been linked to PD such as smoking have also been linked to inflammatory bowel disease a disease where gut microbe-host interactions are thought to play a piv- otal role .

Interactions between disease processes and the microbiome may be bidirectional one must remain open to the possibility that the disease drives changes in the microbiota and not the other way around  -.Routes of CommunicationMuch ignored in the discussion of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is the simple but vexing question--how could a tiny microbe in the gut communicate with the very distant galaxy that is the brain Several possibilities have been proposed.

The microbiome and disease reviewing the links between the oral microbiome aging and Alzheimer's disease.

Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease medications have distinct signatures of the gut microbiome.
