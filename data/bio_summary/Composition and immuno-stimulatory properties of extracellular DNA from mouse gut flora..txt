however evidence is still lacking to support the existence of bacterial edna within the mucus layer.it is worth to note that intestinal epithelial cells do not respond equally to bacterial dna and are capable of distinguishing between dna from probiotic strains and dna from pathogenic strains7.

it has been demonstrated that extracted dna of gut lumen flora limited potently regulatory t cell treg induction by dcs of the lamina propria thus controlling the balance between treg and effector t cell frequency and function6.because of the large number of bacteria present in the gut the amount of cellfree bacterial dna is likely to be more significant.

estimation of the load of bacterial released dna by mucosaassociated bacteria could shed new light on hostmicrobe interactions across a range of diseases.qi c li y yu rq zhou sl wang xg le gw jin qz xiaoh sun j. composition and immuno-stimulatory properties of extracellular dna from mouse gut flora.

they might release dna into the mucus layer to influence host innate immune cell through specific receptors like toll-like receptor 9. evidence supporting this hypothesis is needed.research motivationthis research investigated the existence of extracellular bacterial dna edna in the mouse gut mucus layer their resource and immune modulatory function.

immuno-stimulatory dna of gut microbiotaand colon in healthy male c57bl6 mice.

composition difference of edna and intracellular dna idna of the small intestinal mucus was studied by illumina sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t-rflp.

the edna induced significantly lower tumor necrosis factor-ainterleukin-10 il-10 and il-6il-10 ratios than idna suggesting the predominance for maintaining immune homeostasis of the gut.conclusionour results indicated that degraded bacterial genomic dna was mainly released by gram-negative bacteria especially bacteroidales-s24-7 and stenotrophomonas genus in gut mucus of mice.

unmethylated cytosine guanine cpgrich dna is typical microbial products that are recognized by the vertebrate innate immune system1.

tlr9 activation by bacterial dna has also been demonstrated to induce degranulation of paneth cells and to induce increased resistance to salmonella typhimurium infection4.
