However evidence is still lacking to support the existence of bacterial eDNA within the mucus layer.It is worth to note that intestinal epithelial cells do not respond equally to bacterial DNA and are capable of distinguishing between DNA from probiotic strains and DNA from pathogenic strains7.

It has been demonstrated that extracted DNA of gut lumen flora limited potently regulatory T cell Treg induction by DCs of the lamina propria thus controlling the balance between Treg and effector T cell frequency and function6.Because of the large number of bacteria present in the gut the amount of cellfree bacterial DNA is likely to be more significant.

Bead beating and the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit QIAGEN were used to extract genomic DNA of mucoid bacteria.Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism T-RFLP analysisPrimers 334F939R or 338F806R10 were labeledwith 5'6-carboxyfluorescein 6-FAM forward or 5' 6hexachlorofluorescein HEX reverse.

The 25mL PCR reaction contained 1 x PCR buffer 200 mmolL of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate 1.5 mmolL MgCl2 0.1 mmolL of each primer 100 ng of DNA template and 0.5 U of Takara Taq DNA polymerase11.

Immuno-stimulatory DNA of gut microbiotaand colon in healthy Male C57BL6 mice.

Composition difference of eDNA and intracellular DNA iDNA of the small intestinal mucus was studied by Illumina sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism T-RFLP.

The eDNA induced significantly lower tumor necrosis factor-ainterleukin-10 IL-10 and IL-6IL-10 ratios than iDNA suggesting the predominance for maintaining immune homeostasis of the gut.CONCLUSIONOur results indicated that degraded bacterial genomic DNA was mainly released by Gram-negative bacteria especially Bacteroidales-S24-7 and Stenotrophomonas genus in gut mucus of mice.
