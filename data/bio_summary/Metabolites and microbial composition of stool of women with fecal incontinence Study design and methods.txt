Chronic constipationTo compare microbial diversity at baseline between women with FI and controls first indices of alpha diversity diversity within a sample and beta diversity differentiation between samples of same type will be compared between women with FI and controls gamma diversity using different indices for richness number of OTUsspecies present in a sample and evenness relative abundance of different OTUsspecies and their even distribution.2425 following metrics will be determined observed species measures unique OTUs in the sample Chao estimates the species richness Shannon index measures both richness and evenness with higher numbers indicating greater diversity Simpson's index measures both richness and evenness but less affected by the presence of rare species when compared to Shannon's index and phylogenetic distance includes phylogenetic distance into the diversity calculation.The dissimilarity in microbiota of women with FI and controls will be compared using UniFrac and statistical significance will be measured using PERMANOVA or similar statistical methods eg PERMDISP which are a part of QWRAP.25 principal coordinates analysis PCoA will be used to visualize the clustering pattern of samples in women with FI and controls in order to identify potentially more homogenous subsets of microbiota samples within the cases and controls.

Prospective studies show that bowel symptoms related to gut motility and sensation such as diarrhea and fecal urgency are independent risk factors for FI and more important than obstetric injury to the anal sphincter.2-4 there is a gap in knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying FI in women.

In studies of irritable bowel syndrome the relative proportion ofbutyrate in stool samples was 30 higher than controls.13 an alpha of 0.05 a sample size of 82 participants and 41 controls will give us greater than 90 power to detect a difference of 5 in butyrate levels in stool samples between participants with FI and controls.Data on the proportional abundance of Clostridiales in women with FI are not available.

Jeffery et al14 the proportional abundance of Clostridiales between subtypes of IBS differed by 0.6 standard deviations.14 assumption and a type I error threshold of 0.05 our planned enrollment of 82 participants with FI and 41 controls will provide 90 power to detect a difference in proportional abundance of Clostridiales between women with FI and controls.

Based on publishedNHANES data women with loose watery stool are at increased risk of FI with an odds ratio of 2.8 95CI 1.9 4.1.2 3.8 increased risk for the development of new onset FI.3 that study adults with 3 bowel movements a day were at eight times increased risk for FI than adults with one or less bowel movements a day.

Other studies have implicated constipation as an independent risk factor for FI in women with pelvic floor disorders.4 that cause fecal urgency and alter the gut motility either diarrhea or constipation could predispose to the development of FI.

Repetitive instillation of larger doses of butyrate enemas is associated with decrease in visceral perception likely due to overstimulation and subsequent desensitization of TRPV1 receptors.11 butyrate where levels above a certain threshold level cause fecal urgency but very high levels of rectal butyrate reduce rectal sensation.26 rectal sensation can cause FI these studies provide biologically plausible mechanisms through which elevated levels of fecal butyrate could potentially cause FI.

INTRODUCTIONAn estimated 9 of women in the United States suffer from fecal incontinence FI in the absence of a gastrointestinal GI malignancy.1 understood and symptoms are typically attributed to obstetric injury.

Metabolomic analysis of fecal water has allowed the quantification of numerous metabolites in health and disease a select list of metabolites that have been shown in human or animal studies to have a role in gut motility are listed in Table 7 The neuro-hormonal mechanisms through which stool metabolites could alter gut motility sensation and stool consistency and therefore have a role in FI are shown in Figure 1.

Tryptamine a neuroactive bacterial metabolite resulting from the transformation of the aromatic amino acid tryptophan mimics the effect of serotonin and increases gut contractility.7 adults with irritable bowel syndrome several studies have reported altered levels of multiple stool metabolites13-14 response to treatment has been shown to be mediated through a change in the level of stool metabolites acting on primary afferent neurons and enteric nervous system.15-16Thus we hypothesize that the stool metabolome and microbiome are associated with FI and may be implicated in response to therapy.
