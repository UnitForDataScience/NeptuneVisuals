The importance of TcdB particularly in severe intestinal damageand severeand systemic disease  has been established For these reasons TcdB was selected as a key target for the development of C. difficile colostrum-based therapeutics together with vegetative cell and spore targets that represent all important infectious cycle components.The use of C. difficile-specific colostrum as a prevention or treatment for CDI has yielded promising results when tested in various animal models and in human clinical trials.

C. difficile strains used are indicated alongside each panel a-e. To determine if TcdB-HBC contained IgG capable of neutralising TcdB purified TcdB from strain VPI10463 Abcam was incubated for 60 minutes with either PBS NI-BC IgG or TcdB-HBC IgG before being added to Vero cell monolayers.

Importantly the TcdB-HBC IgG abolished the cytotoxic activity of purified TcdB with a significant dose-dependent reduction in cell death when 25 pg P  0.0001 or 5 pg P  0.0001 of TcdB was incubated with TcdB-HBC IgG compared to TcdB that had been incubated with NI-BC IgG or PBS Fig.

ELISA analysis of C. difficile-specific antibodies in colostrum from cows immunised with C. difficile antigens.

Pregnant cows were immunised to generate hyperimmune bovine colostrum HBC containing antibodies that target essential C. difficile virulence components specificallyspores vegetative cells and toxin B TcdB.

and were detected in a lane containing TcdB purified from a C. difficile 027 strain tgcBIOMICS Lane 11 Fig.

ELISA plates were coated with C. difficile spore exosporium vegetative cell SLP or recombinant TcdB antigens to determine the specific colostrum antibody titres of Spore-HBC a Exo-HBC b Veg-HBC c SLP-HBC d or TcdB-HBC e respectively compared with colostrum from non-immune cows NI-BC.Prophylactic administration of TcdB-specific HBC protects mice from CDI.

C. difficile-specific antibodies in colostrum are cross-reactive and able to neutralise the cytotoxicity of TcdB.

Indicates P  0.01.DiscussionWe have developed the first oral whole-HBC immunotherapeutic product specifically engineered to neutralise the activity of only one of the C. difficile toxins TcdB.

Prophylactic administration of colostrum immunoglobulin concentrate containing antibodies against C. difficile culture filtrate with both TcdA and TcdB present protected hamsters from CDI.
