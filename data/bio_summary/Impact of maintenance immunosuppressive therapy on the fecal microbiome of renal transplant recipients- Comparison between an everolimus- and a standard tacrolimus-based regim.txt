Additionally recent studies have evaluated the role of the gut microbiome in the drug response and the possible impact of the drugs on the composition of the gut microbiota with clinical metabolicbiochemical and immunological consequences .However although the study of the gut microbiome is a recent emerging field in medicine few reports have measured the modification of this complex system in renal transplant recipi- ents .

The search for translated DNA sequences was executed using Diamond  and hits that spanned 220 amino acids with 280 similarity were collected.Alpha diversity within-sample diversity and beta diversity sample-to- sample dissimilarity metricsTo evaluate the degree of variation of the microbial community structure within a sample we measured the alpha diversity by employing the Shannon diversity index .

DESeq was run under default settings and q-valueswere calculated with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct p-values while controlling for false-discovery rates.ResultsTaxonomic and pathway and gene functional diversity was similar between the 2 study groupsAs shown in  samples from the EVEMMF group had similar degrees of Shannon diver- sity at the operational taxonomic unit OTU level microbial gene level and pathway level compared to the TACMMF group.Both study groups had a similar abundance of Ruminococcaceae Bifidobacteriaceae Lachnospiraceae Streptococcaceae Eubacteriaceae Bacteroidaceae Coriobacteriaceae andAlpha diversity estimates.

These results were in line with previous studies carried out in bone marrow transplant patients .Therefore we employed an innovative whole metagenomic profiling approach to find taxo- nomic functional and genomic differences of the gut microbiome in a group of renal trans- plant recipients undergoing maintenance treatment with 2 different immunosuppressive schemas a less commonly used combined regimen of everolimus EVE plus mycophenolate mofetil MMF used in approximately 3 of patients versus a standard immunosuppressive protocol with tacrolimus TAC plus MMF.Material and methodsPatientsFrom February to April 2016 a total of 20 stable adult deceased-donor renal transplant recipi- ents at least 6 months post-transplant EVE group median IQR4.7 years 3.3-6.7 versus TAC group 5.8 years 4.4-7.4 were included in this study after signing an informed consent form.Based on the maintenance immunosuppressive treatment 9 patients MF 72 were treated with everolimus EVE Certican Novartis levels 3-6 ngml and 11 MF 92 with tacrolimus TAC Advagraft Astellas levels 4-8 ngml in combination with mycophenolate mofetil MMF Cell-Cept Roche 1000 mg b.i.d.

The top 8 most abundant functional genes in the 2 study groups.Interestingly although pathway analysis showed no substantial differences between the two study groups  the samples for renal transplant patients undergoing maintenance treatment with EVEMMF exhibited a lower abundance of starch and sucrose metabolism pathway genes Chi-square 6.87 p-value 0.01 and  than those treated with TACMMF.

This result was probably due to the plasticity of the gut microbiota and the absence of a significant renal functional impairment in our patients.Additionally our analysis revealed that the consumption of sugar was highly correlated with significant differences in taxonomic OTU beta diversity p-value 0.0136 functional gene content p-value 0.0116 and pathway differences p-value 0.0035 among samples.

The TACMMF group had an enrichment of genes for flagellar motor switch protein fliNY fliN and type IV pilus assembly protein pilM.

The fla- gellar motor switch protein fliNY and type IV pilus assembly protein pilM pilM were significantly enriched in TACMMF-treated patients while the macrolide transport system mrsA msrA was increased in patients treated with EVEMMF.The bacterial flagellum is a component shared by several pathogenic species including Spi- rochetes E. coli  and Salmonella.
