nine patients were treated with everolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil evemmf group and 11 patients were treated with a standard therapy with tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil tacmmf group.resultsa statistical analysis of comparative high-throughput data demonstrated that although simi- lar according to the degree of shannon diversity alpha diversity at the taxonomic level three functional genes clearly discriminated evemmf versus tacmmf cutoff log2 fold change21 fdr kai huai huai  xiang tihuai huai 10.05. flagellar motor switch protein fliny and type iv pilus assembly protein pilm pilm were significantly enriched in tacmmf-treated patients while macro- lide transport system mrsa msra was more abundant in patients treated with evemmf.

marker genes were identified for bacteria archaea viruses and eukaryotic microbes.functional analysisfiltered dna sequences were mapped against a reference database of all proteins within the kegg database version 75.0. the search for translated dna sequences was executed using diamond  and hits that spanned 220 amino acids with 280 similarity were collected.alpha diversity within-sample diversity and beta diversity sample-to- sample dissimilarity metricsto evaluate the degree of variation of the microbial community structure within a sample we measured the alpha diversity by employing the shannon diversity index .

p-value according to permanova.interestingly our statistical analysis demonstrated that although the two groups of patients exhibited a similar degree of alpha diversity at the taxonomic and genepathway expression level a comparative high-throughput analysis revealed that three functional genes clearly dis- criminated evemmf versus tacmmf cutoff log2-fold change21 fdr yong 0.05. the fla- gellar motor switch protein fliny and type iv pilus assembly protein pilm pilm were significantly enriched in tacmmf-treated patients while the macrolide transport system mrsa msra was increased in patients treated with evemmf.the bacterial flagellum is a component shared by several pathogenic species including spi- rochetes e. coli  and salmonella.

deseq was run under default settings and q-valueswere calculated with the benjamini-hochberg procedure to correct p-values while controlling for false-discovery rates.resultstaxonomic and pathway and gene functional diversity was similar between the 2 study groupsas shown in  samples from the evemmf group had similar degrees of shannon diver- sity at the operational taxonomic unit otu level microbial gene level and pathway level compared to the tacmmf group.both study groups had a similar abundance of ruminococcaceae bifidobacteriaceae lachnospiraceae streptococcaceae eubacteriaceae bacteroidaceae coriobacteriaceae andalpha diversity estimates.

in fact type iv assembly systems are functionally related to the type ii secretion system which is responsible for the extrusion of folded proteins including proteases cellulases pectinases phospholipases lipases and toxins contributing to cell damage and disease  and bacte- rial survival.the msra gene encodes an abc transporter protein that constitutes an efflux pump mediating the bacterial resistance to macrolide .multi-drug efflux pumps mefs are membrane protein complexes that allow the extrusion of various substrates from the cells particularly many antibiotics they represent a well- encoded bacterial resistance mechanism shared by numerous species e.g.

this drug-induced microbiomic metabolic change might specifically influence intestinal habit and modify susceptibility to infections.three genes discriminated evemmf from tacmmf patientsto identify specific drug-related differences in the microbiome we employed several bioinfor- matics algorithms.interestingly comparative statistical analysis revealed that the 3 top functional genes detected out of 4515 tested were able to highly discriminate evemmf versus tacmmf cutoff log2 fold change21 fdr bbyilsyong -0.750.05. particularly the macrolide transport system mrsa msra was significantly enriched in evemmf while the flagellar motor switch protein fliny and type iv pilus assembly protein pilm pilm were increased in the tacmmf group and .in contrast data analysis revealed that out of the 262 tested no otus passed multiple test- ing correction.

these results were in line with previous studies carried out in bone marrow transplant patients .therefore we employed an innovative whole metagenomic profiling approach to find taxo- nomic functional and genomic differences of the gut microbiome in a group of renal trans- plant recipients undergoing maintenance treatment with 2 different immunosuppressive schemas a less commonly used combined regimen of everolimus eve plus mycophenolate mofetil mmf used in approximately 3 of patients versus a standard immunosuppressive protocol with tacrolimus tac plus mmf.material and methodspatientsfrom february to april 2016 a total of 20 stable adult deceased-donor renal transplant recipi- ents at least 6 months post-transplant eve group median iqr4.7 years 3.3-6.7 versus tac group 5.8 years 4.4-7.4 were included in this study after signing an informed consent form.based on the maintenance immunosuppressive treatment 9 patients mf 72 were treated with everolimus eve certican novartis levels 3-6 ngml and 11 mf 92 with tacrolimus tac advagraft astellas levels 4-8 ngml in combination with mycophenolate mofetil mmf cell-cept roche 1000 mg b.i.d.

the top 8 most abundant functional genes in the 2 study groups.interestingly although pathway analysis showed no substantial differences between the two study groups  the samples for renal transplant patients undergoing maintenance treatment with evemmf exhibited a lower abundance of starch and sucrose metabolism pathway genes chi-square 6.87 p-value 0.01 and  than those treated with tacmmf.

the tacmmf group had an enrichment of genes for flagellar motor switch protein fliny flin and type iv pilus assembly protein pilm.

pilm is a cytoplasmic actin-like protein that binds to the short cytoplasmic n-terminus of the inner membrane protein piln and together with inner membrane proteins pilo and pilno and lipoproteins pilp and pilq constitutes the secretin alignment subcomplex - of type iv pili.

the different composition compared to the report of lee et al  could also be due to the exclusion of patients exhibiting acute or chronic diarrhea.additionally in all patients the highly conserved bacterial atp-binding cassette subfamily b abcb-bac putative atp-binding cassette abc transport system permease protein abc.cd.p rna polymerase beta prime subunit rpoc rna polymerase subunit beta rpob beta-galactosidase lacz periplasmic beta-d-glucoside glucohydrolase bgix dna gyrase subunit a gyra and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase large subunit carb cpa2 were the top 8 most abundant functional genes and .

evemmf samples had an enrichment of macrolide transport system atp-binging permease protein mrsa vmlr.notably permanova revealed that the consumption of sugar was highly correlated with significant differences in taxonomic otu beta diversity p-value 0.0136 functional gene content p-value 0.0116 and pathway differences p-value 0.0035 among samples .

this result was probably due to the plasticity of the gut microbiota and the absence of a significant renal functional impairment in our patients.additionally our analysis revealed that the consumption of sugar was highly correlated with significant differences in taxonomic otu beta diversity p-value 0.0136 functional gene content p-value 0.0116 and pathway differences p-value 0.0035 among samples.

this is a molecular target of scientific research to create new antimicrobial drugs .moreover the expression of the bacterial pilus flagellar motor protein and mef pumps are characteristics of the enterobacteriaceae group which include klebsiella pneumoniae one of the main pathogens responsible for urinary tract infections utis .recurrent utis often caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms are among the most fre- quent infectious diseases in the kidney transplant population.

type iv pili have several functions including gliding motility protein secretion adherence to eukaryotic cells and twitching motility  which play a key role in the rapid colonization of new surfaces under conditions of high nutrient availability and in the development of biofilm .a biofilm is an assemblage of different species of microbial cells irreversibly associated with a surface and enclosed in a matrix of primarily polysaccharide material .
