Some other studies were performed at different pH and temperature on bacteriocin production and activity 17 18.The study of the bacteriocin gene clusters types subtypes and the probiotic effect of these strains on laboratory animals will help to a better characterization of lactobacilli isolates.AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by Iran University of Medical SciencesConflict of interestThe authors declared no conflict of interest.ReferencesMohankumar A Murugalatha N. Characterization and antibacterial activity of bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus isolated from raw cattle milk sample.

After these treatments the residual antibacterial activity was determined by the agar spot test and all experiments were carried out in duplicate 1.To study the effect of incubation time on bacteriocin production the equal fresh culture of Lactobacillus strains were incubated at 37 C for 17 24 48 and 72 h. At the end of each incubation time the residual antibacterial activity was determined by the agar spot test and all experiments were carried out in duplicate 11.Results Identification of fecal isolates434 LAB strains were isolated from volunteers with healthy fecal samples.

9 stated that Lactobacillus species had their highest antibacterial activity at pH 7 whereas a considerable decrease was observed at both acidic and alkaline pH.Regarding incubation time our results showed that after 48 h incubation the strains showed the highest antibacterial activity in comparison with other incubation times.

These results are similar to other studies 6 14 15 about lactobacilli activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria although others reported different results with 10-14.3 of the isolates being able to inhibit the indicator organisms 1 16.The investigation of bacteriocin genes including Gassericin A Plantaricin S and Laf operon genes revealed a low frequency of bacteriocin genes between Lactobacillus strains.

These antibacterial peptides can be produced by many labs such as Leuconostocetc Streptococcus Lactococcus Pediococcus and Lactobacillus that enable these bacteria to inhibit the growth and activity of several pathogenic bacteria 5.Lactobacilli have many different bacteriocins with the same activity but vary in some aspects such as mode of action genetic origin chromosomal or plasmid and biochemical properties.These peptides are being tested to assess their application as narrow-spectrum antibiotics and nowadays play an effective role in processing and packaging food and have major potential as natural preservatives 6 7.Based on killing mechanism molecular weight genetics and chemical properties bacteriocins are classified in one of the four major groups Class I small peptide inhibitors termed as lantibiotics Class II small heat-stable proteins that have five subclasses Class III large heat- labile protein and this class have two subclasses and Class IV bacteriocins that are defined as complex bacteriocins containing lipid or carbohydrate sections 8.Lactobacilli usually produce the highest volume of bacteriocins during the maximum cell growth but some environmental factors such as pH temperature incubation period and media composition can influence on the volume of bacteriocin production 9.In this study Lactobacillus species were isolated from fecal samples and their antimicrobialactivities against pathogen microorganisms were determined.

The inhibitory activity of lactobacilli strains against indicator bacteria is reported in Table 2.Detection of the bacteriocin genesAll Lactobacillus species were tested for the presence of bacteriocin genes Gassericin A Plantaricin S and Laf operon.

We found that approximately 40 of all Lactobacillus isolates were positive for bacteriocin phenotypic test antibacterial activity but only 6 of all isolates had bacteriocin genes.

Identification of the Lactobacillus genus was carried out by PCR by using 16S rRNA specific For-Lac 5'- TGGAAACAGGTGCTAATACCG-3' and Rev- Lac 5'-CCATTGTGGAAGATTCCC-3' primers.PCR conditions were 94 degC for 5 min 30 cycles of 94 degC for 30 s 57 degC for 30 s and 72 degC for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 degC for 7 min 10.Screening for antibacterial activity Agar spot testThe antibacterial activity of the isolates was determined by agar spot test according to Hernandez et al.

We did not identify strains having at least two of the three tested genes.Partial characterization of the antibacterial activitiespH alteration between 4 to 7 had no effect on antibacterial activities which arose due to the presence of bacteriocin components but in thealkaline range 8 to 10 these activities were reduced.

Regarding the effect of incubation time the results showed that after 48 h incubation the strains showed higher antibacterial activity in comparison with other incubation times tested.Discussion In the present study 72 16.5 Lactobacillus species were identified from a total of 434 LAB strains based on 16S rRNA gene amplification.
