pcr primers and annealing temperatures are shown in table 1. pcr conditions were similar to all the genes an initial denaturation step of 95 c for 5 min 34 cycles of 95 c for 1 min extension 72 c for 45 s followed by a final extension at 72 c for 5 min 13. the amplified products were visualized by electrophoresis in 1.5 agarose gels stained with gelred.partial characterization of the antibacterial activityto study the effect of ph native and ranging from 4 to 10 on antibacterial properties the cell- free supernatant of lactobacilli culture was divided into two parts one with native ph ph 4.7 resulting from bacterial growth on broth medium and another with altered ph ph 4 to 10. after these treatments the residual antibacterial activity was determined by the agar spot test and all experiments were carried out in duplicate 1.to study the effect of incubation time on bacteriocin production the equal fresh culture of lactobacillus strains were incubated at 37 c for 17 24 48 and 72 h. at the end of each incubation time the residual antibacterial activity was determined by the agar spot test and all experiments were carried out in duplicate 11.results identification of fecal isolates434 lab strains were isolated from volunteers with healthy fecal samples.

the frequency of these genes were 5 6.9 3 4.1 and 5 6.9 for gassericin a plantaricin s structural gene and laf operon respectively figure 1. we did not identify strains having at least two of the three tested genes.partial characterization of the antibacterial activitiesph alteration between 4 to 7 had no effect on antibacterial activities which arose due to the presence of bacteriocin components but in thealkaline range 8 to 10 these activities were reduced.

9 stated that lactobacillus species had their highest antibacterial activity at ph 7 whereas a considerable decrease was observed at both acidic and alkaline ph.regarding incubation time our results showed that after 48 h incubation the strains showed the highest antibacterial activity in comparison with other incubation times.

regarding the effect of incubation time the results showed that after 48 h incubation the strains showed higher antibacterial activity in comparison with other incubation times tested.discussion in the present study 72 16.5 lactobacillus species were identified from a total of 434 lab strains based on 16s rrna gene amplification.

identification of the lactobacillus genus was carried out by pcr by using 16s rrna specific for-lac 5'- tggaaacaggtgctaataccg-3' and rev- lac 5'-ccattgtggaagattccc-3' primers.pcr conditions were 94 degc for 5 min 30 cycles of 94 degc for 30 s 57 degc for 30 s and 72 degc for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 degc for 7 min 10.screening for antibacterial activity agar spot testthe antibacterial activity of the isolates was determined by agar spot test according to hernandez et al.

moreover the genes encoding bacteriocins were investigated while the antibacterial activity was partially characterized.materials and methods bacterial strains and growth conditionsfecal samples were collected from 48 healthy volunteers who had no antibiotic therapy over 6 months before sampling and did not have gi disorders at the sampling time in tehran iran.

some other studies were performed at different ph and temperature on bacteriocin production and activity 17 18.the study of the bacteriocin gene clusters types subtypes and the probiotic effect of these strains on laboratory animals will help to a better characterization of lactobacilli isolates.acknowledgmentsthis study was supported by iran university of medical sciencesconflict of interestthe authors declared no conflict of interest.referencesmohankumar a murugalatha n. characterization and antibacterial activity of bacteriocin producing lactobacillus isolated from raw cattle milk sample.

it may be possible that those species were more sensitive to gi tract in comparison with other lab strains orsome other bacterial forms such as viable but nonculturable vbnc strains were present among the studied samples.our results showed that approximately 40 of all lactobacillus isolates had antimicrobial activity against one or more microorganisms.

email hydrogen peroxide organic acids inhibitory enzymes and bacteriocins 2.in recent years bacteriocins have attracted significant attention because of their potential use as safe additives for food preservation 3 and other applications such as treatment of pathogen diseases cancer therapy and human health enhancement 4. bacteriocins are aheterogeneousgroup of ribosomally-synthesized pore-forming antibacterial peptides.

these antibacterial peptides can be produced by many labs such as leuconostocetc streptococcus lactococcus pediococcus and lactobacillus that enable these bacteria to inhibit the growth and activity of several pathogenic bacteria 5.lactobacilli have many different bacteriocins with the same activity but vary in some aspects such as mode of action genetic origin chromosomal or plasmid and biochemical properties.these peptides are being tested to assess their application as narrow-spectrum antibiotics and nowadays play an effective role in processing and packaging food and have major potential as natural preservatives 6 7.based on killing mechanism molecular weight genetics and chemical properties bacteriocins are classified in one of the four major groups class i small peptide inhibitors termed as lantibiotics class ii small heat-stable proteins that have five subclasses class iii large heat- labile protein and this class have two subclasses and class iv bacteriocins that are defined as complex bacteriocins containing lipid or carbohydrate sections 8.lactobacilli usually produce the highest volume of bacteriocins during the maximum cell growth but some environmental factors such as ph temperature incubation period and media composition can influence on the volume of bacteriocin production 9.in this study lactobacillus species were isolated from fecal samples and their antimicrobialactivities against pathogen microorganisms were determined.

finally the plates were incubated at 37 degc for 24-72 h depending on the growth of the indicator strain and the inhibitory zone wider than 4 mm in diameter was considered as positive.well-diffusion methodthe antibacterial activity of the isolates was determined by well-diffusion test according to toba et al.

among these isolates 72 16.5 were identified as lactobacillus species based on 16s rrna gene amplification.screening for antibacterial activityall 72 lactobacillus species were assayed for potential bacteriocin production and their antimicrobial activity by using the agar spot test and well- diffusion method.

these results are similar to other studies 6 13. we found that approximately 40 of all lactobacillus isolates were positive for bacteriocin phenotypic test antibacterial activity but only 6 of all isolates had bacteriocin genes.

our results showed that ph alteration between 4 to 7 had no effect on antibacterial activity and these activities arose from bacteriocin components but in the alkaline range 8 to 10 these activities were reduced.
