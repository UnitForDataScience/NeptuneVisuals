Calcium intake was comparable in both group I 1.1 - 0.5 g to 1.1 - 0.7 g and group II 1.0 - 0.4 g to 1.0 -0.7 g p  0.89 at 3 mo and this was sustained at 6 mo in both group I 1.1 - 0.5 g and group II 1.1 -0.6 g Table 2.

From 117 potential participants 50 participants were enrolled in the study Figure 1 23 participants in group I and 27 in group II with significantly more males in group II p  0.05 Table 1.

In group II there was a significant reduction in total FODMAP intake from 3 mo to 6 mo of 6 - 8 g p  0.02 however when analyzing the individual FODMAPs only the reduction in lactose was significant between 3 mo and 6 mo 7 - 10 g p  0.01.Effect on symptom severityAt baseline there was no difference in IBS SSS in group I 272 - 60 vs group II 254 - 80 p  0.16.

Investigating the changes in IBS SSS in each subtype we found a significant reduction for IBSD in group I 114.5 - 89 p  0.01 and group II 89 - 81 p  0.01 during their intervention period and for IBSM in group II 112- 38 p  0.03 during their intervention period.

In group II at 6 mo all participants had scores representative of mild IBS or similar to those of people without IBS.At 3 mo there was a statistically significant greater reduction in the maximum number of bowel motions experienced per day in group I 1.7 - 2.6 vs group II 0.1 - 1.7 p  0.01.

While a waiting list comparator group is able to account for the fluctuating nature of symptoms it is not a true placebo arm as participants are aware of their group allocation and are not expecting to get better and participants received less attention from the study investigators than those in group I.

Low FODMAPs reduce IBS symptomscomparator group crossed over to a low FODMAP diet while group I started re-challenging foods.

All patients completed the IBS SSS IBS symptom severity scoring system 0-500 points increasing with severity IBS QoL questionnaire 0-100 increasing with QoL a FODMAP specific food frequency questionnaire and provided a stool sample at baseline three and six months for microbiome analysis.RESULTSFifty participants were enrolled into group I n  23 or group II n  27.

There was a significantly lower IBS SSS 275.6 - 63.6 to 128.8 - 82.5 vs 246.8 - 71.1 to 203.6 - 70.1 P  0.0002 and increased QoL 68.5 - 18.0 to 83 - 13.4 vs 72.9 - 12.8 to 73.3 - 14.4 P  0.0001 in group I vs group II at 3 mo.

The reduced IBS SSS was sustained at 6 mo in group I 160 - 102 and replicated in group II 124 - 76.
