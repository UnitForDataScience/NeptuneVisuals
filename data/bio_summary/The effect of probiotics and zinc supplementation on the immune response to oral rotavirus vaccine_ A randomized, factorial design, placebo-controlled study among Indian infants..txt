solicited and reported adverse events were similar across the four arms.discussionin a setting where the immunogenicity of oral vaccines is low a 6 week course of probiotic lgg resulted in a small increase in the immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine 35.2 seroconversion in pro- biotic arms 1 and 2 vs. 27.7 in placebo arms 3 and 4 p  0.066. infants who received combined supplementation with zinc and probiotics had the highest rates of seroconversion to rotavirus39.4 compared with 27.4 among infants receiving only placebo p  0.04. however provision of zinc alone did not improve rota- virus vaccine immunogenicity and there was no significant inter- action between zinc and probiotics in their association with seroconversion.daily provision of lgg resulted in a substantially higher preva- lence and abundance of lactobacillus in stool samples collected at the time of vaccination.

we therefore investigated their effect on the immune response to oral rotavirus vaccine rotarix in a four-arm placebo- controlled randomized controlled trial with a factorial design among infants in india.materials and methodsstudy design and participantschildren were randomly assigned 1111 in a factorial design to one of four treatment arms 1 probiotic supplement and zinc supplement 2 probiotic supplement and zinc placebo 3 probi- otic placebo and zinc supplement 4 probiotic placebo and zinc placebo using a blocked randomization procedure with varying block size of 4 and 8 by generated on a computer by an indepen- dent statistician.

a companion paper describes the characterization of the intestinal microbiota using pcr for pathogen gene targets and 16 s ribosomal rna gene sequencing in a nested case- control study of infants stratified by their serological response to rotavirus vaccine .outcomesthe primary outcome was seroconversion to rotavirus mea- sured at 14 weeks of age among infants receiving probiotic com- pared with placebo groups 1 2 compared with 3 4 and among infants receiving zinc compared with placebo groups 1 3 com- pared with 2 4. seroconversion was defined as detection of serum anti-vp6 iga at a concentration 20 uml at 14 weeks of age in a subject seronegative at 6 weeks or a fourfold rise in anti-vp6 iga concentration between 6 and 14 weeks.

seroconversion was strongly corre- lated with rotavirus shedding occurring in 4667 68.7 of infants in who shed rotavirus at 4 andor 7 days and 98217 45.2 of non-shedders fisher's p  0.001. we did not compare sheddingby study arm because of the purposive sampling of equal numbers of infants who seroconverted or not.oral poliovirus vaccine immunogenicityat 6 weeks of age 263 47.8 infants had detectable  18 neutralizing antibodies to type 3 poliovirus.

probiotics and zinc supplementation could improve rv immuno- genicity by altering the intestinal microbiota and immune function.methods infants 5 weeks old living in urban vellore india were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a 4-arm factorial design to assess the effects of daily zinc 5 mg probiotic 1010 lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or placebo on the immunogenicity of two doses of rv rotarixr glaxosmithkline biologicals given at 6 and 10 weeks of age.

seroconversion was recorded in 54137 39.4 42136 30.9 40143 28.0 and 37135 27.4 infants receiving 1 probiotic and zinc 2 probiotic and placebo 3 placebo and zinc 4 two placebos.

16 serious adverse events were recorded none related to study interventions.conclusions zinc or probiotic supplementation did not significantly improve the low immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine given to infants in a poor urban community in india.

secondary outcomes were seroconversion to rotavirus among infants receiving probiotics and zinc group 1 compared with placebos only group 4 geometric mean concentration gmc of rotavirus antibodies by study group and seroconversion to poliovirus serotype 3 at 14 weeks of age.

1. flow diagram of study recruitment and follow-up.according to seroconversion status for the shedding assay resulted in 90 of the per-protocol subset coming from the arm that received zinc and probiotic 66 probiotic only 61 zinc only and 67 placebo- only.

the absence of an effect of zinc supplementation observed in our study must be interpreted with caution since we did not observe an increase in serum zinc levels at the dosage used .

we could not compare detection across study arms because of the purposive sampling of an equal number of infants who seroconverted or not across the study arms see parker et al.

seroconversion showed a modest improve- ment among infants receiving probiotic difference between groups 1 2 and 3 4 was 7.5 97.5confidence interval ci -1.4 16.2 p  0.066 but not zinc difference between groups 1 3 and 24 was 4.4 97.5 ci -4.4 13.2 p  0.272.

zinc supplementation did increase serum vibriocidal antibody titers in children and adults following administration of inactivated oral cholera vaccine although thiseffect was not apparent in infants 6-9 months old .
