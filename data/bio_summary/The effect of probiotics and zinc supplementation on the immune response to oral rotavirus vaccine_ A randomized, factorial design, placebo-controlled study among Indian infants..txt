A companion paper describes the characterization of the intestinal microbiota using PCR for pathogen gene targets and 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in a nested case- control study of infants stratified by their serological response to rotavirus vaccine .OutcomesThe primary outcome was seroconversion to rotavirus mea- sured at 14 weeks of age among infants receiving probiotic com- pared with placebo groups 1 2 compared with 3 4 and among infants receiving zinc compared with placebo groups 1 3 com- pared with 2 4.

We therefore investigated their effect on the immune response to oral rotavirus vaccine Rotarix in a four-arm placebo- controlled randomized controlled trial with a factorial design among infants in India.Materials and methodsStudy design and participantsChildren were randomly assigned 1111 in a factorial design to one of four treatment arms 1 probiotic supplement and zinc supplement 2 probiotic supplement and zinc placebo 3 probi- otic placebo and zinc supplement 4 probiotic placebo and zinc placebo using a blocked randomization procedure with varying block size of 4 and 8 by generated on a computer by an indepen- dent statistician.

Serum zinc levels at this time-point did not differ according to whether the infant serocon- verted to rotavirus 54.2 mcgdl among those who seroconverted vs. 54.3 mcgdl among those who did not p  0.819.Among the subset of infants tested using 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing  Lactobacillus was detected in 87.6 92105 and 79.0 83105 of stool samples at 6 and 10 weeks respectively among those receiving probiotics either with or without zinc compared with 17.5 1163 and 30.2 1963 among those receiving probiotic placebo p-values 0.001.

We did not compare sheddingby study arm because of the purposive sampling of equal numbers of infants who seroconverted or not.Oral poliovirus vaccine immunogenicityAt 6 weeks of age 263 47.8 infants had detectable  18 neutralizing antibodies to type 3 poliovirus.

The intention to treat analysis gave similar results Supplementary Table 2.Impact of interventions on serum zinc and intestinal microbiotaThe mean serum zinc level at 14 weeks of age was 53.9 mcgdl among those supplemented and 54.6 mcgdl among those who received a zinc placebo P  0.349.

Secondary outcomes were seroconversion to rotavirus among infants receiving probiotics and zinc group 1 compared with placebos only group 4 geometric mean concentration GMC of rotavirus antibodies by study group and seroconversion to poliovirus serotype 3 at 14 weeks of age.

Probiotics and zinc supplementation could improve RV immuno- genicity by altering the intestinal microbiota and immune function.Methods Infants 5 weeks old living in urban Vellore India were enrolled in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with a 4-arm factorial design to assess the effects of daily zinc 5 mg probiotic 1010 Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG or placebo on the immunogenicity of two doses of RV Rotarixr GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals given at 6 and 10 weeks of age.

A total of 54 39.4 of 137 infants receiving both probiotic and zinc serocon- verted to rotavirus compared with 37 27.4 of 135 infants receiv- ing both placebos 12.0 difference 95 CI 0.8 22.8 Fisher's p  0.04.
