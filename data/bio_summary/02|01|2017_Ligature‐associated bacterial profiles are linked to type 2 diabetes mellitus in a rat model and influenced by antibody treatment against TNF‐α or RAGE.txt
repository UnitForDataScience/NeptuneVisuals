Future studies could be performed using next-generation sequencing technologies addressing the specific microbiota associated with health and disease in diabetic rats.FUNDING INFORMATION The study was supported by the Danish Medical Research Council Horslev-Fonden The Simon Spies Foundation The Danish Dental Association The Danish Diabetes Association and the Danish Diabetes Academy supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest in this study.REFERENCES Bjornsson M.

DISCUSSION The aim of the present investigation was to compare ligature-associ- ated bacterial profiles in rats with T2D to that of lean rats.

Male Zucker obese rats ZOR display a mutation in their leptin receptors and will therefore develop obesity hyperlipidemia and mild hyperglycemia.Thus Zucker obese rats are widely used in T2D studies Chen  Wang 2005.The development of high throughput molecular methods primar- ily based on analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene has enabled comprehensive analysis of bacterial community changes in relation to health and disease Paster  Dewhirst 2009.

We hypothesized that oral bacterial profiles in T2D rats differ from that of non-diabetic rats with impact of antibodiestargeting diabetes-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti- bodies targeting RAGE.

The aim of the study was to compare ligature-associated bacterial profiles in ZOR T2D to that of leannon-T2D Zucker rats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was undertaken as part of a group of studies on experimental PD and T2D in rats the additional results are presented elsewhere Grauballe Ostergaard Schou Flyvbjerg  Holmstrup 2015 Grauballe Ostergaard Schou Flyvbjerg  Holmstrup 2016.

Before PD was induced all rats were examined to exclude rats with pre-existing PD defined by probing depths 0.5 mm Bjornsson et al.
