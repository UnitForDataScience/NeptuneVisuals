2 E vi and F.Annotation and analysis of prophages in bacterial genomes The annotation of the large scaffolds using the Phaster pipeline 56 also pointed at the presence of putative prophage sequences integrated within bacterial genome scaffolds Fig.

The read coverage of the bacterial scaffolds and the normalized contact frequencies between the phage contigs and the bacterial scaffolds are plotted under the maps black and blue graphs respectively.

The phage genomes were then assigned to their putative bacterial hosts according to the physical contacts between the different DNA molecules opening new perspectives for a comprehensive picture of the genomic structure of the gut flora.

The presence of phages which are considered the most abundant and diverse biological entities on earth 24 in these eco- systems has far-reaching consequences beyond particular pairwise in- teractions 25 influencing everything from bacterial virulence 26 to cell physiology 27.

The control contigs containing three bacterial spe- cies were segmented into three well-defined CCs black triangles in fig.

Therefore the two approaches complement each other for well-studied ecosystems for which many samples are already available.De novo assembly and scaffolding of bacterial genomes The content of large CCs was then investigated qualitatively.

The quality of bacterial genome assemblies can be assessed by looking for the presence of a standardized set of marker genes 51.

The features displayed by these contact maps were often highly consistent with published contact maps of bacterial genomes.

The stars points at CCs of bacterial genome scaffolds emphasized in Figs.
