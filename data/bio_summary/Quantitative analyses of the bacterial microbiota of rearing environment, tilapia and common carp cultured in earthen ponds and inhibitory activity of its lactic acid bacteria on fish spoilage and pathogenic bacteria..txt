They were further examined for produc- tion of catalase oxidase and Gram stain retention.On the one hand the Gram-positive and catalase-nega- tive LAB isolates were tested direct antimicrobial activ- ity against each other against the previously isolated fish spoilage and pathogenic bacteria host-derived bacteria and also against fish spoilage and pathogenic bacteria from other origins non-host-derived bacteria listed below through the spot on the lawn test as described by Geis et al.

However as widely recognised utmost economic losses are incurred in the aquaculture sector due to bacterial infections.-- The earthen ponds of the GIC AIO Groupe d'Initiatives Communes pour une Aquaculture Integree de l'Ouest of Batie LN 5deg17'0''-5deg18'53'' and LE 10deg17'0''- 10deg19'31''-- The earthen ponds of the IRAD Institute of Agricul- tural Research for Development of Foumban LN 5deg21'-5deg58' and LE 10deg17'-11deg02'Pond water samples approximately 20 cm below theMoreover the indiscriminate and abusive worldwide use of antibiotic in aquaculture has not only led to the emergence and development of antibiotic-resistant bac- teria but also to the contamination of aquaculture live- stock Giri et al.

Thanks to their generally recognised as safe GRAS von Wright  and qualified presumption of safety QPS status EFSA  lactic acid bacteria LAB have been widely used as biopreservative agents in seafood products as reported by a plethora of studies Calo-Mata et al.

Plate count agar PCA Scharlau was used for total aerobic bacteria count De Man Rogosa and Sharpe agar MRS agar Difco De Man et al.

lactis strains from aquatic fresh water and marine fish intestine and non-aquatic origins against Gram-neg-ative bacteria Todorov and Dicks  Lin et al.

The identification of the isolates to genus orspecie levels was achieved using the criteria specified in the FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual and the Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Holt et al.

The residual activity was evaluatedby AWDA using Lactobacillus plantarum 5S.The inhibitory activity spectrum of the BLIS against theaforementioned spoilage and pathogenic strains   sec- tion was also determined.The detected BLIS were partially purified by chlo- roformmethanol method as described by Grosu-Tudor et al.

The TAB counts in pond water and fish intestine samples 9.37-9.68 log c.f.u ml-1 were higher than the reported value in the literature 3-9 logc.f.u g-1 Sivertsvik et al.

The high production of lactic acid as expected is in concordance with LAB's metabolism with lactic acid as the major end prod- uct of the glycolytic fermentation and accounting 50 of the phosphoketolase route Pessione et al.
