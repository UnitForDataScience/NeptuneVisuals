Though these groups can co-vary and care must be taken during interpretation these factors have been shown to effect bacterial community struc- ture    .In this study bacterial community composition and diver- sity were described across a series of dune chronosequences developing with similar parent materials but varying climatic conditions.

However when the soil physico-chemical characteristics were included as a control matrix there was no significant correlation between bacterial community distribution and geographical dis- tance rM  0.02 p  0.41 Table .Relative Contribution of Temporal and Environmental Filters on Bacterial Community StructureVariance partitioning analysis VPA was performed to quantify the relative contributions of geographic distance and soil pa- rameters to the taxonomic structure of the bacterial communi- ties.

Dunes that were near neu- tral showed higher bacterial community diversity when com- pared to the older dunes that were more acidic and supported less bacterial diversity.

Thus our results suggest that at a geo- graphic scale of 50-1700 km the geographic distance and environmental conditions would have had different extents in shaping the bacterial community structure.In conclusion this study attempts to survey bacterial spatial patterns across two pristine US dune chronosequences which are approximately 1700 km apart.

Partial mantel test were performed to ex- amine correlation between the degree of similarity in bacterial community composition with environmental and spatial vari- ables correlating the community with one variable while holding the third group constant.

7 Variance partition analysis of the effects of geographic distance and soil variables on the bacterial community structuresome evidence of dispersal limitation in shaping the commu- nity patterns but they are difficult to distinguish from the ef- fects of environmental heterogeneity  .Thus the results suggest that local environmental condi- tions could have a stronger effect than the geographic dis- tance and could be a major contributor in shaping the bacte- rial community structure at smaller scales  .

We show that local geochemical features could be a dominant factor in driving bacterial community structure while geographic distance as a single factor could contribute to some community variation at a specific scale 50 - 1700 km.

In 2008 developmental chronosequences with ages ranging from 105 to 500000 years across Georgia GA and Michigan MI were studied to inves- tigate how bacterial community composition and diversity change as a result of local environmental gradients that develop during pedogenesis.
