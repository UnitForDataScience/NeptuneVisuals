though these groups can co-vary and care must be taken during interpretation these factors have been shown to effect bacterial community struc- ture    .in this study bacterial community composition and diver- sity were described across a series of dune chronosequences developing with similar parent materials but varying climatic conditions.

dunes that were near neu- tral showed higher bacterial community diversity when com- pared to the older dunes that were more acidic and supported less bacterial diversity.

thus our results suggest that at a geo- graphic scale of 50-1700 km the geographic distance and environmental conditions would have had different extents in shaping the bacterial community structure.in conclusion this study attempts to survey bacterial spatial patterns across two pristine us dune chronosequences which are approximately 1700 km apart.

in 2008 developmental chronosequences with ages ranging from 105 to 500000 years across georgia ga and michigan mi were studied to inves- tigate how bacterial community composition and diversity change as a result of local environmental gradients that develop during pedogenesis.

the diversity wassurveyed using high-throughput pyrosequencing and variance partitioning was used to describe the effects of spatial environ- mental and spatio-environmental factors on bacterialthe original version of this article was revised the article title was mistakenly amended to bacterial diversity patterns differed in two developing ecosystems.electronic supplementary material the online version of this article doi8 contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

estimates of bacterial diversity were much great- er in mi numbers of otu ace and chao1 and remained 2- 3x greater in mi than ga after removing the effect of soil properties.

the large differences in diversity between geograph- ically separated bacterial communities in different climates need further investigation.

it is not known if the rare members of the community which contributed to greater bacterial diver- sity in ga relative to mi play an important role in ecosystem function but has been hypothesized to play a role in ecosystem resiliency resistance and stability.

for example soil prop- erties such as ph carbon and nitrogen have been shown to have strong associations with bacterial community structure but fewer studies have attempted to compare biogeographically separated and climatically different soils that have comparable parent materials  .

in essence any bacterial species can be found anywhere in the world owing to their small size and high num- bers.
