Surface swab of the tonsils is now being questioned as a reliable method of pathogen identification.10 Tonsillar core gives a better yield of anaerobic specimen which in turn can be used to study and treat bacteremia in post-tonsillectomy cases as well as prevent a case of recurrent tonsillitis to progress to tonsillectomy.11Core samples of normal tonsils have shown not to harbour any bacteria as tonsils removed for any conditions other than recurrent tonsillitis have shown no growth of bacteria on cultures.12 Having positive identification of pathogenic microflora from core samples it can help identify diseased cases and microbial count can help identify cases requiring tonsillectomy.13 Having established that tonsillar microflora is truly represented by the core specimen14 the question remains to find a method to extract this core flora which is both reproducible and reliable.15 Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines in 2010 guidelines have stated that surface swab is a poor representative of tonsillar core flora and cannot form a basis of prescribing antibiotics for24Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan 2017 Vol.

27 1 23-25Tonsillar floratreatment of tosillitis.16 The current antibacterial therapy being adopted for recurrent tonsillitis comprises of penicillin group of antibiotics.17 The anti-microbial spectrum of penicillins does not cover anaerobes whereas anaerobes have been reported in up to 70 of tonsillar core flora specimens.18 Tonsillar aspirations provide a reliable method to identify core flora.

Using Chi-square test it was found that tonsillar aspiration gave a much more realistic picture of the tonsillar core flora as compared to surface swabs p 0.001.Address P  Present A  AbsentTable II Frequencies of aspirates compared with core flora.Chi-square test is appliedDISCUSSIONTonsillitis has been reported since the time of Celcus in the first century and as a consequence tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy remains one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the pediatrics group.

Surface swabs are no more recommended according to National Health Service NHS guidelines.1The objective of the study was to determine the best method of identifying core tonsillar flora.METHODOLOGYThe study was designed to detect the common pathogens in core sample of tonsil with the correlation that the same flora be isolated from surface swab and aspiration of the tonsil.

Chi-square test showed this difference to be significant p-value 0.001.Conclusion Tonsillar aspiration gave a much more realistic picture of the tonsillar core flora as compared to surface swabs.Key Words Core flora.

Despite the overwhelming evidence of involvement of GABHS in the disease process of tonsillitis an asymptomatic carrier rate up to 40 has been mentioned for GABHS in the literature.6 Findings like this compel researchers to dwell on the fact that flora isolated from the tonsillar surface may not be the true representative pathogen.Furthermore bacterial flora within the tonsillar crypts and core of tonsil appear more likely to be causing the infections.

The surface flora may not be the true representative of tonsillar core flora.

showed that there was no correlation between the flora of bacteria cultured from the surface of the tonsil and that which was cultured from within the tonsillar crypts.41 Department of ENT Combined Military Hospital CMH Lahore.2 Department of ENT  Pathology3 PAF Hospital Mianwali.Correspondence Dr. Zeeshan Ayub Classified ENT Specialist Department of ENT PAF Hospital Mianwali.E-mail Received August 08 2016 Accepted January 10 2017.Regarding the tonsillar flora the most commonly isolated organism on tonsillar surface swab is group A beta-haemolytic Streptococcus GABHS shown to present in 5 - 36 of tonsillar infections.

Flora of 12 13.8 surface swabs and 68 78.2 tonsillar aspirates matched the flora cultured from core of the tonsils.

Whether this surgical treatment is at all necessary is debatable because if the recurrence can be stopped by adequate antimicrobial coverage then the need for tonsillectomy can be alleviated.3 Currently the practice in vogue for the choice of antimicrobial therapy is based on the surface flora of tonsil extracted from the tonsillar surface.
