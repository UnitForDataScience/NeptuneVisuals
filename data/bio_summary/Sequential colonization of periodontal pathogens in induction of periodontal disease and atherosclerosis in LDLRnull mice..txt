Mice were sequentially administered an oral infection comprising first four cycles of infection with F. nucleatum infection I through infection IV followed by a polybacterial infection with P. gingivalis T. denticola and T. forsythia infection V through infection VIII.

Our study findings were similar to these prior observations as the cholesterol levels observed in the infected mice lie in aforementioned range indi- cating that infection does not alter the serum lipid profile levels in LDLRnull mice.Our previous experiments with P. gingivalis as a monobac- terial infection in ApoEnull mice demonstrated that although the serum levels of lipid molecules are not altered significantly by chronic infection P. gingivalis gingival infection can trigger atheroma plaque formation Velsko et al.

.In order to mimic the sequential colonization of human pe- riodontal bacteria in the mice oral cavity a sequential infection model was adopted comprising infection with F. nucleatum in- termediate colonizer first followed by infection with P. gingi- valis T. denticola and T. forsythia late colonizers.

The focus of this study was to examine whether synergis- tic polybacterial infection can enhance pre-existing but minimal aortic atherosclerotic lesions in LDLRnull mice on normal chow diets.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeriodontal bacterial strains and growth conditionsFusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 49256 Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53977 Treponema denticola ATCC 35404 and Tannerella forsythia ATCC 43037 were used for gingival infection in this study.

For the remaining 12 weeks of infection with late colonizers the pres- ence of P. gingivalis T. denticola and T. forsythia genomic DNA was determined after 6 and 7 infection cycles Kesavalu et al.

.RESULTSPeriodontal bacterial infection of the LDLRnull miceDuring 24 weeks of bacterial infection LDLRnull mice were mon- itored for the presence of human periodontal bacteria Fusobac- terium nucleatum Porphyromonas gingivalis Treponema denticola and Tannerella forsythia by PCR using 16S rRNA bacterial-specificprimers.

In the remaining 12 weeks of polybacterial infection 19th week of infection 7 out of 12 infected mice and 5 out of 12 mice were also positive for P. gingivalis and T. denticola respectively Table .

In addition T. forsythia was colonized and induced significant IgM antibodies even though the gingival plaque samples were not positive below threshold levels or due to difficulty in plaque sampling for genomic DNA.Alveolar bone resorptionThe progression of PD resulting from polymicrobial infection was examined by measuring the area between CEJ and ABC on buccal and palatal surfaces of the molars to analyze the effects of polymicrobial infection.
