Furthermore whereas preterm formulas improve neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to term formulas and unfortified donor milk they do not produce neurodevelopmental outcomes better than fortified human milk again indicating that maternal milk has unique properties that formulas need to mimic as closely as possible.c 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.IntroductionPreterm formulas were developed to meet the relatively high protein energy and mineral requirements that were considered necessary to support a rate of growth in the preterm very low birth weight VLBW infant that would approximate that of the normal healthy growing fetus in the third trimester of intrauterine life .

The whey- dominant preterm formulas also produce plasma free amino acidconcentrations that are more similar to those produced by human milk than the casein formulas .The protein content of standard preterm formulas is consider- ably higher than term formulas or supplemented milks providing as much as 3.5 gkgd at 150 mLkgd enteral feeding volumes considered necessary to meet the intrauterine protein accretion rate  .

Numerous studies and extensive practice have shown improved growth with preterm formulas but there is concern for increased risks of necrotizing enterocolitis possibly from cow milk antigen in the formulas or from different gut microbiomes increased duration of total parenteral nutrition and increased rates of sepsis in infants receiving preterm formulas.

Such formulas contain more protein 2.4 g100 mL or 3 g100 kcal energy 68e100 kcal100 mL calcium 133e146 mg100 mL or 165e180 mg100 kcal and phosphorus 67e81 mg100 mL or 83e100 mg100 kcal than standard formulas for term infants.The fat source in the newer preterm formulas is a blend of vegetable oils but also contains between 10 and 50 medium chain triglycerides MCTs.

Numerous studies and at least two Cochrane reviews have documented improved growth with preterm formulas  but there is concern for increased risks of NEC  possibly from cow milk antigen in the formulas or from different gut microbiomes increased duration of TPN  and increased rates of sepsis in infants receiving preterm formulas .

Newer generations of high-protein preterm formulas containing 2.7e2.9 g100 mL or 3.3e3.6 g100 kcal and providing up to 4.5 gkgd of protein are indicated for preterm ELBW and VLBW infants who are not growing well have experienced a large cumulative deficit of protein intake have inadequate growth in length andor head circumference or who are fluidvolume restricted .Preterm formulas also are designed with much higher contentsof sodium and potassium to compensate for renal losses charac- teristic of preterm infants with limited renal solute conservation capacity.

Most micronutrients are adequately provided by preterm formulas but the 1.8 mg100 kcal of iron contained in many preterm formulas might not be sufficient for rapidly growing preterm infants who are not transfused .

Despite the higher mineral and vitamin con- tents of preterm formulas most products have relatively safe os- molalities from 210 to 220 mOsmL at 20 kcaloz up to 250e270 mOsmL at 24 kcaloz.Experience with preterm formulasBy the 1990s several studies documented a variety of improved outcomes resulting from use of preterm formulas .

Milk fortifiers also have been asso- ciated with mild metabolic acidosis and growth failure e. Metabolic acidosis and growth failure have not been documented in preterm VLBW infants fed modern preterm formulas .With these new formulations there have been surprisingly fewstudies that have measured plasma amino acid concentrations in preterm VLBW infants receiving the preterm formulas with protein delivery rates of 3.5e4.0 gkgd.
