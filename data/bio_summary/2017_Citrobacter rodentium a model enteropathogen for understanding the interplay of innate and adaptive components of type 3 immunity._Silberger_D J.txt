These data suggest that the increased production of IL-21 observed upon perturbation to the intestinal microbiota such as in patients with inflammatory bowel disease IBD and mice treated with DSS might reflect a compensatory mechanism to restore homeostasis in the intestine however whether IL-21 regulates the composition of the intestinal microbiota has not been directly examined97-99.Future prospects for tracking Type 3 immunity in the C. rodentium infection modelA shortcoming of the C. rodentium infection model is the lack of antigen-specific tools with which to track the fate and function of the pathogen-specific CD4 T cells and B cells during infection.

Adopting this strategy or a similar one to study antigen-specific T cell responses during C. rodentium infection would greatly improve our understanding of the C. rodentium-specific CD4 T cell subsets that develop during enteropathogenic infection and their overlapping and distinct functions relative to ILC3s.

Finally without better methods for tracking clonal populations of CD4 T cells and B cells during C. rodentium infection it is difficult to understand how and where antigen-specific Th17 cells transition into Th1 cells during infection and the roles played by each in host defense.Ideally the utilization of C. rodentium strains that express model antigens should eventually be supplemented with additional reagents to track pathogen-specific lymphocytes based upon the endogenous antigens of this bacterium.

In view of the initial findings that implicate an important role for NCR- ILC3s early in infection these observations imply that NCR- ILC3s might be more critical to early host protection prior to the development of IL-22-producing CD4 T cells.In a study that used an intimin deficient strain of C. rodentium that cannot attach to the epithelium it was demonstrated that the production of IL-22 by ILC3s is triggered by the presence of luminal C. rodentium whereas the production of IL-17 by CD4 T cells requires epithelial attachment24 Fig.

This suggests that ILC3s reside in ILFs and are the predominant producers of IL-22 early in infection whereas CD4 T cells are recruited to the lamina propria and dominate later.Interestingly IL-22 expression by CD4 T cells was initially greater in the colonic lamina propria than in the mesenteric lymph nodes66 suggesting that either the programming for IL-22 production by T cells is completed only after migration from the draining lymph nodes to the mucosa or that induction of T cell priming might occur locally in the colonic mucosa.

While relative contributions of these populations to protection against C. rodentium infection have been debated here we summarize recent findings and promote the concept of integrated type 3 immunity that requires the interplay of IL-22-producing ILC3s and CD4 T cells3260 which appear to have both redundant and non-redundant functions.Silberger et al.Page 5Spatiotemporal control of the interplay between IL-22-producing innate and adaptive lymphocytes during C. rodentium infectionILC3s Th17 cells and Th22 cells share several phenotypic and developmental attributes6162.

In fact the only study to examine the antigen- specific CD4 T cell response to C. rodentium infection used the OVA-expressing strain to demonstrate OVA-specific Th1 cells enhance IgG1 antibodies to C. rodentium56.

CD4 T cells tend to initially produce IL-17A and IL-22 in response to C. rodentium infection but as infection progresses IFN-g production and epithelial damage increase along with a reduction in the number of goblet cells305859.

Using this model it was found that IL-22- producing CD4 T cells expanded during infection and were an abundant source of IL-22 after day 5 of infection consistent with previous results12 whereas ILCs and gdT cells produced IL-22 earlier in infection but did not expand59.

Collectively these cytokines provide critical signals for the activation of effector functions from innate and adaptive lymphocytes during enteropathogenic infection.Adaptive immune response to C. rodentiumStudies of the immune response to C. rodentium have shown that CD4 T cells and B cells are necessary for the clearance of this enteropathogen but CD8 T cells are dispensable49.
