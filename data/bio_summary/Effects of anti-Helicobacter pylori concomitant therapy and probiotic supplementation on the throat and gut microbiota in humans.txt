pylori using triple therapy can result in increased antibiotic resistance of the gut microbiota e.in this study we investigated for the first time the effects of a popular concomitant therapy on the composition of the gut and throat microbiota as well as the antibiotic resistance induced by this therapy.

when the bacterial populations among the three groups were compared no significant differences were noted throughout the study period.alterations of the antibiotic resistance in the gut and throat microbiotathe antibiotic resistance rates of the gut  and throat  microbiota were both markedly affected by concomitant therapy.

in group a the amoxicillin resistance rate of enterobacteriaceae was significantly higher at day 15 whereas in group b the clarithromycin resistance rate of bacteroides spp.

this may partly explain the restoration of antibiotic resistance rates from day 15 to day 71.taken together our results show that concomitant therapy is generally effective and well-tolerated despite its detrimental acute effects as well as its minor long-term effects on the gut and throat microbiota regarding both the composition and the development of antibiotic resistance.

this study aimed to investigate the effects of a commonly used anti- helicobacter pylori concomitant therapy on the composition of the gut and throat microbiota and any antibiotic resistance that may develop.

microbiological culture-based techniques were used to analyse the microbiota composition and antibiotic resistance.

we also detected higher antibiotic resistance rates for enterobacteriaceae enterococcus spp.

studies have shown that concomitant therapy can cause diarrhoea nauseavomiting and even clostridium difficile infection the pri- mary pathogen of antibiotic-induced pseudomembranous colitis .the primary mechanism of these adverse events is thought to be impaired resistance to pathogens due to disruption of the micro- biota especially the gut microbiota and subsequent changes in the metabolism.

the most suitable species duration and dosage is the focus of researchers.in addition to the adverse events scientists have been studying antibiotic resistance which is another by-product that can manifest from eradication therapy.

the detection limit was 102 cfug wet faeces or 102 cfuml diluent.antibiotic susceptibility testsamoxicillin resistance was determined for enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus spp.

clarithromycin resistance was tested in enterococcus and bacteroides spp.

the antibiotic resistance rate was defined as the number of the colonies per plates infused with antibiotics divided by the number of colonies on plates without antibiotics and multiplied by 100.statistical analysisstatistical analyses were performed using spss version 21 spss inc. chicago il usa.
