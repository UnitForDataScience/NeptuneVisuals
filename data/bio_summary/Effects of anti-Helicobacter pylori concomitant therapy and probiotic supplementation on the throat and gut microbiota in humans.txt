pylori using triple therapy can result in increased antibiotic resistance of the gut microbiota e.In this study we investigated for the first time the effects of a popular concomitant therapy on the composition of the gut and throat microbiota as well as the antibiotic resistance induced by this therapy.

in the throat were detected in any of the groups.DiscussionThe Maastricht VFlorence Consensus Report clearly states that in regions with high clarithromycin resistance bismuth-containing quadruple therapy sequential treatment or concomitant therapy a non-bismuth quadruple therapy is recommended as a first-line empirical treatment for H. pylori infection .

Patients treated with the eradication therapy in the absence of probiotic sup- plementation experienced the most pronounced disturbances in the throat microbiota whereas changes in the throat microbiota appeared to stabilize in the groups that received probiotic supple- mentation.

Since no new drugs have been developed for this indication it was proposed that three antibiotics amoxicillin clarithromycin and either metronidazole or tinidazole should be administered simultaneously with a PPI a regimen known as concomitant therapy or non-bismuth quadruple therapy .However long-term and high-dose administration of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics can cause several adverse events.

However to the best of our knowledge there are no reports regarding the effects of the concomitant therapy on the composition of the indigenous microbiota.In view of the proposed underlying pathogenesis the use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy in H. pylori eradication to reduce adverse events and avoid complications has been extensively studied but its role is still debated e. Additionally the optimal supplementation i.e.

Group A did not receive any probiotic therapy Group B was provided probiotic sa- chets BIOFLORr Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745r Biocodex Inc 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks from Day 15 to Day 28 and Group C received the same probiotic sachets for 2 weeks but ingested them from Day 1 to Day 14 at least 2 h after adminis- tration of antibiotic therapy.

All other probiotic products were forbidden during the intervention 2 or 4 weeks as well as during the follow-up period 6 or 8 weeks.A throat swab and a faecal sample were collected from each patient one day before the concomitant therapy Day 0 and one day Day 15 and eight weeks Day 71 after completing the concomitant therapy.

Although three an- tibiotics are included in the concomitant therapy the tolerance and safety of this regimen are satisfactory and elicit a higher eradication rate than that of the standard triple therapy .
