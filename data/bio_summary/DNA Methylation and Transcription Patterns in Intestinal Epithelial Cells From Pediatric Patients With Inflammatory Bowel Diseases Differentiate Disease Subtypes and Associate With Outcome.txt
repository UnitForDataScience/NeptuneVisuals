Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis WGCNA was applied to gene expression and DNAm data for each diagnosis CD and UC by gut segment to correlate omics datasets with clinical phenotypic variables.ResultsDNA Methylation and Gene Expression Profiling of Purified Intestinal Epithelium Reveals Gut Segment-specific and Disease-associated AlterationsTo investigate IEC pathophysiology in pediatric IBD we first performed unsupervised analysis of genome-wide DNAm gene expression and 16S microbial profiles gener- ated from a total of 170 samples A and .

One example of an rDMR that jointly affects CD and UC in the colon is BACH2 D a transcription regulator where a decrease in DNAm matched the increase in gene expres- sion levels in both CD and UC patients.

RNAseq data was processed using established workflows.Microbiota composition analysis was performed using QIIME and phylo- seq.Differential analysis was performed using limmafor DNAm data false discovery rate FDR 0.01 and DESeq2 for gene expression data FDR 0.01 and log fold change-0.5.

Results showed that a majority of the differentiallymethylated positions DMPs between CD or UC and con- trols are primarily driven by diagnostic status and not inflammation FDR 0.01 B and C. Similarly diagnosis explained 74 and 82 of the differentially expressed genes DEGs for CD and UC respectively D and E.Additionally generating MDS plots by labelling samples according to gut segment diagnosis and inflammatory sta- tus did not show a clear separation between inflamed and non-inflamed samples Supplementary Figure S1.

When performing these analyses inflammation was controlled for within the differential analysis thereby allowing us to focus onA1009080706050403020100B CD DNAmC UC DNAmUC vs. Control- log10  q-value D CD RNAseqE UC RNAseqFigure 2.

However analysis of the bacterial operational taxonomic unit by family abun- dance and alpha-diversity did reveal variation by gut segment Supplementary Figure 2 and reduction in species diversity for CD patients Supplementary Figure 2.Taken together initial unsupervised analysis of genome- wide intestinal epithelial profiles reveals highly gut segment-specific signatures and suggests disease-associated alterations of DNAm and gene expression.Disease-specific Alterations in IEC Epigenetic and Transcriptional Profiles are Partly Independent of Inflammation StatusGiven the distinct clustering patterns we observed on a genome-wide scale we next used a variance component model to assess the relative contribution of diagnosis and inflammation to the observed variance within each data layer by gut segment.

The application of WGCNA to RNAseq data derived from the TI of CD pa- tients led to the identification of several gene modules ie groups of genes that correlate significantly correlation-0.6 P  .05 with a number of disease outcome measures including the requirement for treatment with biologics and number of treatment escalations within the first 18 months following diagnosis C. Interestingly modules correlating with disease outcome measures did not show any correlation with gender age or disease phenotype at diagnosis eg abdominal pain diarrhea and Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index.

Bii Receiver operator characteristic ROC curve for the best model separating CD from UC using ileal IEC DNAm data.

Therefore a diagnostic model to reliably differentiate CD from UC such as the model built using DNAm data from the ileum with high sensitivity and spec- ificity could be of clinical value.

Furthermore variations of cell type-specific molecular profiles amongst IBD patients may be indicative of disease sub-phenotype and could therefore help toAuthors share co-first authorship SSAuthors share co-senior authorship.Abbreviations used in this paper AC ascending colon AUC area under the curve CD Crohn's disease DMP differentially methylated position DEG differentially expressed gene DMR differentially methylated region DNAm DNA methylation FDR false discovery rate IBD inflammatory bowel disease IEC intestinal epithelial cell MDS multidimensional scaling rDMR regulatory DMR ROC receiver operator characteristic SC sigmoid colon TI terminal ileum UC ulcerative colitis WGCNA Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis.Most current articlec 2018 by the AGA Institute.
