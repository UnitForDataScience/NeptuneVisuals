importantly the use of ileal dnam datasets allowed separation between cd and uc with high precision 77 sensitivity 57 and specificity 93 auc 0.92 cv 24 b. the accuracy of the ti dnam signatures in distinguishing cd and uc was confirmed in a follow-up patient cohort analyzed using a second dnam array platform illumina epic array see and supplementary figure 8. full details of the models including auc sensitivity and specificity can be found in supplementary table 15. in contrast models built using the ibd risk loci from our patient genotyping data yielded the lowest model score auc 0.49 ai.to correlate genome-wide iec profiles with clinical outcome measures including binary numerical and cate- gorical parameters we used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis wgcna approach.

furthermore variations of cell type-specific molecular profiles amongst ibd patients may be indicative of disease sub-phenotype and could therefore help toauthors share co-first authorship ssauthors share co-senior authorship.abbreviations used in this paper ac ascending colon auc area under the curve cd crohn's disease dmp differentially methylated position deg differentially expressed gene dmr differentially methylated region dnam dna methylation fdr false discovery rate ibd inflammatory bowel disease iec intestinal epithelial cell mds multidimensional scaling rdmr regulatory dmr roc receiver operator characteristic sc sigmoid colon ti terminal ileum uc ulcerative colitis wgcna weighted gene co-expression network analysis.most current articlec 2018 by the aga institute.

one example of an rdmr that jointly affects cd and uc in the colon is bach2 d a transcription regulator where a decrease in dnam matched the increase in gene expres- sion levels in both cd and uc patients.

although a number of genes were found to be differentially expressed between ibd and control samples eg defa5 defa6 lyz pla2g2a cd40 cd44 none of the marker genes corre- lated with inflammatory status suggesting minimal impact of epithelial cell composition and immune cell contamina- tion on the observed disease-specific molecular changes supplementary figure s4.in summary these analyses demonstrate the presence of clear epigenetic transcriptomic and adjacent microbial alterations in the intestinal epithelium of children newly diagnosed with ibd with a proportion being independent of intestinal inflammation.differential methylation analysis reveals disease-specific signatures that affect gene transcriptionnext we performed differential dnam and gene expression analyses by comparing control cd- and uc-derived datasets for each gut segment.

however analysis of the bacterial operational taxonomic unit by family abun- dance and alpha-diversity did reveal variation by gut segment supplementary figure 2 and reduction in species diversity for cd patients supplementary figure 2.taken together initial unsupervised analysis of genome- wide intestinal epithelial profiles reveals highly gut segment-specific signatures and suggests disease-associated alterations of dnam and gene expression.disease-specific alterations in iec epigenetic and transcriptional profiles are partly independent of inflammation statusgiven the distinct clustering patterns we observed on a genome-wide scale we next used a variance component model to assess the relative contribution of diagnosis and inflammation to the observed variance within each data layer by gut segment.

specific to the gi tract the intestinal microbiota adds further complexity because it has been shown to influence cellular function of the intestinal epithelium both in health and ibd.given the wide range of phenotypes and diversespectrum of disease behavior within the conditions we currently label as cd and uc we urgently require novel molecular signatures to allow better classification of clini- cally relevant disease entities.here we applied a multi-omics profiling approach to a highly purified iec sample set obtained from a prospectivelyrecruited treatment-naive pediatric patient cohort.

moreover samples derived from controls clustered closely both on an epigenetic dnamtable 1. summary of patients samples and generated datasetsac ascending colon cd crohn's disease sc sigmoid colon ti terminal ileum uc ulcerative colitis.and transcriptomic level for each gut segment.

similar results were obtained from uc patient-derived signatures in sc samples supplementary figure 9. finally comparing annotated genes from the top modules identified in rnaseq and dnam datasets revealed an overlap of 57 and 79 respectively suggesting that expression signatures might be in part underpinned by stable epigenetic changes f. based on these pre- liminary results both dnam and rnaseq data contain sig- natures that accurately predict disease status and correlate with selected disease outcome parameters.discussionsubstantial evidence suggests that impaired function of the intestinal epithelium plays a major role in ibd patho- genesis.
