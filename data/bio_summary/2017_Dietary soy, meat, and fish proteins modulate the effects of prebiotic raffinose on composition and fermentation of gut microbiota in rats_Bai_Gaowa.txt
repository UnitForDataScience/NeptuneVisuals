perfringens group changes due to raf feeding were different between rats fed soy protein and rats fed other proteins.the dgge and pcoa analyses clearly demon- strated the effects of raf on caecum microbiota soy protein-fed meat protein-fed and fish protein-fed rats formed the same group if they were given raf  and  bands for uncultured bacterium bands 6 and 8 disappeared whereas those for bifidobacterium pseudolongum band 9 and ruminococcus sp.

bands indicating the differences between soy meat and fish in rats given cel were ruminococcus bromii band 11 uncultured bacterium band 13 and murimonasintestini band 20 which were faint in soy protein- fed rats compared with meat protein-fed and fish pro- tein-fed rats.discussionthe increase in the caecum acetic acid concentration caused by raf was similar to that in our previous study bai et al.
