Note that the Dirichlet-tree multinomial regression reduces to the Dirichlet multinomial regression when the tree is a comb tree that is the root node of the tree is the only internal node see Figure 1 for illustration.

Typically the most abundant sequence in an OTU is chosen as the representative sequence and representative sequences from all the OTUs are used to construct a phylogenetic tree among all the OTUs andor to map OTUs to a taxonomic reference database Schloss et al.

We can see that the incorporation of the tree structure helped improve the prediction accuracy.To see how dietary nutrients affected bacterial taxa we set g  0.25 and concentrated on two genera Bacteroides and Prevetella that were previously used to define enterotypes of the human gut microbiome Arumugam et al.

We believe our method of coupling l1 and l2 regularizations with the Dirichlet-tree multinomial model would provide a useful data analysis tool for associating covariates such as dietary nutrients with multivariate over-dispersed and tree-structured count data such as taxa counts.In the literature several schemes have been proposed to take advantage of the tree structure over either the covariates or responses see for example Zhao et al.

In the real data example the tree is learned from 16S rRNA sequences using a fast and approximate maximumWang and ZhaoPage 13likelihood method Price et al.

Indeed tree mis-specification could be a major risk for shotgun sequencing data Matsen et al.

Assuming that the relationships among components of the count vector can be represented as a tree the generalized distribution encodes the tree structure node-by-node as detailed in the next section.

But robustness against tree mis-specification could be a concern since both tree topology and branch lengths are exploited.

Researchers have found that changes in the human microbiota are associated with a number of pathological states such as obesity and inflammatory bowel disease Clemente et al.

It has also been found that microbiota populations are sensitive to genetic and environmental influences Spor et al.
