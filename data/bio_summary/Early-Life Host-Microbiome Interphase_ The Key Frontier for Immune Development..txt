The objective of our review is to highlight the interaction of host immune ontogeny with the developing microbiome in early life as a critical window of susceptibility for lifelong disease as well as to identify the enormous potential to protect and promote lifelong health by specifically targeting this window of opportunity.Keywords microbiome immunity and infections ontogeny immune diseases probioticsiNTRODUCTiONA key function of the immune system is to interact with and respond to the environment .

While the role of SFB or similar bacteria in the neonatal period has yet to be defined one survey of SFB abundance across species and ages found SFB to colonize humans by 2 years of age but could no longer be found after the third year of life suggesting a possible early-life restricted colonization for these bacteria in humans .While much of the necessary detailed knowledge is still amiss current data clearly support the notion that perturbations of microbiota in the early-life imprint the host immune phenotype for a long time maybe lifetime and can manifest as immune- mediated disease later in life.

However given that 10-30 of women in North America are colonized with GBS and receive IAP during labor   there has been a surprising lack of effort to address long-term effects of IAP on immune development and the health of their offspring.eARLY POSTNATAL eveNTS DRAMATiCALLY ALTeR THe MiCROBiOMe wiTH iMPACT ON LONG- TeRM HeALTH OUTCOMeS BUT A CAUSATive ROLe OF iMMUNe CHANGeS iN THiS ReMAiNS UNeXPLOReDFeeding mode breast vs. formula as well as antibiotic exposure during the neonatal period here defined as up to day of life 28 have clearly been linked to changes in microbiota  their causal relationship to immune development and clinical outcome have surprisingly not been well delineated .Feeding ModeDifferences in the microbiota of BF and formula-fed FF infants were first reported nearly 100 years ago with compounds in breast milk found to promote the growth of Bifidobacteria this bifidus factor is now recognized as human milk oligosaccha- rides .

One of the first detailed longitudinal surveys of the intestinal microbiota in its first year of postnatal development found a rapidly changing succession of bacterial taxa beginning with aerobes such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus in the first week of life that soon are replaced by obligate anaerobes like Prevotella and Veillonella which then continue to feature prominently into adult life .

For example human CD newborns harbor fewer IgA IgG and IgM-secreting cells throughout the first year of life  as well as lower levels of Th1-supporting chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL11  lower levels of IFNg and IL-8 and lower CD4 T-cell responses to tetanus toxoid  over the first 2 years of life.

The highest-powered study compared 35 IAP to 49 control infants at days of life 7 and 30 using quantitative PCR for select bacterial taxa finding fecal bac- terial counts of Bifidobacterium alone were reduced at day of life 7 only while Lactobacillus and Bacteroides were unaffected at any time .

Only one other group has described alterations of the microbiota due to IAP and did so for a cohort of Canadian infants receiving IAP either for GBS prophylaxis or CD and compared their microbiota at 3 months and 1 year of life finding that IAP was also associated with lower Bacteroides as well as lower levelsof Parabacteroides but higher Enterococcus and Clostridium levels at 3 months of life among both vaginally and cesarean delivered infants .

For exam-ple BF is associated with lower risk for eczema and recurrent wheeze in first year of life  with exclusive BF for 4 months associated with reduced risk for asthma up to 8 years of age  and in another study breastfeeding for less than 4 months was associated with increased corticosteroid-treated wheezing episodes in the first year of life .
