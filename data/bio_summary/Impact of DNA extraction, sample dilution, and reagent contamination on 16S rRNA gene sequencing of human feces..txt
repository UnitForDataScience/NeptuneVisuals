In our case samples with as low as 2 mg of feces allowed obtaining both high num- bers of 16S rRNA gene reads and a representation of the gut microbiota similar to that obtained with samples with 100 times more biomass.Our results are particularly relevant now that multiple calls for the standardization of procedures have been made in the microbial ecology community Alivisatos et al.

Among them the acquisition of genetic material has been shown to be a critical step on which multiple biases can be Juan S.

This limited effect of dilution in the inferred gut microbial community isunexpected since previous reports demonstrated that sam- ples with low microbial biomass basically amplify contam- inating DNA Salter et al.

At the genus level the pattern was variable among samples among the most abundant genera more reads from Blautia Coprococcus unclassified Lachnospiraceae and Collinsella were obtained with MoBio whereas Oscillospira and unclassified Ruminococcaceae were overrepresented with Qiagen Online Resource 4.In terms of alpha-diversity the analysis of the subset of undiluted samples D0 indicated that most of the microbes of these samples were captured in our sequencing Online Resource 5.

Here we assess the sequencing yield composition and diversity of the gut microbiota studied from human fecal samples which were serially diluted and processed using two commercially available DNA extraction kits to determine the impact of DNA extraction initial sample biomass and reagent contamination on the evaluation of this microbial community using the 16S rRNA gene as marker.Materials and methodsDNA extraction serial dilutions and 16S rRNA gene sequencingMicrobial DNA was obtained from fecal samples from five human donors Online Resource 1.

The question of how to address comparisons between studies and meta- analyses remains open however the fact that measure- ments between samples extracted with different kits can be statistically significant strengthens the idea that compar- isons between studies that employed different extraction methods should be discouraged Henderson et al.

Biases introduced during DNA extraction can result in erro- neous representations of the microbial community particular- ly in samples with low microbial biomass.

To be conservative in a given study total microbial DNA should be extracted with the same kit ideally the same kit lot and caution must be taken when comparing data from different studies.Importantly we demonstrate that highly diluted samples exhibit a microbial community profile distinguishable in most cases from that of laboratory reagents.

Although samples with such low biomass are unsuitable for robust microbial inference and unrealis- tic in most study designs their microbial signature is still distinguishable from that of laboratory reagents especially looking at the presenceabsence of data.

MicrobiomeIntroductionAdvancements in culture-independent methods have granted the possibility to study microbial diversity with unprecedented detail revolutionizing our understanding of life on Earth Brazelton et al.
