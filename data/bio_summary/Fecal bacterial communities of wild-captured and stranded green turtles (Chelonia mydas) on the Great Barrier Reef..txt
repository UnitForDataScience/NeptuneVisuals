The marked differences in the bacterial communities between wild-captured and stranded turtles suggest the possible dysbiosis in stranded turtles in addition to potential causal agents.Keywords green turtle Chelonia mydas gut microbiota bacterial diversity dysbiosis Great Barrier ReefINTRODUCTIONIn both vertebrates and invertebrates it is now well recognized that the gut microbiome plays a vital role in maintaining thehost's health as well as in a wide range of diseases Backhed et al.

The wild free- ranging green turtles n  8 were captured from Edgecumbe Bay Bowen Lat 2007I55II S and Long 14823I14II E and Cockle Bay Townsville Lat 1940I34.32II S Long 14649I51.6II E. Edge- cumbe Bay is a coastal embayment near the township of Bowen which supports large patches of seagrass foraging areas along the fringe of the bay and an approximately 200 m2 coral reef habitat Jensen et al.

The higher abundance of Peptostreptococcus within the GI tract of stranded green turtles may indicate possible opportunistic infection as many Peptostreptococcus species are recorded as causing clinical infections in marine mammals and humans Murphy and Frick  Nielsen et al.

The genus Pseu- domonas is one of the top three causes of opportunistic infections in humans and was in higher abundance in stranded green tur- tles Stover et al.

Map showing the sampling locations highlighted in the central Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Queensland Australia.Our study first characterized in detail the fecal bacterial communities of wild-captured green turtles from different geo- graphical locations including Bowen and Townsville and com- pared these bacterial communities with those encountered in stranded green turtles with unknown illness.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample collections from free-ranging and stranded green turtles were made under permit from the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection Authority permit no.
