Indeed patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases have a high rate of gastrointestinal comorbidities and it has be proposed by some the management of the gut micro- biota may prevent or alleviate the symptoms of these chronic diseases.Keywords Gut microbiota  Probiotics  Gut-brain-axis Neurodegeneration  Oxidative stress Short-chain fatty acidsThe gut microbiota and the gut-brain axisThe gut microbiota is composed of a vast plethora of bacterial species residing within the gastrointestinal tract GIT.

This article describes several possible mechanisms of gut-brain axis communi- cation and how manipulation of the gut microbiota with probiotics can influence neurodegenerative diseases by improving inflammatory markers modulating neurological signaling and reducing the levels of oxidative stress the main common features of idiopathic neurodegeneration.The gut microbiotaThe gut microbiota consists of a diverse community of bacterial species in the GIT existing symbiotically with the human host.

There are high inter-individual variations in the gut microbial populations however the overall functionality is conserved suggesting that a core gut microbiota is required to maintain a basic set of physiological functions .

There are three main modes of communi- cation between the gut and the brain namely 1 neuronal messages carried by vagal afferents 2 endocrine mes- sages carried by gut hormones and 3 immune messages carried by cytokines   Fig.

The gut microbiota plays a key role in the activation of microglia  and it has been suggested that manipulation of the gut microbiome especially with short- chain fatty acid SCFA-producing bacteria could modu- late neuroimmune activation  .

Several comprehensive reviews have been written on this topic      so further elaboration will not be done here.Age-related changes in the gut microbiota observed in neurodegenerative diseasesAging is associated with clear shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota.

In general there is a loss of gut microbial diversity in the aging gut  .

Nonetheless there are clear connections between a disrupted gut microbiota and the pathology of AD that could be targeted with probiotic and prebiotictherapy to alleviate its underlying symptoms.The influence of gut microbiota gut-brain axis and probiotics in neurodegenerative diseaseThere are many interlocking hormonal and biochemical pathways relating the health of the GIT to the brain cre- ating a strong therapeutic potential for the use of probiotics against neurodegeneration.

Further there is a clear correlation between ghrelin and the compo- sition of the gut microbiota in rats under various nutritional statuses and levels of physical activity indicating the influ- ence of gut microbiota dynamics on ghrelin secretion .
