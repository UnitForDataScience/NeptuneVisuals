To test whether the composition of the vaginal oral and gut microbiome at 8-14 and 24-30 weeks is associated with the occurrence of preterm early term or full term birth considered as dichotomized categorical variables and whether specific biobehavioral factors interact with the microbiome composition to influence the risk of early term or preterm birth For bivariate as- sociation analyses we will perform two sample t-test Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test to assess whether the percent- age with a particular type of predominant microbes and the Shannon species diversity index of the vaginal oral and gut microbiome are associated with the occurrence of early term or preterm birth.

To date however far fewer studies have investi- gated other inhabited environments only one study to date has reported on the oral microbiome using RNA sequencing rather than culture-based methods during gestation and only three on the gut microbiome in preg- nancy  with outcomes from these latter studies conflicting.The aims of this study are to 1 Characterize the struc- ture and dynamics of the vaginal oral and gut micro- biome of African American women in early and later pregnancy by 16S rRNA gene sequencing 2 Identify biobehavioral factors including stress hygiene and risk and protective behaviors that influence the structure and dynamics of the vaginal oral and gut microbiome and 3 Evaluate whether the composition of the vaginal oral and gut microbiome in early andor later pregnancy is associ- ated with birth outcomes including gestational age of the infant at birth.

Biological data collected at both prenatal visits include blood samples for measure- ment of serum cytokines self-collected vaginal oral and rectal swab samples for microbiome analyses self- collected vaginal swabs for pH Gram stain for Nugent's criteria and vaginal cytokines.

According to the 2017 National Vital Statistics Reports African American women face a nearly 50 greater risk of preterm birth 37 completed weeks of gestation compared to whiteCorrespondence 1Emory University School of Nursing 1520 Clifton Rd Atlanta GA 30322 USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the articlewomen 13.2 vs 8.9 a difference in risk that doubles 4.8 vs 2.4 when considering early preterm birth born  34 completed weeks' of gestation.

Faced with this continuing challenge clinical and scientific attention has increasingly focused on gaining a better understanding of the underlying biobehavioral mechanisms by which the multiple complex and often inter-related social biological and behavioral risk factors disproportionately experienced by African American families link to adverse birth out- comes including preterm birth.

Post- delivery medical record abstraction is detailed for birth outcome gestational age birth weight size-for-age delivery type and complications.Socio-demographic and psychosocial measuresThe following socio-demographic and psychosocial mea- sures are completed at the identified visits.Socio-demographic Survey 8-14 weeks is com- pleted using self-report and prenatal administrative rec- ord review to gather information on age years of education marital status and insurance status.

This possibility is especially compelling given that microbiome functions associate with one or more of the known risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes including programming and maintenance of the immune system and protection against infection  the physical and emotional response to acute and chronic stress  harvesting of micronutrients and the digestion and metabolism of food  and the breakdown and absorption of toxins .Support for a potential role of the microbiome in in- fluencing birth outcomes comes from recent reports showing that the dominant vaginal microbiome commu- nities present in non-pregnant African American women differ significantly from those present in white women .

This is not unexpected given the potential for microorganisms colonizing the vagina to ascend into the uterine cavity and the recognition that the most common cause of spontaneous preterm birth is infection Nevertheless the possibility of cross-contamination of bacteria from the oral or gut environments to the vagina uterus or placenta either through hematogenous spread or from direct colonization via oral vaginal or anal intercourse or for the gut microbiome via cross-contamination after defecation emphasizes the need for further investiga- tion.

For multivariable ana- lyses we will use logistic regression to model the occur- rence of early term or preterm birth in relation to the composition of the vaginal oral and gut microbiome at 8-14 weeks and 24-30 weeks while controlling for po- tential confounding risk factors.

Diversity of the vaginal Microbiome correlates with preterm birth.
