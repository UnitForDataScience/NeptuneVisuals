In vivo anti-USA300 activity of probiotic PEG-DMA hydrogels The probiotic PEG-DMA hydrogels a circle with a diam- eter of 0.8 cm were constructed by encapsulating S. epi- dermidis ATCC12228 108 CFU in hydrogels comprising 10 PEG-DMA 0.001 APS and 0.1 TEMED in phenolred-free rich media.

F abrication of S. epidermidis-laden PEG-DMA hydrogelsHydrogels were formed by mixing 10 PEG-DMA or acrylamide Promega corporation Madison WI with 0.001 ammonium persulfate APS Promega and 0.1 tetramethylethylenediamine TEMED in 500 mL TBS con- taining phenol red 0.002 wv.

S1 a significant decrease in the values of both pH and OD560 was detected when S. epidermidis but not USA300 was cultured in the presence of PEG-DMA indicating the PEG-DMA fermentation of S. epidermidis occurs.

2 the colonies of USA300 with solid media supplemented with PEG-DMA are much less than those in solid media supplemented with no PEG-DMA.

Identification of SCFAs produced by PEG-DMA fermentation by GC-MSTo identify the SCFAs in the ferments the S. epidermidis bacteria were incubated in phenol red-free rich media in the presence or absence of 2 PEG-DMA for two days.

I nhibition of USA300 growth by S. epidermidis- laden PEG-DMA hydrogels PEG-DMA has been used as a biomaterial for creation of hydrogels 19.

To assess the capability of PEG-DMA for encapsulate the S. epidermidis PEG-DMA mixed with APS and TEMED was used to suspend the S. epidermidis ATCC12228 bacteria.

5B can utilize the PEG-DMA as a carbon source for fermentation PEG-DMA or acrylamide hydrogels were suspended withwithout the S. epider- midis for two days in the presence of phenol red.

5A the color change of phenol red from red-orange to yellow was observed in S. epidermidis-lad- en PEG-DMA but not acrylamide hydrogels demonstrat- ing the probiotic activities of S. epidermidis-laden PEG- DMA hydrogels.To evaluate the probiotic activities of PEG-DMA hydrogels in vivo the USA300-infected skin wounds in the dorsal skin of ICR mice were covered by the PEG- DMA hydrogels with or without S. epidermidis encapsula- tion for 24 h Fig.

6B the number 7.5 - 1.2 x 105 CFU of USA300 bacteria in the wound covered by a PEG-DMA hydrogel with S. epidermidis was significantly less than that 5.0 - 1.5 x 106 CFU in the wound covered by a PEG-DMA hydrogel without S. epi- dermidis.
