the four CTs each determined by the CCG propensity to share the same gut environment and each conferring to the host a specific pattern of CAZymes.In order to explore possible associations of these CTs with the host diet and health we explored their variation in Italian healthy adults consuming a Mediterranean diet and obese T2D patients consuming a high-fat low-MACs diet.

In this scenario the dietary polysaccharides that are metabolically available to gut microbes have been specifically defined as microbiota-accessible carbohydrates MACs    and their abundance in the host diet and consequently their availability within the gut has proved to be crucial for microbiota-host homeostasis.The MAC availability in the host diet is among the aspects that have deeply changed in recent human evolutionary history with the transition from Paleolithic hunting-gathering to Neolithic rural populations and contemporary Westernized societies        .

Our study highlighted the existence of robust clusters of bacterial species sharing a common MAC degradation profile in the Italian GM allowing the stratification of the individual GM into different steady states according to the carbohydrate degradation profile with possible connections with diet and health.Keywords gut microbiota microbiota-accessible carbohydrates CAZymes co-abundance groups type 2 diabetesINTRODUCTIONThe large ensemble of bacteria that stably inhabit the distal part of our gastrointestinal tract namely the gut microbiota GM is of vital importance for many physiological functions of our organism exerting a key role in several biological processes such as nutrition immune function and the regulation of the central nervous system         .

In this scenario here we explore the GM-encoded CAZyme repertoire across two Italian adult cohorts including healthy lean subjects consuming a Mediterranean diet and obese patients affected by type 2 diabetes consuming a high-fat diet.

Interestingly CT2 and CT4 were more represented in healthy individuals consuming a Mediterranean diet while CT1 and CT3 occurred with higher frequency in obese T2D patients consuming a high-fat low-MACs diet.

Conversely a higher abundance of these two CCGs was found in T2D patients 18 out of 40.DISCUSSIONOur work aimed at characterizing the frame of the CAZyme variation in the GM meta-community from 56 Italian subjects of whom 16 were healthy lean adults consuming a standard Mediterranean diet   and 40 were obese T2D patients consuming a high-fat low-MACs diet   .

On the contrary the CTs 1 and 3 that were associated with T2D and a high-fat low-MACs diet may result from a maladaptive microbiome-host process in which this type of diet has led to the selection of CT steady states able to contribute to metabolic andor immunological deregulation.

Indeed the steady states CTs 2 and 4 that were generally associated with healthy hosts seem to be the result of an adaptive microbiome- host co-evolution process in which the interplay between diet gut microorganisms and the host can contribute to overall metabolic health.

Although caution is needed in interpreting results the analysis presented here suggests that a high-fat low-MACs diet in the context of metabolic deregulation such as obesity and T2D could force changes in the GM CTs supporting the presence of CCG1 S. variabile group andor CCG3 R. bromii group to the detriment of CCG2 E. rectale group.
