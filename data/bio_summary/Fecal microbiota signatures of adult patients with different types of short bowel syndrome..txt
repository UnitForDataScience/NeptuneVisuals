functional pathways of citrate cycle and branched-chain and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis were abundant in sbs ii patients while functional profiles of pyrimidine and purine metabolism were dominant in sbs iii patients.conclusions short bowel syndrome patients have a marked intestinal dysbiosis with type ii sbs characterized by proteobacteria and type iii sbs featured by lactobacillus resulting in altered functional profiles of fecal microbiomes.introductionshort bowel syndrome sbs has been defined as loss of bowel or enterocyte mass from surgical resection congenital defects or disease.1 in adults most cases occur as a consequence of massive small bowel resection due to postoperative complications mesenteric vascular disease crohn's disease and trauma.2 the remaining small intestine lacks sufficient surface area and functional capacity to fully digest and absorb nutrients resulting in frequent dependency on parenteral nutrition pn.3 based on the anatomy of the remaining intestine sbs is divided into three categories end jejunostomy type i jejunocolic anastomosis type ii and jejunoileal anastomosis type iii.4 the greatest difference between type ii and iii sbs is that the former one does not have ileocecal valve icv and intact colon which seem to have important impacts on gut microbiota intestinal adaption and clinical symptoms.56the human intestine is colonized by diverse microbes that encode at least 150-fold more genes than the human genome andplay a fundamental role in the well-being of their host.78 commensal intestinal microbes are involved in fermentation and absorption of undigested carbohydrate normal development of immune system and promotion of intestinal mucosal growth and integrity.9 several studies have shown that the disruption of intestinal microbiota leads to delayed enteral diet prolonged pn dependence poor growth and predisposition to liver disease in pediatric sbs patients.10-13 thus determination of the changes in gut microbiota of sbs patients may point to new therapies that ameliorate abdominal symptoms and contribute to intestinal adaptation.previous attempts at mapping the intestinal microbiota of adult sbs patients usually relied on culture-dependent methods or temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.1415 yet advances in sequencing technologies coupled with new bioinformatic developments have allowed us to detect and classify numerous uncultured microorganisms.1617 besides little is known about the characteristics of intestinal microbiota of adult patients with different types of sbs.

levels of serum albumin were significantly lower in sbs patients than in healthy controls p  0.008 with four sbs ii patients and three sbs iii patients being off the normal limit 35 gl.

within bacteroidetes there was a significant decrease in bacteroidaceae in the sbs ii and iii groups compared with the control group p  0.005 and p  0.001 while prevotellaceae significantly increased in the sbs iii group compared with the control and sbs ii groups p  0.001 and p  0.001. sbs ii patients had strikingly increased proportionsof enterobacteriaceae compared with healthy controls and sbs iii patients p  0.005 and p  0.001 which contributed mostly to the prevalence of proteobacteria.genus-levelmicrobesdistinguishinghealthy controls and short bowel syndrome patients.

therefore the findings of this work are suggestive and need confirmation by future multicenter case-control studies.table 2 relative abundance of bacterial phyla and families of fecal samples from healthy controls and adult patients with type ii and iii sbsbacterial taxahealthy controlsn  5type ii sbs patients n  5type iii sbs patients n  5p  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 compared with healthy controlsp  0.05 p  0.01 p  0.001 compared with type iii sbs patients.data were presented as percentage of the total sequences median interquartile range.

additionally capacity of certain lactobacillus species to produce d-lactic acid exposes the sbs patients to a high risk of d-lactic acidosis.39 lactobacillus have also been linked to diarrheal symptoms in pediatric sbs patients.10 collectively the roles of lactobacillus in sbs patients are complicated and variable.another important change in fecal microbiota of adult sbs patients was the depletion of genera from lachnospiraceae ruminococcaceae and bacteroidaceae.

therefore we aim to characterize the fecal microbiota of adult patients with different types of sbs.methods fifteen fecal samples from healthy controls and adult patients with type ii or type iii sbs were collected five in each group.

whereas lactobacillus and prevotella dominated the microbiomes of sbs iii patients commensal bacteria from lachnospiraceae ruminococcaceae and bacteroidaceae declined in sbs patients.

all patients and healthy controls enrolled provided written informed consent before commencing this study.a total of 10 adult sbs patients five of type ii and five of typeiii were finally enrolled.

two sbs iii patients had weaned off pn and all patients relied on enteral nutrition.

furthermore pathways responsible for branched- chain and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and lipopolysaccharide lps biosynthesis were dominant in sbs ii patients while pathways of glycosyltransferase arachidonic acid metabolism and pyrimidine and purine metabolism were enriched in sbs iii patients.

at kegg level 2 healthy controls had higherdiscussionthis study provides a comprehensive description of fecal microbiota of adult sbs patients demonstrating that massive small bowel resection can lead to severe intestinal dysbiosis and patients with different types of sbs exhibit different microbial signatures.

however the sample size was relative small which was mainly due to the rarity of sbs of which the estimated incidence is three per million2 and strict inclusion criteria as patients receiving antibiotics or probiotics who account for the majority of sbs patients were excluded.
