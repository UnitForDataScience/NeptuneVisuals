In contrast our correlation analysis identified significant correlations between C. tropicalis and potentially pathogenic bacteria and negative correlations between Saccharomyces and most of the bacterial genera.Cooperation between fungi and bacteriaArmed with the new evidence suggesting that fungi and bac- teria interact with each other in a way that could potentially exacerbate inflammatory symptoms of IBD we examined how C. tropicalis E. coli and S. marcescens interact together in order to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying these interaction.

S. marcescens interacts with intestinal epithelial cells and induces dramatic immunological alterations similar to those produced by known enteric pathogens Therefore showing that S. marcescens is increased in CD set- tings may have identified yet a new culprit that influences the inflammatory symptoms in IBD patients.As described above Iliev et al.

Scanning electron microscopy micrographs of biofilms formed by C. tropicalis alone or in combination with E. coli andor S. marcescens.

Since microorganisms in the digestive tract exist in a biofilm set- ting which renders them resistant to antimicrobial agents and protects them from immune cells we initiated stud- ies to examine how these bacteria and fungal cells interact in such a milieu using our in vitro biofilm model These studies demonstrated that C. tropicalis E. coli and S. marcescens cooper- ate to form robust biofilms that were significantly thicker than single or double species biofilms.

Interactions between C. trop- icalis and these two bacteria have been previously reported wherein lipopolysaccharide produced by S. marcescens and E. coli significantly enhanced fungal biofilm maturation CloserFig.

wherein C. tropicalis began to form fungal hyphae a known Candida pathogenicity factor that facilitates tissue invasion in the presence of E. coli and S. marcescens thereby triggering host immune response Similar inter-kingdom interactions have been observed in set- tings other than the gut.
