The finding that Omani livestock samples all came from a distinct branch in the B. melitensis phylogeny indicates that these animals all contain relatively closely related isolates from a single lineage.SNP analyses indicate that all of our B. melitensis isolates from Omani camels belong to a distinct clade that also contains isolates originating in Africa Nigeria Chad Tanzania.

Seven additional B. melitensis isolates from blood samples from goats were also collected from Saham in the Al Batinah North Governorate in 2010 but were not biotyped.A sub-set of MLVA profiles derived from geographically diverse B. melitensis isolates causing human infection was generated at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and used in the analysis to understand the distribution of B. melitensis genotypes in the region.

Thus SNP analysis indicates that Omani livestock isolates are part of a group of B. melitensis that is related to isolates from Africa and distantly related to most other isolates from the Middle East.

Our MLVA results also support the SNP analyses that the Omani camel isolates have greatest similarity to B. melitensis isolates from North Africa.

2006 B. melitensis isolates from the United Arab Emirates from camels cattle and a goat had genotypes from the E. Mediterranean clade but also contained isolates from four camels and a gazelle from the African clade Gyuranecz et al.

All culture and manipulation of Brucella isolates were conducted in BSL-3 conditions.To develop a B. melitensis SNP genotyping assay we conducted an in silico analysis of 29 B. melitensis genomes that were then available in GenBank and generated a phylogenetic tree using Northern Arizona SNP Pipeline NASP Sahl et al.

Of particular interest to this study was the phylogenetic placement of isolates from Omani livestock all 34 of these Omani isolates are part of the clade on the assay branch 2 Figure 1.

Interestingly the African clade isolates are more closely related to isolates from the Americas clade than the E. Mediterranean clade in this rooted tree a pattern not seen in MLVA Gyuranecz et al.

Omani camel isolates are related to isolates originating from humans in Egypt sometimes separated by only one VNTR repeat.

The two SNP assays specific for branch 2 can quickly identify isolates that are part of this unique African lineage allowing for a determination of the spread of this clade.We emphasize that the African clade is a phylogenetic assignment and not a geographic one and that not all isolates from Africa will be a part of this clade.
