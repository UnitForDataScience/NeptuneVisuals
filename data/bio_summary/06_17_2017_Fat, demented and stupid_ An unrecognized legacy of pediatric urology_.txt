Research in animals and children recently led the FDA to issue a warning regarding the risk of lengthy use of general anesthesia on cognitive development in children.ConclusionsThis review raises the possibility that antibiotics in children may alter growth anticholinergics may in- crease their risk of dementia later in life and an- esthetics may impair their cognitive development.

Recent medical literature suggests that antibiotics in children may alter growth anticholinergics may increase the risk of dementia and anesthetics may impair cognitive development.

Trasande et al.noted that infants who received a course of antibiotics by 6 months of age more frequently developed an increased body mass and had significantly increased risk of being overweight as toddlers at 38 months than infants that did not receive antibiotics OR 1.22 p Z 0.029.

Reported rates of developing resistant bacteria in children on prophylactic antibiotics range from 3 to 24 times the rate compared to children not receiving prophylactic antibiotics e.The microbiota of the intestinal tract is a highly diverse and complex ecosystem containing 500e1000 species in fact 90 of all cells in the human body are bacterial.

An electronic health record review of 64580 children at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia demonstrated an increased risk of developing childhood obesity associated with both broad-spectrum antibiotics and cumulative exposure for those receiving four or more courses of an antibiotic .

The resiliency of the human body modifies and disguises side effects some of which may be undetectable for years and not apparent without scientific investigation.Pediatric urologists employ relatively few medi- cations for the common conditions they treat and in general these consist of antibiotics anticholiner- gics and anesthetics.

Alteration of the microbiota by antibiotics or other means including diet may affect these normal functions.

Further studies in mice demonstrate that a fecal transplant with stool from humans can transfer either an obese or lean phenotype from the human to the recipient mouse further demonstrating the impact of the microbiota on metabolism and weight .Multiple studies in humans demonstrate that short-term antibiotics may lead to persistent changes in the human gut microbiota .

In addition just as removing the tooth from one gear in a watch may ultimately lead to stress and breakage on it and the other parts the total impact of medical intervention may not be readily evident.

Pediatric urologists employ rela- tively few medications for the common con- ditions they treat and in general these consist of antibiotics anticholinergics and anes- thetics.
