In particular the distribution of the CAZyme families predicted in moose rumen enrichments differed from that recently reported for the moose rumen metagenome   where highest contributing factors were attributed to relatively high abundance of CE4 GH94 and GH78 families and low abundance of GH2 GH43 in the moose rumen enrichments Supplementary Table S3.

Nonetheless along PC2 where these metagenomes diverge the most the PCA plot depicted a closer resemblance of CAZyme profiles microbiomes from termite gut and moose rumen samples enriched on poplar hydrolysate than that between the former and the non-enriched moose rumen.Impact of Enrichment Substrate on Profiles of Predicted Plant-Polysaccharide Degrading CAZyme SequencesMetagenomes of cultures enriched on poplar hydrolysate yielded a higher proportion of predicted plant polysaccharides-active CAZymes  33 compared to metagenomes of cultures enriched on cellulose  23  and .

These sequences were assigned to 100 distinct families of GHs13 families of CEs 15 families of PLs and 39 families of GTs as well as 43 families of associated CBMs.

Meanwhile moose rumen samples enriched on poplar hydrolysate encoded higher counts of GH9 2 times higher CE4 1.8 times GH127 9 times and CE15 11 times compared to corresponding samples enriched on cellulose .Carbohydrate-active enzymes families that were enriched through growth on poplar hydrolysate included those that comprise enzymes involved in plant polysaccharide deconstruction.

Contrary to findings recently reported for the moose rumen microbiome   the multi-modular enzymes comprising CBM50 and GH23 or GH73 were identified at low abundance 3.5 in the enriched moose rumen metagenomes reported herein.FIGURE 4  A Distribution of plant polysaccharide degrading-CAZyme families as single and multi-modular domains.
