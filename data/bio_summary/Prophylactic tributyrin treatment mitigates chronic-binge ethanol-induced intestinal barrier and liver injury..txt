Interestingly hepatic localization of neutrophilic and acidophilic bodies was impacted by tributyrin EtOH-only mice exhibited leukocytes and apoptotic hepatocytes predominantly localized to zone 1 around the portal tract whereas in localization in ethanol- tributyrin mice predominated in zone 3 around the central vein.DiscussionChronic-binge ethanol exposure to mice causes hepatic injury development characteristic of early stage AH.22 Here we find that in addition to the negative effects on liver combined chronic-binge ethanol exposure to mice also impacts intestinal homeostasis impairing intestinal epithelial cell integrity andFigure 4 Effect of butyrate on stability of tight junction proteins and transepithelial electrical resistance TEER reduced by EtOH.

Evaluating the indi- vidual mice with positive TNF-a staining in each group 83 of the ethanol-glycerol mice 50 of pair-fed mice and 33 of ethanol-tributyrin mice had positive TNF-a staining  0.2.Figure 2 Effects of tributyrin treatment on tight junction protein expression in proximal colon.

Ethanol-induced intestinal barrier disruption opens the opportunity for pathogen associated molecular patterns to translocate to the liver activate TLRs and trigger inflammation contributing to hepatocyte damage.4849 Recently TLR2 and TLR9 deficient mice showed reduced hepatocellular damage induced by chronic-binge ethanol expo- sure.50 These data suggest that tributyrin preservation of the intestinal barrier during chronic-binge ethanol exposure may re- duce hepatic ligands for TLRs and protect against hepatic inflammation.We do not yet know the mechanisms by which tributyrin protects from ethanol-induced injury.

Butyrate reduces oxidative stress by influencing intracellular anti-oxidant activity DNA repair systems or anti-oxidant enzymes.9 Butyrate protected against insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease reducing hepatic pro-inflammatory parameters via suppression of TNF-a TLR and NF-kB activation.54 Portal butyrate concentrations from endogenous production are reported as high as 64 mM in humans.55 Therefore while these data associ- ate intestinal barrier protection by tributyrin with decreased liver injury they do not exclude that tributyrin may also have a localized hepato-protective effect.

This study aimed to determine whether prophylactic tributyrin could protect the intestinal barrier and liver in mice during combined chronic-binge ethanol exposure.Methods C57BL6J mice exposed to 5 vv ethanol-containing diet for 10 days received a single ethanol gavage 5 gkg 9 h before euthanasia.

Tributyrin altered localization of both neutrophils and single hepatocyte death Leukocytes and apoptotic hepatocytes localized predominantly around the portal tract in ethanol-only treated mice whereas localization predominated around the central vein in ethanol-tributyrin mice.Conclusions Prophylactic tributyrin supplementation mitigated effects of combined chronic-binge ethanol exposure on disruption of intestinal TJ localization and intestinal permeability and liver injury.IntroductionAlcoholic hepatitis AH is a syndrome of progressive inflamma- tory liver injury associated with chronic ethanol intake.

Values with different alphabetical superscripts were significantly different from each other P  0.05.transporter and receptor expression is highest in the ileum and co- lon making these intestinal regions highly likely to benefit from tributyrin supplementation.39-42 In our prior work with experimen- tal models that induce gut dysbiosis tributyrin supplementation protects the intestine.4344 Butyrate induces differentiation in nor- mal intestinal and colon epithelial cells but induces apoptosis in co- lon cancer cells.10 Tested in humans as a potential therapy for malignancies and hemoglobinopathy tributyrin delivery is able to increase plasma butyrate to biologically active levels with minimal demonstrated toxicity.45Caco-2 cell monolayer model allows for evaluation of the di- rect effects of butyrate on protecting intestinal TJ and permeabil- ity integrity in the absence of potential interactions between ethanol and other cells such as immune and goblet cells in- volved with intestinal epithelium homeostasis.

Ethanol exposure induces histone deacetylase HDAC gene alterations in liver and periph- eral blood5152 with increased HDAC gene expression noted in peripheral blood with chronic ethanol exposure51 and decreased HDAC gene expression following acute ethanol exposure.5152 As a known histone deacetylase inhibitor tributyrin provision in a rat model of hepatocarinogenesis resulted in lower HDAC activity and increased histone acetylation of the nuclear protein p53 with increased apoptosis and autophagy.53 Further studiesFigure 6 Effects of tributyrin on hepatic injury and zonation of neutrophilic infiltrate and acidophilic bodies following chronic-binge ethanol exposure.

These receptors are expressed on a multitude of tissues and cell types including adipocytes intestinal epithelial cells peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hepatocytes.56 Activation of these receptors with SCFA induces anti-inflammatory effects.5657 Further investigations determining the role of tributyrin G-protein-coupled receptors and chronic-binge ethanol-induced hepatic inflammation are warranted.In conclusion tributyrin supplementation protected both the intestinal barrier and liver from injury induced by combined chronic-binge ethanol exposure.

On day 11 mice were gavaged with a 5-gkg dose of ethanol or isocaloric maltose.22 Included in the gavage at a concentration of 2.5 mM was either tributyrin 7.5 mg or glycerol 2.3 mg.At 9-h post-gavage mice were anesthetized and blood was col- lected from the posterior vena cava by syringe and expelled into EDTA-containing tubes.
