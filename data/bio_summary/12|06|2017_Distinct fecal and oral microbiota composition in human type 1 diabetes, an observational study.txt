In contrast with fecal microbiota we found no significant correlations between oral microbiota and glycemic control inflammatory parameters or short-chain fatty acids.DiscussionRecent studies have linked altered fecal microbiota composition to the recent rise in many immunological disorders including T1D.

Especially the observed differences in oral microbiota are of interest in view of recent human studies suggest- ing a link between oral microbiota and microbiota in the small intestine which is believed to be the culprit site in T1D development.Supporting informationS1 Fig.

Oral and fecal microbiota fecal and plasma SCFA levels markers of intestinal inflammation fecal IgA and calprotectin and markers of low-grade systemic inflammation were measured.ResultsOral microbiota were markedly different in T1D eg abundance of Streptococci compared to HC.

Finally although age range-dependent sex differences have been reported in relation to the incidence of type 1 diabetes no difference was found in Baseline characteristics.Group characteristics expressed as mean - SD or median IQR with p-value using independent T-test for parametric and Mann-Whitney test for non- parametric data.inflammatory parameters or short-chain fatty acids between males and females in either group.Fecal and oral microbiota compositionA difference in fecal microbiota beta diversity was seen as depicted by RDA plot  while there was no significant in alpha diversity Shannon's diversity index in T1D N  45 versus controls N  35.

In patients with longstanding T1D we now report that oral as well as fecal microbiota are altered compared to healthy matched controls.While previous studies reported a decrease in alpha diversity in young adolescent T1D we only found significant changes in beta diversity in both fecal and oral microbiota in our well-controlled longstanding T1D patients which is in line with a previous smaller study in longstanding T1D.

In contrast to fecal microbiota we observed a much stronger oral microbiota signature including Streptococcus in T1D subjects.

However our population had good glycemic control without diabetes complications and no correlations were seen between significantly different oral or fecal taxa and HbA1c.Finally as we did not perform HLA typing we cannot provide data on the potential relation between HLA type and intestinal microbiota composition In T1D.In conclusion our study reveals that intestinal microbiota are different in well-controlled subjects with longstanding T1D compared to matched healthy controls.

In this respect we are currently executing a fecal microbiota transplantation study in new onset T1D which may provide more insight into potential causality of small intestinal microbiota and their metabolites in this autoimmune disease.
