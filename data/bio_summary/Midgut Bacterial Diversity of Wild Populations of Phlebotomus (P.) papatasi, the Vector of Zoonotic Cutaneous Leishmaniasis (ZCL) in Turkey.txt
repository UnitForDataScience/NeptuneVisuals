Our results correlate with previous findings and one possible reasons of high gram negative prev- alence in the sand fly midgut is due to the antimicrobial activity of gram negative bacteria against gram positive bacteria during the colonization.Sand flies are not free of bacteria since they emerged.

Based on the sequence similarity to the previously submit- ted 16 S rRNA sequence data 13 different bacteria Variovorax sp.

Among the overall identified bacteria taxa Thauera sp.

Most of the extracellular bacteria are unable to survive during the transstadial passage due to high antibacterial compound secretions in pupal stage but Ochrobactrum sp.

as a vector control agent in sand flies but the presence of this bacteria and transstadial passage to teneral flies makes Wolbachia sp.

Female sand flies are hematophagous and blood-feeding on different mammal hosts in order to develop eggs and reproduce but both males and females are feeding on plant sugars to supply carbohydrates where they may acquire plant bacteria.

During the larval development of sand fly they feed on detritus and other organic compounds thus larvae expose high range of bacteria.

The majority of these larval stage bacteria undergoes biodegradation during the pupal stage and the bacterial load decrease three days later following the emerge of an adult.

Relative abundance of gut bacteria of different P. papatasi populations.

Bacterial composition may either enhance or inhibit the parasitic activity and it's strictly dependent to species of harboring bacteria.
