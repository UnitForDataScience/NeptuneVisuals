casei group represented on average 51 of the bacterial population showing fluctuation connected to the ripening age of the cheese.

casei group during ripening which is lower in this cheese-making highlighting the importance of raw milk microbial contamination in the final cheese product quality .

casei group in GP cheese and its dynamics during ripening.

Cheese samples were collected from the twin wheels after 2 6 and 12 months of ripening immediately grated and stored at -80 degC.RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisFollowing a strategy employed also in analysis of other cheese varieties grated cheese samples coming from twin wheels were mixed prior to RNA extraction .

paracasei  and this difference was found also in the phylogenetic reconstruction provided from spxB gene.The interchange of spxB sequence types during ripening shows thatthe most abundant clusters at the beginning of ripening prevail during cheese ageing.

fermentum is able to survive throughout the ripening and a higher concentration in the early ripening steps affects the amount that is metabolically active at a more advanced stage of ripening.

casei group was recently used to distinguish the species within this bacterial group both in pure cultures and in cheese where it could provide an alternative energy source through the conversion of pyruvate to acetate.

casei group are frequently found in ripened cheeses and they usually become the dominant bacterial population during ri- pening of extra-hard cooked Italian Protected Designation of Origin PDO cheese such as Grana Padano GP .
