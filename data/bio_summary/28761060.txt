Each symbol represents a sample the variance explained by the PCs is indicated on the axes Unweighted PCoA NS vs. Control r 0.82 P 0.001 NS vs. LI01 r 0.80 P 0.001 NS vs. LI05 r 0.81 P 0.001.

Moreover treatment with P. pentosaceus LI05 decreased the BT incidence in the MLN 39 P 0.024 arterial blood 39 P 0.024 and portal blood 29 P 0.007 treatment with C. butyricum decreased the BT incidence in the portal blood of the MY group 27 P 0.02 and treatment with L. rhamnosus decreased the BT incidence in the arterial blood of rats in the LGG group 38 P  0.039.

P 0.05 and P 0.01 vs. normal saline-treated cirrhotic rats in the NS group.the ZCS LI01 and LI05 groups than those in the NS group P  0.01 Table .

As shown in Table  only treatment with L. salivarius LI01 decreased BT in all evaluated tissues compared with that of the cirrhotic rats treated with normal saline as follows mesenteric lymph node MLN 411 P 0.026 arterial blood 411 P 0.026 portal blood 411 P 0.026 and liver 311 P 0.04.

Specifically Elusimicrobium was highly negatively cor- related with IL-6 r -0.37 P 0.00 and IL-17 r -0.43 P 0.00 whereas Oscillospira was positively corre- lated with IL-6 r 0.3 P 0.02 and IL-17 r 0.4 P 0.00 indicating that Elusimicrobium and Oscillospira are strong opposite candidates for inflammatory cytokine regulation.

Interestingly the genus Lactobacillus was cor- related negatively with the profibrogenic genes Collagen a1 r -0.4 P 0.02 and TIMP-1 r -0.5 P 0.00 and the liver function markers GGT r  -0.32 P 0.01 and endotoxin r  -0.4 P 0.00.

P 0.05 and P 0.01 vs. normal saline-treated cirrhotic rats in the NS group.and LI05 group whereas the NS group was characterized by a preponderance of Firmicutes Enterobacteriaceae Oscillospira Oscillibacter Flavonifractor and EscherichiaShigella Fig.

LI01 group vs. NS group P 0.1 LI05 vs. NS group P 0.05.

Oscillospira was negatively correlated with Elusimicrobium r  -0.49 P 0.00 Lactobacillus r  -0.3 P 0.02 and Prevotella r  -0.27 P 0.04.

Among the various relationships we found negative correlations between the gut barrier marker ZO-1 and Oscillospira r  -0.28 P  0.04 Oscillibacter r  -0.5 P  0.00 and Flavonifractor r -0.38 P 0.00.
