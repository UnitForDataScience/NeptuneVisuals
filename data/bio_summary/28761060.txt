whereas the livers in other strain-treated groups exhibited no differences in a-SMA compared to those of the NS group.The following profibrogenic genes were significantly down-regulated in various groups compared with theirexpression in the NS group Collagen a1 showed decrease in group LI01 and 1.5-fold decrease in group LI05 TIMP-1 showed 1.7-fold decrease in group ZCS 1.6-fold decrease in group LI01 and 1.9-fold decrease in group LI05 TGF-b showed 1.5-fold decrease in group LI01 and 1.4-fold decrease in group LI05 and INOS-2 showed 1.9-fold decrease in group LI01 1.8-fold decrease in group LI05 and 1.9-fold decrease in group LGG Fig.

The letters NS in parentheses on the heatmap indicates the microbiota was enriched in NS group the letter LI in parentheses on the heatmap indicated the microbiota was enriched in LI01 and LI05 group.

Male pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 350 g were randomly divided into 7 groups as follows a healthy control group treated with normal saline Control group n  8 a CCl4-induced cirrhosis group treated with normal saline NS group n  15 and five CCl4-induced liver cir- rhosis groups treated with L. salivarius LI01 LI01 group n  15 P. pentosaceus LI05 LI05 group n  15C.

An orogastric tube was used to administer 1 ml of normal saline in the NS and Control groups or 1 ml 3 x 109 CFUml of bacterial cells freshly prepared as previously describedonce daily for 13 weeks pre-treatment with probiotics was initiated one week prior to the induction of cirrhosis.Cirrhosis was induced via a subcutaneous injection of a 50 VV CCl4 solution in olive oil Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO into the dorsal region twice per week at a dose of 2 mlkg.
