as shown in table  only treatment with l. salivarius li01 decreased bt in all evaluated tissues compared with that of the cirrhotic rats treated with normal saline as follows mesenteric lymph node mln 411 p 0.026 arterial blood 411 p 0.026 portal blood 411 p 0.026 and liver 311 p 0.04. moreover treatment with p. pentosaceus li05 decreased the bt incidence in the mln 39 p 0.024 arterial blood 39 p 0.024 and portal blood 29 p 0.007 treatment with c. butyricum decreased the bt incidence in the portal blood of the my group 27 p 0.02 and treatment with l. rhamnosus decreased the bt incidence in the arterial blood of rats in the lgg group 38 p  0.039. however b. licheniformis showed no significant effects on bt incidence.l.

among the various relationships we found negative correlations between the gut barrier marker zo-1 and oscillospira r  -0.28 p  0.04 oscillibacter r  -0.5 p  0.00 and flavonifractor r -0.38 p 0.00. positive correlations were identified between zo-1 and elusimicrobium r 0.48 p  0.00 and paraprevotella r 0.4 p  0.00. specifically elusimicrobium was highly negatively cor- related with il-6 r -0.37 p 0.00 and il-17 r -0.43 p 0.00 whereas oscillospira was positively corre- lated with il-6 r 0.3 p 0.02 and il-17 r 0.4 p 0.00 indicating that elusimicrobium and oscillospira are strong opposite candidates for inflammatory cytokine regulation.

interestingly the genus lactobacillus was cor- related negatively with the profibrogenic genes collagen a1 r -0.4 p 0.02 and timp-1 r -0.5 p 0.00 and the liver function markers ggt r  -0.32 p 0.01 and endotoxin r  -0.4 p 0.00. in contrast signifi- cant positive correlations were found between escherichiashigella and tlr4 r 0.28 p 0.03 tlr5 r 0.28 p 0.03 and tlr9 r 0.27 p 0.04.figure 5. treatment with l. salivarius li01 or p. pentosaceus li05 ameliorated microbiome dysbiosis in cirrhotic rats.

furthermore weighted and unweighted unifrac analysis showed that the microbiota of the li01 and li05 group clustered separately from the ns group anosim p 0.01. in contrast weighted metrics showed the microbiota of my and lgg group had several intersection points with the ns group indicating the closer microbial communities in these groups anosim p  0.05. on the other hand the unweighted unifrac analysis showed that the distinct microbial structure of the li01 and li05 group significantly separate from other probiotic groups anosim p  0.01 table .despite the highly diverse bacterial communities and interindividual differences cirrhosis clearly affectedthe intestinal microbial community.

whereas the livers in other strain-treated groups exhibited no differences in a-sma compared to those of the ns group.the following profibrogenic genes were significantly down-regulated in various groups compared with theirexpression in the ns group collagen a1 showed decrease in group li01 and 1.5-fold decrease in group li05 timp-1 showed 1.7-fold decrease in group zcs 1.6-fold decrease in group li01 and 1.9-fold decrease in group li05 tgf-b showed 1.5-fold decrease in group li01 and 1.4-fold decrease in group li05 and inos-2 showed 1.9-fold decrease in group li01 1.8-fold decrease in group li05 and 1.9-fold decrease in group lgg fig.

rats from the ns group 1.2 - 0.1 euml showed significantly higher plasma endotoxin levels than those of rats from the control group 0.4 - 0.1 euml p  0.01. a significant decrease in endotoxaemia was observed in the li01 group 0.5 - 0.1 euml and the li05 group 0.5 - 0.1 euml compared to that in the ns group p 0.01. there were no significant differences between the other probiotic groups and the ns group.endotoxin is an important ligand that activates specific toll-like receptors tlrs.

il-6 mrna level showed 2.2-fold down-regulation in group li01 and 2.6-fold down-regulation in group li05 compared with its expression in cirrhotic rats from the ns group tnf-a mrna level showed 1.5-fold down-regulation in group zcs 1.9-fold down-regulation in group li01 and 1.6-fold down-regulation in group li05 il-17a mrna level showed 3.2-fold down-regulation in group li01 and 5.2-fold down-regulation in group li05 il-10 expression was unchanged except in the control group 7.1-fold up-regulated p  0.01. notably the administration of c. butyricum or l. rhamnosus gg did not significantly affect inflammatory cytokine regulation.l.

compared with the controls the rats with cirrhosis in the ns group demon- strated a marked increase in the firmicutesbacteroidetes fb ratio 1.7130 - 0.3771 vs. 0.8183 - 0.1113 p  0.01. additionally only the probiotic strains li01 0.8287 - 0.0630 p  0.01 and li05 0.8329 - 0.1512 p  0.05 significantly decreased the ratio fig.

notably the body weights in the li01 group 414.3 - 11.2 g and the li05 group 412.3 - 7.4 g were significantly higher than those in the ns group 362.2 - 9.2 g p  0.003 and p  0.001 respectively at the 6th week before ascites formation table  whereas the other probiotic groups showed no differences.l.

liver function analysis table  revealed that administration of p. pentosaceus li05 significantly relieved the increase in serum alt ast and ggt p 0.05 and p 0.01 respectively.

oscillospira was negatively correlated with elusimicrobium r  -0.49 p 0.00 lactobacillus r  -0.3 p 0.02 and prevotella r  -0.27 p 0.04. liver and intestinal damage were highly associated with gut microbial genera.
