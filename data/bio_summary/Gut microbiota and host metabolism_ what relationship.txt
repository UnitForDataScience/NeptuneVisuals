The growing interest in the influence of intestinal microbiota on diseases has now expanded to non-metabolic illnesses such as intestinal or mental dis- orders 8 disorders of the immune system 9 or neu- rodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease or multiple sclerosis 10.In the field of metabolic diseases obesity and deregu- lated glucose control has been associated with an altered especially poorly diversified gut microbiota which led to the concept of dysbiosis whereas leanness and meta- bolic health has been associated with a higher gut micro- bial diversity 6 11.

But in exceptional pathologi- cal situations in which the gut barrier permeability is im-portantly impaired and in which high molecular weight compounds such as LPS or even bacteria are susceptible to be translocated the bacteria are separated from the gut mucosa by the mucus layer thickness see for example 2.

There- fore one can hope in the near future to learn a lot from metabolomics of bacterial products associated with well- conducted mechanistic approaches.AcknowledgementsThe author is grateful to his collaborators and colleagues from his laboratory and elsewhere for so many essential discussions and expert works in relation with the gut microbiota which taught him so much about the field.Disclosure StatementThe author has no conflict of interest to disclose relating to this paper.ReferencesTurnbaugh PJ Backhed F Fulton L Gordon JI Diet-induced obesity is linked to marked but reversible alterations in the mouse distal gut microbiome.

A crucial link by which gut bacteria communicate with the host mucosa is based on metabolites or low-molecular-weight compounds.

These studies initiated the widespread idea that gut microbiota dysbio- sis could have a causal role in determining the evolution toward obesity and deregulated glucose metabolism and further type 2 diabetes 4-7 11.

Relationships between gut microbiota and host metabolism established solid line and hypothetical dashed line.nies.

Even a complete exchange of the gut mi- crobiota from Jackson to Taconic Farm and vice-versa after elimination of the original microbiota with antibiot- ics treatment was without effect mice from Jackson col- onized with the microbiota of Taconic Farm continued to partially resist to diet-induced obesity compared with mice from Taconic Farm colonized with the microbiota from Jackson 15.

These data disagreed with the concept that the gut microbiota per se could importantly influ- ence the development of obesity in mice.Another striking study was performed in 57 obese pa- tients with altered glucose control featured from various parameters.

However no change in any of the metabolic parameters was evidenced either after the antibiotic treatment or after the 8-week follow- up suggesting again that the gut microbiota does not ex- hibit the capacity to markedly influence the host metabo- lism 16.It must be mentioned that in a high number of exper- imental studies an obesity-prone phenotype could be successfully conferred on germ-free mice upon transfer- ring the microbiota from obese mice see for example 1.
