we conducted microbiologic investigations on 2124 tissue samples from lung liver kidney spleen intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes from 549 dead harbor seals of the german north sea.

subsequently the importance of management and conservation of harbor seals was recognized by the establishment of thetrilateral wadden sea agreement.
