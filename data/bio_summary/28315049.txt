herein we review the changes in the microbiota associated to hypertension and discuss the current insights regarding the impact of probiotics in animal models and in human hypertensive patients.gut microbiota in hypertensionthe mammalian microbiome consists of unique assemblages of microorganisms i.e.

second fecal microbiota transplantation studies are necessary to be known if changes in gut microbiota induced by probiotics are ultimately responsible to restore gut perme- ability and inflammatory status impacting in bone marrow production of proinflammatory cells which subsequently in- hibit the autonomic dysregulation in hypertension.

therefore there is an urgent need for alternative strategies.in recent years gut microbiome dysbiosis has been associ- ated with hypertension  although the mechanisms in- volved in the bp control by the microbiota has not been fully elucidated.

recently it has been demonstrated that high bp is associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis both in animal and human hypertension  .

these results confirm previous studies suggesting a strong association between gut microbial dysbiosis and hypertension establishing a cause-effect relationship between altered micro- biota and high bp.the gut microbiota can potentially influence host bp through multiple mechanisms.

in fact butyrate attenuates angiotensin ii-induced hypertension in mice  and both a diet rich in fiber which substantially increases the production of scfas such as acetate or acetate supplementation prevented the development of hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate doca salt .scfas modulate bp through the renal and vascular olfactory receptor olfr78 and g-protein-coupled receptor gpr41 in mice .

summary further investigations are needed to clarify if the effects of probiotic bacteria result from the changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic by-products the restoration of the gut barrier function and the effects on endotoxemia inflammation and renal sympathetic nerve activity.this article is part of the topical collection on gut microbiome sympathetic nervous system and hypertension juan duarte 1 department of pharmacology school of pharmacy university of granada ciber-enfermedades cardiovasculares cibercv 18071 granada spain2 instituto de investigacion biosanitaria de granada ibs.granada granada spain3 department of pharmacology school of medicine complutense university of madrid ciber enfermedades respiratorias ciberes and instituto de investigacion sanitaria gregorio maranon iisgm madrid spainkeywords probiotic bacteria .

in addition it has been commonly observed that a change in the host health status has been accompanied by a shift in the gut microbiota.to date there are limited studies indicating a direct associ- ation between gut microbiota and hypertension in both animal models and humans.

recently it has been demonstrated that the normal gut microbiota may influence bp.

however the absence of gut microbiota protects mice from angiotensin ii-induced hyper- tension vascular dysfunction and hypertension-induced end- organ damage showing for the first time that commensal mi- crobiota an ecosystem that is acquired directly after birth could represent an environmental factor promoting angioten- sin ii-induced high bp .

case report of resistant hypertensivepatients shows a bp reduction from 16090 to 130 60 mmhg after a combination of antibiotic treatment .a delicate balance in the gut microbiota composition is key in maintaining intestinal immunity and whole-body homeo- stasis.

yet obese school girls with high bp show lower abundance of bacteroidetes in their gut microbiota than normal-weight girls .

in addition overweight and obese pregnant women at 16-week gestation the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria and butyrate production in the gut microbiota are significantly negatively associated with bp and with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 pai-1 levels .
