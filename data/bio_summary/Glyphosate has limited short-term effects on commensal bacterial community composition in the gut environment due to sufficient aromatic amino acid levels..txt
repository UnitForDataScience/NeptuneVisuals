The biochemical pathway for aromatic amino acid synthesis Shikimate pathway which is specifically inhibited by glyphosate is shared by plants and numerous bacterial species.

The effect of glyphosate on prototrophic bacterial growth was highly dependent on the availability of aromatic amino acids sug- gesting that the observed limited effect on bacterial composition was due to the presence of sufficient amounts of aromatic amino acids in the intestinal environment.

It is however possible that the situation is different in cases of human malnutrition or in production animals.c 2017 The Authors.

The significance of this highly complex ecosystem collectively termed the gut microbiota has however attracted immense scientific attention in recent years due to a growing recognition of its importance in human health  .

The link be- tween gut microbiota and host health is partly driven by bacterial breakdown of non-digestible dietary fibers resulting in the gen- eration of short-chain fatty acids SCFA .

The SCFA including acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid play an important role for human health as they serve as nutrition for enterocytes  and are involved in both appetite regulation  and immune homeo- stasis .

Plates were incubated under anaer- obic conditions 80 N2 10 CO2 and 10 H2 at 37 oC and inspected after 24 48 and 72 h. The MIC-value for each bacterial strain was defined as the lowest concentration of the challenge pesticide formulation giving rise to no visible growth.

The E. coli strain was grown anaerobically on blood agar plates and pure cultures were inoculated at OD600 0.05 in ABTG broth in 96 well microtiter plates Nunc ThermoFisher.

The pH of the glypho- sate solutions were adjusted from pH z 2 to pH 5 using NaOH as toxicity of glyphosate-based formulations has been found to be influenced by pH  and to minimize any direct effects caused by low pH.
