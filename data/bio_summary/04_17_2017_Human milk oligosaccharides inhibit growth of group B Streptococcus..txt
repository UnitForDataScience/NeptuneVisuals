Further investigation revealed a unique aspect of HMOs that causes a significant GBS growth defect.ResultsHuman milk oligosaccharides inhibit growth of group B StreptococcusTo evaluate the potential antimicrobial effects of HMO on a group of bacterial pathogens we resuspended 105 cfu of each bacterial overnight culture in serum-free tissue culture medium RPMI with or without 2 mgml of HMOs isolated from pooled human milk pHMO and then incubated for 4 h. pHMOs did not affect the growth of UPEC P. aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

Most intrigu- ingly HMOs also appear in the urine of pregnant women as early as the end of the first trimester 19 suggesting that HMOs might already affect pregnant women and the growing fetus long before birth.In a previous study we demonstrated that HMOs regulate the host innate immune response in bladder epithelial cells to prevent invasion and cytotoxicity caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli UPEC without any direct interference with bacterial growth 20.

Pheno- typic screening of a GBS transposon insertion library identified a mutation within a GBS-specific gene encoding a putative gly- cosyltransferase that confers resistance to HMOs suggesting that HMOs may function as an alternative substrate to modify a GBS component in a manner that impairs growth kinetics.

Thus pHMO-mediated inhibition of GBS growth is neither a nonspecific effect of oligosaccharides nor does it appear to require a protein.Next we separated pHMOs into sialylated acidic HMOs aHMOs and non-sialylated neutral HMOs nHMOs 9.

All bacteria were propagated in standing culture to stationary phase at 37 degC inLNnT LNnH LNFPI LNDFHII LnNO LNnDFH LNnFPVand LNFPV.GBS growth and susceptibility testOvernight GBS growth was back-diluted to A600  0.01 in serum-free RPMI 1640 SF-RPMI Life Technologies or sup- plemented with pooled or fractions of HMOs.

At 1.0 mgml nHMOs slowed serotype III GBS COH1 growth by 98.2 serotype Ia GBS A909 growth by 97.0 and serotype V GBS NCTC1084 growth by 96.0 Fig.

To delineate whether HMOs generate similar effects with other neonatal pathogens we examined the effect of HMOs on GBS which is commonly found in the urogenital tract of pregnant women.

1C.The neutral fraction of HMOs possesses the GBS inhibitory activityGalacto-oligosaccharides GOS are sometimes used to sup- plement infant formula to mimic the prebiotic properties of HMOs.

In a prior study we demonstrated that HMOs specifically the sialylated fraction of HMOs and 3'-sialyllactose 3'SL alone support host innate defense and reduce invasion of UPEC into bladder epithelial cells.

Among the four bacterial species tested the bacteriostatic effect of HMOs was unique to GBS.Through a combination of mutation and bioinformatics analysis we identified a conserved putative glycosyltransferase family 8 member gbs0738 that is required for GBS sensitivity to HMOs.
