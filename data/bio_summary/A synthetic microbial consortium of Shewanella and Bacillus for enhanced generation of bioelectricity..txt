Transferring electrons by electron shuttles flavins for MR-1 so-called mediated electron transfer MET in which electron shuttles undergo redox cycling between the electrode and the cell is an alternative way to direct-contact pathway.Riboflavin and rioboflavin-50-phosphate FMN were found to be secreted by MR-1 to mediate EET with riboflavin as the dominant component at biofilm mode Marsili et al.

Meanwhile previous studies revealed that both electrode and biofilm are inclined to absorb the electron shuttles and proper electrode modification would significantly increase the electron shuttles absorption by the p-p interaction between the electrode material and electron shuttle quinoidbenzenoid structure Marsili et al.

Considering the same MFC configuration and small cathode overpotential the low bioelectricity generation with RH33 inoculum can be ascribed to low efficiency in utilizing riboflavin for electron transfer Liu et al.

The synthetic microbial consortium was also found to be an effective way to improve the performance of MFCs by producing more electron shuttles or broadening carbon source Tao et al.

The results proved that for the electroactive microbes which rely on soluble shuttles to facilitate EET the electron transfer from central metabolism to biofilm interface might act as the rate limitation step Yong et al.

Here we postulate that similar reason makes the low bioelectricity generation of MFCs with RH33 pure culture.To further compare the riboflavin utilization efficiency in MET by MR-1 and RH33 MFCs were first discharged under posed potential 0 V vs. SCE for 10 h and then the anolyte of MR-1 and RH33 were exchanged.

subtilis RH33 is a genetically modified strain obtained by integrating multi-copies of riboflavin operon in the genome using genome shuffling and DNA recombination technologies in which the riboflavin production can be as high as 12 gL in fed-batch fermentation Chen et al.

The strategy to rationally design microbial consortium presented here increases the potential of practical application of electron shuttles as it provides an easy and economic method to continuously provide selected electron shuttles by proper bacteria species selection and consortium design in MFC anode.

It was found that proteins in the Mtr pathway especially OM c-type cytochromes MtrC and OmcA were essential for the activity of flavins-based electron shuttling Coursolle et al.

Although Pseudomonas species are well recognized in MFC microbial communities and are capable of synthesizing phenazines which are efficient electron shuttles bioelectricity in MFCs with the pure culture of Pseudomonas species are usually very low Boon et al.
