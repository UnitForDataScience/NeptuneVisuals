the isolates namely plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 were studied in view of their distinctive ability to grow on t-gsm- agar containing tannic acid 25 wv.the three isolates had identical morphological features when grown on different culture media namely brain heart infusion agar wilkins chalgren agar and anaerobic basal agar.

5. the mini- mum levels of euptox a that could be detected by tlc analysis were 50 lg and highest amount degraded by the isolates was 250 lg ml-1 of culture medium.identification 16s rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysisthe 16s rrna sequencing of three isolates plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 resulted in single band ofnearly 1500 bp.

three rumen bacterial isolates producing tannase were studied and identified as klebsiella variicola strain plp g-17 lc k. variicola strain plp s-18 and klebsiella pneumoniae strain plp g-17 sc.

the isolates plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 formed larger 2 mm diameter white to greyish round and mucoid colonies with prominent zone of clear- ance on culture medium containing tannic acid fig.

the isolates plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 were nonmotile nonspore forming scat- tered cells.

the tannase from isolates namely plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 possessed an optimal activity at 40degc fig.

1-3 degradation at 24 h 3-6 degradation at48 h and 7-9 degradation at 60 h by isolates plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 respectively.

for k. variicola plp g-17 lc is k. variicola plp s-18 is and for k. pneumoniae plp is the phyolge- netic relationships of the isolates with related taxa and the number of substitution per nucleotides are shown in fig.

the 16s rrna sequences of plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 showed 98 homology with k. variicola strain zyj-3 99 homology with kleb- siella pneumoniae strain t89 and 99 homology with k. variicola strain wl 1306 16s rrna genes respectively.

the 16s rdna sequence of the three strains plp g-17 lc plp g-17 sc and plp s-18 were submitted in the ncbi genebank.

colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.comafigure 6 phylogenetic tree for klebsiella variicola strain plp g-17 lc a k. variicola strain plp s-18 b and klebsiella pneumoniae strain plp g- 17 sc c. the homology shared with other closely related micro-organisms is also shown.

the isolates k. variicola strain plp g-17 lc and klebsiella pneumoniae strain plp g-17 sc showed similar pattern of tannin degradation.

the isolates were maintained in t-gsm broth as above.screening the isolates for tannase activitythe tannase activity and biodegradation of tannic acid were evaluated by incorporating filter-sterilized tannic acid 04 wv into culture medium singh et al.
