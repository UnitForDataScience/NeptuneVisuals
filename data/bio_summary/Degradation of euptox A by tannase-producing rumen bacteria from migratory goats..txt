1998 Thin-layer chromatography of gallic acid methyl gallate pyrogallol phloroglucinol catechol resorcinol hydroquinone catechin epicatechin cinnamic acid p-coumaric acid ferulic acid and tannic acid.

The isolates PLP G-17 LC PLP G-17 SC and PLP S-18 formed larger 2 mm diameter white to greyish round and mucoid colonies with prominent zone of clear- ance on culture medium containing tannic acid Fig.

The isolates namely PLP G-17 LC PLP G-17 SC and PLP S-18 were studied in view of their distinctive ability to grow on T-GSM- agar containing tannic acid 25 wv.The three isolates had identical morphological features when grown on different culture media namely brain heart infusion agar Wilkins Chalgren agar and anaerobic basal agar.

S- standards tannic acid gallic acid pyrogallol and resorcinol each 04 wv C-control that is culture medium containing tannic acid only.

Three rumen bacterial isolates producing tannase were studied and identified as Klebsiella variicola strain PLP G-17 LC K. variicola strain PLP S-18 and Klebsiella pneumoniae strain PLP G-17 SC.

The isolates PLP G-17 LC PLP G-17 SC and PLP S-18 were nonmotile nonspore forming scat- tered cells.

The tannase from isolates namely PLP G-17 LC PLP G-17 SC and PLP S-18 possessed an optimal activity at 40degC Fig.

Blue bar--Klebsiella variicola strain PLP G-17 LC orange bar--K. variicola strain PLP S-18 grey bar--Klebsiella pneumoniae strain PLP G-17 SC.

Blue bar--Kleb- siella variicola strain PLP G-17 LC orange bar--Klebsiella variicola strain PLP S-18 grey bar--Klebsiella pneumoniae strain PLP G-17 SC.

The mini- mum levels of euptox A that could be detected by TLC analysis were 50 lg and highest amount degraded by the isolates was 250 lg ml-1 of culture medium.Identification 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysisThe 16S rRNA sequencing of three isolates PLP G-17 LC PLP G-17 SC and PLP S-18 resulted in single band ofnearly 1500 bp.
