When examined at level 3 genes related to two component system bacterial chemotaxis Staphylococcus aureus infection bacterial motility proteins and bacterial secretion system bacterial invasion of epithelial cells andFigure 5.

Metabolic pathways involved in bacterial colonization and pro- liferation such as bacterial secretion system two component system S. aureus infection bacterial chemotaxis and bacterial motility protein pathogenic E. coli infection were overrepresented in AM and SAM respectively.

A LEfSe was used to compare abundance of all bacterial genera between healthy-controls SAM and AM samples.Significant bacterial genera were determined by Kruskal-Wallis test P  0.05 with LDA score greater than3.

These results together with shift in microbial com- position suggest that different metabolic pathways observed in mastitis individuals were mainly due to altered bacterial communities.In conclusion our study confirmed complex microbial diversity with significantly altered bacterial commu- nities and imputed functions in SAM and AM women.

two-component system bacterial secretion system and motility proteins in SAM and AM samples.

Uncultured bacteria accounted for 36.73 34.89 and 22.32 of total bacterial sequences in healthy-controls SAM and AM samples respectively.

SAM and AM samples were largely enriched in Proteobacteria while Firmicutes and Actinobacteria contributed to higher proportion of healthy bacterial sequences.

Circos representation of top most abundant bacterial genera between healthy-controls SAM and AM samples.

Differentially abundant bacterial taxa between healthy-controls SAM and AM samples.

Moreover nowadays there is great concern to include blank-control in metagenomic study but low microbial biomass and difficulty in amplifying bacterial sequences by PCR has assured us that our results reflects actual human milk microbial composition.When examined at species level we observed similar pattern of dysbiosis enrichment of opportunistic path- ogens and depletion of beneficial commensals in mastitis samples.
