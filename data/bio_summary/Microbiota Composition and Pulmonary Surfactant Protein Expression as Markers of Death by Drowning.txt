Although these genera were found in all samples in the drowning group they were not detected in closed organs of the postmortem submersion group.detected in the drowned group and in lung samples in the post- mortem submersion group at low levels but these genera were not detected in the closed organs of the postmortem submersion group in the seawater group.Histopathological AnalysisHE-stained sections showed diverse histological findings including hemorrhage congestion and edema.

The Ace index of freshwater was higher than that of seawater while the Shannon index was similar between freshwater and seawater.

4--Taxonomic composition of the bacterial communities revealed by 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing at the genus level in the seawater group A and freshwater group B.group but not in the closed organs and cardiac blood in the postmortem submersion group Fig.

Although all these microorganisms were not identified in the water samples some of the following bacteria can be found in aquatic environments Brucella 38 Rhodococcus 1539 Brevibacterium 4041Chryseobacterium 42 Serratia 4344 and Pantoea 45 in the seawater group and Clostridium 4647 in the freshwater group.

In the freshwater group the genus Clostridium and Clostridiumg4 predominatedin all samples in the drowned group and in the lungs in the post- mortem submersion group but not in the closed organs kidney and liver and blood Fig.

The total reads from cardiac blood and tissue samples are shown in Table 1.Bacterial Communities of Freshwater and SeawaterIllumina MiSeq sequencing analysis was performed to deter- mine the microbiota distribution and composition in freshwater and seawater.

The phylum Proteobac- teria alpha beta and gamma were more abundant in the seawater than the freshwater samples accounting for 68.44 of the community in the former.

The bacterial composition of the drown- ing medium samples was analyzed and Proteobacteria generally predominated in both freshwater and seawater.

The genera Morganella Escherichia and Enterococcus predomi- nated in not only drowned but also in postmortem submersion samples of seawater and freshwater.

Therefore we analyzed the microbiota and histological appearance of the drowned group postmortem group and control group in this study.The bacterial composition differed between freshwater and marine water.
