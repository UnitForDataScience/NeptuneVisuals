Our study provides pre- liminary descriptive data on the microbiota of the two most commonSample descriptions based on species sexlife stage location of collection and number of ticks.human-associated ticks in the province of Ontario I. scapularis and D. variabilis .Families Planococcaceae Moraxelleceae and Xanthomonadeceae and genera Persicirhabdus were observed in both I. scapularis and D. variabilis at a high median relative abundance i.e.

Dominant families and genera.Table A1Dominant median relative abundance  1 families and genera of I. scapularis samples n  10.Table A2Dominant median relative abundance  1 families and genera of D. variabilis samples n  9.Appendix B.

For I. scapularis there were 246 families and 773 genera while for D. variabilis 251 families and 766 genera were identified.The most abundant families in I. scapularis were an unclassified Clostridiales Ruminococcaceae and an unclassified Bacteria.

The four I. scapularis samples from Ontario had high relative abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae which is similar to our study while the I. scapularis from Nova Scotia were dominated by the Rickettsiaceae .

To examine the microbiota of these two species we collected adult and nymphal I. scapularis and D. variabilis from the eastern and southern regions of the province via tick dragging and conducted next generation sequencing of 19 samples composed of 45 ticks via Illumina MiSeq.

Ticks were categorized based on species D. variabilis or I. scapularis location east or south sex male or female and life stage adult or nymph.DNA extractionAll tick samples were rinsed in 70 ethanol followed by sterile distilled water.

This data analysis was completed in mothur and visualized using the Galaxywebserver .ResultsIn total 19 samples 11 single 8 pooled which represented 36 I. scapularis and 9 D. variabilis ticks were processed .

The median relative abundance of microbial genera in I. scapularis and D. variabilis samples.

examined 778 D. variabilis samples in Ontario and detected low levels of R. montanensis and R. peacockii and these species are not associated with human disease   .Previous studies examining the microbiota of I. scapularis have consistently identified Rickettsia as well as Ralstonia Wolbachia Bacillus and Lactobacillus .
