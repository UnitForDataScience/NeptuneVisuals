We aimed to identify the factors that contributed substantially to infant microbiota shifts in Slovenian geographic locality to relate them to infant growth and development during the first year and finally to determine the microbial shifts directly associated with infant growth and development at first year.A comprehensive knowledge on the fecal microbial experience in the period of the microbiota acquisition and its relevance to the multiple early life exposures and clinical and developmental outcomes would not only enable to identify the critical determinants of an 'aberrantly' colonized gut but would also lead to the appropri- ate tailoring of the consortia in its initial confined momentum.

Moreover longitudinal studies were reported to introduce the temporal developmental dynamics.Our longitudinal exploratory study aims to investigate the hypothesis that early and time-framed perinatal clinical events and environmental circumstances alter infant microbial gut colonization by affecting the abun- dances of specific microbiota members which introduces changes in infant metabolic programming and reflects in later infant growth and development.

In European infants differential environmental circumstances were suggested to affect gut microbi- ota development in compositional shifts following 'north-south' geographic gradient.Unique and immensely complex mature gastrointestinal tract GIT microbial communities result from the intrinsic microbial interactions and their developmental host-associated determinants which are still not satis- factorily understood.

.Samples dominant in the class Bacilli comprised of the cumulative relative abundance of staphylococci streptococci enterococci and lactobacilli prevailed 3 days after birth 55 while in the majority of later sam- ples Bifidobacterium group was recognized as the most abundant among the microbial groups surveyed.Infants classified on the basis of fecal microbiota composition into four groups as suggested by Dogra et al.

Briefly after homogenization lysis and sonication sam- ples were transferred to Maxwell 16 Tissue DNA Purification Kit Promega and the obtained 167 commu- nity DNA extracts served as a template for qPCR amplification of the following microbial groups all bacteria Bacteroides-Prevotella group Bifidobacterium group Clostridium leptum group Clostridium coccoides group Enterobacteriaceae group Enterococcus group Enterococcus faecalis Lactobacillus group Lactobacillus gasseri Staphylococcus group Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus group.Maxwell DNA extracts from the respective microscopically enumerated pure-culture bacteria as specified by Obermajer et al.

Sample prevalence and reaction parameters of qPCR investigated microbial groups.Health complications reported for five infants at the end of the first month were in comparison to healthy subjects 52 associated with a shift in Streptococcus at third month m 5.5 x 10-4 r 1.9 x 10-4-2.4 x 10-3 vs. m 3.8 x 10-3 r 1.8 x 10-4-4.4 x 10-2 p  0.015 and finally seven babies with health issues recorded at third month compared to the healthy subpopulation 50 were associated with higher proportion  of Bacteroides-Prevotella m1.5 x 101 r 1.5 x 10-4-3.1 x 101 vs. m 2.4 x 10-3 r 7.9 x 10-5-1.2 x 101 p  0.025in samples at third month.Maternal antibiotic treatments after birth characterized six infants at the end of their third month com- pared to those whose mothers were not exposed to antibiotics 51 by lower proportion  of Lactobacillus m 3 x 10-4 r 1.2 x 10-4-5.3 x 10-3 vs. m 3.4 x 10-3 r 1.4 x 10-4-3.6 x 10-1 p  0.031.

Though the most versatile microbial associations with the external parameters related to the pace of the 'evolutionary taxa colonization' in our study were found with respect to infant early feeding pattern and early health.Relative abundances of bacterial genera in the three months old infants were reported to be affected by for- mula type of feeding resulting in a lower Bacteroides and higher Firmicutes Clostridium XVIII Lachnospiraceae Streptococcus Enterococcus and Veillonella.

Mode of delivery however reflected only in the first month Enterococcus faecalis proportions.Infant early phenotypes - higher weight and lower ponderal index at first month were associated with decreased proportions of group Bacteroides-Prevotella which could suggest its protective role in infant development.Chiefly we would like to expose here the early mixed feeding practices and antibiotic treated health issues for the manifestation of the most diverse and even extended shifts in microbial proportions related to the 'evolution- ary' important taxa in infant gut.

The microbial representatives were analyzed in 167 fecal samples day 3 postpartum PP 56 samples day 30 PP 57 samples day 90 PP 54 samples and samples from all three time points were retrieved from 51 85 subjects.The formation of the initial gut microbiota in breastfed infants 36 gestational weeks was characterized by an increased relative abundance of genus Bifidobacterium during the first three months while relative abundances of staphylococci and enterococci simultaneously decreased Fig.
