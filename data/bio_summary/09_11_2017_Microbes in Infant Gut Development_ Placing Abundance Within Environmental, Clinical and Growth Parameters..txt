we aimed to identify the factors that contributed substantially to infant microbiota shifts in slovenian geographic locality to relate them to infant growth and development during the first year and finally to determine the microbial shifts directly associated with infant growth and development at first year.a comprehensive knowledge on the fecal microbial experience in the period of the microbiota acquisition and its relevance to the multiple early life exposures and clinical and developmental outcomes would not only enable to identify the critical determinants of an 'aberrantly' colonized gut but would also lead to the appropri- ate tailoring of the consortia in its initial confined momentum.

additionally lower birth weight was associated with higher bmi z1i-z0i bmi z3i-z0i and bmi z12i-z0i p 0.01 but not with wg z-scores.in our study infants experiencing health issues at birth and during first month manifested also higher wg z-scores p 0.05. even though relative abundances of single microbes were not directly associated with growth parameters the health variables at the observed time-intersections were found extendedly associated with dif- ferential proportions in some microbial groups.

during the first three months bacteroides-prevotella group was detected only in one third of samples from slovenian infants but the average counts were higher 1-2 logs compared to the study by arboleya et al.. average values for thefigure 3. diagram presenting values for the exposed significant associations between the infant growth parameters and presumptive perinatal growth confounders.lactobacilli at first month and enterobacteria during the period of three months in our study were comparable to spanish infants.within the first six months of life an earlier acquisition of an anaerobic microbiome dominated by bifidobacterium and collinsella was found associated with typical adiposity at 18 months of age.

though certain firmicutes populations on the lower taxonomic scale were reported to be associated with childhood obesity.in search for a time-dependent early gut stimuli associated with the expected growth in infants white et al.examined the detection of the probe signals in the fecal samples of term vaginally born norwegian infants initially not exposed to antibiotics.

moreover longitudinal studies were reported to introduce the temporal developmental dynamics.our longitudinal exploratory study aims to investigate the hypothesis that early and time-framed perinatal clinical events and environmental circumstances alter infant microbial gut colonization by affecting the abun- dances of specific microbiota members which introduces changes in infant metabolic programming and reflects in later infant growth and development.

infants born to elder mothers had lower pi 90 and lower bf at first year.finally for the mode of delivery and residential environment no associations with anthropometric or growth parameters were established.discussionthe successional evolution of microbes residing in the gut of neonates surveyed in our study generally resem- bled the colonization stages proposed by dogra et al.. however the microbial profiles established 3 days after birth prevailed in bacterial groups from the class bacilli thought to be a common characteristic for the prema- ture infants.

mode of delivery however reflected only in the first month enterococcus faecalis proportions.infant early phenotypes - higher weight and lower ponderal index at first month were associated with decreased proportions of group bacteroides-prevotella which could suggest its protective role in infant development.chiefly we would like to expose here the early mixed feeding practices and antibiotic treated health issues for the manifestation of the most diverse and even extended shifts in microbial proportions related to the 'evolution- ary' important taxa in infant gut.

yet bacteroides-prevotella relative abundance in one month old infants was found inversely associated with infant's first month weight p 0.028 formula supplementation p 0.004 and prior maternal smoking p 0.031 while positive association for this bacterial group was demonstrated with pi at first month pi 30 in samples from all three time intersections p 0.041 p  0.022 p  0.048. during the periodtable 4. multiple regression analysis of the associations of logit transformed relative abundances of microbial groups with demographic environmental clinical and anthropometric characteristics of the mother-infant pairs.

sound and timely microbial stimuli during a nonrandom colonization process were addressed for their importance in the intestinal barrier development activation and maturation of baby's immune system central nervous system development metabolic system programming and were finally linked to infant's growth velocity and later life weight development-.fetal course of growth set by genetic and environmental determinants at an early developmental phase finally results in the size at birth-.

bmi pi and bf were calcu- lated according to slaughter et al.. infant's expected growth was defined using the world health organisation's who child growth standards 2006. sex standardized bmi-for-age z-scores not adjusted for a gestational age were calculated by lmsgrowth excel add-inbased on the captured dataset gender age specified as days pp and bmi.

in european infants differential environmental circumstances were suggested to affect gut microbi- ota development in compositional shifts following 'north-south' geographic gradient.unique and immensely complex mature gastrointestinal tract git microbial communities result from the intrinsic microbial interactions and their developmental host-associated determinants which are still not satis- factorily understood.

though the most versatile microbial associations with the external parameters related to the pace of the 'evolutionary taxa colonization' in our study were found with respect to infant early feeding pattern and early health.relative abundances of bacterial genera in the three months old infants were reported to be affected by for- mula type of feeding resulting in a lower bacteroides and higher firmicutes clostridium xviii lachnospiraceae streptococcus enterococcus and veillonella.

multivariate regression analysis was applied to evaluate microbial dynamics with respect to infant demographic environmental clinical characteristics and first year growth data.
