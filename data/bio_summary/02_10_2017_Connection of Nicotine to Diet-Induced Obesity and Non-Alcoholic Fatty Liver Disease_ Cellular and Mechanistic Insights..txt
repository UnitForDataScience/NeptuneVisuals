This review discusses emerging evidence of contribution of nicotine when combined with obesity to the development of hepatic steatosis and insights into the molecular mechanisms by which nicotine contributes to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD.nAFLD is Highly Prevalent in Obese individuals and Can Be exaggerated by SmokingNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver disorder and is associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus.

Emerging evidence now suggests that nicotine exacerbates hepatic steatosis triggered by HFD through increased oxi- dative stress and hepatocellular apoptosis decreased phosphorylation inactivation of adenosine-5-monophosphate-activated protein kinase and in turn up-regulation of sterol response-element binding protein 1-c fatty acid synthase and activation of acetyl-coenzyme A-carboxylase leading to increased hepatic lipogenesis.

There is also growing evidence that chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress through regulation of several pathways leading to oxidative stress inflammation perturbed hepatic lipid homeostasis apoptosis and autophagy can induce hepatic steatosis and its progression to NASH.

Phosphorylation of IRS1 leads to its degradation and the subsequent inhibition of Akt resulting in increased adipose tissue lipolysis and circulating FFA levels .The Role of eR StressChronic ER stress induces several pathways leading to oxida- tive stress inflammation perturbed hepatic lipid homeostasis apoptosis and autophagy that can lead to hepatic steatosis and its progression to NASH reviewed in Ref.

There is also growing evidence that chronic ER stress through regulation of several pathways leading to oxidative stress inflammation perturbed hepatic lipid homeostasis apoptosis and autophagy can also induce hepatic steatosis and its progression to NASH.

The multiple mechanisms of nicotine and obesity-induced hepatic steatosis is mediated by both its nAChR-mediated and non-receptor effects.A better understanding of the mechanisms and various diverse signaling pathways responsible for nicotine plus HFD-induced NAFLD may also unveil novel pharmacological targets to treat fatty liver disease and adverse metabolic sequelae.

Gastric bypass surgery is protective from high-fat diet-induced non-alcho- holic fatty liver disease and hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Clearly further studies are needed to define the role of ER stress in fatty liver disease trig- gered by nicotine and HFD.Connections of Gut Microbiota to nAFLDEvidence linking dysbiosis also known as disruption of the nor- mal gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of NAFLD has accumulated rapidly -.
