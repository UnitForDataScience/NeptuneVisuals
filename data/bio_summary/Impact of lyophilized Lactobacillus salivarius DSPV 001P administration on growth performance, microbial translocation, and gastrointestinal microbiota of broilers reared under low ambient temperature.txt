Then broilers continued eating diet without inoculum ad libitum.Biosafety standardsA set of management practices were designed to prevent the entry and transmission of the probiotic strain to C-G we agreed that different overalls and overshoes for P-G and C-G should be used and made itcompulsory to apply a disinfectant before entering and leaving eachgroup place trays with lime at the entrance gates to each broiler house ban visitors' entry and dispose of dead broilers properly.NecropsiesProgrammed necropsies were performed on four randomly selected broilers from each experimental group one per replicate at d 0 and once a week after the administration of the probiotic bacteria.

In future trials a higher dose and a shorter test time could favour the expression of the probiotic effect of this strain.It is known that the probiotic efficacy varies greatly and depends on many factors such as inocula composition strain type administration level doses method and frequency of application animal health overall diet farm hygiene and environmental conditions  .

Two hundred and forty one-day-old male Cobb broilers were randomly distributed into two treatment groups a probiotic group and a control group with four replicates per treatment and 30 broilers per replicate.

The results showed that probiotic treatment significantly improved body weight of broilers when compared with the control group.

Similarly supplementation tended to reduce the rate of mortality with 12 deaths occurring in the probiotic group and 20 in the control group.

Each probiotic candidate should meet a number of re- quirements including safety functional and beneficial characteristics.

In poultry production emphasis has been placed on the selection preparation and application of probiotic strains espe- cially lactic acid bacteria LAB .

However experimental results are contradictory and variations in the effectiveness about the use of defined cultures may be attributed to differences in the bacterial strains used as dietary supplements.To take maximum advantage of the benefits of microorganisms with probiotic capacity it is desirable to use autochthonous strains isolated from the same ecosystem of which they will be part once ingested .

It is therefore logical to consider that autochthonous strains constitute better probiotic strains for some applications .
