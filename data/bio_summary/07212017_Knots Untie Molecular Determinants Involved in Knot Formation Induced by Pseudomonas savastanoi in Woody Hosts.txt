syringae complex containing bacteria causing tumors in woody hosts namely Psv Psn Psr P. meliae P. tremae and P. syringae pathovars cerasicola daphniphylli dendropanacis myricae and rhaphiolepidis .While artificial infections with Psv Psn and Psr strains cause knots Psf isolates induce cankers accompanied by wart-like excrescences in both ash and olive.

However this secondary T3SS has not been related to pathogenicity and its function remains unclear  .Although most studies on the role and structure of the T3SS in strains within the P. syringae complex have focused on bacteria isolated from herbaceous hosts P. savastanoi also encodes a complete and functional T3SS which is phylogenetically related to that of other strains of the P. syringae complex     .

However it is now clear that P. savastanoi belongs to a larger phylogenetic group which should be called P. amygdali when elevated to the species rank comprising 25 pathovars and four additional Pseudomonas species and that pathovars Psv Psn Psf and Psr are phylogenetically closer to other pathovars infecting trees than to pv.
