Read-level binning by sequence composition can isolate reads from low-abundance species that do not assemble into contigs while read-level binning by methylation profiles can segregate reads from multiple strains for the purpose of separate strain-specific de novo genome assemblies.

a 5-mer frequency-based binning of assembled contigs and raw reads length 15 kb from the Human Microbiome Project mock community where only the unassembled reads are labeled.

c Combined assembly of a synthetic mixture of reads from H. pylori strains J99 and 26995 results in one small contig containing mostly reads from strain 26695 and one large highly chimeric contig.

f Combined assembly of a synthetic mixture of reads from E. coli strains BAA-2196 O26H11 BAA-2215 O103H11 and BAA-2440 O111 results in many chimeric contigs that contain reads from all three strains.

After combin- ing sequences from both the contigs and unassembled reads previously sequenced from a 20-member mock community Supplementary Table 2 we visualized and labeled the reads in the t-SNE map of 5- mer frequency features for all sequences Supplementary Methods.

To explore whether methylation binning could be extended to the level of unassembled reads we constructed two synthetic mixtures of reads from 1 two strains of H. pylori and 2 three strains of E. coli Supplementary Table 2.

Bulk assem- bly of the mixture of error-corrected reads resulted in many chimeric contigs and very few contigs that were specific to a strain  but binning the reads by methylation profiles across four differentiating motifs  Supplementary Table 9 before assembly resulted in a substantial increase in the purity of contigs .DISCUSSIONWe report that microbial DNA methylation can be exploited as endog- enous epigenetic barcodes to complement coverage and composition features to improve metagenomic binning.

SMRT reads were obtained separately from eight individual bacterial spe- cies Supplementary Table 2 and the reads were mixed without any labe- ling by combining one SMRT cell of sequencing from each species to create a synthetic metagenomic mixture at similar relative abundances.

We first determined the species identity for all reads by aligning the reads to reference assemblies for each species.
