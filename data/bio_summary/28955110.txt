The tested strains were most frequently resistant to erythromycin and least frequently to ciprofloxacin and gentamycin.Among the analyzed staphylococci 17 isolates 30.9 were susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents 20 isolates 36.3 were resistant to one 10isolates 18.2 to 2 6 isolates 10.9 to 3 1 strain1.8 was resistant to 5 and yet another 1 strain to 6 antimicrobial agents tested in this study.The incidence of the mechanisms of resistance to macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics is shown in Table .Table 2 Share of individual staphylococci species in the iso- lated materialTable 3 AntimicrobialAntimicrobial agentNumberpercentage of resistant strains n  55resistance of the studied Staphylococcus spp.

Disk-diffusion tests demonstrated that 9.1 of the tested Staphylo- coccus strains showed inducible mechanism of resis- tance to macrolides lincosamides and streptograminsIn the case of constitutive mechanism it was 14.5 of the tested strains.

reported that 47 of S. epidermidis strains tested in their study showed constitutive mechanism while inducible one was detected in 8 of strains.

In total 55 strains belonging to the genus Staphylococcus were isolated from 45 sites and 13 species of coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified.

Subsequently Gram- stained smears were microscopically observed and the furazolidone susceptibility test was performed in order to discriminate the Staphylococcus genus from the Micrococcus strains.

Furazolidone-susceptible strains were classified as Staphylococcus spp.
