for the l-20 group the lyophilized sample was stored frozen at -20c for a period of 3 6 and 12 months.metagenomic dna extractiona 'fast dna spin kit for soil' mp bio1 biomedicals illkirch france extraction kit was used to extract metagenomic dna from 200 mg of sample according to the manufacturer's instructions.

in the other groups meta- genomic dna extraction was performed at the indicated storage time for each group 3 6 or 12 months.all rumen samples were analysed for dry matter dm by drying at 105c for 24 h to express the apparent specific metagenomic dna yield as mg of dna per dry weight of rumen of sample.

reactions were held at 95c for 3 min to denature the dna with amplification proceeding for 40 cycles at 95c for 30 s 53.8c for 30 s and 72c for 45 s a final extension of 10 min at 72c was added to ensure complete amplification.the expected fragment length of pcr products was verified by agarose gel 1 electropho- resis and the amplicon size was estimated by comparison with a 1 kb plus dna ladder 1 kb plus dna ladder invitrogen carlsbad ca usa.

moreover 73.83 of dna was recovered from the p-20 group and the p-80 group resulted in a high p  0.001 recovery of 91.83 of dna obtained from the pc group.the relative absorbance readings for a 260a280 nm and a 260a230 nm 1.89 - 0.08 and1.95 - 0.19 median - iqr respectively were not affected by the time or rumen sample storage method p  0.05. dna integrity determined by agarose gel apparently was not affected when the rumen samples were not stored .

the purity of metagenomic dna was assessed spectrophotometrically at a260a230 nm and a260a280 nm ratios were obtained to indicate contamination of dna with buffer salts and organic compounds.

each sample was amplified in triplicate and each pcr reaction mixture 20 ml final volume contained 20 ng of metagenomic dna 10 mm of each forward and reverse primers1.25 mm of magnesium chloride 200 mm of dntp mix invitrogen carlsbad ca usa 1.0 u platinum taq dna polymerase high fidelity invitrogen carlsbad ca usa high fidelity pcr buffer 1x and milli-q water.

a probability of p  0.05 was considered sig- nificant for all tests.resultsmetagenomic dna yield and puritythe specific yield mg dnag sample of metagenomic dna varied depending on the sample storage time and rumen sample storage method used when both were quantified by spectro- photometry  p  0.001 or fluorometry  p  0.001. thus when the rumen samples were not stored pc and lc groups no effects of the sample storage method were observed p  0.05. however after 3 months of storage both pellet sample groups p-80 and p-20 showed higher yield than the lyophilized samples at -20c l-20.

pc  pellet control lc  lyophilized control p-20  pellet stored frozen at -20c p-80  pellet stored frozen at -80c l-20  lyophilized sample stored frozen at -20c.group showed a greater yield of metagenomic dna than the other groups after 6 months of storage.therefore the l -20 storage method cannot maintain the yield of dna.

at 12 months of storage for the l-20 group 21.83 of dna extracted from the lc group was recovered result- ing in metagenomic dna losses of approximately 6.5 per month of rumen sample storage.

this difference is most clearly shown in principal coordinate analyses and sug- gested that in the rumen samples even without storage and similar yield and integrity dna the type of rumen sample processing before the extraction of metagenomic dna can influence the final result of the rumen microbial population studies.

this highlights the importance standardizing the processing method for rumen samples in microbiological labs and in the scientific community to allow for comparability of results.despite the similar apparent metagenomic dna yield between methods at time 0 of stor- age the high percentage of metagenomic dna loss in the l-20 group during storage makes this method less suitable when ruminal samples must be stored for over three months.

thus comparisons of results from studies in which the storage time and storage techniques of the ruminal samples are different should be done with caution.moreover it is not advisable to store rumen samples when studying specific groups that show high sensitivity to storage such as bacteria of the fibrobacteres phylum this microbial group is considered the most important phylum for the degradation of cellulosic plant biomass in the guts of herbivores  and has been greatly studied for its high industrial potential in the production of cellulases .the lowest apparent yield of metagenomic dna assessed by fluorometry when compared to evaluation by spectrophotometry can be due to the uv absorbance readings measuring molecules that absorb at 260 nm including simple dna and rna tapes .

furthermore the fluorescence can be deactivated by co-reagents or materials extracted from the rumen together with metagenomic dna .additionally the relative absorbance readings at a260a280 nm and a260a 230 nm have significance for most molecular biology techniques because they are used for the determina- tion of metagenomic dna purity  .

our results showed that the purity of metagenomic dna extracted after all storage methods and storage times was similar suggesting that this variable is marginally affected by storage of the rumen sample.conclusionthe results of this study suggest that the tested methods of storage for rumen contents influ- ence the yield of extracted metagenomic dna as well as results of analysis of the rumen bacte- rial community composition.
