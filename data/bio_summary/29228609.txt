Poor oral hygiene has been associated with oral cancers suggesting that oral bacteriome bacterial community and mycobiome fungal community could play a role.

Our results demonstrate differences in bacteriome and mycobiome between OMTC and their matched normal oral epithelium and their association with T-stage.INTRODUCTIONSquamous cell carcinoma of the oral mobile tongue arising at the anterior two-thirds of the tongue has been rapidly increasing and has now become the second most common malignancy in the oral cavity 1 2.

In this exploratory study we selected oral tongue cancers to minimize confounding contributions from HPV and from multiple oral sites and sought to determine whether there were differences in the bacteriome andor mycobiome between oral tongue cancers and matched normal tissue and to evaluate if bacteriome andor mycobiome differences are correlated with clinico-pathologic features.RESULTSTissue samples from 39 patients were analyzed in this study Table 1.

Another study with a more limited sample size used superficial bacterial sampling of 15 oral cavity cancers by means of oral swabs and found differences in taxonomic abundance between normal and tumor surfaces at the phylum level 10.

Although the role of the mycobiome in oral cancer including oral tongue cancer has not been investigated a recent study by Shelburne et al.

14 combined genetic analyses of the infecting agent host whole exome sequencing and longitudinal determinationof the oral and stool micro- and mycobiomes in a leukemic patient and suggested that the dysbiotic nature of the oral bacteriome may have provided a permissive environment for establishment and the eventual development of invasive mucormycosis.

In addition levels ofFigure 1 Principal coordinates analysis of oral tongue tumor samples and matched non-tumor oral epithelium samples at the phylum left and genus right levels for A-B bacteriome or C-D mycobiome.

In this regard acetaldehyde derived from alcohol metabolism has been proposed as the oral carcinogen linked to oral cancers due to alcohol consumption.

In the presence of alcohol exposure and increased abundances of microbes that produce acetaldehyde such as Rothia Streptococus and Prevotella 35 we could postulate that increased oral acetaldehyde could promote oral carcinogenesis.
