in the scope of their extraordinary bioactivity the technologically controlled addition of hydroxytyrosol tyrosol or elenolic acid derivatives to food may be considered favorable as they possess strong health beneficial ef- fects in contrast to traditional preservative agents.although activities modes of action and food applicability need to be further investigated the existing results indicate the potential use of defined o. europaea extracts or contained compounds like oleuropein hydroxytyrosol oleacein or oleacanthal as natural pre- servative compounds in food products.

although hydroxytyrosol was the most abundant phe- nolic compound in all extracts tested the study showed that cultivar and processing technology dependent changes in phenolic composi- tions have a considerable impact on the antimicrobial potential of crude olive extracts .regarding the recovery of antimicrobial active phenolic compounds from o. europaea l. plant parts the fruits appear to be of minor impor- tance.

this renders them highly interesting for alternative exploitation such as the produc- tion of phenolic extracts for food preservation or health associated applications.application of antimicrobial extracts and compounds from olea europaea l. in foodrecent findings on the antimicrobial efficiency of selected bioactive phytochemicals from olea europaea l. quickly led to the idea to exploit these compounds as natural green food preservatives.

l. monocytogenes was resistant to hydroxytyrosol at 0.042 mgml which equals the mean concentration of hydroxytyrosol in the virgin olive oils investigated by the authors .the hydroxytyrosol concentrations used by  and must be consid- ered exceedingly low.

in summary defined extracts from olive fruit or leaves containing the strongest antimicrobial compounds hydroxytyrosol oleacein or oleacanthal in considerable concentrations appear to be suitable for food preserva- tion.

in com- parison to the other studies on omww reviewed this extract was dom- inated by oleacein instead of hydroxytyrosol .concerning their potential antimicrobial activities crude omww extracts appear to be less investigated but have proven to be reliable sources of phenolic compounds which are known to exhibit antimicro- bial effects.
