Up to now there has been no clinical trial to assess the effects of these supplements on insulin resistance and risk of diabetes development in patients with prediabetes.Hence this study has been designed to investigate the efficacy of probiotic and synbiotic administration in the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic variables in prediabetics via a parallel-group randomized triple- blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.The aims and hypothesesGeneral aimThe general aim of the present investigation is to deter- mine the effects of 6 months ingestion of probiotic or synbiotic on metabolic syndrome indices and gut micro- biota composition through a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults at risk of type 2 diabetes prediabetes.The specific aims and hypothesesAim 1To determine whether probiotic or synbiotic supplementa- tion improves fasting plasma glucose insulin resistance primary outcome and beta-cell function in individuals at elevated risk of developing T2DM.

The groups are probiotic synbiotic 6 grams inulin  probioticTable 1 Eligibility criteria for the effects of probiotic or synbiotic supplementation on metabolic syndrome indicesInclusion criteriaPopulation men and women 35-75 years oldPrediabetic FBG  100-125 OR 2hBS  140-199 via OGTTInformed consent Exclusion criteriaCurrent smokers suspected or definite history of alcohol or drug abuse historyAntibiotic use in the past 3 months or during the treatment period Using probiotic prebiotic or symbiotic during the past 3 months Noncompliance in consumption of the supplementsBeing pregnantHaving gastrointestinal diseases i.e.

The supplements which will be assigned letter A B or C are otherwise identical and the participants investigators outcome as- sessors and data analysts will be blinded after assign- ment to interventions.Statistical analysisRecord data including outcome data and adverse events will be double-entered on SPSS software Version 15 SPSS Inc. Chicago IL USA to secure its validity.

Most health aspects of prebiotics have been directed toward obesity and inflam- mation Furthermore probiotic supplementation has been shown to reduce metabolic endotoxemia and improve glycemic control in rodents Therefore it is hypothe- sized that prebiotic andor probiotic supplementation may be a useful strategy to improve metabolic health insulin re- sistance and prevent type 2 diabetes which could be inter- esting in the management of metabolic disorders in prediabetics.

We hypothesize that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation will improve fasting plasma glucose insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in these individuals compared with placebo.Aim 2To determine whether probiotic or synbiotic supplemen- tation will improve lipid profiles in individuals at elevated risk of developing T2DM.

We hypothesize that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation will reduce serum trigly- ceride and non-high-density lipoprotein HDL choles- terol elevate HDL cholesterol and improve low-density lipoprotein LDLHDL total cholesterol TCHDL and triglyceride TGHDL in these individuals.Aim 3To determine whether probiotic or synbiotic supplemen- tation will improve anthropometric indicators in individ- uals at elevated risk of developing T2DM.

We hypothesize that the change in Gram-positive gut microbiota Firmicutesand Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio with probiotic and synbiotic supplementation will be correlated with the change observed in the metabolic variables.Aim 5To compare the effects of probiotic and synbiotic sup- plements on gut microbiota anthropometric glycemic and lipid profiles.

De- scriptive univariate analyses on all study variables through presenting them as mean - standard deviation SD for normally distributed continuous or median interquartile range IQR for nonnormal quantitative data and frequency percentage for categorical data will be conducted.

Based on patterns and the mechanism of missing data an ap- propriate multiple imputation approach will be followed for completing missing data.

Through employing these methods the possibility for using all available data to construct weighted averages across the different patterns of missing data to provide valid point estimates and confidence intervals for population pa- rameters will be provided .
