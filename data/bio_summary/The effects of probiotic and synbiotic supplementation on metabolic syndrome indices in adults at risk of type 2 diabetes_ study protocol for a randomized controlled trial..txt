up to now there has been no clinical trial to assess the effects of these supplements on insulin resistance and risk of diabetes development in patients with prediabetes.hence this study has been designed to investigate the efficacy of probiotic and synbiotic administration in the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic variables in prediabetics via a parallel-group randomized triple- blind placebo-controlled clinical trial.the aims and hypothesesgeneral aimthe general aim of the present investigation is to deter- mine the effects of 6 months ingestion of probiotic or synbiotic on metabolic syndrome indices and gut micro- biota composition through a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults at risk of type 2 diabetes prediabetes.the specific aims and hypothesesaim 1to determine whether probiotic or synbiotic supplementa- tion improves fasting plasma glucose insulin resistance primary outcome and beta-cell function in individuals at elevated risk of developing t2dm.

we hypothesize that the change in gram-positive gut microbiota firmicutesand firmicutes-to-bacteroidetes ratio with probiotic and synbiotic supplementation will be correlated with the change observed in the metabolic variables.aim 5to compare the effects of probiotic and synbiotic sup- plements on gut microbiota anthropometric glycemic and lipid profiles.

firmicutes are the largest phylum of bacteria comprising more than 200 genera and the bacteroidetes include over 20 bac- terial genera most of the studies in humans and in mice have reported that obesity and impaired glucose metabolism are associated with an altered ratio of firmi- cutes and bacteroidetes  it is documented that the ratio of bacteroidetes to fir- micutes is positively and significantly correlated with plasma glucose concentrations in a study in mice obesity has been associated with a 50 reduction in bacteroidetes and increase in firmicutes .an approach for modulation in the gut microbiota is the use of oral viable strains of bacteria probiotics indi- gestible carbohydrates prebiotics or synergistic combi- nations of a probiotic and prebiotic synbiotic  .based on previous studies prebiotics result in specific changes in the activity andor composition of the gut microbiota mostly in rodent models which can be benefi- cial for local and systemic host health.

most health aspects of prebiotics have been directed toward obesity and inflam- mation furthermore probiotic supplementation has been shown to reduce metabolic endotoxemia and improve glycemic control in rodents therefore it is hypothe- sized that prebiotic andor probiotic supplementation may be a useful strategy to improve metabolic health insulin re- sistance and prevent type 2 diabetes which could be inter- esting in the management of metabolic disorders in prediabetics.

we hypothesize that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation will improve fasting plasma glucose insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in these individuals compared with placebo.aim 2to determine whether probiotic or synbiotic supplemen- tation will improve lipid profiles in individuals at elevated risk of developing t2dm.

we hypothesize that probiotic and synbiotic supplementation will reduce serum trigly- ceride and non-high-density lipoprotein hdl choles- terol elevate hdl cholesterol and improve low-density lipoprotein ldlhdl total cholesterol tchdl and triglyceride tghdl in these individuals.aim 3to determine whether probiotic or synbiotic supplemen- tation will improve anthropometric indicators in individ- uals at elevated risk of developing t2dm.

participants laboratory staff and investigators will be blinded to the allocation of probiotic synbiotic or placebo which will be conducted by the study pharmacist who will then dispense blinded supplements or placebo to the investigators.

product standardization and palatability testing participants will be supplemented with 6 gd of either syn- biotics comprising a probiotic with an inulin-based pre- biotic probiotics containing the freeze-dried lactobacillus acidophilus bifidobacter bifidum bifidobacter lactis and bifidobacter longum 109 for each with maltodextrin as filler or placebo including maltodextrin for 6 months.table 2 time schedule of enrollment interventions assessments and visits for participantsweekvisits and activitiesprior to starting the studypatients who meet eligibility criteria will be asked to read and sign the consent formweek 1patients will be instructed on writing the food and physical activity records and proceduresfor collection of stool samples.

all of the outcome data will be collected even for participants who discontinue or devi- ate from intervention protocols.randomizationa computer-generated list of random numbers is used to create a series of sequentially numbered envelopes containing equal assignments to either placebo pro- biotic or symbiotic.

de- scriptive univariate analyses on all study variables through presenting them as mean - standard deviation sd for normally distributed continuous or median interquartile range iqr for nonnormal quantitative data and frequency percentage for categorical data will be conducted.

data will be evaluated for the presence of outliers violations of normality and missing data.

to test our hypothesis that probiotic and syn- biotic supplementations will improve main outcomes in prediabetic participants a repeated measures analysis ofvariance anova with a between-subject factors ap- proach will be used.
