Bacteroidaceae p  0.01 Figure 2A and S3C.We transplanted cecal microbiota from either conventionally-raised B6 B6-CR or CAST CAST-CR donor mice into 9-week-old B6-GF recipient mice to yield B6B6 or B6CAST mice respectively.

These results suggest that the effectiveness of insulin to maintain euglycemia was greater in the mice receiving the CAST microbiota than in mice receiving the B6 microbiota Figure 3E-F.16S rRNA gene profiling of the donor cecal inoculum and transplant recipient fecal samples show that recipient mice were successfully colonized with the donor's microbiota.

The BA composition of B6B6 mice closely resembled that of B6-CR donor mice whereas B6CAST exhibited a BA profile that was intermediate between CAST-CR and B6-CR mice Figure 5A.

They also suggest that the differential responses to prolonged HFHS diet consumption between B6 and CAST mice could be mediated at least in part by differences in microbial BA metabolism.Kreznar et al.Page 9Gut microbiota influences insulin secretionThe most dramatic phenotype difference we observed between B6B6 and B6CAST mice was in insulin secretion where B6CAST mice had a blunted insulin response during the oGTT Figure 3E.

Despite the high abundance of Bacteroidaceae in B6CAST mice we did not observe complete protection from diet-induced metabolic disease that we observed in CAST-CR mice suggesting that hostKreznar et al.Page 11factors or taxa that failed to colonize transplanted mice e.g.

Consistent with this B6B6 mice had significantly higher levels of secondary BA as well as hydrophobic BA species than B6CAST mice Figure 5B-C and S6C-D both of which are elevated in humans and mice with insulin resistance Ryan et al.

We detected higher levels of LCA and DCA in the feces and plasma of B6B6 mice relative to B6CAST mice Figure 5B and S6C-D along with increased expression of Fxr in pancreatic islets from B6B6 mice Figure 6B.

With the exception of NZO mice which did not survive past 18 weeks on the HFHS diet B6 mice were the most responsive to diet.

2015 where B6 CAST and NOD mice showed the greatest microbiome response to diet Figure S3A.We detected eight bacterial phyla among the mice Figure S3B.

B6B6 mice gained 25 more weight had larger epididymal fat pad mass and showed greater hepatic triglyceride accumulation than B6CAST mice Figure 3.
