the h22 strains differed by subclade b type and plasmid content whereas the h30-r strains were identical.conclusions phenotypic analysis of our fecal strains based on observed genomic differences between s250 and jj1886 strains suggests the presence of traits related to bacterial commensalism in our h22 strains and traits commonly found in uropathogenic e. coli in our h30-r strains.keywords e. coli st131 h22 genome sugar metabolism mannose-binding fimh region biofilm subclades b plasmid replicons correspondence 1service de microbiologie hopital beaujon ap-hp clichy france2faculte de medecine paris diderot paris francefull list of author information is available at the end of the articlec the authors.

here we first showed that our three antibiotic-susceptible fecal st131 e. coli strains displayed fimh22 whereas the four resistant to fluoroquinolones displayed fimh30 h30-r. we thus centered our study on the comparison between these two groups of strains focusing on processes and struc- tures involved in environmental adaptation considering that subclone h22 is the precursor of subclone h30 which emerged at the end of 1990s  we first se- quenced the whole genome of one of our fecal h22 strains strain s250 as there were no assembled and an- notated genomes of h22 strains when we started our work.

coli which has been shown to be a worldwide human expec since the beginning of the 2000s has also been shown to colonize the human digestive tract in 2006 we found healthy subjects with a subdominant in- testinal population of fluoroquinolone-resistant st131 e. coli as well as those with a dominant intestinal popula- tion of st131 e. coli susceptible to fluoroquinolones the latter finding suggests that st131 e. coli may be a human intestinal commensal.

we then determined the type of subclade b displayed by strain s250 and the two other fecal h22 strains by pcr using primers specific for the flag-2 locus phi3 and gi-phev additional file table s1 and our h30-r fecal strains as a positive control.plasmid contentthe plasmid content of h22 strain s250 was determined using the plasmidfinder system  and the fii fia and fib formula of the detected incf plasmid by pcr- based replicon typing the latter method was also applied to the two remaining fecal h22 strains and the four fecal h30-r strains.expec status and virotypeaccording to the study of johnson and adam expec status is defined by the presence of 2 vf genes among the following genes pap sfafocde afadrabc iutaand kpsmt ii as the latter gene is not included in the vfdb we searched for it by blasting the kpsmt ii genes genbank x53819 against the s250 jj1886 and se15 genomes.

altogether although the h22 and h30-r strains investigated in this work were all isolated from the digestive tract of healthy subjects only h22 strains displayed properties previ- ously shown to be associated with human intestinal commensalism including competition for nutrients in the intestine gluconate use and a high intestinal adhe- siveness we sought to confirm the genetic differences identi-fied here between the lineages h22 and h30 with thewhole genome sequences of st131 isolates recently de- posited on ncbi databases i.e.

the fol- lowing antibiotics were tested amoxicillin amoxicillin  clavulanic acid ciprofloxacin gentamicin amikacin cotrimoxazole and fosfomycin.molecular analysis of resistance mechanismsthe genes encoding resistance to amoxicillin tem and shv enzymes were identified by pcr and sequencing methods as previously described the qnr genes en- coding plasmid-mediated resistance to fluoroquinolones were tested and the quinolone resistance determining region qrdr of the genes gyra gyrb parc and pare amplified and sequenced using methods previously described - the qrdrs of our strains were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone-susceptible reference strain e. coli k-12 mg1655 genbank cp014225.1 and the allelic gyra and parc profiles were compared with those previously described for st131 isolates sequencing and analysis of the whole genome of h22 strain s250the complete genomic sequence was determined for h22 strain s250.

we found the same fea- ture in the two other fecal h22 strains whereas the fimh sequence of our four h30-r strains was identi- cal to that of h30-rx strains jj1886 and uk p46212 data not shown.genes involved in sugar metabolism and growth with gluconate as the sole carbon sourceall genes involved in sugar metabolism in commensal e. coli strains hs and nissle were detected in the genome of h41 strain se15 whereas one the d-gluconate kinase-encoding idnk gntv gene was not detected in either strain h30-rx jj1886 or h22 s250 table its absence in our six remaining strains was revealed by the pcr-sequencing assay.

the 100 bp upstream of the start codon and the sequence of the deduced proteins showed 100 identity data not shown between these two strains except for the coding region of the ghrb genetable 3 distribution of the genes involved in sugar metabolism in commensal escherichia coli strains hs and nissle in the genomes of representative h30 h22 and h41 subclones of escherichia coli st131which showed a t968c substitution resulting in amino acid substitution v323a in strain jj1886.

in 2006 we retrieved non-esbl-producing st131 e. coli isolates susceptible or resistant to fluoroquinolones from the intes- tinal microbiota of 7 of healthy subjects living in the paris area the fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates accounted for a subdominant e. coli population in four independent healthy subjects whereas those susceptible to fluoroquino- lones accounted for the dominant e. coli population inthree other independent subjects.

although this gene was also absent in both our fecal h22 and h30-r strains h22 strains showed a higher capacity to grow in minimal medium with gluconate.

thus we compared them to the three fecal h22 strains considering the genomic differences identified between h22 strain s250 and h30-rx strain jj1886 and analyzed the phenotypic impact of some of these differences.methodsbacterial strainsthe seven fecal st131 isolates strains 02 39 183 187 196 208 and s250 obtained from the intestinal micro- biota of seven healthy subjects living in the paris area in 2006 were included in the study.
