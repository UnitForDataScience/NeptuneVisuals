The within-patientchange in sputum cell counts before and after treatmentdid not differ significantly between azithromycin and placebo groups appendix.There was no significant difference between the azithromycin and placebo groups in the overall rate and type of serious adverse events which occurred in 16 8 patients treated with azithromycin and 26 13 patients treated with placebo p027 table 4.

Since we observed a benefit of azithromycin on both asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections we speculate that azithromycin might be acting to prevent viral-induced episodes in asthma.Azithromycin seemed well tolerated with only diarrhoea being more common in patients treated with azithromycin.

Since macrolide antibiotics can be used to treat persistent asthma we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral azithromycin as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma on medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting bronchodilator.Methods We did a randomised double-blind placebo controlled parallel group trial to determine whether oral azithromycin decreases the frequency of asthma exacerbations in adults 18 years with symptomatic asthma despite current use of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting bronchodilator and who had no hearing impairment or abnormal prolongation of the corrected QT interval.

The proportion of patients experiencing at least one asthma exacerbation was reduced by azithromycin treatment 127 61 patients in the placebo group vs 94 44 patients in the azithromycin group p00001.

In eosinophilic asthma patients treated with placebo n103 experienced 198 exacer- bations per person-year whereas those treated with azithromycin n93 experienced 096 exacerbations per person-year IRR 052 95 CI 029-094 p0030.Severe asthma exacerbations were significantly reduced by azithromycin treatment.

In the azithromycin group n10 at baseline three microorganisms 30 were resistant to azithromycin and this increased to six 60 at the end of treatment p038 appendix.

Effect of azithromycin on asthma exacerbations and quality of life in adults with persistent uncontrolled asthma AMAZES a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trialPeter G Gibson Ian A Yang John W Upham Paul N Reynolds Sandra Hodge Alan L James Christine Jenkins Matthew J Peters Guy B Marks Melissa Baraket Heather Powell Steven L Taylor Lex E X Leong Geraint B Rogers Jodie L SimpsonSummaryBackground Exacerbations of asthma cause a substantial global illness burden.

Patients were randomly assigned 11 to receive azithromycin 500 mg or placebo three times per week for 48 weeks.

The trial is registered at the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ANZCTR number 12609000197235.Findings Between June 12 2009 and Jan 31 2015 420 patients were randomly assigned 213 in the azithromycin group and 207 in the placebo group.

Diarrhoea was more common in azithromycin-treated patients 72 34 vs 39 19 p0001.Interpretation Adults with persistent symptomatic asthma experience fewer asthma exacerbations and improved quality of life when treated with oral azithromycin for 48 weeks.
