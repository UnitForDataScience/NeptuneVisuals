the within-patientchange in sputum cell counts before and after treatmentdid not differ significantly between azithromycin and placebo groups appendix.there was no significant difference between the azithromycin and placebo groups in the overall rate and type of serious adverse events which occurred in 16 8 patients treated with azithromycin and 26 13 patients treated with placebo p027 table 4. there was no difference in study withdrawals due to adverse effects between the azithromycin group 15 7 and placebo group 10 5 p034.

the placebo group experienced 107 severe asthma exacerbations per person-year whereas the azithromycin treated groupexperienced 061 severe asthma exacerbations per person-year irr 059 95 ci 042-083 p0002.azithromycin use improved asthma control as measured by acq6 score adjusted mean difference-020 95 ci -034 to -005 table 2. there was also a reduction in nasal symptoms cough and sputumproduction in patients using azithromycin table 2. at the end of the treatment period the number of sputum eosinophils x 104 per ml were less in the azithromycin group median 689 iqr 203-4638 vs 1105 214-4032 appendix but sputum neutrophils did not differ between treatment groups.

since we observed a benefit of azithromycin on both asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections we speculate that azithromycin might be acting to prevent viral-induced episodes in asthma.azithromycin seemed well tolerated with only diarrhoea being more common in patients treated with azithromycin.

since macrolide antibiotics can be used to treat persistent asthma we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral azithromycin as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma on medium-to-high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a long-acting bronchodilator.methods we did a randomised double-blind placebo controlled parallel group trial to determine whether oral azithromycin decreases the frequency of asthma exacerbations in adults 18 years with symptomatic asthma despite current use of inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting bronchodilator and who had no hearing impairment or abnormal prolongation of the corrected qt interval.

the proportion of patients experiencing at least one asthma exacerbation was reduced by azithromycin treatment 127 61 patients in the placebo group vs 94 44 patients in the azithromycin group p00001.

there were similar numbers of trial withdrawals in each group and similar withdrawals due to adverse effects 15 4 in the azithromycin group and 10 2 in the placebo group figure 1. other reasons for withdrawal are listed in the appendix.the patients allocated to azithromycin had similar characteristics to those allocated to placebo table 1. all patients were on average older median 60 years iqr 50-68 with atopic asthma 319 76 who had asthma for a median of 32 years iqr 16-48. patients in both groups included ex-smokers 61 38 median pack-years 75 iqr 16-225 without reduced gas transfer coefficient median kco percent predicted of 86 iqr 78-95 so as to exclude co-existing emphysema.

the beneficial effect of azithromycin remained significant after adjustment for differences in maintenance inhaled corticosteroid dose figure 3 a history of frequent at least two asthma exacerbations in those with chronic cough and sputum production and in those with and without bacterial pathogen isolation from sputum using standard culture techniques.azithromycin use was associated with an improvementin asthma-related quality of life adjusted mean difference 036 95 ci 021-052 p0001 table 2. this benefit was seen across all aqlq domains table 3 and in the symptoms domain the mean change from baseline was 05 units which equates to the minimal important difference for this questionnaire.azithromycin reduced asthma exacerbations in both eosinophilic asthma and non-eosinophilic asthma figure 3. in non-eosinophilic asthma patients treated with placebo n104 experienced 174 exacerbations per person-year compared with those treated with azithromycin n120 who experienced 115 exacerbations per person-year incidence rate ratio 066 95 ci 047-093 p0019.

in the azithromycin group n10 at baseline three microorganisms 30 were resistant to azithromycin and this increased to six 60 at the end of treatment p038 appendix.
