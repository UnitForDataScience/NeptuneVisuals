The probiotic treatment also significantly reduced the mucus production in the lungs of re-challenged OVx allergic mice compared with non-treated re-challenged OVx allergic mice .Preventive Supplementation withB.

The relationship between bifidobacteria and allergic asthma andor allergic dermatitis a prospective study of 0-3 years-old children in Turkey.

We found a significant increase in total cells recovered in the BALF from Sham and OVx allergic mice that was exacerbated by re-exposure of OVx allergic mice to OVA .

Moreover the number of eosinophils in the BAL from re-challenged OVx allergic mice significantly increased compared with Sham allergic mice.

Re-challenged OVx allergic mice exhibited significantly increased airwayhyperresponsiveness to MCh compared with Sham OVx allergic mice .We also determined the effect of ovariectomy on the Th2 cytokine profile.

Our data revealed a significant increase in IL-5 levels in the BAL recovered from OVx allergic mice re-exposed to antigen challenge compared with that of Sham OVx allergic mice .

In contrast IFN-g and IL-10 were reduced in the BAL of re-challenged OVx allergic mice compared with Sham OVx allergic mice .Excessive mucus production is a characteristic of asthmatic airways therefore we evaluated the presence of PAS-stained cells in the lungs of re-challenged mice.

As seen in  a significant increase in PAS-stained cells was observed in the lungs of re-challenged OVx allergic mice compared with re-challenged Sham OVx allergic mice.

An oral probiotic B. longum 51A was administered daily by gavage for 15 days before the first OVA sensitization of mice and continued until 4 h before the mouse ovariesFIGURE 3  Preventive oral probiotic supplementation decreased the allergic airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness of re-challenged ovariectomized allergic mice.

As shown in  when the probiotic was given after ovary removal the profile of total inflammatory cells and eosinophils recovered in the BAL was not altered in the re-challenged allergic mice relative to the non-treated re-challenged OVx allergic mice .DISCUSSIONClinical evidence shows that after puberty asthma is more frequent in females than in males which indicates that the oscillation of female sex hormones during the menstrual cycle is involved  .
