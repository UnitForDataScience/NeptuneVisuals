In this study we used a metatranscriptomic ap- proach to analyze the active microbial communities before and after sunrise in the rhizosphere of barley.

Actinomycetales Planctomycetales Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales were the most abundant and therefore the most active orders in the barley rhizosphere.

Microbial dynamicsThe microbiome of the rhizosphere plays a crucial role in plant health as it determines nutrient availability as well as response patterns of the plant towards abiotic and biotic stressors .

In turn the microbiome of the rhizosphere benefits from plant- derived carbon as a major energy source and surfaces for colo- nization and formation of microbial networks  .

So far these short-term dynamics have mostly been ignored when composition and function of the rhizosphere microbiome have been analyzed.

We hypothesize that microbial activities in the rhizosphere are closely linked to theElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article  contains supplementary material which is available to authorized users.

At that time point rhizosphere samples were col- lected at 4.30 a.m. 1 h before sunrise and 9.30 a.m. 4 h after sunrise respectively.

a which is in agreement with other studies on the microbiome of the barley rhizosphere.
