The first report published in 2013 analyzed the gut microbiota in 16 children with T1D and an average disease duration of 4.8 years and 16 unaffected children using PCR- denaturating gradient electrophoresis and real-time quantita- tive PCR .

Gut microbiota in children with type 1 diabetes differs from that in healthy children a case-control study.

Aberrant gut microbiota composition at the onset of type 1 diabetes in young children.

The gut mi- crobiota and the immune system interact closely  empha- sizing the role of the intestinal microbiota in the maturation and education of immune functions.The Intestinal Microbiome and Type 1 DiabetesThe adult human gut microbiota comprises 1013-1014 micro- organisms and the gut microbiome defined as the aggregate genome of all intestinal microorganisms is about 150 times larger than the human genome .

In addition the cases were characterized by a dearth of the two most abundant Bifidobacterium species B. adolescentis in the older children and B. pseudocatenalatum in the younger children and a higher abundance of Bacteroides when compared with the controls.

In contrast an analysis of 22 autoantibody-positive BABYDIET children  and 22 autoantibody-negative con- trol children matched for date of birth did not observe any differences in bacterial diversity microbial composition or abundance of single genera between cases and controls .

Those who progressed to clinical disease had also a reduced intestinal microbial gene content compared with the children who developed autoantibodies but not T1D and the control children.

A recent European study comprised 28 children with newly diagnosed T1D and 27 unaffected children.
