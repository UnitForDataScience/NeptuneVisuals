the gut mi- crobiota and the immune system interact closely  empha- sizing the role of the intestinal microbiota in the maturation and education of immune functions.the intestinal microbiome and type 1 diabetesthe adult human gut microbiota comprises 1013-1014 micro- organisms and the gut microbiome defined as the aggregate genome of all intestinal microorganisms is about 150 times larger than the human genome .

taken together the gut microbiota in finnish infants was characterized by dysbiosis including a decreased abundance of most bifidobacteria species and an increased abundance of bacteroides species.a concerted view on the role of the intestinal microbiome in the development of type 1 diabetesbased on the current knowledge one may hypothesize that the impact of the intestinal microbiome on the risk for progression to clinical t1d is a two-step process fig.

on the other hand there are definitely changes in the gut microbiome associated with the disease process leading eventually to symptomatic disease and the modula- tion of the intestinal microbiome provides novel strategies that may be safely and effectively applied for treatment of such aberrations.

1 the intestinal microbiome may affect the risk of type 1 diabetes t1d in two steps.

in the following chapter we will discuss possible means to modulate the t1d risk through measures affecting the gut microbiome.potential measures for reducing the risk of type 1 diabetes through the intestinal microbiomeso far there are no evidence-based therapies modulating the gut microbiome for preventing or delaying progression to overt t1d.

modulation of the intes- tinal microbiome holds the promise of effective protection against human type 1 diabetes.keywords type 1 diabetes .
