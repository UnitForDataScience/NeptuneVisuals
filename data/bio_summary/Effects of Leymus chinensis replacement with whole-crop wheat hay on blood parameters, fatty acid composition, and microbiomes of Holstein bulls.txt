For ruminants ingestion of WCW which consists of wheat straw and wheat grain has greater nutrient content and higher feed efficiency than inges- tion of wheat straw alone.

However most of the wheat straw is burned which results in not only severe resource waste but also air pollution such as par- ticulate matter Li et al.

Applications of agronomy and plant breeding methods for the produc- tion of whole-crop wheat WCW together with its potentially lower production cost have resulted in the increased use of this crop as feed for ruminants Walsh et al.
