Indeed although members of the microbiota are often referred to as commensals the symbiosis persistent interaction between the microbiota and its mammalian host encompasses various forms of relationships and how members of the microbiota interact with their host can be highly contextual with the same microbe developing as mutualist commensal or parasite according to the genetic landscape nutritional status or co-infection of its host.Microbial surveys unveiled the remarkable partitioning of com- mensals within the human body with each tissue and microenvi- ronment hosting unique microbial communities  .

As previously discussed maternal microbial colonization during gestation increases ILC3 population size in offspring  uEUR further supporting the idea that the importance of non-classical lymphocytes in mediating interac- tions with the microbiota might be more relevant to early life than in adults in which adaptive immunity is likely to dominate in controlling host microbiota interactions.Adaptive Immunity to the MicrobiotaOur understanding of the complex interactions between the gut microbiota and the host immune system has challenged theFigure 4.

Because of the extraor- dinary number of antigens expressed by the host microbiota pri- mary exposure to a pathogen is likely to occur in the context of a much broader recall response against commensal bacteria.A protective effect for the microbiota has also been revealed in clinical and experimental settings in which broad antibiotic treat- ment allow the domination of intestinal microbiota by drug-resis-tant microbes such as Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus VRE or Clostridium difficile  .

Of late the field of immunology has been transformed by the growing understanding of the fundamental role of the microbiota in the induction education and function of the mammalian immune system.The development of defined arms of the immune system and more particularly those associated with adaptive immunity has coincided with the acquisition of a complex microbiota sup- porting the idea that a large fraction of this complex system evolved in order to maintain a symbiotic relationship with the mi- crobiota.

The Microbiota Plays a Fundamental Role in the Induction Education and Function of the Mammalian Immune SystemEvolution of the mammalian immune system has coincided with the acquisition of a complex microbiota demonstrating a symbiotic relation- ship between the host immune system and its commensal microbiota.

Conversely selective modulation of the microbiota presents immense therapeutic potential for bolstering tumor immu- notherapy vaccination and resistance to anti- biotic-resistant microbes.and their ability to calibrate the threshold of activation of cells and tissues promote responses to infection vaccines and tumor immunotherapy.Control of Epithelial Cells by the MicrobiotaA central strategy utilized by the host to maintain its homeostatic relationship with the microbiota is to minimize contact between microorganisms and the epithelial cell surface thereby limiting tis- sue inflammation and microbial translocation.

Additionally intestinal epithelial cells are also influ- enced indirectly by the microbiota via cytokine production by innate and adaptive immune cells induced by microbial coloniza- tion reviewed in .Tonic Control of Hematopoiesis and Innate Immunity by the MicrobiotaDespite the anatomical separation of the microbiota and host im- mune system that limits systemic dispersion of commensal mi- crobes bacterial metabolites are detectable in peripheral tissues following commensal colonization  .

The microbiota can impact both yolk sac- and stem-cell- derived myeloid cell development   and the size of the bone marrow myeloid cell pool correlates with the complexity of the intestinal microbiota  .

In addition to a role for the microbiota in controlling the output and potentially the function of cells leaving the bone marrow the microbiota continues to influence hematopoietic cells within tissues.

The site of SFB-specific Th17 cell priming remains unknown but can occur in the absence of lymph nodes.SFB colonization drives an ILC3IL-22SAA12 axis that licenses IL-17A production from RORgt Th17 cells within the terminal ileum.Clostridia colonization promotes RORgt Foxp3 pTreg cell accumulation which in turn limit colonic Th2 and Th17 cell responses.Foxp3 Treg cells and Tfhex-Th17 cells localize in the Peyer's patches and promote B cell class-switch and production of IgA which fosters a diverse microbiota and ensures com- mensal compartmentalization from the intestinal epithelium.original perception that under steady-state conditions mi- crobes composing the microbiota were ignored by the adaptive immune system.
