similarly at 4 months of age 98 of the sequences were found in 10 genera streptococ- cus 64 rothia 9 veillonella 8 neisseria 4 alloprevotella 3 gemella 3 pre-votella 2 actinomyces 2 granulicatella 2 and haemophilus 1. the most striking differences between 4 and 12 months of age were a decrease in streptococcus to 46 an increase in neisseria to 13 and appearance of fusobacteria 3 leptotrichia 1 and porphyromonas 1. full lists of detection prevalence  of the total number of sequences in 4 and12 months old infants together with p-values are presented for phyla and genera   and for speciesphylotypes .core microbiome at 4 and 12 months of agetwenty-two hot taxa were identified in 295 of all 4 and 12 months old infants.

when the infants were 12 months old a statistically significant pls regression model was still seen but it was weaker cross validated predictive power q2 of 30 and the set of species associated with having been breast-fed from birth to at least 6 months of age ver- sus formula-fed differed from those seen at 4 months of age .being delivered by caesarean section was modestly associated pls correlation 0.1 with being in the sf group at both 4 and 12 months of age.

the funders had no role in study design data collection and analysis decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript.backgroundin a recent study supplementation of infant formula with milk fat globule membranes mfgm decreased the incidence of otitis media in infants 6 months of age.objectivesthe aim of the present study was to characterize the oral microbiota in infants fed mfgm- supplemented formula and compare it to that of infants fed standard formula or breast milk.methodsin a prospective double-blinded randomized controlled trial exclusively formula-fed infants2 months of age were randomized to be fed experimental formula ef n  80 with reduced energy and protein and supplemented with a bovine mfgm concentrate or standard for- mula sf n  80 until 6 months of age.

the inclusion criteria were 2 months of age gestational age at birth 37-42 weeks birth weight 2 500-4 500 g absence of chronic illness and exclusively formula-fed at baseline and for the breast-fed reference group that the infant was exclusively breast-fed at inclusion and that the mother had the intention to breast-feed until 6 months.

all caregivers were recommended to not give any taste portions of comple- mentary foods until the infant was 4 months of age and then only small amounts up to 6 months of age.

besides the explanatory r2-value pls regression provides a cross validated predictive value q2 of the model.resultsof the infants included in the basic trial sequencing of the oral microbiota was performed in 64 56 and 49 of the 4 months old and 81 81 and 72 of the 12 months old infants in the ef sf and bfr groups respectively.

the mean 95 ci number of filtered sequences per sample were at 4 months of age 57 399 54 398-60 399 and at 12 months of age 49 164 46 493-51 835 with no difference between feeding groups at either age .

of 234 unique hot taxa 202 were present in 4 months old and 229 in 12 months old infants.

the 234 unique hot taxaclusters represented 10 phyladivisions actinobacteria bacteriodetes firmicutes fusobacteria gno2 proteobacteria sr1 synergistes tenericutes and tm7 and 64 genera .at 4 months of age 98 of the sequences were found in the phyla firmicutes 77 actino- bacteria 11 proteobacteria 5 and bacteriodetes 5. at 12 months of age the propor- tions were lower for firmicutes 60 higher for proteobacteria 18 but similar for otherphyla.

at 12 months they still tended to have lower species richness than formula-fed groups but the difference was not statistically significant.pcoa modeling of the 469 original otus at 4 months tended to cluster bfr infants together whereas ef and sf infants were scattered .

the figure provides a map of how infants relate to each other by feeding type based on a model including genera and speciesphylotypes identified by homd blasting after exclusion of otus with 15 sequences sex mode of delivery anthropometric measures and lactobacilli by culture at a 4 months and b 12 months of age.

for full list and univariate p-values see and tables.doi10.1371journal.pone.0169831.g007months of age the pls regression model was considerably weaker cross-validated predictive power q2 of 5 and the hot-taxa influential for being in the ef versus sf group at 4 months of age did not remain influential .the taxa detection pattern differed markedly between infants in the bfr and sf groups at 4 months of age and pls regression yielded a strong model cross validated predictive power q2 57. being breast-fed was mainly characterized by lactobacilli by culture bifidobacter- ium b. breve lactobacillus l. rhamnosus and l. gasseri kingella oralis ralstonia ralstonia sp.

notably this difference in species richness was gone when the infants were 12 months old while some differences in the oral microbiota remained even though breast-feeding in most cases was discontinued since several months.

in this perspective it is interesting that m. catar- rhalis was less prevalent in oral swabs from the 4 months old ef infants compared to those in the sf group.one more notable observation in the present study was that at 12 months of age the pres- ence of s. mutans an opportunistic bacterial species associated with early childhood caries  was more prevalent in formula-fed than in breast-fed infants.
