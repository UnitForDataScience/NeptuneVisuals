When the infants were 12 months old a statistically significant PLS regression model was still seen but it was weaker cross validated predictive power Q2 of 30 and the set of species associated with having been breast-fed from birth to at least 6 months of age ver- sus formula-fed differed from those seen at 4 months of age .Being delivered by Caesarean section was modestly associated PLS correlation 0.1 with being in the SF group at both 4 and 12 months of age.

The inclusion criteria were 2 months of age gestational age at birth 37-42 weeks birth weight 2 500-4 500 g absence of chronic illness and exclusively formula-fed at baseline and for the breast-fed reference group that the infant was exclusively breast-fed at inclusion and that the mother had the intention to breast-feed until 6 months.

All caregivers were recommended to not give any taste portions of comple- mentary foods until the infant was 4 months of age and then only small amounts up to 6 months of age.

Besides the explanatory R2-value PLS regression provides a cross validated predictive value Q2 of the model.ResultsOf the infants included in the basic trial sequencing of the oral microbiota was performed in 64 56 and 49 of the 4 months old and 81 81 and 72 of the 12 months old infants in the EF SF and BFR groups respectively.

The mean 95 CI number of filtered sequences per sample were at 4 months of age 57 399 54 398-60 399 and at 12 months of age 49 164 46 493-51 835 with no difference between feeding groups at either age .

Of 234 unique HOT taxa 202 were present in 4 months old and 229 in 12 months old infants.

Full lists of detection prevalence  of the total number of sequences in 4 and12 months old infants together with p-values are presented for phyla and genera   and for speciesphylotypes .Core Microbiome at 4 and 12 Months of AgeTwenty-two HOT taxa were identified in 295 of all 4 and 12 months old infants.

A shows plot for 4 months and B for 12 months old infants.

At 12 months they still tended to have lower species richness than formula-fed groups but the difference was not statistically significant.PCoA modeling of the 469 original OTUs at 4 months tended to cluster BFR infants together whereas EF and SF infants were scattered .
