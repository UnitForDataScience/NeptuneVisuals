these partici- pants were divided into a discovery cohort of 73 aspatients and 83 healthy controls as well as a validation cohort of 24 patients and 31 healthy controls.resultsupdated integrated gene catalogthe first integrated gene catalog igc including type 2 diabetes t2d ibd human microbiome project hmp and metahit individuals contains 9879896 genes from 1267 gut metagenomes to better assess the rela- tionship between as and the gut microbiome we first assembled the genes from the as patients and our healthy controls patient characteristics are reported in additional file table s1 and then constructed an up- dated integrated gene catalog denoted as igc2 here- after which encompasses the igc lc and as gene catalogs.

the shannon-weiner alpha diversity and the simpson alpha diversity were calculated and com- pared between the as patients and healthy controls additional file figure s4.differential gene identificationon the basis that genes with too low an abundance in both as patient samples and healthy control samples might not appropriately reflect the actual situations the genes with median abundance less than 1e-7 in the aspatient group or the healthy control group were dis- carded.

p. copri may stimulate an immune reaction that then targets joint tissues and this species was strongly correlated with the disease severity in untreated new-onset ra patientswhereas p. melaninogenica can interact with human lactoferrin.gene markers and functional differences between as patients and healthy controlsthe as patients exhibited a reduced richness of the gut microbiome compared with the healthy controls 414289 - 129035 and 539071 - 189228 respectively p  6.68e-06 wilcoxon rank-sum test and the overall distribution of their gene counts was clearly shifted toward lower values additional file  figure s4a b. the shannon-wiener diversity index p  1.50e-07 wilcoxon rank-sum test and the simpson diversity index p  3.57e-06 wilcoxon rank-sum test also reflected the lower gut microbiome richness of the as patients additional file figure s4.to identify the differentially abundant genes wil- coxon rank-sum test was applied to 73 as patients and83 controls.

we added them to the igc1 and obtained a new catalog named igc2 table and additional file figure s1a that was used in the remainder of the study.phylogenetic differences between as patients and healthy controlsthe sequencing reads additional file table s2 were aligned against 8743 reference genomes from the ncbi and hmp additional file table s3.

of these 63 31.7 could be assigned taxonomically additional file table s12 additional file figure s11 consistent with previous data that indicated that most gut bacterial species have no closely related reference genomes  in a similar manner we obtained and validated 755 clusters of 100-699 genes hereafter denoted small cags  583 77.2 of these 755 were un- known taxonomic organisms.to identify the clusters included the big cags and small cags associated with as the low abundance clusters were filtered online methods and the wilcoxon rank-sum test was used false discovery rate fdr  0.01. there were 62 clusters which included 16 big cags and 46 small cags additional file table s12.

non-metric multi-dimensional scaling nmds analysis for all the samples as patients and healthy controls based on phylogenetic abundance profiling showed that the samples of the as patients and healthy controls were randomly distributed in the nmds space additional file figure s12a-d it showed that the batch effects in this study were minor.dna extraction and library constructionthe dna was extracted from each frozen fecal sample 200 mg using the phenoltrichloromethane dna ex- traction method.

the diversity of the gut microbiomes for the as patients and the healthy controls was similar at genus level additional file figure s1a but was significantly higher in the controls at species level additional file figure s1b.

furthermore all of the proteasome-associated genes that were identified as being differentially abun- dant in this study belonged to the bacterial proteasome additional file table s8.metagenomic species mgs in as disease and comparison with other diseasesmgs is a gene group in which all of the genes are def- erentially abundant between patients and healthy con- trols the genes in the same mgs have consistent abundance among individuals.

the genera belonging to enterobacteriaceae were enriched in the healthy controls as were fusobacterium and a genus most closely related to lachnospiraceae bacte- rium additional file table s4.the most abundant species in both the as and healthy control groups were primarily from the bacteroides genus.

among these participants 23709 genes were identified 6238 were more abundant in as patients and 17471 in the healthy controls using the threshold value of  1e-7 for mean relative abundance and  1e-4 for q additional file figure s5a.

after that this gene catalog was merged with the igc and lc gene cat- alogs using cd-hit with the same parameters.phylogenetic abundance profiling and gene abundance profilingthe clean reads were mapped to the reference genomes collected from ncbi and hmp using the soap alignerand the phenotype profiling was evaluated using the number of hits for the reads against a certain reference genome.

during the classifier construction all 210 differentially abundant sequenced reference genome markers additional file table s14 were input and 33 sequenced reference genomemarkers were picked after mcc optimization selection additional file table s13.

the first repeated assembly was within 20 sets additional file table s5 while the repeated assembly was within four sets additional file table s6.

among these the highest medians of the phylogenetic abundance in the enriched cohort were drawn as boxplotsthyroid diseases through the mechanism of molecular mimicry  .furthermore compared with healthy controls the mi- crobial communities in the as cases were characterized by a higher abundance of prevotellaceae including prevo- tella melaninogenica p  5.91e-09 wilcoxon rank-sum test prevotella copri p  1.18e-03 wilcoxon rank-sum test and prevotella sp.
