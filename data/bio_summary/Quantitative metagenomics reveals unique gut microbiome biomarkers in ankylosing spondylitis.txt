indicating that they could be a foundation for novel non-traumatic monitoring and classification ap- proaches based on human gut microbiome for different chronic diseases.Unknown taxonomic organism identified by population metagenomics technologyTo further explore the bacterial species associated with AS that was not captured by the gene-based approach presented above we grouped the AS-specific catalog genes 1708140 genes that were with abundance in at least ten samples from 2319710 genes into clusters of 700 genes denoted big CAGs Co-abundance genegroups.

Furthermore all of the proteasome-associated genes that were identified as being differentially abun- dant in this study belonged to the bacterial proteasome Additional file Table S8.Metagenomic species MGS in AS disease and comparison with other diseasesMGS is a gene group in which all of the genes are def- erentially abundant between patients and healthy con- trols the genes in the same MGS have consistent abundance among individuals.

Of the 6238 genes enriched in the AS cohort 2594 genes were clustered into six MGSs whereas of the 17471 genes enriched in the healthy controls 5291 were clustered in 23 MGSs Additional file Table S9.

These partici- pants were divided into a discovery cohort of 73 ASpatients and 83 healthy controls as well as a validation cohort of 24 patients and 31 healthy controls.ResultsUpdated integrated gene catalogThe first integrated gene catalog IGC including type 2 diabetes T2D IBD human microbiome project HMP and MetaHIT individuals contains 9879896 genes from 1267 gut metagenomes To better assess the rela- tionship between AS and the gut microbiome we first assembled the genes from the AS patients and our healthy controls patient characteristics are reported in Additional file Table S1 and then constructed an up- dated integrated gene catalog denoted as IGC2 here- after which encompasses the IGC LC and AS gene catalogs.

The gene catalog for the AS gut microbiome contained 2319710 non-redundant open reading frames ORFs whereas the LC gut microbial catalog contained 2688468 genes Together they contained 517488 genes not present in the IGC1.

The top 100 differentially abundant genes with smallest p values 1.1e-12 were input and finally 30 genes were used.

Ap- proximately 17 additional genes 232446 genes could be aligned effectively with the expanded catalog as op- posed to the AS gene catalog alone.

The Shannon-Weiner alpha diversity and the Simpson alpha diversity were calculated and com- pared between the AS patients and healthy controls Additional file Figure S4.Differential gene identificationOn the basis that genes with too low an abundance in both AS patient samples and healthy control samples might not appropriately reflect the actual situations the genes with median abundance less than 1e-7 in the ASpatient group or the healthy control group were dis- carded.

S5a were calculated using the q value R package Gene functional analysisThe protein sequences of the genes in the merged gene catalog were aligned to the KEGG protein database using BLAT After filtering the match scores under 60 the genes were assigned to the KEGG orthology groups on the basis of the highest scores of the matches.

To identify the KOs that were associated with AS the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed with FDR  0.005 and the observed differential KEGG orthology groups were assigned to the KEGG pathways.MGS identificationFor the identified differentially expressed genes hier- archical clustering was applied using Spearman's correl- ation coefficient for the abundance of the genes with a clustering threshold of 0.9.
