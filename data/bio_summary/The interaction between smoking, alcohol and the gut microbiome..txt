Whether the significant association between the likelihood of unsuccessful first-line treatment for Hp infection and smoking status may be linked to an altered gastric microbiome remains to be investigated.summarizes the supposed mechanisms and the described modulating effects of alcohol and smoking on the gastric microbiota.Effects of alcohol on the microbiome of the lower gastrointestinal tractThe association between alcohol consumption and changes in intestinal microbiome has been investigated extensively in the past decade and there is sufficient evidence suggesting that both acute and chronic exposure to alcohol determine specific modifications of the microbiome composition bacterial overgrowth and disruption of the mucosal barrier function see .

To date it is not understood whether alcohol-related alterations of the gastric microenviron- ment and possible subsequent changes of the gastric microbiota may be linked to this observation.In contrast to the observed protective effects of alcohol on Hp infection alcohol intake was reported being a risk factor for GC e Low alcohol intake was negatively associated with GC risk HR 0.74 .

In another study rats fed with alcohol for 10 weeks showed modifications of the microbiome in the colonic but not in the ileal mucosa and pre-treatment with either a probiotic Lactobacillus GG LGG or a prebiotic oats prevented these changes .Similar results have been confirmed by others with data sug- gesting that alcohol causes an increase of Proteobacteria and Acti- nobaceria phyla and a decrease of Firmicutes with these changes being restored by treatment with LGG .Germ-free animals are an interesting model to investigate the role of alcohol on intestinal microbiota.

Furthermore when germ-free animals are transplantedwith faeces of control animals fed with alcohol intestinal and he- patic inflammation increases suggesting that the pro- inflammatory effect of alcohol is mediated by the intestinal microbiome .Chronic exposure to alcohol also modifies the composition of intestinal mucus.

In mice treated with alcohol when A muciniphila is administered in a preventive setting all markers of intestinal gut barrier function and mucus thickness and liver damage are reduced .Taken together these studies strongly suggest that alcohol causes significant changes in the composition of the colonic microbiome in animal models which in turn causes pro- inflammatory changes leaky gut and bacterial translocation asso- ciated with liver disease .The liver is not the only organ distant from the gut that has been associated with deleterious effects of intestinal dysbiosis due to alcohol.

They found that subjects with increased intestinal permeability had higher scores of depression and anxiety and alcohol craving after 3 weeks of abstinence possibly suggesting that the microbiome might be a potential target to reduce the risk of alcohol use relapse in alcoholics.An interesting issue regards the cause-effect relation between alcohol and microbiome.

Therefore analogously to tobacco smoking acute or chronic useabuse of alcohol may be postulated to signif- icantly alter the gastric microenvironment in turn affecting the gastric microbiota composition.With regard to Hp an alcohol intake lower than 75 g weekly hasbeen reported to protect against active infection .

Similarly to smoking alcohol intake has been reported as being associated with Hp eradication failure .Ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenases ADH catalase or cytochrome P450 2E1 to acetaldehyde which is then further oxidized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH .
