In the fully adjusted model prenatal antibiotic use was not statistically significantly associated with BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years 0.17 - 0.18 P  0.35 in offspring of women who delivered via C-section in contrast the association of prenatal antibiotic use with BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years 0.23 - 0.13 P  0.064 approached statistical significance in women who delivered vaginally.20k-o40 k107 28.8Antiviral useChild characteristic at 2-year visitAge years2.2 - 0.32.2 - 0.22.2 - 0.32.2 - 0.2BMI kg m-216.8 - 1.7b16.5 - 1.5b16.8 - 1.816.6 - 1.6BMI Z-score0.17 - 1.1b- 0.04 - 1.1b0.15 - 1.10.06 - 1.1BMI categoryUnderweight BMIo5th percentile20 6.615 6.76 5.929 6.8Normal weight BMI 5th and o85th percentile231 76.2171 76.375 74.3327 76.8Prenatal antimicrobial characteristicsTiming of medication exposure trimesterNumber of medication exposuresTrimester-specific antimicrobial use and BMI at the age of 2 years Trimester of prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with BMI Z-score and overweightobesity at the age of 2 years 3.

There was no association of prenatal antibiotic or antifungal use with child use of antibiotic before 1 or 6 months of age all P40.14.Prenatal antimicrobial use and BMI at the age of 2 yearsThe mean BMI of the WHEALS children at the age of 2 years was16.6 - 1.7 kg m-2 and the mean BMI Z-score was 0.08 - 1.1 90 17.1 WHEALS children were overweightobese at the age of 2 years.

In the Northern Manhattan Mothers and Children study antibiotic exposure in the second or thirdtrimester was associated with risk of obesity and BMI Z-score atinfant gut microbiome at at the age of 1 monthwhich isthe age of 7.In contrast to our findings at the age of 2 yearsconsistent with our finding that third-trimester antibiotic exposure is not associated with childhood BMI at at the age of 2 years.

Finally the age at childhood BMI measurement age 2 in WHEALS versus age 7 years in the Northern Manhattan Study age 7-16 years in the Danish study and age 3 years in the Geisinger study differed.

There was no evidence for a trimester- specific effect of antifungal use on childhood BMI at the age of 2 years.Dose-response relationship with antibiotic useMost women who used antibiotics had one exposure over pregnancy n  157 51.8 1. shows the relation- ship between number of prenatal antibiotics used and the mean BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years with the highest BMI Z-score seen in children with the greatest number of prenatal exposures to antibiotics however this was not statistically significant P-trend  0.144.

Similar models were fit to determine whether type of antibiotic ever use of cephalosporin ever use of macrolide ever use of nitroimidazole ever use of nitrofurantoin ever use of penicillin or ever use of other antibiotic aminoglycoside lincosamide quinolone vancomycin or sulfonamidetrimethoprim was associated with BMI at the age of 2 years.To test for differences in timing of antibiotic or antifungal exposure across pregnancy multiple informant models were used which allowed us to test differences in an exposure-outcome relationship across time windows while maintaining the effect estimates that would be obtained fitting separate regression models for each time point.A score test of the equality of all the trimester-specific parameter estimates was used to evaluate differences across trimesters.A generalized estimating equation approach with linear and logistic regression was utilized to fit the multiple informant models for BMI Z-score and overweightobesity respectively.Not all WHEALS children completed a 2-year clinic visit.To account for loss to follow-up we calculated inverse probability weights for complete follow-up.Inverse probability weights were calculated by fitting a logistic regression model for complete follow-up at the age of 2 years with the following baseline maternal factors age race insurance type income including whether or not the question was answered education smokingstatus prenatal alcohol use urban residence marital status history of asthmaallergies and mode of delivery and obtaining the predicted probability of successful follow-up.

In the fully adjusted model there was evidence for atrimester-specific effect of antibiotic use with BMI Z-score interaction P  0.032 first-trimester antibiotic use was asso- ciated with a 0.21 - 0.12 unit higher BMI Z-score P  0.071 second-trimester antibiotic use was associated with a statisti- cally significant 0.28 - 0.13 unit higher BMI score P  0.028 but third-trimester use was not associated with BMI Z-score P  0.691.

Overall there is evidence to support a role for prenatal antibiotic use and childhood BMI future studies that address BMI trajectories throughout childhood are needed.We found evidence to suggest that macrolide antibiotic use in pregnancy was associated with higher BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years.

Prenatal antibiotic use was positively associated with BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years P  0.046 after covariate adjustment children born to mothers who used antibiotics in the prenatal period had an estimated 0.20 - 0.10 unit higher BMI Z- score at the age of 2 years compared with children born to mothers who did not use prenatal antibiotics 2.

Data from the Project Viva cohort demonstrated a trimester-specific effect of antibiotic exposure on leptin a hormone involved in energy balance and appetite suppression exposures in the first and second trimesters were associated with non-statistically significant lower levels of cord blood leptin whereas exposures in the third trimester were associated with statistically significant higher levels of cord blood leptin.Lower cord blood leptin levels are associated with higher BMI at the age of 3 years.Thus although the associations were not statistically significant the finding of lower leptin in cord blood following first or second- trimester antibiotic exposure is consistent with our finding that earlier pregnancy antibiotic exposure is associated with larger BMI at the age of 2 years.
