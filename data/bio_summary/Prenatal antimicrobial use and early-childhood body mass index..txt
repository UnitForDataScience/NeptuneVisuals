The infectious agents themselves rather than the subsequent antimicrobial use could have an impact on child growth.A recent longitudinal birth cohort study from Kaiser Permanente Northern California suggested that childhood infection rather than overall early-childhood antibiotic use was associated with childhood obesity however consistent with ouroverall hypothesis in this study early infancy antibiotic use first 6 months of life was associated with childhood obesity.To our knowledge however similar studies have not been conducted during pregnancy and thus future work to examine prenatal infection with and without antibiotic use may be needed.CONCLUSIONSWe found evidence suggesting that prenatal antibiotic use but not antifungal use is associated with childhood BMI at the age of 2 years.

Similar models were fit to determine whether type of antibiotic ever use of cephalosporin ever use of macrolide ever use of nitroimidazole ever use of nitrofurantoin ever use of penicillin or ever use of other antibiotic aminoglycoside lincosamide quinolone vancomycin or sulfonamidetrimethoprim was associated with BMI at the age of 2 years.To test for differences in timing of antibiotic or antifungal exposure across pregnancy multiple informant models were used which allowed us to test differences in an exposure-outcome relationship across time windows while maintaining the effect estimates that would be obtained fitting separate regression models for each time point.A score test of the equality of all the trimester-specific parameter estimates was used to evaluate differences across trimesters.A generalized estimating equation approach with linear and logistic regression was utilized to fit the multiple informant models for BMI Z-score and overweightobesity respectively.Not all WHEALS children completed a 2-year clinic visit.To account for loss to follow-up we calculated inverse probability weights for complete follow-up.Inverse probability weights were calculated by fitting a logistic regression model for complete follow-up at the age of 2 years with the following baseline maternal factors age race insurance type income including whether or not the question was answered education smokingstatus prenatal alcohol use urban residence marital status history of asthmaallergies and mode of delivery and obtaining the predicted probability of successful follow-up.

In the fully adjusted model prenatal antibiotic use was not statistically significantly associated with BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years 0.17 - 0.18 P  0.35 in offspring of women who delivered via C-section in contrast the association of prenatal antibiotic use with BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years 0.23 - 0.13 P  0.064 approached statistical significance in women who delivered vaginally.20k-o40 k107 28.8Antiviral useChild characteristic at 2-year visitAge years2.2 - 0.32.2 - 0.22.2 - 0.32.2 - 0.2BMI kg m-216.8 - 1.7b16.5 - 1.5b16.8 - 1.816.6 - 1.6BMI Z-score0.17 - 1.1b- 0.04 - 1.1b0.15 - 1.10.06 - 1.1BMI categoryUnderweight BMIo5th percentile20 6.615 6.76 5.929 6.8Normal weight BMI 5th and o85th percentile231 76.2171 76.375 74.3327 76.8Prenatal antimicrobial characteristicsTiming of medication exposure trimesterNumber of medication exposuresTrimester-specific antimicrobial use and BMI at the age of 2 years Trimester of prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with BMI Z-score and overweightobesity at the age of 2 years 3.

Even at early ages children who are obese are at higher risk of becoming obese adolescents and adults prenatal antibiotic use may be one modifiable exposure that could reduce the current rates of childhood obesity particularly if we are able to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.Antibiotic use during pregnancy is associated with alterations in the vaginal microbiome at gestational week 36 with significantly increased Staphylococcus species in women treated with oral antibiotics.Particularly in vaginally born infants the infant gut skin and oral microbiome resembles the maternal vaginal microbiome.Children with greater Staphylococcus aureus counts in fecal samples from 6 or 12 months of age are statistically significantly more likely to be overweight at at the age of 7 years.Thus if prenatal antibiotic exposure increases vaginal Staphylococcus aureus numbers this could explain the increased risk of larger BMI at at the age of 2 years detected in our study.

In animal models maternal antibiotic treatment is associated with alterations in the offspring gut microbiome.Although intrapar- tum maternal antibiotic use in Group B Streptococcus-positive mothers is associated with alterations in the infant gut microbiometo our knowledge data from humans examining whether prenatal antibiotic use over various gestational ages is associated with infant gut microbiome are lacking.

Data from the Project Viva cohort demonstrated a trimester-specific effect of antibiotic exposure on leptin a hormone involved in energy balance and appetite suppression exposures in the first and second trimesters were associated with non-statistically significant lower levels of cord blood leptin whereas exposures in the third trimester were associated with statistically significant higher levels of cord blood leptin.Lower cord blood leptin levels are associated with higher BMI at the age of 3 years.Thus although the associations were not statistically significant the finding of lower leptin in cord blood following first or second- trimester antibiotic exposure is consistent with our finding that earlier pregnancy antibiotic exposure is associated with larger BMI at the age of 2 years.

Finally prenatal exposure to antibiotics could increase the risk of antibiotic use in early childhood which is known to increase the risk of obesityhowever in our cohort prenatal antibiotic use was not associated with early-childhood antibiotic use suggesting that this was not acting as a confounder in our study.

Our results which showed a stronger albeit only near statistically significant association of maternal antibiotic use with BMI Z-score at the age of 2 years in children delivered vaginally compared with those delivered by C-section further suggest that alterations in the microbiome may be a mechanism linking maternal antibiotic use with childhood BMI.first-trimester antibiotic use was not associated with childhood BMI at the age of 7 years.

Inappropriate antibiotic use during pregnancy is common.Although there are clear indications for antibiotic use during pregnancy inappropriate maternal antibiotic use such as for upper respiratory infection of probable viral origin may contribute to the childhood obesity epidemic.
