D PCoA of weighted UniFrac community distances for fecal microbiota of mice transplanted with microbiota from healthy n  23 or MS n  24 twins.

E Mean relative abundances of bacterial genera in fecal samples of mice that received microbiota of healthy donors HD n  20-26 or MS patients MS n  22-26 at 2 and 6 wk after transplantation.and other environmental factors 13 it was not surprising that the composition of gnotobiotic mouse fecal samples reflected incomplete colonization by the human donor microbiota.

Furthermore most notably when transplanted to a transgenic mouse model of spontaneous brain autoimmunity MS twin-derived microbiota induced a signifi- cantly higher incidence of autoimmunity than the healthy twin- derived microbiota.

Second we transplanted fecal samples from selected twin pairs to germ-free mice to assess functional differences in the human intestinal microbiota of MS and healthy twins.ResultsMZ Twin Cohorts Discordant for MS. We assembled a cohort of 34 MZ twin pairs clinically discordant for MS.

Most importantly spontaneous disease critically depends on an intact commensal microbiome as germ- free RR mice remain healthy 7.We reasoned that if the gut microbiota is a determinant factorcontributing to the severity and course of human MS transplanta- tion of human fecal microbial communities from MS twins should result in a higher frequency of spontaneous EAE than the transfer of fecal material from healthy twins.

Remarkably RR mice trans- planted with MS patient-derived microbiota developed sponta- neous EAE at a higher frequency than animals colonized withintestinal bacteria from healthy twins Fig.

The most significant difference however was a reduced abundance of the genus Sutterella in mice colonized with microbiota from the MS twins compared with recipients ofFig.

Obvi- ously more detailed studies of much larger cohorts are needed to further explore the complexities of MS-related microbial associations.The second tier of our strategy transfer of human microbiota into germ-free RR mice led to a particularly interesting obser- vation.
