Further within HFD fed offspring offspring from control and HFD-fed dams clustered separately showing a robust effect of maternal HFD .Maternal HFD and offspring HFD per se altered the expression of 20 and 68 transcripts respectively minimum - 2.0-fold change adjusted P0.05 corrected for multiple testing.

Overall exposure to maternal HFD clearly influenced hepatic gene expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways.Maternal HFD exacerbates hepatic pro-fibrogenic response to a post- weaning MCD dietOffspring from control and HFD fed dams were provided MCD or an appropriate control diet to examine inflammatory changes in the absence of HFD  referred to as CC C-MCD HC or H-MCD groups.

Offspring from HFD dams a gain more weight when challenged with HFD and develop pro-inflammatory gene signatures b show alterations in DNA methylation amongst key developmental genes and c have significant shifts in the gut microbiota composition.The majority of previous studies in rodents have primarily focused on the body composi- tion and cardiovascular consequences for the offspring following maternal HFD .

While our studies do not provide evidence for causal- ity they add to the growing consensus of findings showing early programming of gut micro- bial configurations may contribute to diverse health offspring outcomes including NAFLD and NASH.ConclusionWe have demonstrated that maternal HFD alters the response to post-weaning HFD in the off- spring including hyper-responsiveness in weight gain and fatty liver associated with obesity.Offspring from HFD-dams develop unique transcriptomic changes especially in response to post-weaning HFD typified by greater hepatic immune response.

Quantitative genome-scale DNA methylation analysis of over 1 million CpGs showed persistent epigenetic changes in key genes in tissue development and metabolism Fgf21 Ppargc1b with maternal HFD and in cell adhesion and communication VWF Ephb2 in the combination of maternal HFD and offspring MCD diets.

Analysis of circulating serum metabolites showed cholesterol p0.001 and NEFA p0.05 were significantly affected by maternal HFD and combination of maternal and offspring HFD respectively.

Two-way ANOVA revealed that maternal HFD p0.05 exacerbated the hepatic pro-fibrogenic gene expression response to a post weaning MCD diet  .Maternal HFD in combination with post weaning MCD diet triggers persistent changes in hepatic DNA methylationWe employed RRBS to examine changes in DNA methylation with maternal and offspring MCD diets.

Calculations of Dme the difference in average methylation between groups for each DMR showed that DMRs were equally likely to be either hypo- or hyper-methylated with an average change in methylation between 10-30 .We next focused on interpreting changes in DNA methylation in two contexts maternal HFD per se HC vs CC  and the combination of maternal HFD and offspring MCD diet H-MCD vs CC  P0.0005 and Dme 210.

Hierarchical clustering also showed greater main effect of MCD diets with genes involved in immune system infectious diseases nucleotide metabolismChanges in DNA methylation with either maternal HFD HC vs CC or maternal HFD and offspring MCD dietH-MCD vs CC.

Scatter plots of average methylation of DMRs showing altered methylation with A maternal HFD or B the combination of maternal HFD and offspring MCD diet are presented along with annotation of key genes.
