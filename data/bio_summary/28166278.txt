although gut microbes primarily produce short chain fatty acids acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid via carbohydrate fermentation these organisms also produce branched-chain fatty acids isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid accompanied by toxic compounds including ammonia during protein fermen- tation .

furthermore in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis gut metagenomes were enriched in genes encoding the peptidoglycan pathway and depleted in genes involved in the synthesis of anti-inflammatory molecules and antioxidants suggesting an association between gut metagenomes and host inflammatory status .the purpose of the present study was to determine whether the composition of the gut microbiota and fecal organic acid concentrations are associated with ischemic stroke and if so to examine the associations between these changes and host metabolism and inflammation.materials and methodssubjectspatients with acute ischemic stroke n  175 who were admitted to the department of neurol- ogy juntendo university hospital between april 2014 and march 2015 were examined as potential study participants.

in this regard butyric acid production decreases in the distal part of the large intestine  potentially impacting fecal butyric acid concentrations.furthermore we found that valeric acid concentrations and the detection rates of isovaleric and valeric acid were significantly higher in patients with stroke.

in experimental models dietary supplementation with prebiotics has been shown to promote the growth of presumably beneficial bacterial species and to increase short chain fatty acid concentrations while simultaneously reducing the prevalence of potentially harmful bacteria and the production of protein-derived catabolites such as isobutyric acid isovaleric acid and ammonia in association with modification of gut permeability and inflammation .

the aim of this study was to investigate whether the gut microbiota as well as concentrations of organic acids the major products of dietary fiber fermentation by the gut microbiota are altered in patients with ischemic stroke and to examine the asso- ciation between these changes and host metabolism and inflammation.

however whereas the blood tmao level was reported to predict car- diovascular disease risk  a recent study found that the blood tmao level in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack was lower rather than higher than that of the asymptom- atic group .in particular individuals with obesity  and t2d  exhibit changes in the populations of bacteria that produce organic acids primarily acetic propionic and butyric acid which represent the primary products of dietary fiber fermentation by the gut microbiota and com- prise key pathophysiological molecules for modulating host inflammation and metabolism  .

statistical analyses were performed using jmp 12.0.1 software sas inc. cary nc usa.resultsdemographic profiles of study participantsthe rates of hypertension p  0.03 and t2d p  0.001 as well as the levels of hba1cp  0.008 ldl cholesterol p  0.003 and inflammatory markers such as hscrp p  0.01 and il-6 p  0.001 were significantly higher in patients with stroke than in the control sub- jects .composition of fecal bacteriatotal fecal bacterial counts were similar between patients 10.5 - 0.4 log10 cellsg feces and controls 10.5 - 0.5 log10 cellsg feces and were not statistically significantly different between groups p  0.85. moreover while there were lower fecal numbers of the c. coccoides group and the l. sakei subgroup and higher numbers of the atopobium cluster and enterococcus among stroke patients than in the control subjects these differences did not remain statistically significant after fdr adjustment  .

there were no differences in bioclinical variables such as t2d prevalence and inflammatory marker levels between the bac- teremic and non-bacteremic subjects .correlation between fecal organic acid concentrations and metabolic and inflammatory marker levelsthe total organic acid concentration was significantly lower p  0.02 in patients with stroke 87.6 - 30.6 mmolg feces than in the control subjects 102.5 - 26.3 mmolg feces.

among the organic acids tested the concentrations of acetic acid were significantly lower p  0.003q  0.02 while the concentrations of valeric acid were significantly higher p  0.003 q  0.02 in patients with stroke compared to the controls.

the main producer of valeric acid is currently unknown and it remains unclear whether oscillibacter is the cause of the increased valeric acid concentrations observed in stroke patients in this study.elevated blood levels of lipopolysaccharide lps a major component of the outer mem- brane of gram-negative bacteria are associated with systemic inflammation and cardiovascular disease events .

while signifi- cant increases in the lbp associated with inflammatory marker levels as well as higher rates of live gut bacteria in the blood have been reported in patients with t2d  we observed no differences in lbp concentrations and bacteremia rates between the patients with stroke and the control subjects.there are several limitations to the present study.

although we detected an association between the composition of the gut microbiota and risk factors for stroke information regarding the pre-stroke gut microbial composition of these patients was unavailable.
