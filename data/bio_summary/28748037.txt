The extent to which miRNAs are involved in this phenomenon remains under investigation but differentially expressed genes encoding proteins associated with the innate immune responses appear to be associated with periodontitis- affected tissues .The classical approach in studying miRNAs involves building their profiles from diseased and normal tissues.

This also applies to likely functions of miRNAs in immune and stress responses in periodontal disease as described by Kebschull and Papapanou  and Irwandi and Vacharaksa .The aim of this mini review is twofold first toassess current knowledge as regards altered miRNA profiles found in P. gingivalis-mediated inflamed per- iodontium and second to determine possible func- tions of differentially expressed miRNAs in direct response to immune reactions that paradoxically facilitate bacterial survival and consequently promote pathogenesisprogression of periodontal disease.Key features of the innate immune response to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide LPS endotoxin involves initiation of various signaling cascades within immune cells for example neutrophils.

When investigating early miRNA responses of THP1-differ- entiated macrophages challenged with LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis Naqvi et al.

The results by Naqvi et al.

provide evidence for the expected interplay between miRNA involvements in endotoxin mediated innate responses for the above genes.Effects of miRNA-128 on inflammatory response in periodontitisNa et al.

The increased levels of miRNA- 128 may support a regulatory function during survi- val of P. gingivalis in the inflamed periodontium by muting the host's inflammatory response that would otherwise be very harmful to the host tissues and to some extent also for the bacterium.Possible role for miRNA-132 in periodontitisPark et al.
