crohn's disease inflammatory bowel disease viral diarrhoea hyperthyroidism colitis metabolic diseases such as type ii diabetes and obesity.7-9pcr-dgge with combination of image analysis was used to study the microbial similarity and diversity while dendrogram upgma construction and sequencing were done to analyse the disease associated dgge motifs and taxa.10 real time pcr was done to quantify the clostridium leptum sub group bacteroides vulgatus lactobacillus and bifidobacterium genus to determine the changes in gut microbial composition of tobacco smoker group.7current study aimed to characterize the fecal microbiota of healthy tobacco smoker group also to study the alteration in the diversity and similarity of gut flora of healthy tobacco smoker group with comparison of healthy non-smoker volunteers.material and methodsin this cross-sectional study fecal samples were collected from 14 healthy tobacco smokers chinese men in shaanxi province xi'an china having the history of 10-year tobacco smoking aged between 35 to 50 years and 6 healthy non-smoker volunteers chinese men aged between 35-50 years in a sterile cup.

when all values of statistical samples of tobacco smoker and non-smoker groups were compared by dice similarity coefficient mean similarity index between the two groups was 0.189-0.108 which indicated that it was lower in inter-group than intra-group which shows that gut microbiota of smoker group was different from non- smoker control group.

all the results are summarized in table-5.figure-2 by applying dice's coefficient and upgmatable-1 primer used in pcr-dgge25table-2 primers that used in real time pcr25-28figure-1 dgge profile erected by using universal primer targeting v3 region and cluster analysis of tobacco smoker group s1-s14 and non-smoker control group c1-c6table-3 gut microbial diversity and similarity of smoker and non-smoker control groupresults that are significantly different through mann-whitney u test where p0.05.

these outcomes also indicate that tobacco smoking may cause some changes in the physiology of the intestine which may result in the modulation of gut microbial composition.3in consistent with previous study our results also showed the same phyla bacteroidetes firmicutes and proteobacteria in gut microbiota of tobacco smoker group.8101718 according to sequence results excised gel bands show that opportunistic bacteria got increased in tobacco smoker group and dysbiosis occurred.

hence there is a chance of subtle associations between species abundance and diseases may not necessarily be identified.19 in our study some basic and significant characterization of gut microbialcomposition were established by combining similarity and diversity analysis with dominant bands excision from dgge profile and with pcr re-amplification of excised bands and sequencing.real time pcr was performed to study the quantitative changes of gut microbiota20 and results indicated that a significant reduction of bifidobacterium and non-significant reduction of lactobacillus in tobacco smoker group which are aligned with previous work.78 moreover there was non-significant increase of bacteroides vulgatus and non-significant decrease in clostridium leptum sub group in tobacco smoker group.

this non-significant decrease in clostridium leptum sub group and non-significant increase of bacteroides vulgatus in tobacco smoker group is also in line with previous studies.1021 in our study though there is a non- significant reduction of clostridium leptum sub group in tobacco smoker group but it has been documented in previous study that low levels of clostridium leptum shows high risk factor of asthma development.

results the results indicated that gut microbial diversity in tobacco smoker group was lower than non-smoker controls.

furthermore similarity index comparison also indicated that it was lower in inter-group than intra-group which showed that gut microbial composition was changed in tobacco smoker group.

we also observed that in tobacco smoker group there was a significant reduction in bifidobacterium and non-significant increase in bacteroides vulgatus while non- significant decrease in lactobacillus and clostridium leptum sub group respectively.

conclusion it can be concluded that in healthy chinese tobacco smoker group there is a notable alteration in the molecular characterization of gut microbiota.keywords tobacco smokers gut microbiota characterization dggej ayub med coll abbottabad 20172913-7introductionhuman gut microbiota is considered to be an important factor in determining the health status of an individual.

twohealthy tobacco smoker subjects were tracked for about three weeks to test out the stability of gut microbiota samples collected on day 1 7 14 and 21 days.

neither of the healthy tobacco smoker group and healthy non-smoker group had any previous history of gastrointestinal diseases nor taken probiotics antibiotics and prebiotics 60 days prior to sampling.all fecal samples were thawed and dna extraction was performed by using the qiagen hilden germany mini stool kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with initial bead-beating step of 30 s. at 5000 rpm.

the p-values were calculated by applying the u test where p0.05 was considered as statistically significant.resultsdenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was done with amplified pcr product with universal primers targeting v3 region of 16s rrna gene in both tobacco smoker and non-smoker groups.

for gut microbial diversity analysis between tobacco smoker and non-smoker group mann-whitney u test was used to compare the h1 shannon weaver index of diversity.
