Amplification of PCR was performed in a thermo cycler automated ABI2720 USA by using touchdown PCR program.12 Final PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5 agarose gel and stained in Ethidium bromide solution to visualize under UV illumination.DCodeTM Universal Mutation Detection System Bio-Rad USA was used to perform denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.

8 ml of this was used after centrifugation as a template for PCR re-amplification of 16sRNA gene focusing V3 region with the same primers without GC- clamps as previously were used for DGGE analysis.14 The re-amplified PCR products were sequenced by using ABI 3500xL.15 Real-time PCR detection and quantification were performed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Bio-Rad USA.

d. Comparing of DGGE band profiles by using Dice similarity coefficients between members of tobacco smoker and non-smoker group.Table-4 Sequencing of PCR Amplicons of excised gel bands from DGGE profile and identities based on BLAST databaseTable-5 Real time PCR quantification Mean-SD of different bacteriaData were presented as the average estimate of logarithms of fecal PCR target genetic amplicon copy numbers present in 1 g of feces.

Data were reported as the average estimate of logarithms of fecal PCR target genetic amplicon copy numbers present in 1g of feces.Real time PCR and DGGE experiments were performed thrice Statistics software SPSS 17 was applied for statistical analysis.

Hence there is a chance of subtle associations between species abundance and diseases may not necessarily be identified.19 In our study some basic and significant characterization of gut microbialcomposition were established by combining similarity and diversity analysis with dominant bands excision from DGGE profile and with PCR re-amplification of excised bands and sequencing.Real time PCR was performed to study the quantitative changes of gut microbiota20 and results indicated that a significant reduction of Bifidobacterium and non-significant reduction of Lactobacillus in tobacco smoker group which are aligned with previous work.78 Moreover there was non-significant increase of Bacteroides vulgatus and non-significant decrease in Clostridium leptum sub group in tobacco smoker group.

Real time PCR was also performed to evaluate the copy numbers of some dominant bacteria of intestinal flora.

Crohn's disease inflammatory bowel disease viral diarrhoea hyperthyroidism colitis metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes and obesity.7-9PCR-DGGE with combination of image analysis was used to study the microbial similarity and diversity while dendrogram UPGMA construction and sequencing were done to analyse the disease associated DGGE motifs and taxa.10 Real time PCR was done to quantify the clostridium leptum sub group Bacteroides vulgatus Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus to determine the changes in gut microbial composition of tobacco smoker group.7Current study aimed to characterize the fecal microbiota of healthy tobacco smoker group also to study the alteration in the diversity and similarity of gut flora of healthy tobacco smoker group with comparison of healthy non-smoker volunteers.MATERIAL AND METHODSIn this cross-sectional study fecal samples were collected from 14 healthy tobacco smokers Chinese men in Shaanxi province Xi'an China having the history of 10-year tobacco smoking aged between 35 to 50 years and 6 healthy non-smoker volunteers Chinese men aged between 35-50 years in a sterile cup.

50 ml PCR reaction mixture had 20 pmol of each primer 200 mM of deoxy nucleotide triphosphate dNTP 2U of Taq DNA polymerase Promega USA 2.5 mM MgCl2 2.5 mM 10xbuffer and fecal bacterial DNA 2 ml 120 ng approximately.

Briefly PCR product that were amplified from total bacteria of each fecal sample was loaded in 8 wv acrylamide-bis 37.51 polyacrylamide gels in 1xTAE buffer tank having 3065 linear denaturing gradient.

Each 20 ml reaction mixture contained 1 ml of each primer 5uM shown in Table-2 10 ml of 2xSYBR Green PCR Master Mix TOYOBO Japan 2 ml of DNA fecal sample and 6 ml of sterilized H2O.
