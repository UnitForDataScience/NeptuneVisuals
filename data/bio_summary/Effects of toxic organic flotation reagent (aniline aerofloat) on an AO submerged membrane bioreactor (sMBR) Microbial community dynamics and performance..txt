the first stage occurs between start-up and the early second stage suggestingthat the microbial community were in the process of adaptation to their new environment with the establishment of new community structures capable of effective dda degradation.the second cluster occurred during the stable operation phase of the smbr from the point of increased influent dda concentration in the late second stage to the third stage showing the established and relatively stable community capable of successfully degrading dda at higher loading concentrations and can therefore survive extended operation periods within the smbr.

the digital data were analyzed using four methods  1 similarity analysis 2 cluster analysis 3 diversity analysis and 4 nmds analysis.similarity analysisin order to analyze the similarities within the microbial community a comparison was performed between the inoculated sludge baseline standard and samples taken throughout smbr operation usingtable 3microbial classification using dgge band pattern fingerprinting from various stages of the smbr systems operation.category numbercategory descriptiontypical bandmaintains a stable and dominant position throughout the entire operation process.band 14maintains a stable but not dominant position throughout the entire operation process.band 3 5 6 8 12 13 17 24 and 25the dominant species have evolved into a non-dominant species or even disappeared from within the operating smbr community.band 1 2 4 16 and 19the non-dominant species have evolved into a dominant species within the operating smbr community.band 11 15 20 21 and 22the non-dominant species evolved into a dominant species but following the increase in dda concentration of the influent the species again became a non-dominant species or even disappeared from the microbial community.band 7 9 10 18 and 23table 4sequencing analysis results of partially typical microorganism.fig.

as shown in the similarity diagram in  samples taken from zone o showed a greater degree of similarity to the baseline standard than samples from zone a. this suggests that the microbial community within zone a had significantly adapted altering the microbial dynamics more than the microbial community in zone o. it was also observed that with continued smbr operation the level of similarity between the baseline standard and the microbial communities within zones a and o decreased.

the baseline microbial community was assessed using the initial inoculated sludge that was applied to the smbr sample i. samples were taken to represent microbial community dynamics at different stages of operation with startup stage samples taken at days 8 and 16 100 mgl dda stage samples taken at days 32 and 53 and 200 mgl dda stage samples taken at days 59 and 77.before dna extraction 5 ml of mixed liquor samples were cen-molecular formula molecularweight g molmelting point solubilitychemical characteristictrifuged for 3 min at 12000 rpm with the pellet being used for dna extraction according to manufacturer's instructions using an ezup column soil dna purification kit sangon biotech shanghai china.c6h5nh2pssh280152-157soluble inmild alkali solutionslow hydrolysis in acid solutionpcr amplificationfor dgge analysis 16 s rrna genes were amplified from the dnafig.

the performance of the smbr system was investigated at different dda loading concentrations with assessment of the effects of dda on the microbial communities within the smbr in particular the biodiversity and succession within the microbial community.

conversely very little is known on the effects of organic reagents despite the significance of the potential effects of toxic organic flotation chemicals on microbialcommunity dynamics.the aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of flotation agent removal from floatation wastewater by smbr as well as the effects of organic flotation reagents on smbr performance and bacterial community dynamics.

this indicates clearly an adverse effect of increased dda concentrations on the microbial population of the smbr although the factors involved in microbial adaptation and the degree of recovery require further investigation.dgge fingerprint pattern analysisdgge fingerprint pattern analysis was used to evaluate the effect of dda on the microbial community composition and dynamics within the smbr.

these results demonstrate that despite an initial inhibitory effect of dda exposure stable and healthy dynamics were restored within the microbial communities of the smbr indicating that smbr can be an effective and efficient method of dda removal.change of sludge activityin order to assess the microbial performance within the smbr the mlss concentration of zones o and a as well as the dha activity within zone o were measured periodically with the results outlined in .

alternatively thauera amino aromatica have the ability to efficiently degrade aromatic compounds   showing that category 4 contains highly effective and broad ranging metabolic activity microbial strains therefore inoculation of the smbr with category 4 strains will improve the start-up and dda removal efficiency of smbr systems.category 5 showed similar characteristics to category 4 during thelow dda influent loading stages but the category 5 strains gradually lose dominance during smbr operation particularly with increasing dda concentration of the influent.

therefore maintaining alicycliphilus denitrificans dominance is highly beneficial for effective dda degradation by controlling the concentration of byproducts that inhibit the successful and diverse growth of the microbial community.microbial community dynamicsin order to better assess the dynamics of the microbial community the dgge fingerprint patterns were converted into a digital format using quantity one 4.6.2 software bio-rad usa.

the second sub-cluster represents the operation period with increased dda concentrations when a new community structure was established dominated by strains capable dda degradation at higher loading rates.diversity analysisthe diversity and dynamics of the microbial community was analyzed using a range of indices such as the shannon-wiener diversity index h' equitability index e richness index r and the simpson index d. the calculation results are summarized in .the variation tendency of these indices h' e r and d of zones o and a showed a high degree of similarity.

once the dda loading concentration had increased the microbial community within zone a had experienced a greater degree of inhibition likely due to its contact with high untreated influent dda concentrations.nmds analysisto investigate temporal changes in the microbial community structure nmds time series plots were formed as shown in .

the second large fluctuation in microbial community can be attributed to the accumulation of dda breakdown byproducts that inhibit sensitive strains resulting in the establishment of a new community structure.
