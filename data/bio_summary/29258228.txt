Recently the microbial molecular mechanisms of rumen development have been analyzed in 6-week-old lambs by means of transcriptomics revealing that the rumen microbiota was responsive to early administration of starter feed and showing significant earlier development of rumen metabolism compared to the milk-fed animals .As GIT microbiota fermentation capability appears to be of vital importance to the animal nutrition since early life the knowledge of the combined effect of dietary pattern and microbiota in pre-weaned animals are certainly key to the ensuing sheep production performances.

In conclusion this pilot study supports the suitability of a metaproteogenomic approach to the characterization of microbial and host functions of the lamb GITs opening the way to further studies aimed at investigating the impact of early dietary interventions on the GIT microbiota of small ruminants.Keywords metaproteomics microbial community mucosa ruminant sheepIntroductionIn mammals the gut microbiota has been clearly demonstrated to be of paramount importance for its roles in digestive processes nutrient absorption and metabolism immune response and gastrointestinal tissues development.

At this age the GIT microbiota is expected to be shaped by the dam's teat and the environmental microbiota milk diet starters and initial grazing together with the co-development of the lamb digestive functions.

Therefore the lower bacterial load poses technical limitation to investigate the microbial metabolic functions at the abomasum duodenum jejunum and the proximal ileum level.Hence in this study we aimed to investigate the composition and the functions actively expressed by the microbiota associated to the GIT of a pre-weaned 30 days lamb.

These include GH 9 formerly known as cellulose E that was only found in the ruminal lumen GH 36 alpha-galactosidase higher in the omasum and GH 2 beta-galactosidase present mainly in the lumen of the large intestine Dataset S3.Next given the relevant fermentative activity exerted by both rumen and colon we sought to compare the functional assortment of the microbiota inhabiting the lumen of these two GITs and to determine if similardifferent enzymatic activities are performed by similardifferent members of the microbiota in a pre-weaned lamb.

We demonstrate that the analysis of the diverse ecological niches along the GITs can reveal microbiota composition and metabolic functions although low amounts of microbial proteins could be identified in the small intestinal and mucosal samples.

Concerning the GIT distal to the forestomach from the abomasum to the rectal ampulla however no studies have been yet undertaken to measure the microbial functions actively expressed by the microbiota in the pre-weaned lamb.

The complexity of the microbiota and its functions therefore is in keeping with the massive fermentation capability to be reached in therumen reticulum and omasum and with the significant contribution to feed fermentation provided also by microorganisms that colonize the colon as recently reported .
