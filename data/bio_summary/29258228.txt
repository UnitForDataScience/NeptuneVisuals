an additional annotation concerning metabolic pathways was accomplished by aligning the identified protein sequences against a database containing all bacterial sequences from uniprotkbswiss-prot release 201709 using diamond blastp module e-value threshold 10-5 and retrieving pathway information via the 'retrieve' module of the uniprotkb website by providing the uniprotkbswiss-prot accession numbers .finally a third database uniprotkb sequences belonging to the suborder ruminantia 201710 update 115553 sequences was employed to achieve information concerning the host.the mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the proteomexchange consortium via the pride  partner repository with the dataset identifier pxd008192.data analysis and graph generationrichness and alpha diversity shannon index were calculated for 16s data taxonomic family level metaproteomic data functions and host proteome data.

furthermore when considering functional data richness and diversity of host protein functions were higher than those of microbial functions along all gits with a remarkable increase in the small intestine where the microbial function exhibited the lowest values.figure 1. alpha-diversity and richness distribution along the gastrointestinal tracts of a pre-weaned lamb.

in conclusion this pilot study supports the suitability of a metaproteogenomic approach to the characterization of microbial and host functions of the lamb gits opening the way to further studies aimed at investigating the impact of early dietary interventions on the git microbiota of small ruminants.keywords metaproteomics microbial community mucosa ruminant sheepintroductionin mammals the gut microbiota has been clearly demonstrated to be of paramount importance for its roles in digestive processes nutrient absorption and metabolism immune response and gastrointestinal tissues development.

at this age the git microbiota is expected to be shaped by the dam's teat and the environmental microbiota milk diet starters and initial grazing together with the co-development of the lamb digestive functions.

therefore the lower bacterial load poses technical limitation to investigate the microbial metabolic functions at the abomasum duodenum jejunum and the proximal ileum level.hence in this study we aimed to investigate the composition and the functions actively expressed by the microbiota associated to the git of a pre-weaned 30 days lamb.

our data suggest that a 30-day lamb has already developed mature microbial functions in the forestomachs while the effect of the milky diet appears to be more evident in the remaining gits.

recently the microbial molecular mechanisms of rumen development have been analyzed in 6-week-old lambs by means of transcriptomics revealing that the rumen microbiota was responsive to early administration of starter feed and showing significant earlier development of rumen metabolism compared to the milk-fed animals .as git microbiota fermentation capability appears to be of vital importance to the animal nutrition since early life the knowledge of the combined effect of dietary pattern and microbiota in pre-weaned animals are certainly key to the ensuing sheep production performances.

the composition of the mucosal microbiota inhabiting the pre-weaned lamb forestomachs appeared to be globally comparable to that found in the lumen in spite of a drop of pirellulaceae counterbalanced by higher levels of veillonellaceae phylum firmicutes 12 in rumen and 15 in reticulum and lachnospiraceae phylum firmicutes both 11. furthermore veillonellaceae 19 in the luminal and 11 in the mucosal community and xanthomonadaceae phylum proteobacteria both 18 were the most abundant families observed in the omasum microbiota where some families observed in the first two tracts were also detected such as ruminococcaceae pirellulaceae and f16.

these include gh 9 formerly known as cellulose e that was only found in the ruminal lumen gh 36 alpha-galactosidase higher in the omasum and gh 2 beta-galactosidase present mainly in the lumen of the large intestine dataset s3.next given the relevant fermentative activity exerted by both rumen and colon we sought to compare the functional assortment of the microbiota inhabiting the lumen of these two gits and to determine if similardifferent enzymatic activities are performed by similardifferent members of the microbiota in a pre-weaned lamb.

concerning the git distal to the forestomach from the abomasum to the rectal ampulla however no studies have been yet undertaken to measure the microbial functions actively expressed by the microbiota in the pre-weaned lamb.

through a metaproteogenomic approach we provide here an extensive description of the different microbial communities colonizing 10 tracts of a pre-weaned lamb git from the rumen to the rectum and of the host digestive functions in the different git biotopes.materials and methodsanimal description and sample collectiona lamb of sarda dairy sheep was slaughtered at 30 days after birth.

with the aim of achieving knowledge of both taxonomy and functions of the different git microbiotas in the pre-weaned lamb and to this end to investigate the feasibility of a metaproteogenomic approach 10 gits rumen reticulum omasum abomasum duodenum jejunum ileum cecum colon and rectum were collected from a 30-day-old sarda lamb fed mother's milk and forage.

no clear separation among luminal and mucosal samples could be observed figure a. according to metaproteomic data a global separation was seen between luminal contents of forestomachs and large intestine on one hand and luminal contents of small intestine and all mucosal contents on the other hand figure b. according to these data similar fibrolytic taxa are expected to be active in the lumen of the forestomachs and the larger intestine.
