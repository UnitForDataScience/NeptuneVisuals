despite several lines of evidence correlating gut microbiota to mental health we still lack knowledge about the cor- relation between gut microbiota and mental health including behavior in humans.furthermore there is a growing body of evidence that gastroin-testinal symptoms are associated with psychological distress such as anxiety depression and neuroticism  .

understanding the role of personality on gut microbiota can help us understand that of men- tal health on gut microbiota.this research examines this relationship within the framework of the five-factor model of personality which includes neuroti- cism extraversion openness to experience agreeableness and conscientiousness using the revised neo personality inventory neo pi-r .

in addition personality has been linked to regulations in the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal hpa axis activity as well as to a pro-inflammatory cyto- kine response  providing a rational basis by which personality may be associated with gut microbiota.in the present study we aim at identifying correlations betweenhuman gut microbiota and personality.

though the current study focused on correlations between personality and gut microbiota further studies are needed to examine mediation effects of diet on relationships between per- sonality and gut microbiota.

although multiculturalism has reduced lifestyle differences between asian and western populations sig- nificant distinctions persist including patterns of food consump- tion multiple products of gut microbial and host co-metabolism and gut microbiota compositions .

previous research on behavior and gut microbiota has focused primarily on animal models but researchers should be cautious when extrapolating these findings to humans  .we show that personality traits are correlated with gut micro-biota composition.

here we first report correlations between personality traits and gut microbiota.

the diversity and the composition of the human gut micro- biota exhibited significant difference when stratified by personality traits.

we found that personality traits were significantly correlated with diversity of gut microbiota while their differences were extre- mely subtle.

our findings will contribute to elu- cidating potential links between the gut microbiota and personality and provide useful insights toward developing and testing personality- and microbiota-based interventions for promoting health.c 2017 the authors.

there is considerable research showing that the gut microbiota can influence all aspects of physiology including gut-brain communication brain function and behavior .

behaviors constitute an important element in bidirectional communication between the gut and brain.

although a link between the gut microbiota and anxiety stress and depression-related behaviors has recently been established in mice   limited infor- mation is available from human studies.

investigating the dynamics of behavior-gut associations in adults is important because the gut microbiome is practically stable in healthy adults and the microbiome plays a role in the maintenance of a healthy state in adulthood .0889-1591c 2017 the authors.
