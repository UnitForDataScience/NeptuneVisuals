In this study antibiotic-inducedsuppression of the intestinal microbiota reduced the urinary excretion of hippuratephenylpropionic acid phenylacetylglycine indoxyl-sulphate trimethylamine-N-oxide TMAOand the short chain fatty acid SCFA acetate.

Thecirculating and hepatic bile acid pool contains more than 30 known bile acids and the gutmicrobiota is responsible for driving the majority of this diversity Garcia-Canaveras 2012 22.Primary bile acids cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are synthesized in the liver fromcholesterol and are conjugated with either taurine or glycine before secretion into the bile.Upon ingestion of a meal bile acids stored in the gall bladder are expelled from the gall bladderinto the small intestine and although the majority are actively absorbed in the small intestinea minor amount 1-5 200-800 mg daily in humans reaches the colon.

Targeted profiling ofthe bile acid signature enables a detailed overview of the enterohepatic circulation to begained and the influence of the gut microbiota to be studied Sarafian 2015 8.

The absence or attenuation of the gut microbiota shifted the bile acidsignature to one dominated by taurine-conjugated bile acids and strikingly reduced thediversity of the bile acid pool.

Phenylacetylglycine arises from the bacterial metabolism of the aminoacid phenylalanine to phenylacetate which is conjugated with glycine in the rat liver to formphenylacetylglycine and with glutamine in the human liver to form phenylacetylglutamine.Hippurate is the glycine conjugate of benzoic acid which can be derived from the bacterialmetabolism of phenylalanine chlorogenic acid and catechins.

Many bacteria possess bile salt hydrolase BSHenzymes that deconjugate the bile acid from its amino acid.

Once deconjugated furtherbacterial modifications can occur such as dehydroxylation giving rise to secondary bile acidssuch as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid.

However there is a dearth of information whichconsiders that the microbes colonising the various niches of the human body may actuallyhave co-evolved with the host and provide essential functions not found in the host's genome.The role of mammalian microbiome is revealed in extremis when animals are reared in asterile environment Tlaskalova-Hogenova 2014 41Marcobal 2013 42 and thus do notdevelop in the presence of a microbiota.

Metabolic profiling approaches are increasingly used to studymetabolic function of the gut microbiota.

Statistically and biologically validated output from metabolic profiling mayeventually be applied to further mechanistic investigation and clinical diagnosis andtherapeutic decision making.Examples of using metabolic profiling to study gut microbial functionalityThe advancement of systems biology techniques in particular metabolic profilingmetabolomicsmetabonomics and mathematical modelling approaches has expanded theresolution at which we can study the metabolic contribution of the gut microbiota and theirinteraction with host biochemistry.
