WeedingDespite the increased bacterial load we found that bacterial com- munities on beetle-prepared carcasses showed levels of species rich- ness and diversity that were no different from those associated with a  Seeding and replantingConsistent with the seeding and replanting mechanisms bacterial communities on burying beetle-prepared carcasses were changed by the addition of groups such as Clostridiales Tissierella and other un- classified OTUs Moraxellaceae Acinetobacter and Xanthomonadales Wohlfartiimonas the latter at very low abundances Figure 5.

It is possible that the increased bacterial load observedin beetle-prepared carcasses when compared with fresh or buried carcasses may be due to bacterial growth occurring during the 24 hr between beetle removal and carcass sampling.

At the very least our results show that beetle-prepared carcasses offer an environment which is highly amenable for bacterial growth contrary to that previ- ously assumed.Manually buried carcasses showed surprisingly low levels of bacterial load which suggests that at least on the external surface of the carcass microbes are not a major source of competition.

An example of such a fast-growing bac- terium could be Myroides which thrives in beetle-prepared carcasses but is scarce in manually buried carcasses.Further evidence consistent with the weeding mechanism comes from our finding that bacterial community membership differed be- tween beetle-prepared carcasses and both fresh and manually buried carcasses Figure 3b.

i Preserving should lead to a reduction in bacterial load in the resource manipulated by the animal in comparison to an unma- nipulated resource whereas this is not necessarily predicted for other mechanisms ii new bacterial groups unobserved on the resource in the absence of manipulation by the animal should appear in bacterial communities manipulated by seeding or replanting but not by pre- serving or weeding and iii if animals are seeding their resource with beneficial bacteria these seeded groups should be in the ani-mals' own microbiota in a long-standing evolutionary association.We investigated which of these mechanisms best accounts for the way in which burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides manage the bac- terial community on their breeding resource.

We discarded the supernatant and stored the pellet at -80degC until DNA extraction.Analysing bacterial samples from fresh carcasses allowed us to char- acterize the bacterial communities present on the surface of the carcass before introduction of beetles.

Present in lower abundances one Micromonosporaceae a Planococcaceae one Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia-Shigella another Pseudomonas and one unclassified Alphaproteobacteria were also indicator species Table 2 Figure 5.0.40.20.0-0.20.40.20.0-0.2-0.4-0.2-0.10.20.10.3FIGURE 2 Non-metric multidimensional scaling plot of the three dimensions of an ordination of a 2653 bacterial operational taxonomic units OTUs present in soil and carcass samples and b 284 bacterial OTUs in beetles' gut and exudatesAs Figure 5 illustrates few OTUs were exclusively present in beetle- prepared carcasses.

An examination of bacterial communities on carcasses under different manipulations should pro- vide interesting information regarding which groups are endogenous and seeded and which are environmentally acquired and replanted.At the community level breeding beetles differed from non-virgin non-breeding beetles Figure 4 potentially because bacterial species richness and diversity was lower in the guts of non-breeding females than the guts of breeding females.

Hence despite the higher concentration of bac- terial DNA in beetle-prepared carcasses these bacterial communities comprised fewer species than unprepared carcasses of the same age.FIGURE 1 Estimated copy number of the 16S rRNA gene quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the three carcass treatments fresh beetle-prepared and buriedof total sequence abundance.

We allowed carcasses to rest for a day to minimize differences between carcasses simply due to the physical manipulation of carcasses by beetles.
