these rats had higher levels of cytotoxic t-cells in their spleens.interpretation -- the failure to reproduce older experiments in clean rats was striking and the difference in response between these and staphylococcus-carrying rats suggests that the prp effect is dependent on the immune status.

all cages were provided with shredded paper wooden pegs and hiding places.standard treatmentthe achilles tendon was transected in 181 rats weighing on average 245 g sd 25. the rats were anesthetized with iso- flurane gas.

2006. the stimulatory effect disappeared if the limb was mechanicallyunloaded and increased if the rats were stimulated to increase their physical activity virchenko and aspenberg 2006. these studies were the first to show effects of platelets in tendon healing and might in part be responsible for the unfortunate surge in clinical use of prp especially in sports medicine.after these studies we left the prp field and focused on the role of mechanical stimulation of tendon healing using the same rat model.

in all 242 rats were used.results -- in 4 consecutive experiments on pathogen-free rats no effect of prp on healing was found.

the rats were transferred to another facility and then for the first time the old effects of prp appeared again.table 1. overview of the experimental groupsmethodsoverview242 rats were used in 6 experiments.

the group mean difference between prp and saline had a 95 confidence interval ci of -4.3 to 2.7 n corresponding to-10 to 6 of control mean p  0.9 indicating that any meaningful effect could be excluded.the first experiment on staphylococcus-carrying rats showed increased peak force by 17 p  0.04 but also increased peak stress and energy uptake table 4.comparing experiment 4 the final clean experiment and experiment 5 staphylococcus there was an interaction between bacterial status and prp treatment p  0.03 figure 1. there was also an interaction for peak stress p  0.003 and cross-sectional area p  0.03 but not for stiffness p  0.2.the sixth confirmatory experiment on staphylococcus car- riers showed an increased peak force by 16 but this time it was not statistically significant p  0.1.the anova on all experiments with an 11-day duration showed an interaction between the effects of bacterial status and prp on peak force p  0.003. post hoc we also analyzed peak stress stiffness and cross-sectional area which showed similar interactions p  0.001 p  0.01 and p  0.05 figure 2.peak force n706050403020100salineprpsalineprpcleancontaminedfigure 1. peak force for contaminated and uncontaminated rats using prp or saline as treatment groups 4 and 5. contaminated means carrying staphylococcus aureus.peak force n70605040302010023456cleancontaminatedfigure 3. t-cells in all samples.

the ratio of cd3cd8a cells was higher in the pathogen- free rats mann-whiney test p  0.03. the cd3cd4 cd8a double-positive t-cells was severalfold higher in the pathogen-free rats mann-whitney test p  0.009 figure 3.discussionthe clinical experience with prp is disappointing schepull et al.

in contrast apparently healthy rats carrying staphylococcus aureus showed increased strength of the healing tendon after prp treatment.

still the immune system in the contaminated and the pathogen-free rats was clearly different.this is the first study to suggest a possible interaction between microbiota and tendon healing.

extrapo- lation from our previous findings with prp to the situation in humans therefore becomes even more uncertain.we have previously shown that platelet concentrates platelet- rich plasma prp can improve tendon healing in a rat achil- les tendon model.

the tendon complex was exposed through a transverse skin incision lateral to the achilles tendon.

the plantaris tendon was removed and the achilles tendon was cut transversely in the middle part.
