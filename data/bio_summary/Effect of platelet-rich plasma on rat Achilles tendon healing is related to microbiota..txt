These rats had higher levels of cytotoxic T-cells in their spleens.Interpretation -- The failure to reproduce older experiments in clean rats was striking and the difference in response between these and Staphylococcus-carrying rats suggests that the PRP effect is dependent on the immune status.

The tendon complex was exposed through a transverse skin incision lateral to the Achilles tendon.

The plantaris tendon was removed and the Achilles tendon was cut transversely in the middle part.

The stimulatory effect disappeared if the limb was mechanicallyunloaded and increased if the rats were stimulated to increase their physical activity Virchenko and Aspenberg 2006.

The rats were transferred to another facility and then for the first time the old effects of PRP appeared again.Table 1.

The rats were anesthetized with iso- flurane gas.

The rats were killed by exsanguination.

The PRP was not irradiated.Evaluation--mechanical testing11 days after surgery the rats were anesthetized with isoflu- rane gas and killed with CO2.

The absorbance at 450 nm was mea- sured with a microplate reader.Flow cytometryThe spleen from 12 female Janvier Sprague-Dawleys rats was removed under anesthesia as above.

The other 6 rats were specific opportunistic patho- gen-free SOPF from the uncontaminated breeding house.
