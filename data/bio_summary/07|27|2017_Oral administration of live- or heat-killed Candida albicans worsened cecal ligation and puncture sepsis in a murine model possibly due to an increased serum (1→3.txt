However while the serum cytokines were normalized serum BG level was still higher than sham control .Oral administration of either live- or heat-killed-Candida albicans before cecal ligation and puncture increased several intestinal anaerobic bacteria but not aerobic bacteriaBecause gram negative bacteria are well-known causative agents of severe bacterial sepsis it is possible that oral Candida administration might enhance gram negative bacteria in gut.Accordingly we characterized the fecal gut bacterial microbiota  to evaluate the effect of Blood bacterial count A peritoneal bacterial count B and bacterial count from internal organs C are shown.

Moreover fluconazole reduced fecal fungal burdens serum BG and attenuated sepsis severity in CLP with live-Candida administration but not CLP-alone.This supports the potential importance of intestinal fungi as a source of serum BG in bacterial sepsis.Another factor that could be responsible for the more severe sepsis after an oral fungi administration is the alteration in gut microbiota.

On the other hand quantitative analysis of blood bacterial count peritoneal bacterial count and bacterial count from the inter- nal organs at 18h post-CLP were positive for mixed bacterial colonies but the levels were not different among groups .Oral live-Candida administration converted fecal Candida culture from negative to positive in a time dependent manner after CLP despite the absence of candidemia .

We recently demonstrated the attenuation of gut leakage with Lactobacilli in a C. difficile-induced sepsis model .Thus decreased Lactobacilli might enhance gut-leakage in our model resulting in the translo- cation of gut BG.Although the increased sepsis severity in our models could be responsible from fungal fac- tors fecal Candida burdens and serum BG andor bacterial factor gut microbiome alter- ation the data from the CLP-Candida model that i the oral administration of live- or heat killed- Candida increased sepsis severity and ii the reduction of fecal Candida with flucona- zole without additional antibacterial drugs attenuated sepsis severity implied a more promi- nent influence of fungal factors over bacterial factor in bacterial sepsis severity in our models.

The animal protocols were approved by theInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Faculty of Medicine Chulalongkorn University Bangkok Thailand.Cecal ligation and puncture at 3h after oral-administration of Candida albicans CLP with immediate Candida administration modelLive- C. albicans oral administration at 1x106 CFU with cecal ligation and puncture CLP surgery induced positive fecal fungi without fungemia within 24h after administration.

The compatibility between serum BG and serum cytokines in the early phase of sepsis18h post-CLP and the discordance of these parameters in the late phase of sepsis 96h post- CLP implies the different influence of serum BG in the different phase of sepsis.

It is also interesting to note that the impact of intestinal Candida on bacterial sepsis severity was also more predominant than the effect from fecal-microbiome alteration in the 5 days Candida colonization model a model with the influence of mixed-oral antibiotics .Because serum BG in normal mice is usually absent or very low  30 pgml it is interest- ing to note that serum BG elevation is demonstrated after CLP without Candida administra- tion .

In compar- ison with CLP-control serum BG was higher in CLP with heat-killed Candida administration at 6h but not at 18h after CLP .

Organ injury as demonstrated by serum creatinine Scr for kidney injury C alanine transaminase ALT for liver injury D serum cytokines TNF-a IL-6 and IL-10 E-G fecal Candida burdens H and serum 1 3-b-D-glucan BG I was analyzed.n  6-7group  p  0.05 vs. NSS p  0.05respectively .

This implied the enhanced serum BG after an oral BG administration.Moreover Scr but not serum BG ALT and cytokines in CLP with heat killed-Candida was higher than CLP-control .
