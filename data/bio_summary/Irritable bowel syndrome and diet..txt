IBS subtypes include constipation- predominant IBS-C diarrhea-predominant IBS-D and IBS with predominant irregular mixed diarrheaconstipation bowel habits IBS-M. IBS subtypes are classified according to the 7-point Bristol Stool Form Scale which is based on stool ap- pearance ranging from type 1 separate hard lumps like nuts hard to pass to type 7 watery no solid pieces entirely liquid and is considered a reliable marker for colonic transit -.

Major abnormalities involve temporal instability  degree of variations  and microbiota composition according to IBS subtypes - and increased intestinal mucosal permeability associated with a low-grade of inflamma- tion -.Since the symptoms that define IBS are not unique organic diseases that can mimic IBS i.e.
