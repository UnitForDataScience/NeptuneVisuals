An increase on the CAID of Ca was promoted by 60-DWP diet compared to control diet P  0.041 while no differences were found between 60-DWP and 80-WPC P  0.695 or 80-WPC and control diet P  0.119.

Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria decreased their abundance in birds fed 60-DWP diets 31 and 6 respectively and 80-WPC diets 39 and 5 respectively while Firmicutes increased their abundance 63 in 60-DWP and 55 in 80-WPC.

Sequences are available at the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number PRJEB17510 in Chemical analyses and calculationsExperimental diets and ileum samples were analyzed in triplicate for DM method 934.01 total ash method 942.05 CP method 990.03 ether extract method 920.39 according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists Measurements of Ca P and Cr2O3 oxide were determined by spectroscopy plasma atomic emission.Calculation of nutrients CAID was made using the following formulaCAID of diet component 14dDiet component  Cr2O3Thd-dDiet component Cr2O3Thi dDiet component  Cr2O3Thdwhere Diet componentCr2O3d is the ratio of the diet component to the Cr2O3 content in the diet and Diet com- ponentCr2O3i is the ratio of the component to Cr2O3 in the ileal digesta.Statistical analysisFor analysis of productive performance and nutrient CAID pen was considered the experimental unit.

Feeding birds with experimental diets did not influence the CAID of DM and CP P  0.402 and 0.201 respectively.Trial 2 Performance parametersBroilers fed with 60-DWP and 80-WPC diets showed the highest values for growth parameters in the analyzed periods 1.

Chickens fed with 60-DWP and 80-WPC showed an increase in the CAID of P when com- pared with control diet P  0.001 and 0.002 respectively while no differences were found between 60-DWP and 80-WPC P  0.406.
