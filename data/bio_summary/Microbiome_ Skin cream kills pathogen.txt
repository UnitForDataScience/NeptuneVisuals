Warren Wrightat North Carolina State University in Raleigh and his colleagues simulated asupernova and calculated the number of neutrinos it would generate and the timing of GENOMICSPrehistory's female dynastiestheir release if the star's gravity initially limited the explosion and the nuclear reaction spread across the star's entire surface before the star exploded.This would create two distinct neutrino bursts that would be much fainter than the single burst that would be made by a faster explosion which the team calculated in a previous study published last year.

Interfaces2017 EVOLUTIONHow humans adapt to arsenicPeople living in Chile's Atacama Desert have different versions of a gene that allow them to cope with the region's naturally high levels of arsenic.Arsenic from rocks seeps into the desert's scarce water sources exposing people in the Camarones Valley to levels 100 times higher than the safelimit of 10 micrograms per litre set by the World Health Organization.

orgbz4s 2017 NEUROSCIENCEPredicting smell from structureAlgorithms can predict a molecule's odour on the basis of its chemical structure.Pablo Meyer at IBM's Computational Biology Center in Yorktown Heights New York and his colleagues asked 49 people to smell hundreds of molecules pictured and rate them on intensity pleasantness and19 other descriptors such as 'fruit' 'musky' and 'bakery'.The researchers gave these ratings along withinformation on the substances' chemical structures to22 teams of computational scientists who competed tobuild the best predictive machine-learning algorithms.

This may explain the polymer's high degree of stickiness underwater the authors say.ACS Appl.

After initially developing and training their algorithms ona partial data set the teams tested their algorithms' abilities to predict people's perception of the remaining molecules.Across all models 'garlic' and 'fish' were the best- predicted attributes at about 70 accuracy.

Douglas Kennett at Pennsylvania StateUniversity in University Park and his colleagues examined DNA from nine individuals buried in a crypt at Chaco Canyon in New Mexico pictured a major population centre between ad 800 and 1130.The crypt contained thousands of turquoise and shell artefacts finely made pottery and musical instruments suggesting that the people belonged to an elite class.

Other bacteria that normally live harmlessly on the skin are known to produce antimicrobial compoundsso Richard Gallo at the University of California San Diego and his colleagues set out to investigate whether these bacteria help to combatS.

Jonathan Wilker and his colleagues at Purdue University in West Lafayette Indiana created a polymer with some of the same structural elements as the sticky protein threads that mussels make to attachthemselves to rocks and other surfaces.Previous adhesives had catechol chemical groups attached to a synthetic polystyrene backbone butthe new material incorporates these groups into the backbone as mussels' adhesive proteins do.
