When challenged with a glucose tolerance test WTWT mice fed HFD again showed impaired glucose tolerance which was partially but significantly alleviated in the absence of hematopoietic NOD1 F. Notably these ob- servations were not due to differences in insulin secretion Fig- ure S3C suggesting that KOWT mice have improved insulin sensitivity.

The neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 CXCL2 and CXCL12 were upregulated with HFD in EWAT from WTWT mice but remarkably did not change in KOWT mice and a lesser phosphorylation of the NF-kB p65 subunit in EWAT from KOWT mice correlated with lower production of these chemokines A and 5B.

Further while HFD suppressed insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in EWAT of WTWT mice insulin action was intact in the KOWT mice H. Collectively these results demonstrate that NOD1 depletion specifically from immune cells improves glucose and insulin tolerance at the adipose tissue and whole-body level independent of changes in body weight or adiposity.Hematopoietic NOD1 Regulates Adipose Tissue Pro- inflammatory Macrophage Polarization and Neutrophil InfiltrationA hallmark of metabolic inflammation is a rise in adipose tis- sue immune cells during HFD or obesity.

Total CD11b F480 macrophage numbers were higher in HFD-fed WT WT mice as previously shown for non-chimeric WT mice   and importantly a similar elevation in EWAT macrophages was observed in KOWT mice A.Thus EWAT macrophage infiltration was not dependent on he- matopoietic NOD1.

In line with reports on WT mice  EWAT neutrophil counts were higher in HFD-fed WTWT mice but strikingly this infiltration was abolished in the absence of hematopoietic NOD1 E. Corroborating these obser- vations expression of elastase Elane a neutrophil-specific enzyme reported to trigger insulin resistance   was higher in EWAT of HFD-fed compared to LFD-fed WTWT but not KOWT mice F. Notably in the liver neutrophil infiltration was also dependent on hematopoietic NOD1 Figure S4.

Using a HEK293T cell-basedreporter assay that responds to NOD1 activation we observed that serum from HFD-fed mice had a higher NOD1 activating capacity compared to low fat diet LFD-fed mice A revealing that HFD elevates circulating NOD1 activators.

As reported for both mice and humans   the Bacteroidetes to Firmi- cutes ratio decreased with HFD in our WTWT mice relative to LFD-fed controls and this change was not affected by the absence of NOD1 in immune cells Figure S2A.

HFD induced a marked increase in pro- inflammatory CD11c macrophages in the WTWT mice as ex- pected but notably this elevation of CD11c macrophages was lower in KOWT mice B.
