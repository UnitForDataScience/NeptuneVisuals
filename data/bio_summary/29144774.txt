a second consequence of the genomic revolution has been the development of molecular methods to investigate the composition and function of microbial communities including unculturable forms leading to the recognition that the sustained vigor and fitness of both plants and insects are dependent on interactions with resident microorganisms collectively known as the microbiome 18 42. it is becoming increasingly evident that members of the microbiome can influence insect-plant interactions and can contribute to strategies for enhanced crop resistance to insect pests.the main purpose of this article is to explore three broad routes for the discovery of novelsources of resistance to insects to customize plant secondary chemistry for specific toxicity or deterrence to insect pests to harness plant immunity against insect pests and to target the mi- crobiome of insect pests.

interactions between the plant immune system and natural enemies are indicated with solid lines arrow positive interaction bar negative interaction and selection pressures leading to evolution and diversification of effectors and eti are denoted by dashed lines.responses equivalent to the conserved pathogen-triggered immunity pti and insect effectors are predicted to coevolve with plant effector-triggered immunity eti yielding dominant alleles of single genes that confer resistance to the insect pest 64. here the evidence for insect elicitors and effectors is considered in turn.insect elicitorsinsects inadvertently reveal their presence to plants by constituents in their oral secretions saliva gut regurgitant and egesta frass honeydew and by the oviposition fluids released by female insects depositing eggs into plant tissue 109. these candidate insect elicitors of plant immune responses include fatty acid-amino acid conjugates commonly an unsaturated c18-fatty acid coupled to glutamine or glutamate e.g.

different approaches will be required for the following different environmental circumstances especially the increased variability in rainfall and temperature asso- ciated with climate change 75 different crops including new crop varieties designed for changing conditions 71 and new crop species generated by targeted domestication of plant species with desirable traits 95 and different insect pests that arise through ecological release by changes in agricultural practice or climate and by human-mediated transport to different geographical regions 10 96 135.the repeated experience of insect pest control in the twentieth century has taught us that there can be no permanent solution for insect crop pests because insects are under intense selection pressure to break control measures including plant resistance mechanisms 135. the durability of resistance traits in plants can be enhanced by adherence to well-designed resistance management strategies as used with some success for bt crops 20 127. these approaches will increasingly be complemented by new technologies that offer the potential to design crops that can be patched in real time against evolving insect pests.

additionally piercing-and-sucking insects are important vectors of plant disease agents including viruses and bacteria.despite the very large number of phytophagous insect species phytophagy has a restricted distribution across the insect phylogeny with representatives in just 8 26 of the 31 orders figure 1. many of the most important crop pests are members of just two insect orders that include 100000 phytophagous species and that display the chewing feeding habit the lepi- doptera butterflies and moths whose caterpillar larvae are both ancestrally and near-universally phytophagous and the coleoptera beetles in which phytophagy by both larvae and adults has evolved multiple times.

tipulid crane flies cecidomyiid midges and tephritid flies and with a diversity of feeding styles and two groups with the chewing feeding habit the predominantly phytophagous order of orthoptera grasshop- pers and locusts and the sawflies and wood wasps within the hymenoptera ants bees and wasps.3.4douglasthe remaining insect orders with phytophagous representatives are the thysanura thrips which include important pests and the phasmatoda stick insects each comprising 10000 species.technologies for crop resistance against insect peststhe complementary roles of conventional breeding and genetic technologiesonce plant traits conferring resistance to insect pests are identified the priority is to introduce them to crop genotypes that already have multiple desirable traits e.g.

specifically smartstaxqr pro monsanto includes a dsrna sequence against the snf7 gene of the western corn rootworm stacked with cry3bb1 also with activity against the western corn rootworm and a herbicide re- sistance gene 85. the snf7 protein is a class e vacuolar sorting protein and its downregulation results in perturbation to protein deubiquitination and autophagy in the insect midgut and fat body 104. rnai against lepidopteran and hemipteran pests is used widely in research but can be less re- liable than in the coleoptera 119 132. strategies to enhance the efficacy of in planta rnai against insect pests include expression of long hairpin rna hprna in the chloroplast to minimize pro- cessing by the plant rnai machinery 5 149 and stacking the hprna against the gene of interest with hprna against nonspecific nucleases expressed in the gut of the target insect 121 122.genome editing by crisprgenome editing technology dramatically expands the opportunities for introducing resistance traits into crops 57. the most widely used crispr clustered regularly interspersed shortdouglaspalindromic repeats system in eukaryotes including plants has been designed from the crispr cas9 bacterial defense against viruses.

two approaches are especially promising plant delivery of microbicides that suppress microorganisms associated with the insect including microbial partners required by the insect pest and plant pathogens vectored by the insect and the use of plant-associated microorganisms for delivery of novel insecticides.

the use of genetically manipulated microorgan- isms to control pathogen transmission which has been applied to suppress vector competence in hematophagous insects 46 111. resolution of these generic challenges for managing the mi- crobiome of insect pests will create new opportunities for both human health and agricultural production.outlookstrategies to control insect crop pests need to take into account that many aspects of crop produc- tion including large-scale monoculture intensive crop production schedules and elimination of natural enemies by broad-spectrum chemical pesticides promote colonization feeding and pop- ulation increase of insect pests.

recent advances in metabolic engi- neering of plant secondary chemistry offer the promise of specific toxicity or deterrence to insect pests improved understanding of plant immunity against insects provides routes to optimize plant defenses against insects and the microbiomes of insect pests can be exploited either as a target or as a vehicle for delivery of insecticidal agents.

implementation of these ad- vances will be facilitated by ongoing advances in plant breeding and genetic technologies.3.1contentsintroductionglobally an estimated 20-40 of crop yield is lost to pests and disease 50 and insect pests represent a significant portion of this loss both by direct damage and indirectly through the transmission of plant disease 93. reducing the burden of insect crop pests is a key priority particularly since an estimated 70-100 increase in global food production will be required by 2050 to feed the burgeoning human population 50 106 137. there is a growing consensus that this target should be met by sustainable intensification i.e.

increasing insect resistance the greater regulatory burden linked to environmental toxicity and concerns for human health and the high cost of bringing new products to market are already having impacts on traditional insecticide rd 14.how is crop loss to insect pests to be reduced part of the solution lies in the problemagricultural crops provide attractive and nutritious food for many phytophagous insects.

specifically the insect trait is defined in terms of one or multiple gene targets and plant resistance is defined as as a gene or suite of genes with a product or products that inactivate or otherwise disable the product or products of the target insect gene or genes.

the article concludes with an outlook that addresses the principal opportunities and barriers for enhanced crop resistance to insect pests.the insect pests of cropsa key factor contributing to the importance of insects the class insecta as crop pests is their diversity.

for some chewing insect species one or multiple life stages live within the plant tissues the adult females deposit eggs deep within the plant or larval insects  strategies for enhanced crop resistance3.35 x 1054 x 1053 x 1052 x 1051 x 1050insect ordersfigure 1the incidence of phytophagous insect species across the 31 orders of the class insecta.

conventional breeding is possible where the trait of interest is present in the same species for example in a land race or sexually compatible plants of related species and the timescales for breeding projects can be reduced by marker-assisted selection 31. however genetic technologies including genetic transformation and genome editing can dramatically accelerate the production of cultivars with insect resistance and are essential for crops with limited genetic diversity in the desired traits.bt and other protein toxinsthe success of crop genetic technologies is epitomized by the insecticidal bt toxins produced by the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis 97. more than 200 bt genes are known each active against a restricted range of insects and thus conferring exquisite specificity with minimal direct impact on nontarget organisms including natural enemies of the insect pest.
