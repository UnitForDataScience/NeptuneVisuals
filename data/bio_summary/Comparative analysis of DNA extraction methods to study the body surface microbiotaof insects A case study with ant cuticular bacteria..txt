statistical analysesto evaluate potential errors in dna extraction protocols we assessed whether the extraction methods yielded similar amounts of artefactual contaminants bacterial or false-positive otus.

these should result in flatter rarefaction curves and lower number of otus than for biological samples.we then assessed the effect of dna extraction protocols num- ber of individuals used for extraction and individual body size on the cuticular bacterial beta-diversity community composition varia- tion across samples.

community differences were visualized using a principal coordinates analysis pcoa and effects of dna extraction method ant species and their interaction were tested with a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova anderson 2001.the multivariate homogeneity analysis of group dispersions anderson 2006 for each dna extraction protocol and ant species was performed to assess the reproducibility of the retrieved bacterial community composition in each method.

these correspond to one tweezer control and one extraction control for i each of the four dna extraction methods tested and for both p. penetrator 5 mm and fora.

nevertheless the evolutionary and eco- logical mechanisms shaping cuticle microbiota remain poorly under- stood scheuring  yu 2012. a methodological challenge prevents detailed description of insect cuticular microbiota the bacterial dna extraction protocol which involves washing one small individual in a detergent solution to detach low amounts of bacterial cells tightly fixed on the cuticle.
