Thus we validated our 16S rRNA gene amplicon dataset based on the V34 variable regions with a subset analysis of V12 sequencing and qPCR screening for L. crispatus L. iners and G. vaginalis.ConclusionsIn this longitudinal study of young women with a range of sexual experience ethnicity and engaging in penile-vaginal sex influenced the composition of the vaginal microbiota.Overall there was a very high level of consistency of vaginal bacterial communities betweenconsecutive pairs of specimens over 12 months particularly when either L. crispatus L. iners or L. gasseri or L. jensenii were the dominant bacterial species present in the reference speci- men.

Community state type CST groupings shown based on previous literature    where CST I aligns with specimens dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus CST II with specimens dominated by L. gasseri CST III with specimens dominated by L. iners CST IV with specimens dominated by G. vaginalis and CST V with specimens dominated by L. jensenii.

From these women specimens were selected to represent the following six overall sexual activity categories 1 women with no past sexual contact with others and no sexual contact over 12 months 2 women with no past sexual contact with others who commenced non-coital sex andor 3 atFlow chart of number of specimens assessed according to sexual activity categories at enrolment and over the study duration.

Gardnerella vaginalis clade distribution according to sexual activity category or BV status N  65 specimens 32 women.aSpecimens that were positive for Gardnerella vaginalis were analysed by clade-specific qPCR to characterise the G. vaginalis clade present GV1234 bThere was no difference in clade type between specimens from women reporting no sexual activity or non-coital sex only No sexNC so these were combined for analysis and compared to specimens from women reporting unprotected penile-vaginal sex who don't get BV PVS or all specimens from women who develop BV BVcG.

Women who engaged in penile-vaginal sex were more likely to have specimens dominated by L. iners or G. vaginalis compared to other heterogeneous non-lactobacilli after adjusting for ethnicity and OCP-use ARRR  17.51 95CI 2.18 140.33 p  0.007 and ARRR  14.03 95CI 1.22 160.69p  0.034 respectively .The median dissimilarity scores for pairs of consecutive specimens in which the first speci- men reference specimen was dominated by L. crispatus L. iners other lactobacilli G. vagina- lis or other non-lactobacilli were 0.17 0.17 0.22 0.66 0.70 respectively .

vaginalis clade abundances were analysed using logistic regression with women reporting no sexnon-coital sexual activity only as the referent group clustering by participant to take into account multiple specimens provided longitudinallydMultinomial logistic regression with specimens containing a single clade as the referent group clustered for multiple specimens from participants 32clusters.

G. vaginalis clade type in young women particularly with differing sexual experience has not been described.We aimed to determine how sexual activity affects the composition and stability of vaginal bacterial communities and G. vaginalis clade types present in young women who participated in a female university student study FUSS in Melbourne Australia  .MethodsParticipants and specimens for this study were selected from the original FUSS cohort com- prising 413 female university students aged 17-21 without BV at enrolment .

The lower scores indicate that in pairs of consecutive specimens if the reference specimen was domi- nated by L. crispatus L. iners or other lactobacilli the subsequent specimen was more likely to contain the same species in contrast to reference specimens that were dominated by other non-lactobacilli p0.001 p0.001 p  0.030 respectively .
