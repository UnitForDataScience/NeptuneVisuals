Microbiota composition in feces of ND-fed mice treated with or without high dose of OP-D and HFD mice treated with 2 doses of OP-D were analyzed using next generation sequencing n  5 continued on next pageOP-D ALLEVIATES METABOLIC SYNDROME1145significant separation in the microbiota between ND- and HFD-fed mice and between HFD and HFD  OP-D groups suggesting that OP-D treatment shifted the overall structure of the gut microbiota of HFD-fed mice toward that of ND-fed mice Fig.

More importantly the effects of OP-D on modulation of obesity and microbiota were transferable via horizontal feces transfer from OP-D-treated mice to HFD-fed mice.

For example obese obob mice display a decreased number of Bacteroidetes with a corresponding increase in Firmicutes compared to lean mice from the same litter 8.

At the end of the experiment mice were unfed for 6 h and then were humanely killed for the collection of blood and liver samples.Tolerance testsForthe glucose tolerance test GTT mice were unfed for 16 h and then injected i.p.

Next we performed GTT PTT and ITT assays in these mice and found that mice fed a HFD displayed glucose and pyru- vate intolerance as well as insulin resistance.

4C D indicating that OP-D had a more profound effect on the composition of the gut microbial community in HFD-fed mice than in ND-fed mice.

5A the body weight of HFD-fed mice that received feces from HFD-fed mice denoted as HFD-HFD group signifi- cantly increased.

Obesity-associated metabolic syndromes are reversed by feces transplantation from OP-D-treated mice to HFD-fed mice.

On the other hand OP-D demonstrated satisfying effects on the improvement of energy metabolism in HFD- fed mice while the concentrations of OP-D in plasma and liver were barely detectable when administered to mice through gavage Supplemental Table S2.

4C D indicating that OP-D had a more profound effect on the composition of the gut microbial com- munity in HFD-fed mice than in the ND-fed mice.
