Distribution of bacterial OTUs in the GMB1 samples.Of the 186 abundant and 273 rare species shared between all the samples 36 which includes Wolbachia and Pseudomonas of the abundant and 6 species including Acinetobacter of the rare were commonly present in all GMB1 samples.Dynamics of the presence of Pseudomonas and Wolbachia in developmental stages of the Asian rice gall midge.

Members of Proteobacteria were the predominant bacterial constituents in all GMB1 samples and this could be due to the fact that during the feeding stage of the Asian rice gall midge the maggots GMB1LS and GMB1LR could be actively recruiting Proteobacteria from the rice hosts and these then could be actively transferred from the maggots to the pupal stage and finally to adults-.

Assessment of microbial diversity in the GMB1 sample using Principal Co-ordinate Analysis PCoA a unweighted 3-D visualization and b parallel visualization of UniFrac plots to reveal quantitative assessment of microbial diversity between the GMB1 samples.

The diversity of microbial community structure in the GMB1 samples was estimated by alpha and beta diversity indices.

We used 5 groups of alpha diversity diversity within sample indices to compare the species richness estimators observed OTUs Chao1 and PDwholetree and diversity index Shannon and Simpson index of the microbiome from each GMB1 sample and these index values were significantly different between the samples Table .

However currently there is no information whether Wolbachia present within the ARGM exerts any influence on the rice - gall midge interaction.Pseudomonas a prominent constituent of Proteobacteria was also present in high numbers in all the GMB1 samples.

Maggot GMB1LR and GMB1LS samples showed highest alpha diversity among the GMB1 samples.

The rel- ative abundance of different bacterial phyla across all GMB1 samples were identified as follows Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Acidobacteria Chloroflexi Cyanobacteria TM7 Euryarchaeota Thermi NKB19 and Verrucomicrobia Fig.
