Some fungal species found in our samples have also been detected in the human gut namely Candida species Malassezia Cladosporium Debaromyces and S. cerevisiae.As some of the species found in our milk samples can also be detected in the oral cavity and the human skin we cannot discard the possibility of transfer of fungi from the skin surrounding the breast to the breastmilk as well as from the baby's skin or mouth transferred during suckling.

Although bacteria in human milk have been widely assessed information about the natural presence of fungal species is generally lacking and it is limited to a few studies focused on mammary infections describing breast candidiasisand a recent metagenomic study on human breastmilk from mothers suffering from mastitis which confirmed the presence of fungal sequences in addition to the dominant bacterial fraction.

The human milk microbiome changes over lactation and is shaped by maternal weight and mode of delivery.Am J Clin Nutr 96 544-51 2012.Ramsay D. T. Kent J. C. Owens R. A.  Hartmann P. E. Ultrasound imaging of milk ejection in the breast of lactating women.Pediatrics 113 361-7 2004.Martin R. et al.

The fact that we were able to obtain viable isolates of these strains from human milk which is at a temperature of 37 degC suggests an adaptation to the human body.

Relative abundances of fun- gal genera from the 10 sequenced milk samples were compared with the amounts of nutritional components fat protein lactose and non-fatty solids and the number of human somatic cells as well as with the microbial bacterial and fungal load content in paired milk samples in order to find potential correlations among them Fig.

Available data suggest a potential beneficial role of various fungi for human health-and further work should be performed in order to better understand their mode of action.ConclusionsThrough multiple methodological approaches we have detected isolated and identified fungi from human breast- milk.

However fungal presence in the milk of other mammals has been widely described in several studies- which supports the idea that human breastmilk could also contain fungi under normal healthy conditions.Furthermore there is evidence that fungal species yeast-like mainly can be found in the infant gut early in life-.

Yeasts growth at different temperatures 28 degC 37 degC and 42 degC and their ability to metabolize sugars naturally present in human milk lactose are shown in Supplementary Figure 2a.The optimal growth temperature for Saccharomyces species is usually 24-26 degC for Rhodotorula mucilagi- nosa 24 degC and for Candida parapsilosis 30 degC-35 degC temperature conditions according to recommendations from the American Type Culture Collection .

Although the natural presence of fungi in the milk of other mammals is well-accepted there are no previous descriptions of specific fungal species in human samples from healthy mothers.

The prevalence of samples with detectable fungal presence was 1618 in colostrum 1418 in transitional milk and 2829 in mature milk.
