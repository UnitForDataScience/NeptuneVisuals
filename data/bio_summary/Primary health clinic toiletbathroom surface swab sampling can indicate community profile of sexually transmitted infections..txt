Therefore the conjecture we tested was that the relative prevalences of different STI agents in clinic toiletbathroom swabs would be correlated with the relative prevalences of these STIs in the notifications data.METHODSThe basis of this study was the comparison of previously published data concerning STI agents in toiletbathroom surface swabs  with corresponding NT Government STI notifications data .

An assumption in the design was that while absolute built environment loads of STI nucleic acids will be a function of patient traffic density and facility cleaning protocols the relative loads of STI nucleic acids from different species will be largely unaffected by these processes.

Therefore we did not regard it asuseful to test the conjecture that absolute STI nucleic acid load on clinic toilet-bathroom surfaces predicts absolute STI prevalence in the community.

Rather the experimental design was based on the premise that while toiletbathroom cleaning protocols would be likely to greatly impact absolute STI nucleic acid prevalence on toiletbathroom surfaces they would have much less impact on the relative loads of nucleic acid from different STI agents.

The swabs were subjected to the same STI diagnostic procedure as actual clinical specimens for STI analysis from the clinic concerned i.e.

The STI profile defined by these results was compared with the breakdown of time and place-matched STI notifications as described in the Methods  .

A surface swabbing approach to STI surveillance encompasses people who have not been subjected to STI diagnostic procedures and it may have potential to provide early indications of outbreaks.

antibiotic resistance genes or exotic viruses.In conclusion the surface swabbing in the clinics in the remote communities in the NT was effective at indicating community STI profile in large part because of the large number of STI positive swabs.

In this study we tested the hypothesis that analysis of surface swabs from clinic toiletbathroom yields results correlated with sexually transmitted infection STI notifications from corresponding human populations.

We extended a previously reported study in which surfaces in toiletbathroom facilities in primary health clinics in the Australian Northern Territory NT were swabbed then tested for nucleic acid from the STI agents Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis.
