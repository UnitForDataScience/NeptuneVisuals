81038. doi To explore the effects of gastric non-H. pylori Helicobacter speciesNHPH on the structure and potential function of gastric microbiota we employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on 164 gastric biopsy specimens from NHPH H. suis H. felis H. salomonisH.

The results in this study implied that NHPH can arouse the variation of structure and function of gastric microbiota which may pave the way to further research on the pathogenesis of gastric diseases.Keywords non-pylori Helicobacters NHPHs gastric microbiota Helicobacter pylori-infected coinfection 16S rRNA gene sequencingINTRODUCTIONProgress in sequencing technology and biological information analysis methods has enhanced our knowledge of gastrointestinal microbiota independent of traditional culture methods.

H. pylori as the most relevant inhabitant plays an important role in altering the gastric microenvironment by inhibiting acid secretion leading to an imbalance in hormones which might facilitate transient flora survival and colonization on the gastric epithelium with subsequent disruption of the established gastric microbiota  .

Whether and how these NHPH species' colonization of the gastric mucosa influences the structure of the gastric microbiota bacterial diversity and its possible functional metabolism should be further investigated.In this study we investigated the effects of NHPH species H. suis H. felis or H. salomonis and H. pylori coinfection on microbiota of gastric mucosa specimens from individuals undergoing gastroduodenoscopy by applying 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing.

The effects are highly species-specific the entire profile of the gastric microbiota is dependent on the type of gastric NHPH species which may promote or attenuate variation in H. pylori-predominated gastric microbiota.

The investigation of the human gastric microbiota is still in its infancy and the roles and functions of other bacteria should be further elucidated.In addition to H. pylori other members of the genus Helicobacter with typical spiral morphology non-pylori Helicobacter NHPH are also associated with a range of gastric disorders especially mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma    .

Recently a study concerning interactions between H. suis and gastric parietal cells determined that this bacterium can cause a series of side effects significant impairment of cell viability abnormal gastric acid secretion and disruption of stomach homeostasis  .

Simultaneously the effects of NHPH species on the gastric microbiota were indirectly explained by comparing variations in gastric bacterial community structure between H. pylori monoinfection group and NHPHH.
