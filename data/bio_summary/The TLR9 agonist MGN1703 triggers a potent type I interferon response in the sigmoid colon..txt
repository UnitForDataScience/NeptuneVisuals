Here we report a sub-study of this trial where we define MGN1703-treatment outcomes related to i TLR9 agonist-induced intestinal immune activity ii maintenance of intestinal homeostasis during TLR9 agonist treatment iii stability of the gut microbiota composition during TLR9 agonist treatment and iv TLR9 agonist-associated changes in HIV persistence in the intestine.ResultsMGN1703 induced a potent type I interferon response in the intestinesThe clinical trial design is depicted in Figure 1a.

We observed an increase in the numbers of MX1 positive cell profiles from baseline to the fourth week of treatment Figure 1b in both the intestinal lamina propria p0.001 Figure 1c and epithelium p0.003 Figure 1d.The number of ISG15 positive cell profiles in lamina propria also increased during MGN1703 treatment p0.014 Figure 1e while no significant changes in the number of ISG15-producing cell profiles in the epithelial region were observed Figure 1f.

Together these data indicate that MGN1703 treatment did not induce a type II interferon response or inflammation in the intestines.MGN1703 treatment was associated with subtle changes in the intestinal microbiotaClinical interventions e.g.

Nor was MGN1703 treatment associated with changes in intestinal T cell activation Supplemental Figure 2a T cell memory subset proportions Supplemental Figure 2b or expression of genes known to be involved in T cell activation Supplemental Figure 2c.

antibiotic treatment for ulcerative colitis may decrease intestinal inflammation but often at the expense of reduced microbial diversity in the intestines 35-37.

Together these intestinal data highlight that higher TLR9 and IFNAR1 gene expression prior to MGN1703 treatment is associated with a greater reduction in integrated HIV-1 DNA levels following treatment.DiscussionHere we present the first examination of the in vivo effects of TLR9 agonist therapy in the human colonic sigmoid mucosa and feces.

We demonstrate that intestinal homeostasis was maintained during treatment.

MGN1703 significantly modulated the expression of 248 genes in intestinal mononuclear cells including many genes involved in type I interferon responsesa Ward link correlation dendrogram for all genes assayed reveals that gene expression patterns cluster with respect to treatment status rather than by individual Slatkin-Maddison p0.0167.

MGN1703 treatment did not radically alter the intestinal floraa Group average dendrogram illustrates relationships between samples at the taxonomic level of family.

Consistent with no change in the levels of IFN-g mRNA in the intestinal tissue mononuclear cells we did not detect significant changes in theKrarup et al.Page 5numbers of cell profiles positive for the IFN-g-induced protein CXCL10 using IHC in either the intestinal lamina propria Figure 3b or epithelium Figure 3c.
