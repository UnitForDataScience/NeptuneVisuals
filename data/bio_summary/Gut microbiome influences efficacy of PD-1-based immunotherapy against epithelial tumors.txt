A and B ATB-induced dysbiosis was restored by oral administration of A. muciniphila Akkermansia alone or combined with Enterococcus hirae 13144 E. hirae to recipient mice receiving PD-1 mAb.Commensals and PD-1 mAb regimens were administered five times every 3 days against RET melanomas A and four times in luciferase-expressingorthotopic LLC non-small cell lung cancers treated or not with radiotherapy plus PD-1 mAb B.

These findings could be corroborated by FMT from seven RCC patients into ATB-treated BALBc mice that were then orthotopically implanted with luciferase-expressing renal cancer RENCA cells resistant to PD-1 monotherapy and treated with a combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 mAbs fig.

Therefore we explored the possibility that dysbiosis associated with malignant disease or concomitant antibiotic ATB use could influ- ence primary resistance to PD-1 blockade in tumor- bearing mice and cancer patients.Initially we compared the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 mAb alone or combined with CTLA-4 mAb in mice with established MCA-205 sarcoma and RET melanoma.

Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT from cancer patients who responded to ICIs into germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice ameliorated the antitumor effects of PD-1 blockade whereasFMT from nonresponding patients failed to do so.

Oral supplementation with A. muciniphila after FMT with nonresponder feces restored the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in an interleukin-12- dependent manner by increasing the recruitment of CCR9CXCR3CD4 T lymphocytes into mouse tumor beds.Cmunotherapies targeting PD-L1 or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 CTLA-4 16-21.

ATB treatment significantly compro- mised the antitumor effects and survival of mice treated with PD-1 mAb alone or in combination with CTLA-4 mAb Fig.

The most widely used ICIs are monoclonal antibodies mAbs targeting programmed cell death protein 1 PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 7.

PD-1 blockade is highly efficacious against advanced melanoma non-small cell lung cancer NSCLC and renalcell carcinoma RCC.
