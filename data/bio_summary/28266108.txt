in fact although oral bacteria could be transmitted from the infant's oral cavity to the mammary glands during breastfeeding the appearance of oral bacteria in pre- colostrum suggests that breastmilk could in fact be an important source for directed microbial colonization of the oral cavity mira  rodriguez 2016. given that different oral microbial profiles have been found between breastfed and formula-fed infants and that some bacteria asso- ciated with breastfeeding have been found to inhibit the growth of oral pathogens holgerson et al.

2011. very recently it has been shown that experimental oral exposure of babies born by c- section to maternal vaginal fluids increases the colonization of vaginal bacteria in the oral cavity the gut and the skin of the babies and par- tially restores their oral microbiota which shifted towards that found in babies born by vaginal delivery dominguez-bello et al.

2009. this is sur- prising given the high exposure of the oral cavity to external contami- nation and shows that the oral microbiome has an important degree of stability under health conditions.certain stability in the oral microbiota has also been observed in shorter time periods when compared to other human niches.

2014. this highly variable polymicrobial feature of oral diseases makes the development of vaccines against oral diseases extremely difficult as a single immu- nization target cannot be identified simon-soro  mira 2015.nevertheless some patterns are starting to emerge and several bac- teria appear to be associated with specific lesions or stages.
