In fact although oral bacteria could be transmitted from the infant's oral cavity to the mammary glands during breastfeeding the appearance of oral bacteria in pre- colostrum suggests that breastmilk could in fact be an important source for directed microbial colonization of the oral cavity Mira  Rodriguez 2016.

Very recently it has been shown that experimental oral exposure of babies born by C- section to maternal vaginal fluids increases the colonization of vaginal bacteria in the oral cavity the gut and the skin of the babies and par- tially restores their oral microbiota which shifted towards that found in babies born by vaginal delivery Dominguez-Bello et al.

This is sur- prising given the high exposure of the oral cavity to external contami- nation and shows that the oral microbiome has an important degree of stability under health conditions.Certain stability in the oral microbiota has also been observed in shorter time periods when compared to other human niches.

A repertoire of stable dysbiotic states may occur in both caries and periodontitis involving different microbial community structures with potentially similar functional properties.Conclusions The processes which underlie the development and stability of microbial populations in the healthy mouth are fundamental to understanding how these populations are transformed into a dysbiotic state in disease.Alex Mira1 A.
