Therefore further investigation on the intestinal microbiota is essential to secure fish health and rearing performances in aquaculture.Many endogenous and exogenous factors impact the composition of intestinal microbiota in fish including species developmental stage intestinal structure diet nutritional status and living conditions Ley et al.

This study aimed to explore the effect of adding TCM in feed on the intestinal microbiota of gibel carp Carassius auratus gibelio.Methods and Results Bacterial communities of 16 fish intestinal contents and one water sample were characterized by high-throughput sequencing and analysis of the V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

At the genus level the addition of TCM tended to reduce the incidence of potential pathogens Aeromonas Acinetobacter and Shewanella while stimulating the emergence of some potential probiotics Lactobacillus Lactococcus Bacillus and Pseudomonas.Conclusions These data suggested that the feed additive could regulate the fish intestinal microbiota by reinforcing the microbial balance.Significance and Impact of the Study This study may provide useful information for further application of TCM for diseases prevention and stress management in aquaculture.IntroductionThe intestinal tract of vertebrates is a complicated ecolog- ical niche which is colonized by a large and diverse microbial community Ley et al.

In the current study Fusobacteria Proteobacteria and Fir- micutes included most of the prevalent bacteria in all intestinal samples possibly constituting the core gut microbiota of gibel carp.Proteobacteria were predominant in the culture water in a similar proportion as in the fish intestinal contents 4545 vs 4054 respectively.

Moreover the fish intestinal contents shared 993 bac- terial OTUs in common with the culture water which confirmed that the fish gut microbiota was partly derivedfrom the culture water but remaining globally distinct as previously observed Romero and Navarrete 2006.

Researches on the intestinal microbiota have revealed that the microbial community plays vital roles in the digestive tractfunction such as stimulating the growth and develop- ment of the intestinal epithelium preventing it from pathogen invasion contributing to the digestion of com- plex nutrients and synthesizing beneficial secondary metabolites Verschuere et al.

The water community was separated far from the intestinal microbiota showing distinct differ- ences between intestinal microbiota and water bacterial community.

Previous study showed that the fish intestinal micro- biota composition depended on dietary factors to a large extent Nayak 2010 Tarnecki et al.

To this end 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was applied to water sample and to the intestinal contents of gibel carp fed a TCM additive or not fed.Materials and methodsChinese herbal compound and TCM fish feed preparationIn the present study YPF powder was prepared with pro- portions of 1  2  2 of its three components Chinese parsnip root Astragalus membranaceus and Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz respectively.
