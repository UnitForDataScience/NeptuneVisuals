therefore further investigation on the intestinal microbiota is essential to secure fish health and rearing performances in aquaculture.many endogenous and exogenous factors impact the composition of intestinal microbiota in fish including species developmental stage intestinal structure diet nutritional status and living conditions ley et al.

the second most abun- dant phylum in the culture water community was cyanobacteria 4302 which were far more abundant than in the intestinal contents of gibel carp 471. moreover the fish intestinal contents shared 993 bac- terial otus in common with the culture water which confirmed that the fish gut microbiota was partly derivedfrom the culture water but remaining globally distinct as previously observed romero and navarrete 2006. a much lower richness and diversity was observed in the water samples compared with gut microbiota suggesting that the surrounding community may be unstable.

in the current study lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus and lactococcus bacillus and pseudomonas were detected relatively increased in the gut of fish subjected to the tcm treatment table 3. though the relative abundance of these genera was low that may suggest that tcm feeding could promote the colonization of potential probiotics.in conclusion this study showed for the first time the changes in the intestinal microbiota of gibel carp after feeding the tcm and the differences between the com- munities present in fish intestine and in culture water.

this study aimed to explore the effect of adding tcm in feed on the intestinal microbiota of gibel carp carassius auratus gibelio.methods and results bacterial communities of 16 fish intestinal contents and one water sample were characterized by high-throughput sequencing and analysis of the v4-v5 region of the 16s rrna gene.

at the genus level the addition of tcm tended to reduce the incidence of potential pathogens aeromonas acinetobacter and shewanella while stimulating the emergence of some potential probiotics lactobacillus lactococcus bacillus and pseudomonas.conclusions these data suggested that the feed additive could regulate the fish intestinal microbiota by reinforcing the microbial balance.significance and impact of the study this study may provide useful information for further application of tcm for diseases prevention and stress management in aquaculture.introductionthe intestinal tract of vertebrates is a complicated ecolog- ical niche which is colonized by a large and diverse microbial community ley et al.

in the current study fusobacteria proteobacteria and fir- micutes included most of the prevalent bacteria in all intestinal samples possibly constituting the core gut microbiota of gibel carp.proteobacteria were predominant in the culture water in a similar proportion as in the fish intestinal contents 4545 vs 4054 respectively.

traditional chinese medicine tcm feed additives have been applied in aquaculture to improve fish health but the interaction with fish gut microbiota is still poorly understood.

both of the feeds were provided by jiangsu yancheng yuda feed co. ltd china crude protein 340 crude fat75 available phosphorus 05 lysine 17 methionine 05.fish feeding protocolsix cages 4 m 9 4 m 9 25 m were set up in a fish pond of 10 ha in a commercial fish farm located in yan- cheng city jiangsu province china.

2012. the effect of tcm on fish growth promotion may depend on many factors such as the composition of the medicine the dose and duration of treatment as well as the fish spe- cies.

the decreasing trend of potential pathogens may reduce the risk of fish diseasetaxagroup egroup caeromonas00086 - 0013300391 - 00388 acinetobacter00355 - 0032200416 - 00813 shewanella00820 - 0170401211 - 01049 pseudomonas02067 - 0167000587 - 00672 lactobacillus00024 - 000690lactococcus00049 - 0007400037 - 00073bacillus08538 - 1310403082 - 05264outbreak which is consistent with other studies report- ing that tcm could enhance the immunological func- tion of fish and lower the risk of disease outbreak vasudeva rao et al.

previous study showed that the fish intestinal micro- biota composition depended on dietary factors to a large extent nayak 2010 tarnecki et al.

to this end 16s rrna gene high-throughput sequencing was applied to water sample and to the intestinal contents of gibel carp fed a tcm additive or not fed.materials and methodschinese herbal compound and tcm fish feed preparationin the present study ypf powder was prepared with pro- portions of 1  2  2 of its three components chinese parsnip root astragalus membranaceus and atractylodes macrocephala koidz respectively.

the intestinal content of each fish was squeezed out and separately harvested under aseptic conditions.

the fish intestinal microbiota of the two dietary groups showed distinguishing bacterial communities at the family level fig.

further experiments would be neces- sary to test the efficiency of such a treatment in subopti- mal conditions.many studies showed that the microbial community in the fish intestinal contents may be close to those inthe culture water and sediment but aquaculture feed has also a significant impact on gut microbiota wu et al.
