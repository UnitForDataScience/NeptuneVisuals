therefore in the taxonomic analysis step metalab considers the qualitative and xic- based quantitative information of the identified peptides to provide the taxonomic classification and abundances of bacteria in microbiota samples.taking the 115832 identified unique peptides as an input 65407 peptides were assigned with a taxonomic lineage of lca in metalab additional file table s1.

metalab is free for academic users and can be down- loaded at resultworkflowa standard metaproteomics data analysis workflow in metalab contains three modules database construction peptide identificationquantification and taxonomy ana- lysis fig.

metalab integrates several open source third-party libraries mzjava is a versatile tool for ms data analysis and the functions con- cerning spectrum processing and protein digestion are used in metalab spectral clustering is performed by pride cluster which is an open source algo- rithm used in pride database .

generally various types of label-free methods rely on two different strategies spectral counts or extracted ion chromatogram xic intensities extracted ion chromatogram-based methods are considered superior to spectral counting especially for the data generated by high-resolution mass spectrome- ters however to the best of our knowledge tak- ing advantage of xic-based label-free quantitative information of peptides to estimate the abundance of corresponding taxa and implementing it in a fully auto- matic data-processing workflow is not available in current metaproteomics software tools.in this work we present an integrated software plat- form termed metalab for the comprehensive analysis of metaproteomics datasets.

taking advantage of the workflows in metalab conventional processing steps such as analyzing each data file step-by-step manually switching on different tools or converting data format for inputoutput are no longer needed for metaproteo- mics data analysis.implementationmetalab is developed in java a platform independent language so it can be executed on any platform with a java runtime environment jre.

the galaxy bioinformatics framework en- ables metaproteomics data analysis which provides a relatively complete workflow from database generation to downstream analysis.

moreover because of the additional pre- and post-processing steps metaproteomics data analysis can be much more time- consuming than conventional proteomics studies.the expanded search space for metaproteomic analysis leads to low sensitivity difficulty in false discovery rate fdr determination and very long searches using con- ventional proteomics tools .

metalab is designed as a versatile efficient and easy-to-use tool which can greatly simplify the procedure of metaproteomic data analysis for researchers in microbiome studies.keywords metaproteomics protein identification quantification taxonomy analysisbackgroundmicrobial communities play important roles in human health agriculture and the environment in humans studying the composition function and inter- action of microorganisms in samples derived from indi- viduals during healthy and disease states holds great promises for disease diagnosis and treatment the microbial community is a highly diverse system which correspondence 1department of biochemistry microbiology and immunology ottawa institute of systems biology faculty of medicine university of ottawaottawa ontario canada2molecular architecture of life program canadian institute for advanced research toronto ontario canadamakes it a challenge for comprehensive investigations.

metalab is designed as a one-stop solution providing a complete efficient and convenient way to overcome challenges in metaproteomics data analysis.

through this the data generated by metalab can be directly subjected to downstream analysis by tools supporting this format such as megan  a well-known metagenomics software providing sample comparing functions.

by importing the .biom for- mat result file various types of charts were obtained that can be beneficial during the interpretation of the results additional file figure s5.discussionwe have introduced metalab a software which aims to provide a comprehensive bioinformatic workflow for metaproteomics data analysis.

additionally a biom format file is saved for the downstream analysis of this data set which can be used by other tools such as megan.the result file exported by metalab contained twoparts peptide list and taxa list.

b. the performance of this strategy is evaluated by re-analyzing the data from the metapro-iq paper and de- tails of this analysis are presented in the following section.the second module identifies and quantifies peptides using the sample-specific database.

metalab could also run without the peptide to taxonomy database and in this case the taxonomy analysis can be processed in unipept api mode.
