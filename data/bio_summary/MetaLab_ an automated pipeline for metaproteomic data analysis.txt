Taking advantage of the workflows in MetaLab conventional processing steps such as analyzing each data file step-by-step manually switching on different tools or converting data format for inputoutput are no longer needed for metaproteo- mics data analysis.ImplementationMetaLab is developed in Java a platform independent language so it can be executed on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment JRE.

Therefore in the taxonomic analysis step MetaLab considers the qualitative and XIC- based quantitative information of the identified peptides to provide the taxonomic classification and abundances of bacteria in microbiota samples.Taking the 115832 identified unique peptides as an input 65407 peptides were assigned with a taxonomic lineage of LCA in MetaLab Additional file Table S1.

Generally various types of label-free methods rely on two different strategies spectral counts or extracted ion chromatogram XIC intensities Extracted ion chromatogram-based methods are considered superior to spectral counting especially for the data generated by high-resolution mass spectrome- ters However to the best of our knowledge tak- ing advantage of XIC-based label-free quantitative information of peptides to estimate the abundance of corresponding taxa and implementing it in a fully auto- matic data-processing workflow is not available in current metaproteomics software tools.In this work we present an integrated software plat- form termed MetaLab for the comprehensive analysis of metaproteomics datasets.

The performance of this strategy is evaluated by re-analyzing the data from the MetaPro-IQ paper and de- tails of this analysis are presented in the following section.The second module identifies and quantifies peptides using the sample-specific database.

While this strategy is beneficial for peptide iden- tification it remains complicated and time-consuming when processing dozens of raw files.Quantitative techniques have been used to measure the expression level of proteins in MS-based proteomics studies for over two decades Moreover the amount of proteins from corresponding taxonomic nodes reflects the abundance of this taxon in the community and can be used to estimate microbiota diversity The sim- plest form of protein abundance estimation is counting the number of identified peptides from a protein and dividing the total counts by the number of theoretically observable tryptic peptides Unipept uses such a peptide counting approach for its sunburst and treeview diagrams as an estimation of the relative abundance of these nodes.

By contrast the database generated by the clustering strategy led to the identification of 115832 unique peptides at a FDR below 0.01 and the commonly identified peptides accounted for 90 of the combined peptide list Fig.

In most cases samples share a considerable number of peptides and peptides in high abundance generate multiple MS MS spectra which result in repeated peptide spectra in different or even the same MS raw files.

The peptides shared by other species were notconsidered because the quantitative contribution of the shared peptides was indistinguishable.
