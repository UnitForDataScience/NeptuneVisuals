The widespread application of such approaches has revealed that the small group of CF airway-associated microbes is in fact part of a larger and more complex CF lung microbiota - In particular microbes that are able to exploit lower oxygen tensions including members of the Prevotella Veillonella Streptococcus and Gemella genera have been reported consistently in CF lower airway samples -While analysis of diseased lung tissue obtained directly through surgery and the comparative analysis of upper and lower airway samples suggest lung colonisation by these taxa there is an ongoing debate around their clinical significance.

Little evidence yet exists that this wider lung microbiota contributes directly to inflammation although intriguingly studies in animal models have demonstrated that some oropharyngeal anaerobes can significantly increase the expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity traits when present as co-infections To date efforts to understand the relationships between the composition of the CF lung microbiota and clinical and immunological measures have mostly taken the form of single-centre cross-sectional studies.

E-mail Since the first reports of bacterial lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis CF almost 80 years ago concerted efforts have been made to identify the microbes responsible and to determine their contribution to lung disease.

The lower airway microbiota in early cystic fibrosis lung disease a longitudinal analysis.

Directly sampling the lung of a young child with cystic fibrosis reveals diverse microbiota.

Direct sampling of cystic fibrosis lungs indicates that DNA-based analyses of upper-airway specimens can misrepresent lung microbiota.

Overall they report that nontraditional taxa were the dominant taxon in one in five of the CF BALF samples assessed while no sequence data were generated from 20 of CF adults and 44 of CF children a phenomenon the authors attribute to low bacterial load.It is interesting to speculate about what this changing microbiological landscape might represent.

However while CF respiratory microbiology has helped to shape clinical practice our understanding of the relationships between microbial colonisation of the lung inflammation and disease remains relatively poor.The development of culture-independent analytical techniques such as 16S ribosomal RNA rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has provided a means to characterise CF airway microbiology more comprehensively.

The authors reported inconsistent intraindividual concordance between microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory niches suggesting that the lungs of infants with CF may have their own microbiome seeded by but not identical to the upper respiratory tract microbiome.If nontraditional taxa do colonise the CF lower airways whether they contribute directly to airway inflammation is uncertain.

One notable observation has been that the composition of the CF lung microbiota changes with increasing age exposure to antimicrobials and disease severity This evolving composition represents a transition from a diverse but relatively low abundance microbial community in infants where taxa such as Streptococcus Prevotella and Veillonella are particularly prevalent to an increasingly low diversity high bacterial load community in older individuals often dominated by P. aeruginosa Indeed by end-stage disease the predominance of pathogens such asReceived Sept 23 2017  Accepted Sept 25 2017Conflict of interest Disclosures can be found alongside this article at erj.ersjournals.com Copyright cERS 2017P.
