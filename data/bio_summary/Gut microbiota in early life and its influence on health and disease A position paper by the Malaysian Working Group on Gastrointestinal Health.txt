bacteroides and clostridium coccoides which are not supported by human milk and infant formula.28 however it may be possible that the effect on microbiota of complementary feeding is also due to maturity of other gut functions as weaning progresses including pancreatic function small intestinal absorp- tion and colonic fermentation which modify the materials that reach the colon and microbiota.28statement 6 antibiotic exposure during pregnancy and infancy affects gut microbial colonisationlevel of agreement i 50 ii 40 iii 10 iv 0 v 0.strength of evidence a 60 b 30 c 10 d 0.current estimates indicate that 40 of women are given antibiotics during their pregnancy or immediately prior to deliv- ery.29 antibiotic exposure during pregnancy can cause terato- genic effects whereas during infancy it can disrupt the stability of the gut microbiota.30 maternal intrapartum antibiotic use is reported to be associated with delayed colonisation of vaginal bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in neonates.11 additionally anti- biotic use during breastfeeding may interfere with the infant's gut microbiota composition due to antibiotic transfer into the breast milk.31 while antibiotics may reduce short-term complica- tions it is unknown for how long the use of antibiotics may have an impact on gut microbiota and their long-term effects are yet to be determined.

this paper reports the position of a malaysian working group on some key issues surrounding gut microbiota in early life and its role in gut health and diseases as well as experts' stand on probiotics and prebiotics.

the group reached a consensus that certain factors including elective caesarean premature deliveries complementary feeding use of antibiotics prebiotics andor probiotics and exposure to the external environmental have an impact on gut microbiota in early life.

however as evidence is lacking especially from the asia-pacific region further studies are needed to understand how gut microbiota in early life affects subsequent diseases including allergy inflammatory bowel disease obesity and infantile colic.

notably the gut microbiota colonisation in preterm infants is different from term infants especially in terms of key bacterial members such as bifidobacterium sp.15 factors that worsen dysbiosis in preterm infants include delayed enteral feeding frequent use of total parenteral nutri- tion aseptic condition in intensive care unit and maternal and post-natal antibiotic administration.16 a high prevalence of nosocomial infections especially staphylococcus sp.
