Lastly although beneficial in acute diarrhoeal dis- ease and probably allergic eczema probiotics andor prebiotics should be used cautiously in other gut dysbiotic conditions until more data are available.Key words Asia early life gut health gut microbiota prebiotics probiotic.As an emerging concept 'gut health' encompasses multiple posi- tive aspects of the gastrointestinal GI system that is stable com- position of gut microbiota efficient digestion and absorption of food absence of illnesses and effective immune and metabolic status.1 In particular gut microbiota in humans plays an impor- tant role in shaping the gut health of early life starting from the first 1000 days and transcending beyond.2 While the research of gut microbiota in early life is progressing rapidly in the West the same cannot be said for Asia.Another emerging concept is the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease DOHaD which emphasises the central role of the maternal microbiota in shaping a stable gut microbiota in early life.3 The gut microbiota established during early life is then influenced by a variety of physiological cultural and environ- mental factors Fig.

have shown that the stability of gut microbiota in infants with colic were different from those without colic the factors or mechanisms accounting for these different microbial signatures are not clear.6364 Furthermore effectiveness of probiotics in ran- domised controlled trials of infantile colic have been inconclu- sive.65 More studies are needed to determine the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and management of infantile colic.Statement 12 Prebiotics and probiotics play a role in modulating the gut microbiota in early lifeLevel of agreement I 50 II 40 III 10 IV 0 V 0.Strength of evidence A 40 B 50 C 10 D 0.Prebiotics'Prebiotics' are selectively fermented ingredients usually indigesti- ble oligosaccharides that result in specific changes in the composition andor activity of the gut microbiota thus con- ferring benefits to host health.66 Some prebiotics e.g.

The National Breastfeeding Policy of Malaysia concurs with the WHO recommendation for exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age.18 Breast milk con- tains not only the beneficial microbiota Bifidobacterium but also antimicrobial factors such as immunoglobulins cytokines lyso- zyme and lactoferrin as well as HMOS.1920 The gut microbiota of breastfed infants are reportedly different and more stable than formula-fed infants although there may be differences between1154Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health 53 2017 1152-1158c 2017 The Authorsdifferent regions of the world due to environmental factors.20 For example in a Korean study the genus Bifidobacterium and Lactoba- cillus predominated in breastfed infants but Firmicutes and Proteo- bacteria predominated in formula-fed infants.21 Moreover intestinal contents of breastfed infants are generally more acidic pH 5.0 and contain more short-chain fatty acids SCFAs.21 Nowadays the bifidogenic effects of human milk can be emulated in infant formula through the addition of prebiotic andor probi- otic supplements22 but whether such approaches produce similar effects compared with human milk will require further studies.Statement 5 Introduction of complementary feeding has an impact on the gut microbiotaLevel of agreement I 50 II 40 III 10 IV 0 V 0.Strength of evidence A 30 B 60 C 10 D 0.Complementary feeding introduces solid non-milk foods to infants typically by 6 months of age.23-25 The stability of the gut microbiota in early life is affected by the introduction of home- prepared foods that contain non-digestible carbohydrates proteins and fibres especially fruits and vegetables.26 Home-prepared foods with its well-conserved overall micronutrients have been shown to be inversely associated with the development of allergic diseases.27 Notably complementary feeding provides new sub- strates that may promote the survival and dominance of certain bacterial species e.g.

Bacteroides and Clostridium coccoides which are not supported by human milk and infant formula.28 However it may be possible that the effect on microbiota of complementary feeding is also due to maturity of other gut functions as weaning progresses including pancreatic function small intestinal absorp- tion and colonic fermentation which modify the materials that reach the colon and microbiota.28Statement 6 Antibiotic exposure during pregnancy and infancy affects gut microbial colonisationLevel of agreement I 50 II 40 III 10 IV 0 V 0.Strength of evidence A 60 B 30 C 10 D 0.Current estimates indicate that 40 of women are given antibiotics during their pregnancy or immediately prior to deliv- ery.29 Antibiotic exposure during pregnancy can cause terato- genic effects whereas during infancy it can disrupt the stability of the gut microbiota.30 Maternal intrapartum antibiotic use is reported to be associated with delayed colonisation of vaginal Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in neonates.11 Additionally anti- biotic use during breastfeeding may interfere with the infant's gut microbiota composition due to antibiotic transfer into the breast milk.31 While antibiotics may reduce short-term complica- tions it is unknown for how long the use of antibiotics may have an impact on gut microbiota and their long-term effects are yet to be determined.

ascertained that gut microbiota of early life have significant influences on the development of the immune system especially on asthma suscep- tibility.48 Moreover infants who exhibit severe multi-sensitisation to food or aero-allergens have a significantly higher risk of devel- oping asthma in childhood.49 Immunological studies have found a significant association between gut microbiota and the develop- ment of immunoglobulin A IgA- IgG- and IgM-mediated sensi- tisation in allergy asthma and atopic dermatitis.5051Statement 9 IBD is associated with alterations in the gut microbiotaLevel of agreement I 60 II 20 III 20 IV 0 V 0.Strength of evidence A 60 B 20 C 20 D 0.There is increasing prevalence of IBD within the Asia-Pacific region including Malaysia with figures comparable to the West.52 The lack of diversity of beneficial gut microbiota in early life is thought to be an important cause.

POSITION PAPERGut microbiota in early life and its influence on health and disease A position paper by the Malaysian Working Group on Gastrointestinal HealthYeong Yeh Lee1 Siti Asma Hassan1 Intan Hakimah Ismail2 Sze Yee Chong3 Raja Affendi Raja Ali4 Syafinaz Amin Nordin5 Way Seah Lee6 and Noorizan Abdul Majid11School of Medical Sciences Universiti Sains Malaysia Kota Bharu Kelantan 2Department of Paediatrics Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Universiti Putra Malaysia Serdang Selangor 3Department of Paediatrics Hospital Pulau Pinang Georgetown Pulau Pinang 4Gastroenterology Unit Department of Medicine Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia 6Department of Paediatrics Universiti Malaya Kuala Lumpur and 5Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Universiti Putra Malaysia Serdang MalaysiaAbstract The role of gut microbiota in early life and its impact on gut health and subsequent diseases remain unclear.

This paper reports the position of a Malaysian Working Group on some key issues surrounding gut microbiota in early life and its role in gut health and diseases as well as experts' stand on probiotics and prebiotics.

The group reached a consensus that certain factors including elective caesarean premature deliveries complementary feeding use of antibiotics prebiotics andor probiotics and exposure to the external environmental have an impact on gut microbiota in early life.

However as evidence is lacking especially from the Asia-Pacific region further studies are needed to understand how gut microbiota in early life affects subsequent diseases including allergy inflammatory bowel disease obesity and infantile colic.
