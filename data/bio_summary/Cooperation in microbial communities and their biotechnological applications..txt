Therefore the evolutionary resilience of microbial communities and their ability to constraint detrimental mutants should be considered to design robust biotechnological applications.Evolutionary dynamics and cooperation in microbial populationsThe design and optimization of microorganisms for bio- technological purposes often considers cells in isolation.

Although in this review we focus on microbial populations this is a very general issue in the sustain- ability of many organisms at different scales including humans justifying why the evolution and resilience of cooperation is considered one of the major open ques- tions in biology Pennisi 2009.Evolutionary conflicts between cooperative and cheat- ing cells have been studied in a variety of microbial sce- narios including the conversion of sucrose into glucose by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gore et al.

These properties endow cooperative microbial populations with the possibility to resist cheat- ers invasions and the capability of performing more sophisticated tasks.Despite its growing use to study the evolution of coop-eration evolutionary game theory has had so far a very limited impact in field or industrial biotechnological appli- cations in which the environmental conditions are gener- ally not well-defined and may affect the microbial communities Bouchez et al.

Similarly bioprocesses including bioreactor design could be engineered to account and exploit for eco-evo feedbacks and spatial organizations.Understanding how syntrophy and cooperation endow the microbial populations with resistance and resilience against ecological and environmental disturbances like compositional shifts in the environment or antibiotic shocks could be used to engineer robust microbial com- munities with enhanced performance and predictable dynamics Briones and Raskin 2003 Allison and Mar- tiny 2008 SoEURzen et al.

In this review we illustrate the relevance of cooperative interactions in microbial biotechnological processes discuss their mechanistic origins and analyse their evolutionary resilience.

Cooperative interactions enrich microbial communities with a higher degree of robustness against environmental stress and can facilitate the evolution of more complex traits.

2016 a good example of shared goods are the cellulases secreted in the production of cellulosic ethanol Zomorrodi and Segre 2016.The presence of cooperative interactions has a signifi- cant impact on the evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities represented by the change in the frequen- cies of cells and species that implement different physio- logical strategies such as production of public goods vs. not.

Achieving this would require considering how 'social' interactions shape microbial processes rather than simply focusing solely on individualistic traits such as growth rate.This situation may confront the intuitive idea that 'evolu- tion implies improvement' i.e.

These intertwined selection mechanisms are expected to operate in any microbial population where there is possibility of different cells implementing different strategies with respect to their physiology as is the case of phenotypic heterogeneity.Phenotypic heterogeneity arises even in monocultures and simple bioprocesses due to different reasons such as the use of non-homogenous culture conditions sto- chasticity in gene expression and differential epigenetic control Enfors et al.
