Possibly because of the proxim- ity to the river's source the water at the S1W1 site was more stationary and shallow about 10 cm deep at a river width of1.5 m. The combination of a relatively smaller water volumein comparison to the other sections of the river and a slow turnover of the water column might have contributed to the accumulation of fecal microorganisms at this site.Members of the phototrophic Cyanobacteria exhibited low abundance values for the community composition of wa- ter and sediment samples.

A pos- sible explanation for this distribution is that river sediment could act as a reservoir that is rich in bacterial species releas- ing microorganisms into the water column via resuspension at the sediment-water interface 2038.When comparing the microbial communities in the differ- ent samples along the river's course the choice of the descrip- tive metrics was important in terms of determining differenc- es in alpha diversity.

A total of 28 different officially described bacterial phyla and four candi- date divisions were detected in the sequence set in both the sediment and water samples.Proteobacteria are commonly found in surveys of river and freshwater microbial communities and were the most dominant phylum in both sediment and water samples in the present study Fig.

While they covered between 52 and 82 of the total number of reads in the water communities the sediment samples generally exhibited lower abundance values for this group 35-40 and were more evenly popu- lated by a higher number of different phyla.While less abundant in the river sediment members of the class Betaproteobacteria clearly dominated the water-derived communities 35-72 of the sequences and were by far the most dominant phylogenetic group followed by the alpha- and gamma- classes.

The sharp difference in the diversity metrics between sediment and water with the exception of headwater-derived sediment shows that in contrast to the sediment the water column is not a stable environment.Due to its movement from the source to the sink of theriver the water column at any given point is constantly chang- ing its composition of bacterial species.

48 which describes a river mostly as a longitudinal continuum alpha diversity see Table 2 would likely increase along the river's course due to the increasing size of the microbial metacommunity which continuously collects new species downstream.

Since dissolved oxygen levels were relatively high throughout the river from 6-8 mgl with the exception of W60.7 mgl it can be hypothesized that due to the heterogeneity of the river bed there were microniches in the sediments in which aerobic bacteria could survive 40.

Using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S gene the present study analyzed the microbial diversity of the planktonic and sediment populations in a tropical river in northeastern Brazil that is exposed to severe pollution.

The recent devel- opment of economically accessible high-throughput sequenc- ing techniques has provided a far more complete inventory of the microbial communities present in lotic ecosystems with sampling depths orders of magnitudes higher than those used in previous studies.By using these new techniques an emerging set of studies of geographically distinct river ecosystems has expanded our knowledge of lotic 792242 and sediment 23 communi- ties as well as their physiological functions.

The aim of the present study was to increase knowledge about lotic biodiversity by studying the microbiota of both the sediment and the water column of a tropical river in a progres- sively urbanized region in Brazil.
