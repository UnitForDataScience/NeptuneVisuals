B Relative percentage abundance RPA of Gordonia and Geobacillus for subjects with No Rosacea subjects with NRS score  0 and Rosacea subjects with score NRS score  1-9 was plotted with increasing NRS score.

The alpha diversity was calculated for siblings in which neither has rosacea n  9 twin pairs both siblings have rosacea n  4 twin pairs or only one sibling has ro- sacea n  2 twin pairs.

The WUF distance was calculated between siblings in which neither has rosacea no rosacea-no rosacea n  9 twin pairs both siblings have rosacea rosacea-rosacea n  4 twin pairs or only one sibling has rosacea no rosacea-rosacea n  2 twin pairs from left to right.

WUF distance was calculated between left versus left cheeks and right versus right cheeksFIGURE S3 Monozygotic twin pairs have more similar facial microbial beta diversity to each other than dizygotic twin pairs and unrelated twin pairs.

Difference in alpha diversity Shannon index on Y-axis and NRS score on X-axis was plotted as values for twin B subtracted from related Twin A n  15 twin pairs.

There were five twin pairs who have different NRS score including 2 twin pairs in which only one sibling has rosacea.

Data are shown as mean - SEM of n  42 NRS score  0 18 NRS score  1-9 12 NRS score2-9 4 NRS score3-9 and 3 NRS score  4-9. p-values for no rosacea vs. rosacea are shown as .05 .001 .0001.

Twin numbers assigned in the order of recruitment with A being used per convention for the firstborn of the twin pair versus B for the second born twin.
