Within the SCFAs two distinct clusterswere observed acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid correlate with dietary contributorsfibre and protein while isobutyric acid isovaleric acid and valeric acid correlate withmicrobial diversity.

Comparing athletes toboth high and low BMI controls a greater number of pathways correlating to specificmacronutrients with the controls suggests a shift in the dynamics of these varied metabolicfunctions.

Furthermore concentrations of propionatestrongly correlated to protein intake while butyrate was shown to have a strong associationwith intake of dietary fibre Supplementary Table 6.Correlating metabonomic and metagenomic resultsCorrelation analysis between targeted measurements of SCFAs and taxonomic data from 16SrRNA sequencing revealed a number of correlations that remained significant followingcorrection Roseburia was positively correlated with acetate p  0.004 and butyrate p 0.018 while Family XIII Incertae Sedis was positively correlated with isobutyrate p 0.001 isovaleric acid p  0.001 and valeric acid p  0.008 Fig.

By-products of dietary proteinmetabolism mostly by microbes including TMAO carnitines trimethylamine 3-Carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid and 3-hydroxy-isovaleric acid are all elevated inthe athlete cohort.

Levels of glutamine 7-methylxanthine imidazoleacetic acid isoquinoline  quinolone were lower in athletes'urinary samples relative to controls.

The relative abundances of pathways related to fundamental metabolicfunction--amino acid biosynthesis vitamin biosynthesis and lipid biosynthesis--werehigher on average within the high BMI control group when compared to the athlete group.The mechanisms behind these differences are unclear and might reflect chronic adaptation ofthe athlete gut microbiome possibly due to a reduced reliance on the correspondingbiosynthetic capacities of their gut microbiota.

This analysis shows that the differences in the gutmicrobiota between athletes and controls is even more pronounced at the functionalmetabolic level than at the compositional level as previously reported and provides furtherrationale for prospective controlled studies to unravel the relationship between diet exerciseand the gut microbiome.RESULTSThe study groups were comprised of professional male athletes n  40 and healthy controlsn  46.26 To better represent the variability of BMI in the athletes controls wereclassified as either low BMI n  22 BMI  25.2 or high BMI n  24 BMI  26.5.Participants made no report of gastrointestinal GI distress or alterations of GI transit timethroughout the course of the initial study.Functional structure of the enteric microbiome correlates with athletic stateFunctional metagenomic analysis of faecal samples allowed for the prediction of theoperational potential of each individual's microbiota.
