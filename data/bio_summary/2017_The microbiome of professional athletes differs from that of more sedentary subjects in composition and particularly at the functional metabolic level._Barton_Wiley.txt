this analysis shows that the differences in the gutmicrobiota between athletes and controls is even more pronounced at the functionalmetabolic level than at the compositional level as previously reported and provides furtherrationale for prospective controlled studies to unravel the relationship between diet exerciseand the gut microbiome.resultsthe study groups were comprised of professional male athletes n  40 and healthy controlsn  46.26 to better represent the variability of bmi in the athletes controls wereclassified as either low bmi n  22 bmi  25.2 or high bmi n  24 bmi  26.5.participants made no report of gastrointestinal gi distress or alterations of gi transit timethroughout the course of the initial study.functional structure of the enteric microbiome correlates with athletic statefunctional metagenomic analysis of faecal samples allowed for the prediction of theoperational potential of each individual's microbiota.

it must be conceded that some athletes although fit may notnecessarily be more healthy.31athletes have an increased abundance of pathways that--giving an equivalent amount ofexpression activity--could be exploited by the host for potential health benefit includingbiosynthesis of organic cofactors and antibiotics as well as carbohydrate degradation andsecondary metabolite metabolism compared to both control groups.32 furthermore athleteshave an enriched profile of scfas previously associated with numerous health benefits anda lean phenotype.33-35 while interpretation of scfa data can be difficult as levelsrepresent a combination of scfa production and host-absorption rates it is notable that  aspreviously presented the athletes' diet maintained significantly higher quantities of fibreintake 29. this along with an increased number of detected scfa pathways in the athleteswould be conducive to an enhanced rate of scfa production36it was noted that athletes excreted proportionately higher levels of the metabolite tmao anend product metabolite of dietary protein degradation.

comparing athletes toboth high and low bmi controls a greater number of pathways correlating to specificmacronutrients with the controls suggests a shift in the dynamics of these varied metabolicfunctions.
