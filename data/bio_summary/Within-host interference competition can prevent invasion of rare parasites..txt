1Within-host interference competition can prevent invasion of rare parasitesBENJAMIN J.

Here we investigate a mechanism by which a rare parasite is unable to establish itself in a host population if a common resident parasite is already present a 'priority effect'.

We develop a simple epidemiological model and show that a rare parasite genotype is unable to invade if coinfecting parasite genotypes inhibit each other's transmission more than expected from simple resource partitioning.
