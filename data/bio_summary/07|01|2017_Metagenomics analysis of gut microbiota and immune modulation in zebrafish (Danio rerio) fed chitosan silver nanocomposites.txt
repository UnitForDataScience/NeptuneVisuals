intestinal sections of cagncs supplemented diet fed fish showed increased goblet cell density at 30 b and 60 days d compared to control diet fed fish a and c. the quantitative analysis of goblet cells showed cagncs diet feeding for 30 days has signifi- cantly increased p  0.05 the cell density average cell density2.24 - 0.0411000 mm2 than the control diet fed fish1.39 - 0.06101000 mm2.

furthermore cagncs supplemented diet resulted higher richness in microbial population compared to control diet whereas the control diet comparatively leads to higher evenness in the microbiota than the cagncs supplemented diet simpson control 0.65  cagncs 0.79 shannon index control 2.44  cagncs 2.97. the rarefaction curve further supports that cagncs supple- mentation has led to higher richness in microbial community.zebrafish gut taxonomy and comparison between control and cagncs supplemented feedingthe majority of the bacteria found in the metagenomics dataset of the present study were dominated by the commonly identified taxonomic groups which reported for teleosts including zebrafish.

to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of cagncs supplemented diet on gut microbiota goblet cell density gut morphometry and immune re- sponses in fish.conclusionin this study we revealed that feeding of cagncs supplemented diet changes the primary gut microbiota in zebrafish by increasing the beneficial bacteria belongs to families fusobacteria and bac- teroidetes.

histological section 4 mm of mid intestine fed with a control diet and b cagncs supplemented diet for 30 days and c control diet and d cagncs supplemented diet for 60 days.

however they remained as the major bacterial group in gut with cagncs supplemented diet while the abundance of phylum fusobacteria and phylum bacteroidetes were increased notably compared to the control diet fed fish.

the higher chao1 cagncs 61.5  control 58.5 and simpson's cagncs 0.79  control 0.65 indexes for the cagncs supplemented diet indicate higher diversity in the gut microbial population compared to control group.several studies have reported natural compositional changes of microbiota along the gastrointestinal gi tract as well as the al- terations in gut microbial community caused by external factors such as diet and ph .

the unique bacteria strains denovo 4 18 30 51 54 found only in feces of cagncs fed fish were closely related to genus cetobacterium that comes under family fusobac- teria suggesting that cagncs could promote vitamin producing beneficial bacteria in fish gut.in general the beneficial aspects of gut microbiota in fish are well documented.

the diet that prepared only with the powdered commercial diet was used for control group while the diet prepared by replacing 2 of the weight of powdered commercial feed with cagncs powder was used for treatment group.

however the difference was not significant at p  0.05. this difference in villi height was further increased at the end of 60 days showing significant difference at p  0.05 for cagncs supplemented diet fed group 144.40 - 4.8 mm compared to control diet fed group 96.2 - 4.8 mm as shown in c. however villi width did not differ significantly with the cagncs supplemented diet at 30 36.6 - 1.1 mm and 60 days 43.43 - 0.2 mm compared to the respective controls at 30 45.33 - 0.004 mm and 60 days 43.43 - 0.002 mm as shown in d.3.4.

the venn diagram displays the unique and shared otus found in control and cagncs diet fed fish a. there were total of 55 commonly shared otus by the two groups control and cagncs diet fed.

however phylum proteobacteria showed reduced 0.69-fold abundance in cagncs supplemented fish than the control diet fed fish.

the accession numbers of known bacterial 16s rrna sequence are marked in the figure.17 families in the feces of fish while compositional changes of bacterial communities were observed upon cagncs diet compared to the control fish.

cagncs supplemen-tation has also increased villi height significantly in the zebrafish mid gut at the end of 30 95.5 - 3.7 mmand 60 days 144.40 - 4.8 mm compared to control diet fed fish at 30 86.90 - 3.7 mm and 60 days 96.2 - 4.8 mm.
