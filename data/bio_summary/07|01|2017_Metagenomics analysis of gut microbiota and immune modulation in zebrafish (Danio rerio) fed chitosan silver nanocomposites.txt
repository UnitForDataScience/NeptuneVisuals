To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of CAgNCs supplemented diet on gut microbiota goblet cell density gut morphometry and immune re- sponses in fish.ConclusionIn this study we revealed that feeding of CAgNCs supplemented diet changes the primary gut microbiota in zebrafish by increasing the beneficial bacteria belongs to families Fusobacteria and Bac- teroidetes.

Furthermore CAgNCs supplemented diet resulted higher richness in microbial population compared to control diet whereas the control diet comparatively leads to higher evenness in the microbiota than the CAgNCs supplemented diet Simpson Control 0.65  CAgNCs 0.79 Shannon index Control 2.44  CAgNCs 2.97.

Intestinal sections of CAgNCs supplemented diet fed fish showed increased goblet cell density at 30 B and 60 days D compared to control diet fed fish A and C. The quantitative analysis of goblet cells showed CAgNCs diet feeding for 30 days has signifi- cantly increased p  0.05 the cell density average cell density2.24 - 0.0411000 mm2 than the control diet fed fish1.39 - 0.06101000 mm2.

Histological section 4 mm of mid intestine fed with A control diet and B CAgNCs supplemented diet for 30 days and C control diet and D CAgNCs supplemented diet for 60 days.

The higher Chao1 CAgNCs 61.5  control 58.5 and Simpson's CAgNCs 0.79  control 0.65 indexes for the CAgNCs supplemented diet indicate higher diversity in the gut microbial population compared to control group.Several studies have reported natural compositional changes of microbiota along the gastrointestinal GI tract as well as the al- terations in gut microbial community caused by external factors such as diet and pH .

The diet that prepared only with the powdered commercial diet was used for control group while the diet prepared by replacing 2 of the weight of powdered commercial feed with CAgNCs powder was used for treatment group.

This difference in villi height was further increased at the end of 60 days showing significant difference at p  0.05 for CAgNCs supplemented diet fed group 144.40 - 4.8 mm compared to control diet fed group 96.2 - 4.8 mm as shown in C. However villi width did not differ significantly with the CAgNCs supplemented diet at 30 36.6 - 1.1 mm and 60 days 43.43 - 0.2 mm compared to the respective controls at 30 45.33 - 0.004 mm and 60 days 43.43 - 0.002 mm as shown in D.3.4.

However they remained as the major bacterial group in gut with CAgNCs supplemented diet while the abundance of phylum Fusobacteria and phylum Bacteroidetes were increased notably compared to the control diet fed fish.

At 60 days post feeding of CAgNCs supplemented diet 6 of the tested genes TNF-a 6.2-fold IL-10 5.0-fold IL-12 9.2-fold IRF-1 5.2-fold Defbl1 3-fold Lyz 5.1-fold showed significantly higher up-regu- lation p  0.05 compared to the control.DiscussionIn this study metagenomics based analysis has been success- fully applied to understand the changes of gut microbial commu- nity represented by fecal microbial population upon feeding of CAgNCs supplemented diet.
