In the 2 batches this bacterial group was mainly composed of the genera Car- nobacterium including C. maltaromaticum C. inhibens and C. gallinarum VP 35.5 MAP 54.5 Vagococcus including V. teuberi and V. flu- vialis VP 16.6 MAP 7.6 Lactococcus VP 9.6 MAP 8.3 and Leuconostoc including L. gelidum VP 13.3 MAP 0.7 and to a lesser extent the genus Enterococcus including E. sulfureus VP 1.0 MAP 0.9.

The second was to monitor in detail the quantitative and qualitative evolution of the microbiota of VP and MAP fillets using microbiological culture-dependent and culture-independent techni- ques chemical biochemical and sensory analyses.Materials and methodsRed drum sampling and storage conditionsFirst trial comparison of whole fish and packed filletsRed drum Sciaenops ocellatus provided from a fish farm located in the center of the Atlantic coast of Martinique 14deg41'2.4''N 60deg54'7.8''W.

The organoleptic rejection of whole fish was observed at day 15 whereas VP and MAP fillets appeared unacceptable only after 29 days.

The shelf-life of VP and MAP fillets was almost double that of whole fish.

The flesh of whole fish slightly alkalinized with a final pH of 6.10 - 0.07 while the pH of VP products fell to a value of 5.87 - 0.07 at day 15 data not shown significant difference with whole fish.

developed a multisensory system integrating the amount of biogenic amines to assess the fish freshness.The main bacteria present in VP and MAP packed fish fillets are H2S-producing bacteria including Shewanella putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum Pseudomonas sp.

Nine whole fish approximate weight of 1 kg per fish and fifteen fillets with skin ap- proximate weight of 250-300 g per fillet were received at the PARM laboratory 6 h after harvesting.The whole fish were stored in a cooler box by alternating a layer of fish placed on the belly with a layer of flake ice and kept in a cold room 4 degC.

However despite these impacts on thesensory quality these fillets remained acceptable throughout the sto- rage period data not shown.Table 1Score and sensory criteria evaluated during the storage under ice 0 degC of whole red drums.CriteriaScore0123456OperculumColorsilvery slightly colored with red or brownsilvery slightly colored with red or brownsilvery slightly colored with red or brownbrowning and blood seepage around eyeyellowishyellowexcessive yellowPeritoneumIntegrityintactadhesionno adhesioncrackeddeterioratedlysedtotally lysedFleshpre-rigorfirmelasticspringysoftflaccidvery flaccidBelly cavityWallintactintactsoftfragileperforatedperforatedperforatedcolumn breaks andcolumn breaks andadhesionless adhesionno adhesionflesh comes offflesh comes offGray criteria indicate the unpleasant effects found at the rejection time day 15.Chemical analysesThe pH value of fresh flesh was equal to 5.96 - 0.01.
