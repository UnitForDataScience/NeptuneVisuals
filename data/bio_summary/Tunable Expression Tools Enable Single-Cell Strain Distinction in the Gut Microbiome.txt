Schematic of the High-Throughput Cloning and Genomic Integration Pipeline for Bacteroides Using 96-Well-Compatible Liquid Handling StepsThe pipeline was applied to 54 specifically de- signed genomically integrated cassettes across four Bacteroides species resulting in  99 cor- rect plasmid assembly.integration plasmids in a one-pot reaction Figure S1.

Transformation of fluorescent signatures enables visual differentiation of six co- residing Bacteroides species within the gut C and 5D and observation of Bacteroides species differentially localizing in dietary plant material within the gut E. These tools open the door for investigating how single-cell function inter- sects with spatial microbiota dynamics.In addition to distinguishing strains with constitutive reporter expression PBfP1E6 can be used to assess the state of recombi- nase-based logic gates.

Encoding Unique Fluorescent Profiles Enables Simultaneous Distinction of Six Bacteroides Species In VivoA unique combination of one of three GFP expression levels or two mCherry expression levels were encoded in each of six Bacteroides species.

This underrep- resentation of the incoming species in the crypts relative to the lumen 0.07 and 0.73 respectively p  0.029 provides additional evidence that crypt colonization plays an important role in Bacteroides entrenchment in the gut and provides a first example of how these tools can be leveraged to investigate gut microbiota spatial organization while providing strain-level resolution.DISCUSSIONOur platform for rapid modification of Bacteroides with strong and predictable expression adds to an emerging palette of tools   that can syner- gize to add new dimensions to our understanding of gut ecology.

After one day Figures E and  8 days  2 weeks B-5D 4 weeks C or 10 weeks A and 3B mice were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation and cervical dislocation in accordance with approved protocols and tissue was immediately harvested and pro- cessed as described below.METHOD DETAILSHigh throughput plasmid construction conjugation and integrationAssembled construct designs were based on the mobilizable Bacteroides element NBU2  which integrates into Bacteroides genomes at a conserved location.

Samples with substantially lower growth at the time of the assay as determined by OD600nm were excluded from the analysis although inclusion of wells with little or no growth only sub- stantially impacted Bv calculations with a reduction to 90 correct.Culture reporter expression and fluorescent assaysTo assay Bacteroides strain reporter activity glycerol stocks of Bacteroides strains were streaked out on BHI blood agar plates with the appropriate antibiotics 200 mgmL gentamycin and 25 mgmL erythromycin or 2 mgmL tetracycline and after a 24-30 hr anaer- obic incubation at 37oC at least 3 colonies were picked into TYG with antibiotics 25 mgmL erythromycin or 2 mgmL tetracycline and grown anaerobically at 37oC for 14-20 hr.

Here we describe a plat- form for engineering Bacteroides the most abundant genus in the Western microbiota which includes a process for high-throughput strain modification.

We have identified a novel phage promoter and transla- tional tuning strategy and achieved an unprece- dented level of expression that enables imaging of fluorescent-protein-expressing Bacteroides stably colonizing the mouse gut.
