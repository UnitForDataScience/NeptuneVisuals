The major implication of the microbiota in this context is high- lighted by the observation that inflammation is ameliorated or even absent in the absence of bacteria in different models of IBD 12 13.In this review we discuss the role of intestinal microbiota in visceral medicine in the context of gut health and intestinal inflam- mation and highlight some of the strategies aiming to functionally modulate microbiota as a new treatment frontier for visceral health.Essential Role of the Intestinal Microbiome in Visceral HomeostasisAlthough the structural and functional complexity of different ecosystems established within the gastrointestinal tract is daunting it has become evident over recent years that deciphering interac- tions between the microbiome and the intestinal immune system holds great promise for understanding homeostasis of the entire body.

The upcoming decade holds great promise in uncovering why specific strains are localized to different segments of the gut and how microbiota supports visceral homeostasis 8.Different layers of passive and active defense including the physical integrity of the intestinal epithelial cell layer the mucus antimicrobial peptides glycoproteins and secretory immunoglob- ulin A protect viscera from the potentially aggressive microbial content of the intestinal lumen.

The fact that commensals cancause intestinal inflammation is strengthened by the observation that some species may acquire traits of pathogenicity including the potential to adhere to the intestinal epithelium or to express toxins as in the case of adherentinvasive E. coli 52.

It has been demon- strated that adherentinvasive E. coli which is absent in healthy in- dividuals can be abundantly found in the inflamed ileal mucosa of CD patients where it causes intestinal inflammation by disrupting the intestinal barrier 53.

In contrast organotypic culture of intestinal crypts that has been established and refined over the past decade the so-called organoids 58 currently provides a great tool for addressing molecular mechanisms governing intestinal epithelial cell physiology.

Strong evidence demonstrates for ex- ample that intestinal inflammation can develop as a re- sult of a dysregulated microbiota deficient antimicrobial responses and aberrant bacterial translocation into the bowel wall.

In healthy individuals the bacterial translo- cation is blocked by a single layer of highly specialized intestinal epithelial cells which forms a strong barrier that lines the gut wall.

In susceptible individuals for yet in- completely understood reasons either defective epithe- lial barrier function or dysregulated microbial composi- tion or microbial pathogens drive intestinal inflamma- tion.

Many therapeutic strategies focusing on the modulation of the microbiota have been proposed re- cently but future research including prospective human studies and gnotobiotic mouse models are still needed to evaluate the contribution and potential therapeutic value of individual bacteria to human health.c 2017 S.
