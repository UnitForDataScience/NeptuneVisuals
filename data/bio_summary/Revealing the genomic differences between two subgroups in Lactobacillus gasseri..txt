the genomic differences provide evidences for demarcating a new probiotic group within l. gasseri.key words comparative genomics lactobacillus gasseri gassericin t quorum sensinglactobacillus gasseri is an autochthonous species of lactic acid bacteria lab that colonizes in the human gastrointestinal tract vaginal tract and oral cavity.

gasseri by using the average nucleotide identity ani the statistical similarity computed from whole genome sequences an ani threshold of 95 corresponds to an experimental dna-dna hybridization ddh value of 70 which is the general criterion for a species-level difference to reveal genomic characteristics within the two l. gasseri groups we here report detailed analysis of them focusing on their gene contents.in total 75 draft genomes of l. gasseri were downloaded from our dfastarchive of genome annotation daga the curated genome repository of lactobacillus and pediococcus from the ddbjenagenbank and sequence read archive sra they all satisfied a quality rating of 4 out of 5 in our database meaning that their genome completeness is95 and contamination level is 5 as computed by the checkm software when ani values were calculated for all pairs of the obtained genomes by an open-sourcecorresponding author.

we thoroughly compared the gene contents of 75 l. gasseri genomes and identified two intraspecific groups by the average nucleotide identity ani threshold of 94. group i with 48 strains possessed 53 group-specific genes including the gassericin t cluster 9 genes and n-acyl homoserine lactone lactonase.

the multiple analogs presumably result from their promiscuous inhibitory spectra that depend on subtle amino acid substitutions or modifications.the production of gassericin t requires 9 related genes in a 7 kb genomic region in l. gasseri la158 genbank ab710328.1 11. in group i this region was completely conserved in 39 out of 48 strains.

its health benefits such as its antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties have been well documented making l. gasseri distinct as a probiotic yoghurt inoculum in japan.previously we reported the existence of two subtypes inl.

after removing genes of hypotheticalunknown functions we selected genes whose conservation rates between the two gasseri groups differed by more than 80. the numbers of group i- and group ii-specific genes became 53 and 46 respectively.
