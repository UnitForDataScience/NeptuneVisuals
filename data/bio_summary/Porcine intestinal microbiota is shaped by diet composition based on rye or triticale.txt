This is in contrast to the higher crude protein content of triticale described above but a decreased detection of metabolite concentrations in faeces and an increased prediction of the pathway in faecal microbiota might be due to an increased absorption of metabolites into host cells from the GIT Topping and Clifton 2001 Vogt and Wolever 2003.Formation of short-chain fatty acids and gut healthIn both feeding experiments the ileal microbiota was dominated by lactic acid bacteria like Lactobacillus and Streptococcus with the abundance of Lactobacillus being increased in rye-based treatments and Streptococcus pro- moted by triticale.

The bar chart represents the relative abundance of bacteria genera with an average abundance  1 derived from rye-based hatched and triticale-based feeding treatment dotted and proportions being significantly different P  005.Bifidobacterium Bacteroides PrevotellaClostridium sensu stricto Clostridium XI LactobacillusSarcina Streptococcus Veillonella EscherichiaShigella-30-20-100102030Relative abundance  averaged by grain typesamples from triticale-based treatment Clostridium sensu stricto was the predominant genera and showed a fourfold increase in abundance compared to rye-based treatment.Grain cereal effect on faecal microbiota and bacterial metabolitesAdditionally to the taxonomical structure of the faecal microbiota profiles of metabolites showed variations in response to the grain species.

Clostridium sensu stricto was nega- tively linked to the abundance of Olsenella uncultured Prevotellaceae and uncultured Porphyromonadaceae which were only detected in an average abundance 01.Regardless grain type Olsenella and Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis were positively correlated with a signifi- cantly increased average abundance by rye-based diets compared to triticale rye vs triticale Olsenella 31 vs 01 Erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis 31 vs 04.The correlation analyses of faecal microbiota of the rye treatment Fig.

However triticale significantly promoted the abundance of Streptococcus in ileal digesta and Clostridium sensu stricto in faeces.Conclusions Diets based on rye or triticale affect varying intestinal microbiota both of taxonomical and metabolic structure with rye indicating an enhanced saccharolytic potential and triticale a more cellulolytic potential.

The butanoate metabolism ko00650 was predicted to be slightly promoted by triticale 111-fold.Temporal variations among microbiotaIn the present study the effect of diet composition on gut microbiota was studied in pigs with 12 weeks of age over a period of 8 weeks.

The above-mentioned cross- feeding between degraders of complex carbohydrates and fermenters of simple sugars might support multiple cor- relations with the abundance of EscherichiaShigella in faeces of pigs fed rye.Prevotella was detected among the most abundant bac- teria in porcine faeces and is known for its high abun- dance in the faecal metagenome of pigs exhibiting proteolytic and saccharolytic activities Purushe et al.

A multivariate dispersion analysis was performed on faecal microbiota structure both on the level of OTUs and metabolites to assess individual varia- tion in faecal communities along the present experiment.

When comparing the average dispersion of individuals fed rye- and triticale-based diets the faecal microbiota of the rye treatment showed increased dispersion values Table S6 rye vs triticale OTU 119 vs 086 metabolites 124 vs 087 both P  005.
