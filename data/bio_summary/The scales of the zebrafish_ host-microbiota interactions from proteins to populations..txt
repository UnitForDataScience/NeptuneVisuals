following thereciprocal transplantof mouse microbiota into germ-free zebrafish recipients bacterial taxa from the donor mouse microbiota were able to suc- cessfully colonize larval zebrafish but the relative abun- dances of these strains was altered to match the relative abundance of shared lineages in conventional zebrafish microbiota  inoculum the zebrafish gut environment selects for a specific distribution of bacterial lineages.

this suggests that alterations to a host and its environ- ment can not only alter the composition of an individual's microbiota but also the nature of the interactions among its resident microbial taxa.interactions among microbiota and populations of hostsanimal microbiota also have the potential to be influ- enced by processes occurring beyond an individual host through the migration of microorganisms from biotic and abiotic sources.

for example our group found that microbiota are required for normal expansion of pancreatic b-cells in larval zebrafish and we discovered a single protein produced by specific zebrafish gut bacte- ria that is sufficient for this expansion in germ-free larvae  named beta cell expansion factor a or befa are found in microorganisms isolated from human microbiota and show a similar ability to induce b-cell expansion in zebrafish suggesting this function has a conserved origin.

these studies suggest that inferences from simple defined communities can be scaled up to the complex ones that naturally inhabit vertebrates.scales of host-microbe interactions burns and guillemin 139interactions between complex microbiota and their hosts the resident microbiota of zebrafish consist of hundreds of microbial taxa and is typically dominated by members of the proteobacteria phylum followed by fusobacteria and actinobacteria  be colonized by a wider range of microorganisms than those normally found associated with them including taxa iso- lated from mammalian and human hosts  erty has facilitated analysis of potential human probiotics including several strains of lactobacillus in larval gnotobi- otic zebrafish .

despite differences in the intestinal environment of zebrafish and human hosts the authors of this study were able to colonize germ-free zebrafish with several human derived isolates demonstrating the feasibility of studying members of human microbiota in the controlled environment of the zebrafish model system.stagaman k burns ar guillemin k bohannan bj the role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the gut microbiota in zebrafish.

available online at sciencedirectthe scales of the zebrafish host-microbiota interactions from proteins to populations adam r burns1 3the interactions between animal hosts and their associated microbiota can be studied at multiple spatial and conceptual scales with each providing unique perspectives on the processes structuring host-microbe systems.

controlled but simplified gnotobiotic experiments enable discovery of the molecules and cellular dynamics that shape host-microbe system development whereas population level investigations of bacterial dispersal and transmission are beginning to reveal the processes shaping microbiota assembly across hosts.

thus any approach that focuses solely on interactions occurring at a single scale such as either directcell to cell interactions within a single hostor changes in microbiota composition across populations of hosts will likely lead to an incomplete or even misleading under- standing of these systems as a whole.in recent years the zebrafish danio rerio has emerged as an excellent model system in which multiple levels of interactions can be analyzed together to build a compre- hensive understanding of how different mechanisms act across scales.

equally important is the ease with which hundreds of individual embryos can be derived germ-free and reared gnotobiotically with a defined or absent microbiota .

at the population level of host-microbe studies the character- istic variability of animal microbiomes can be overcome through the large degree of biological replication afforded by zebrafish's high fecundity allowing for robust analysis of the effects of host factors on the composition of the microbiota.

comparisons of germ-free larval zebrafish with those colonized with a complex microbiota have repeatedly demonstrated effects of resident micro- organisms on host intestinal cell differentiation  epi- thelial cell proliferation  intestinal absorption of fatty acids  and immune responses .

the discovery of befa provides a clear example of how the gnotobiotic zebrafish system can be used to simulta- neously uncover the consequences of host-microbe inter- actions on animal physiology as well as identify the specific molecular mechanisms underlying those interactions.interactions between defined microbiota and their hostszebrafish have also proven useful in studying the coloni- zation and dynamics of populations of microorganisms in hosts.
