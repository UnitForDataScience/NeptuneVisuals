Following thereciprocal transplantof mouse microbiota into germ-free zebrafish recipients bacterial taxa from the donor mouse microbiota were able to suc- cessfully colonize larval zebrafish but the relative abun- dances of these strains was altered to match the relative abundance of shared lineages in conventional zebrafish microbiota  inoculum the zebrafish gut environment selects for a specific distribution of bacterial lineages.

This suggests that alterations to a host and its environ- ment can not only alter the composition of an individual's microbiota but also the nature of the interactions among its resident microbial taxa.Interactions among microbiota and populations of hostsAnimal microbiota also have the potential to be influ- enced by processes occurring beyond an individual host through the migration of microorganisms from biotic and abiotic sources.

For example our group found that microbiota are required for normal expansion of pancreatic b-cells in larval zebrafish and we discovered a single protein produced by specific zebrafish gut bacte- ria that is sufficient for this expansion in germ-free larvae  named Beta cell expansion factor A or BefA are found in microorganisms isolated from human microbiota and show a similar ability to induce b-cell expansion in zebrafish suggesting this function has a conserved origin.

These studies suggest that inferences from simple defined communities can be scaled up to the complex ones that naturally inhabit vertebrates.Scales of host-microbe interactions Burns and Guillemin 139Interactions between complex microbiota and their hosts The resident microbiota of zebrafish consist of hundreds of microbial taxa and is typically dominated by members of the Proteobacteria phylum followed by Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria  be colonized by a wider range of microorganisms than those normally found associated with them including taxa iso- lated from mammalian and human hosts  erty has facilitated analysis of potential human probiotics including several strains of Lactobacillus in larval gnotobi- otic zebrafish .

A larger more densely sampled study found similar changes in bacterial diversity and an increase in inter-individual variation from larval to adult stages sug- gesting developmental changes in the processes by which hostsselecttheir microbiota  microbiota became less similar to the microbial communi- ties in the surrounding environmentandfood over time.

The resulting microbiota were comprised of microbial lineages originating from donor hosts but restructured to match the distributions found in the conven- tional microbiota of the recipient demonstrating the overall importance of host habitat selection in explaining differences between host species.21.

This study provides a large and comprehensive survey of the zebrafish intestinal microbiota at various important stages of zebrafish develop- ment and in so doing documents characteristic changes in microbial composition diversity and inter-individual variation.Using a neutral model of community assembly the authors are able to infer the contribution of passive migration and stochastic demographic processes to shaping the zebrafish intestinal microbiota.

Despite differences in the intestinal environment of zebrafish and human hosts the authors of this study were able to colonize germ-free zebrafish with several human derived isolates demonstrating the feasibility of studying members of human microbiota in the controlled environment of the zebrafish model system.Stagaman K Burns AR Guillemin K Bohannan BJ The role of adaptive immunity as an ecological filter on the gut microbiota in zebrafish.

Available online at ScienceDirectThe scales of the zebrafish host-microbiota interactions from proteins to populations Adam R Burns1 3The interactions between animal hosts and their associated microbiota can be studied at multiple spatial and conceptual scales with each providing unique perspectives on the processes structuring host-microbe systems.

Controlled but simplified gnotobiotic experiments enable discovery of the molecules and cellular dynamics that shape host-microbe system development whereas population level investigations of bacterial dispersal and transmission are beginning to reveal the processes shaping microbiota assembly across hosts.
