larvae infected by environmental f. erecta had a lower survival than those infected by clinical strains of f. pedrosoi atcc 46428 and cbs 271.37t and f. monophora cbs 102248. in addition f. erecta hyphae induced high levels of tnf-a figure 9 contributing to macrophage activation after phagocytosis.

finally the cells were re-suspended at 1 x 106 cellsml for f. pedrosoi atcc 46428 f. pedrosoi cbs 271.37 and f. erecta cbs 125763 or at 1 x 105 cellsml forf.

in addition repetitive element identification was considered to be low in fonsecaea siblings ranging from 1.06 to 1.13 in f. multimorphosa to 1.93 in f. monophora table 2.mitochondrial genomesfonsecaea erecta cbs 125763t and f. pedrosoi cbs 271.37t mtdna was assembled in one contig measuring 25.7 and 25 kb respectively.

the mtdna of f. monophora assembled into eight contigs comprising 24.7 kb the mtdna of f. nubica resulted in a single contig with 24.5 kb and the mtdna of f. multimorphosa cbs 980.96t resulted in seven contigs with a size of 26.4 kb.

in addition f. multimorphosa an environmental species that once caused a feline cerebralabscess formed a separate cluster with an environmental sibling figure 3a.cluster analysis was performed in the protein set of four fonsecaea species f. erecta cbs 125763t f. multimorphosa cbs 980.96t leao et al.

the species in bantiana- and carrionii-clades showed similarity in gene contents sharing different carbohydrate metabolism and peptidase genesp  0.00398 mann-whitney u test suggesting that these fungiare able to degrade plant and animal substrates.protein family expansion and contractionprotein domain expansions and contractions were inferred from the abundance of protein domains predicted by interproscan searches and statistically tested by cafe v3.0 de bie et al.table 3  fonsecaea and cladophialophora specific genes annotated in the phi base.speciesgenesaccessionfunction in pathogenicityconserved site ipr002328 showed an expansion in the ancestor of f. pedrosoi f. monophora and f. nubica.

larvae infected by environmental f. erecta had a lower survival.fungal macrophage murine co-culture showed that f. erecta induced high levels of tnf-a contributing to macrophage activation that could increase the ability to control intracellular fungal growth although hyphal death were not observed suggesting a higher level of extremotolerance of environmental species.keywords fonsecaea species black yeast genomics chromoblastomycosis comparative genomics fonsecaea erectaintroductionmelanized fungi belonging to the order chaetothyriales are clinically relevant as agents of a gamut of diseases in humans and animals varying in severity from superficial to systemic and fatal infections de hoog et al.

2014. those species are mainly found in fonsecaea and cladophialophora of which f. pedrosoi f. monophora and cladophialophora carrionii are recurrently recovered from patients in tropical and semi-arid climate zones respectively around the globe xi et al.

fonsecaea pedrosoi and f. nubica are strictly associated to chromoblastomycosis while f. monophora also causes primary brain disease surash et al.
