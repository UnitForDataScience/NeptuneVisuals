recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointes- tinal tract neoplasms whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids scfas such as butyrate which can suppress inflam- mation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract .here we review clinical studies on intestinal bacteria in relation to gastrointestinal tract cancers including esophageal gastric and colorectal cancers.

accumulating evidence indicates that gastrointes- tinal tract cancers develop through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations which are influenced by host immunity diet and environmental and microbial exposures .the human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms which can influence the immune system and health conditions including cancer e. a growing body of evidence indicates that diet lifestyle and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms .

emerging data suggest that enterococcus faecalis may contribute to anastomotic leak after colectomy by producing collagenases and activating mmp9 .postoperative complications have been associated with tumor recurrence and a worse patient survival in gastrointestinal tract cancers e. manipulating the gut microbiota by diet life- style antibiotics and probiotics and prebiotics might become useful towards preventing the occurrence of postoperative com- plications and improving postoperative recovery after gastroin- testinal tract surgery.future directionsaccumulating evidence indicates that intestinal bacteria can influence the tumor development and progression in the gastro- intestinal tract.

a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influence tumor development and progression in the intestine would provide opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the intestinal microflora.c 2017 published by elsevier ltd.contentsintroduction369mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria influence the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms369bacterial genotoxins369other microbial virulence factors369microbial metabolites369abbreviations caga cytotoxin-associated gene a cimp cpg island methylator phenotype eac esophageal adenocarcinoma escc esophageal squamous cell carcinoma msi microsatellite instability nod nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain nlr nod-like receptor nlrp6 nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 prr pattern recognition receptor ros reactive oxygen species rygb roux-en-y gastric bypass tigit t cell immunoglobulin and itim domain tlr toll-like receptor vaca vacuolating cytotoxin a. corresponding author.

a better understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota in the process of absorption after gastrointestinal reconstruction and the occurrence of complications after gastro- intestinal surgery may provide new opportunities to utilize the gut microbiota for postoperative recovery in patients with gastroin- testinal tract cancers.fundingthis work was supported by grants from the u.s. national in- stitutes of health nih r35 ca197735 to s.o.

recent study has shown an inverse association between the amount of tissue fusobacterium nucleatum dna and cd3th t-cell density in human colorectal cancer tissue specimens .these findings from the experimental studies described here provide insights into strategies for targeting the gut microbiome towards the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal tract cancer.

these findings suggest that manipulating the gut microbiota may modulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.evidence suggests that the gut microbiome develops early in life and that once established the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life .

in a mouse model of melanoma cyclophosphamide has been shown to induce the translocation of several gram-positive bacterial species including lactobacillus johnsonii lactobacillus murinus and enterococcus hirae to secondary lymphoid organs and the administration of cyclophosphamide to germ-free mice or antibiotic-treated mice has been shown to reduce the antitumor effects of cyclophos- phamide by inhibiting the differentiation of th17 cells and the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating cd3th t cells suggesting that the gut microbiota may influence cyclophosphamide-mediated anticancer immunity .

in addition we describe emerging evidence for roles of intestinal bacteria in the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies and novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-ctla4 and anti- cd274 therapies the process of absorption and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal surgery.mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria influence the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasmsbacterial genotoxinsintestinal bacteria have been shown to potentiate carcinogen- esis through specific toxins that induce dna damage.

a study based on a mouse model suggests that deoxycholic acid can promote the development of barrett's esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma by damaging dna .accumulating evidence indicates that scfas such as butyrate which are produced by the gut microbiota can suppress colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis by blocking activation of the nfkb signaling pathway and inducing the differentiation of regu- latory t cells and il10-producing t cells e. experimental studies have shown that butyrate can function as a histone deacetylase inhibitor to inhibit cell proliferation stimulate apoptosis and suppress colonic tumor development e. in contrast emerging data demonstrate that low concentrations of butyrate may promote the growth of colonic tumors that exhibit dna mismatch repair deficiencies in a mouse model .modulation of host innate and adaptive immunityinnate immunity is a rapid immune response that recognizes conserved microbial structures in a non-specific manner typically through the action of pattern recognition receptors prrs expressed on host cells including toll-like receptors tlrs and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain nod-like receptors nlrs .

these findings suggest that the gut microbiota can influence the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy.therapeutic antibodies specific for immune checkpoint mole- cules including ctla4 pdcd1 programmed cell death 1 pd-1 and cd274 programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 pd-l1 can effec- tively enhance antitumor t-cell activity in various cancers underscoring an important role of t-cellemediated adaptive im- munity in inhibiting tumor progression e. studies using a mouse model have shown that the oral administration of bacter- oides thetaiotaomicron or bacteroides fragilis to germ-free mice can enhance the anticancer effect of the therapeutic antibody specific for ctla4 and that the oral administration of bifidobacterium can potentiate the anticancer effect of the therapeutic antibody specific for cd274 .

consistent with these lines of evidence clinical studies using metagenomic analyses have shown associations of specific bac- teria and bacterial dysbiosis with gastrointestinal tract cancers including esophageal gastric and colorectal cancers.
