However diet lifestyle pharmacological factors including antibiotics and probiotics and prebiotics have been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota e. Although further studies using human tu- mor tissue specimens are required for clinical application we hope to utilize the gut microbiota to modulate the efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapies in the future.Gut microbiota and surgery for gastrointestinal tract cancersSurgery for gastrointestinal tract cancers and intestinal re- constructions has been shown to influence the composition of the gut microbiota.

A better understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influence tumor development and progression in the intestine would provide opportunities to develop new prevention and treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal tract cancers by targeting the intestinal microflora.c 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.ContentsIntroduction369Mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria influence the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms369Bacterial genotoxins369Other microbial virulence factors369Microbial metabolites369Abbreviations CagA cytotoxin-associated gene A CIMP CpG island methylator phenotype EAC esophageal adenocarcinoma ESCC esophageal squamous cell carcinoma MSI microsatellite instability NOD nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain NLR NOD-like receptor NLRP6 NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 6 PRR pattern recognition receptor ROS reactive oxygen species RYGB Roux-en-Y gastric bypass TIGIT T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain TLR Toll-like receptor VacA vacuolating cytotoxin A.

Emerging data suggest that Enterococcus faecalis may contribute to anastomotic leak after colectomy by producing collagenases and activating MMP9 .Postoperative complications have been associated with tumor recurrence and a worse patient survival in gastrointestinal tract cancers e. Manipulating the gut microbiota by diet life- style antibiotics and probiotics and prebiotics might become useful towards preventing the occurrence of postoperative com- plications and improving postoperative recovery after gastroin- testinal tract surgery.Future directionsAccumulating evidence indicates that intestinal bacteria can influence the tumor development and progression in the gastro- intestinal tract.

Accumulating evidence indicates that gastrointes- tinal tract cancers develop through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations which are influenced by host immunity diet and environmental and microbial exposures .The human intestinal microbiome encompasses at least 100 trillion microorganisms which can influence the immune system and health conditions including cancer e. A growing body of evidence indicates that diet lifestyle and drugs can influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that the gut microbiota can modulate the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms .

In addition we describe emerging evidence for roles of intestinal bacteria in the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies and novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-CTLA4 and anti- CD274 therapies the process of absorption and the occurrence of complications after gastrointestinal surgery.Mechanisms by which intestinal bacteria influence the development and progression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasmsBacterial genotoxinsIntestinal bacteria have been shown to potentiate carcinogen- esis through specific toxins that induce DNA damage.

Recent data have shown that some bacterial species produce tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids which potentiate the development and progression of gastrointes- tinal tract neoplasms whereas other species produce short-chain fatty acids SCFAs such as butyrate which can suppress inflam- mation and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract .Here we review clinical studies on intestinal bacteria in relation to gastrointestinal tract cancers including esophageal gastric and colorectal cancers.

A better understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota in the process of absorption after gastrointestinal reconstruction and the occurrence of complications after gastro- intestinal surgery may provide new opportunities to utilize the gut microbiota for postoperative recovery in patients with gastroin- testinal tract cancers.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the U.S. National In- stitutes of Health NIH R35 CA197735 to S.O.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that specific bacteria and bacterial dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal tract can potentiate the development and pro- gression of gastrointestinal tract neoplasms by damaging DNA activating oncogenic signaling pathways producing tumor-promoting metabolites such as secondary bile acids and suppressing antitumor im- munity.

Considering that diet lifestyle pharmacological factors including antibiotics and probiotics and prebiotics can influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota future in- vestigations may be warranted to examine the potential influences of these modifiable factors on the intestinal microflora and tumorigenic processes.The main cause of gastrointestinal tract cancer-related death is distant metastasis and the liver is commonly affected by distant metastases from primary gastrointestinal cancers.

These findings suggest that manipulating the gut microbiota may modulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome develops early in life and that once established the composition of the gut microbiota is relatively stable throughout adult life .
