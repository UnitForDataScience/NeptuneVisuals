Next we identified two TCS genes L. enzymogenes qseC Le-qseC and Le-qseB in L. enzymogenes and found that mutations of Le-qseC and Le-qseB also led to a dramatic increase in indole production.

For example L. enzymogenes diffusible signaling factor 1 LeDSF1 to LeDSF5 a group of fatty acids were identified in L. enzymogenes strain OH11 and found to act as DSFs to regulate the biosynthesis of HSAF .

In this study we describe the identification of indole as a small-molecule signal for Le-QseCLe-QseB in L. enzymogenes OH11 and present evi- dence for the involvement of this signaling system in intrinsic multiantibiotic resistance.RESULTSTreatment of L. enzymogenes OH11 with the QseC inhibitor LED209 induces a dramatic increase in indole production.

Indeed treatment with epineph- rine also led to a remarkable induction of indole production in L. enzymogenes OH11 .Deletion of Le0754-Le0752 in L. enzymogenes OH11 also leads to a large increase in indole production.

Because L. enzymogenes is known to produce several antibiotic metabolites we examined indole's effect on the biosynthesis of HSAFFIG 5 Effect of indole on antibiotic resistance of L. enzymogenes OH11.

Nonetheless these data support that the binding of indole to L. enzymogenes cells isLe-QseC dependent.FIG 3 Fluorescence imaging of Lysobacter enzymogenes OH11 the Le-qseB deletion mutant and the Le-qseC deletion mutant.

Upon treatment with LED209 an inhibitor of the widespread TCS QseCQseB L. enzymogenes produced a large amount of an unknown metabo- lite that was barely detectable in the untreated culture.

Therefore we tested if the dra- matic increase in the level of indole production in L. enzymogenes upon blocking of Le-qseC and Le-qseB would lead to enhanced antibiotic resistance.

Here we found that the inac- tivation of a two-component regulatory system TCS by an inhibitor or by gene de- letion led to a remarkable increase in the level of production of a metabolite in L. enzymogenes and this metabolite was identified to be indole.

Indole treatment caused the intrinsically multidrug-resistant bac- terium L. enzymogenes to be susceptible to antibiotics.
