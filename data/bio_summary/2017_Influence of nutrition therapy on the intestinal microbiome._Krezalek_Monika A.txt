These changes are further associated with profound immune activation which may further predispose to the development of systemic complications 117Research has shown that the intestinal microbiome of the critically ill displays a near com- plete loss of health-promoting microbiota with overgrowth of healthcare-associated pathogenic microorganisms with high-virulence potential 181920 McDonald et al.

We have also recently characterized the microbiota of critically ill patients and similarlyshowed a loss of diversity in addition to a loss of the unique microbial signatures of different body sites which were more likely to be dominated by patho- gens 21Furthermore the reduction of intestinal microbial diversity has been shown to be predictive of mortality in the critically ill Earley et al.

Early research associated parenteral nutrition with high rates of complications specifically those of infectious nature and current guidelines do not recommend initiating parenteral nutrition earlier than 7 days from onset of acute illness 36Paren- teral nutrition has long been thought to be associ- ated with dysbiosis of the intestinal microflora dysfunction of the intestinal innate immune sys- tem and decreased barrier function of the intestinal mucosa 31Wan et al.
