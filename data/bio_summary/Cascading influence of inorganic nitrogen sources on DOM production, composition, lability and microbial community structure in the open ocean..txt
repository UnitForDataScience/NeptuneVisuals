2011.Inorganic N sources can alter the short-term lability of DOM produced by phytoplanktonIn the dark remineralization experiment more NH1-derived TOC was utilized by heterotrophic bacterioplankton than NO--derived TOC in the first week indicating that the short-term lability of DOM can be influenced by N source likely by altering phytoplankton community structure and the composition of DOM that is subsequently produced.

Perhaps more importantly the tim- ing of when DOM was 'harvested' for the subsequent dark remineralization may be vastly inappropriate while we captured the DOM during the period of peak chl a concen- trations this also allowed a long period of whole community remineralization and internal recycling with the potential for different interpretations of lability if the DOM were harvested earlier or later.

Carboys were incubated for 10 days and sampled daily for concentrations of inorganic nutrients total organic carbon bacterioplankton and chlorophyll a chl a as well as fluo- rescent DOM composition and rates of primary production estimated using 14C-bicarbonate assimilation.Seawater dilution and DOM degradation experiments were then conducted using the DOM produced from the grow-out experiment.

We collected water from 5 m depth inthe central North Pacific and amended duplicate 20 liter polycarbonate carboys with nitrate or ammonium track- ing planktonic carbon fixation DOM production DOM composition and microbial community structure responses over 1 week relative to controls.

We sought to explicitly parse the DOM and microbial community response to nutrient enrich- ment by contrasting whole community responses unfiltered light incubations in which production and consumption dynamics are coupled and indistinguishable and heterotro- phic microbial responses dark remineralization incubations in which we can directly associate DOM consumption and transformation to microbial biomass increases C flux and associated community structure shifts.

DOM composition and reactivity varies induction and alter the composition of both the microbial community and the DOM produced relative to an unamended control.

Initial concentrations of inorganic nutrients did not differ significantly in the dark remineralization experi- ment from those observed in at the time of sample collection or at day 10 of the grow-out p  0.05.Long-term DOM remineralization dynamicsBy 49 days in the DOM remineralization experiment changes in TOC concentrations were equivalent between the NH1 and NO2 sources -7.1 6 2.2 and 26.8 6 3.8 mmol C l21 respectively there was no detectable change in TOC in the controls.

199934TOC were removed suggesting that the semi-labile DOM fractions produced by the two N-amendments were equiva- lent in bioavailability if not composition discussed aboveand that long-term DOM lability is ultimately controlled byFandino et al.
