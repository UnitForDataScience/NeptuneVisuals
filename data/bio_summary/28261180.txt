One study reported no observable differences in acquisition and transmission with I. scapularis ticks   whereas another demonstrated that B. burgdorferi burden in ticks increased when fed on mice coinfected with A. phagocytophilum  .E.

A graphic representation of the humoral and cellular responses of ticks during B. burgdorferi infection can be found in .CONCLUSIONAlthough ticks are of increasingly importance little is known about what dictates their competence as disease vectors.

By investigating non-insect arthropod immunity we will not only better comprehend tick biology but also unravel the intricate effects that pathogen coinfections have on vector competence and tick-borne disease transmission.Keywords tick-borne diseases Lyme disease vector ticks humoral immunityINTRODUCTIONTicks are increasingly important disease vectors that transmit a variety of pathogens relevant to public and veterinary health        .

Transmission subsequently occurs during a second bloodmeal when spirochetes are introduced into a new host with the saliva injected by a feeding tick   .Different species of ticks vary in their ability to transmit Borrelia spp.

Nevertheless immune pathways within ticks remain functional suggesting that there are undiscovered principles governing non-insect arthropod immunity        .

Unknown immune networks are likely present in ticks that facilitate the recognition of invading pathogens.

In light of this we discuss how the presence of commensal bacteria symbionts andor coinfections can lead to altered immune responses in the tick that impact pathogen persistence and subsequent transmission.

Herein we will discuss the current understanding of tick humoral signaling pathways in the context of disease transmission both with and without confounding factors such as coinfections and the microbiota.HUMORAL IMMUNITYTwo of the best studied immune signaling cascades in arthropod immunity are the Toll and IMD pathways.

Another point of interest is the recent evidence that mammalian- derived cytokines can cross-react with the tick immune system  .

Investigating alternative immune circuitry and agonists will not only lead to better understanding of tick biology and pathogen transmission but will also illuminate how coinfections are maintained.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAO wrote this review.
