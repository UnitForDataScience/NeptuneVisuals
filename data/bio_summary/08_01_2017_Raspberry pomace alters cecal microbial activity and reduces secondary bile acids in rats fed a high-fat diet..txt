Interestingly both finely ground raspberry pomaces significantly increased the concentration of acetic acid in the cecal digesta Pb.05 vs. C. Irrespective of the grind type the preparation of seedless raspberry pomace significantly increased the blood serum concentration of ellagic acid dimethyl ether glucuronide DMEAG .The effect of the dietary raspberry pomaces on the BA profile in thececal digesta is shown in .

All of the animals fed high-fat diets displayed a significant increase in fat accumulation in the liver Pb.05 vs. C. The control high-fat diet group HF had the highest cecal ammonia concentration but treatment with HFSG and HFNGs reduced these values to levels similar to those in the C group .
