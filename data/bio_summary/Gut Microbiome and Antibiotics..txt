We are now witness- ing major changes in the epidemiology of chronic and auto- immune diseases that cannot be explain by the increase in the population and current research suggests that antibiotics may play a significant role.References........Gut Microbiome and Antibiotics733...... ............ ........................734Iizumi et al.

Administration of antibiotics within the first 6 months of life has a strong correlation with obesity but this corre- lation disappears if administration of antibiotics occurs af- ter the first 6 months of life.

b It is getting more difficult to develop new antibiotics and there aren't any in- dications that new antibiotics will be available in the next 5e10 years.

However as result of their multiple benefits antibiotics have been wildly used and abused in the number of prescriptions particularly in pediatric population and in the success of antibiotics for growth promotion in the food industry.

As mentioned above a strong correlation between Caesarean section and the incidence of asthma has been reported  thus many researchers are now focusing on the association between perturbation of the microbiome in early life particularly due by antibiotics and T1D.In non-obese diabetic NOD mice there is spontane- ously develop of T1D-like and there is some evidence that microbial exposure affects diabetes incidence.

It is incredible that children of Unites States are exposed to such an enormous quantity of prescribed antibi- otics in their early life because this amount is about two times more than the antibiotics prescribed in children from northern European countries .Antibiotics Lead to Microbiome AlterationAntibiotic use either orally or intravenously influences and reduces the gut microbiome .

reported that weight gain of children de- pends upon periods when they took antibiotics early in life .

In contrast Nobel et al indicated that administration of thera- peutically doses of antibiotics in mice early in life was associated with a significant increase in weight  .In summary there are many reports indicating a positive correlation between antibiotic treatment and weight gain in both human and animal studies.

There- fore physicians need to think more carefully about over what periods of life and what kind of antibiotics they should prescribe.ConclusionsAntibiotics are one of the greatest discoveries in Medicine and the benefits in the reduction of the mortality of the in- fectious diseases is unquestionable.
