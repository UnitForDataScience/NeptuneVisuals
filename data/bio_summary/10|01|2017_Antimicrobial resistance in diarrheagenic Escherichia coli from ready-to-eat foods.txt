Enteroinvasive E. coli EIEC polyvalent antisera E. coli A E. coli 028ac 029 0136 O144 and 0152 and polyvalent E. coli B E. coli 0112ac0124 0143 0164 and O167 were used.

coli EPEC was identified with classic polyvalent antiserum A E. coli 026 055 0111 and 0119 polyvalent antiserum B E. coli 0114 0125 0142 and 0158 and polyvalent antiserum C E. coli 086 0126 0127 and 0128 Orskov et al.

Never- theless the type of RTE food was associated with the presence of E. coli p  0.01897.In Brazil 1.2 of reported food-borne diseases from 2000 to 2015 were related to the consumption of vegeta- bles Brasil .Serological tests identified five isolates as enteropatho- genic E. coli EPEC three as enteroinvasive EIEC and one as enterohemorrhagic EHEC six isolates were neg- ative for the agglutination test.

The enterohemorrhagic isolate came from raw salad.PCR assays showed that none of the E. coli isolates possessed the virulence genes cnf1 cnf2 eae sta lt1 stx1 stx2 or cdtB that were investigated.Recent studies developed by some researchers report isolation rates of E. coli in RTE foods between 1.0 and 3.0 Ryu et al.

In addition studies with raw vegetables the food type with a higher rate of contamination by E. coli in this study have demonstrated that the number of gastroenteritis outbreaks related to the consumption of raw leafy vegeta- bles is significant and increases every year Taban and Halkman  Olaimat and Holley .The high MPN of thermotolerant coliforms detected in raw salads investigated in this study may be related to theTable 2 Occurrence of thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli in RTE foods from commercial institutional and hotel restaurants in Salvador Brazilexposure of plants to contaminants during irrigation har- vesting transport processing and sale Go'mez-Aldapa et al.

Furthermore commensal E. coli can be a source of resistance genes for pathogenic E. coli strains.

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of diarrheagenic E. coli strains in ready-to-eat RTE foods produced in institu- tional commercial and hotel restaurants in Salvador Bra- zil.

E. coli were detected using the most probable number method the presence of virulence factors in isolates was determined by polymerase chain reaction PCR assays and antibiotic resistance was analyzed using the disc diffusion method.

In total 15 isolates 3.1 of E. coli were recovered raw salads had the highest detection rate 1.4 followed by cooked salads 0.8 meat-based preparations 0.4 and cereals and vegetables 0.4.

These results suggest that RTE foods especially raw salads can be reservoirs of E. coli and facilitate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to the gastrointestinal microbiota of humans.Keywords Escherichia coli  RTE foods  Virulence Antibiotic  ResistanceIntroductionThe occurrence and consequences of food-borne diseases have been underestimated because they are not usually reported and establishing causal links between food con- tamination and disease or death is difficult WHO .Escherichia coli is one of the most versatile and well- studied microorganisms worldwide.
