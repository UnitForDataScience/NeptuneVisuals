In contrast Helicobacteraceae in A. amurensis from Nemuro were distantly related to known Helicobacteraceae members and their phylogeny could not be inferred in detail from the short-read sequence from MiSeq.To clarify the phylogenetic position of Helicobacteraceae dominantly found in A. amurensis cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were performed on one representative sample 2014N-MCF-2.

Although these Epsilonproteobacteria were scarcely detected in A. amurensis CF previously unknown Helicobacter-related taxon was mainly detected from A. amurensis collected from Nemuro City in 2015.The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Helicobacter-related taxon was most closely related to Helicobacter rodentium and H. marmotae which were respectively isolated from laboratory miceand livers of woodchucks and intes- tines of cats.

At the sampling sites A. amurensis and P. pectinifera live together although A. amurensis was rarely found in the area of Nemuro with turbid seawater.

The dominance of potentially sulfur-oxidizing microbiota might be associated with the starfish feeding behavior for example A. amurensis has been observed digging up and eating bivalves bur- ied depth 10 cm in sediments .

Although some microorganisms were isolated in pure cultures from starfish body little is known regarding microbial community structures associated with starfish.In this study by the combined use of culture-dependent and -independent methods we analysed micro- bial communities associated with common starfish species A. amurensis and P. pectinifera Echinodermata Asteroidea.

The similarity among microbiota within the many P. pectinifera CF some A. amurensis CF and seawater was generally supported by cluster analysis Fig.

The biogeographical pattern could be due to the small number of A. amurensis samples obtained from Hakodate City.

The family Helicobacteraceae and unclassified Thiotrichales were dominantly detected from some A. amurensis individu- als collected from the coast of Nemuro City in 2015 and 2016 Fig.

The qPCR results generally confirmed the limited but dominant occurrence of the Helicobacter-related taxon in A. amurensis of Nemuro City Fig.

The sequence found in the CF of A. amurensis is shown in bold.
