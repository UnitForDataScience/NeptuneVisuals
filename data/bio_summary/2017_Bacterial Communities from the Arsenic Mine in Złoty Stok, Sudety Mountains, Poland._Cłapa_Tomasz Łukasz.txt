small amounts of phosphorus were probably related to the bioactivity of microorganisms.silicon was probably related to amorphous silica which precipitated on the surface of the colony.the analysis of 16s rdna sequences.

2011. assessing and improving methods used in operational taxonomic unit-based approaches for 16s rrna gene sequence analysis.

pxrd analysis revealed the presence of picropharmacolite as the most common secondary arsenic mineral in the mine.

pcr amplification of 16s rdna was performed followed by subcloning of its products.

the quality of genomic dna was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis.amplification and cloning of 16s rdna sequences.

the amplified 16s rdna products were characterised by hydrolysis with endonuclease cfoi at 37degc for 2 h. the digestion products were separated in 1.7 agarose gel electro- phoresis for 90 min at 80 v. bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and uv illumina- tion.

rflp patterns were grouped visually into otus operational taxonomic units and representatives of each otu were selected for insert sequencing and analysis schloss and handelsman 2006 schloss and westcott 2011 romling and balsalobre 2012. clonesdescription was given as follows uprx where x is the clone number.

for phylogenetic analysis the sequences were aligned using clustalw.

the presence of picro- pharmacolite was confirmed by pxrd analysis.

qualitative eds analysis corresponds to pure picrop- harmacolite without other elements e.g.

eds analysis confirmed high purity of the mineral.
