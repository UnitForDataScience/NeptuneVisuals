In this review we compile the recent findings and hypotheses describ- ing the interplay between the microbiome and blood pressure and we highlight some prospects by which utilization of microbiome-related techniques may be incorporated to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of hypertension.Keywords hypertension dysbiosis microbiota lifestyle blood pressure short-chain fatty acid microbial metabolitesBACKGROUNDThe human microbiota is a mixed community of microorganisms composed of bacteria viruses archaea and eukaryotic microbes that coinhabit the human body surfaces .

Although theoretically plausible it is unknown to what extent does microbiota-derived H2S contribute to blood pressure regulation in humans This area is still in need of further research.HYPeRTeNSiON eFFeCTS ON THe MiCROBiOTA COMPOSiTiON AND FUNCTiONWhile the focus of most studies was to examine how the micro- biota at different body sites can modulate blood pressure a few studies looked at the other direction of this relationship that is can hypertension affect our microbiota composition and cause dysbiosis Is dysbiosis a target organ injury due to hypertension And does dysbiosis precede accompany or result from hyperten- sion It is important to point out that the majority of published studies were cross-sectional and were designed to examine associations and not to determine cause-and-effect relationships.

It remains unclear whether the effect of physical activity on the microbiome is independent of any accompanying adjustment of dietary intake mainly protein .Diet and its effect on Hypertension and the MicrobiomeMultiple dietary components have been shown to affect blood pressure  and various studies have examined the effect of manipulating those components on the blood pressure .

Therefore understanding the nature of hypertension-related microbial aberrations in various body sites may enable us to bet- ter understand the pathophysiology of high blood pressure and possibly develop personalized microbiome-based diagnostics for individuals at risk.In this review we discuss potential mechanisms by which the microbiota contributes to our blood pressure regulation and describe the link between dysbiosis and hypertension.HYPeRTeNSiON AND THe MiCROBiOMeBlood pressure regulation is complex.

Deciphering the possible interindividual varia- tions in the microbial composition in various body sites and identifying the changes in site-specific microbiota composition during onset or progression of various diseases will help to pave the way toward developing microbiota-driven personalized medicine.While large-scale studies addressed the role of the microbiome in some conditions including cancer IBD obesity and diabetes only fewer studies describing the role of the microbiome in regulating blood pressure have been published   .

It is important to mention that while obesity is associated with increased prevalence of hypertension not all obese children are hypertensive.Recently multiple animal and human studies have examined the relationship between the gut and the oral microbiome and blood pressure -.

These include but are not limited to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system the sympathetic nervous system SNS the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide signaling pathway NO uric acid endothelin the vasopressin system natriuretic peptides vasodilator peptides the tissue kallikrein-kinin system the immune system the adipose tissue and adipokines .Recently multiple animal and human studies have examined the relationship between the oral and gut microbiome and blood pressure they demonstrated a significant decrease in microbial richness and diversity in the presence of hypertension.

Propionate administration to Gpr41-deficient mice induced blood pressure elevation suggesting that Gpr41 is needed to counterbalance the pressor response to SCFA .increased Risk of Atherosclerosis from Microbiota-Generated Trimethylamine-N- Oxide TMAOAnother indirect connection between the gut microbiome composition and hypertension derives from the role of the gut microbes in the metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine to trimethylamine TMA which is further metabolized to the pro-atherogenic species TMAO .
