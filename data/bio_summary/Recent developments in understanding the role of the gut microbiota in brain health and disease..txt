also identified alterations to the gut microbiota in parkinsonian patients however the changes reported were different from those in previous reports.39 Although these studies report different alterations to the gut microbiota of parkinsonian patients they collectively suggest that there is dysregulation to the gut commensals that may facilitate inflammation and bacterial translocation.

Trans- plantation of microbiota from patients with irrita- ble bowel syndrome with anxiety to germ-free mice resulted in gastrointestinal symptoms and anxiety- related behaviors in these animals.82 These findings indicate that dysregulation to the gut microbiota is capable of facilitating the behavioral and physiolog- ical symptoms of depression and anxiety.Microbiota-based therapies for the treatment of depressionWhile a greater understanding is required as to how the gut microbiota can mediate the behavioral and physiological symptoms of depression emerging preclinical and clinical data are highlighting how modulators of the gut commensals i.e.

In support of this we have recently demonstrated that the gut microbiota influences myelination in the prefrontal cortex of mice.60 In addition to producing various bioactive metabolites the gut microbiota also synthesize var- ious neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and GABA.140141 Moreover certain spore-forming bac- teria have been shown to influence the secretion of serotonin from enterochromaffin cells which subse- quently influences local gut physiology.142 Whether microbially derived neurotransmitters are capable of reaching the brain and influencing their specified circuitry and behavior is unknown.

Given the close association between the gut microbiota and the brain it is not all that surprising that gut bacteria have roles to play in neurological and psychiatric diseases.

Relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis patients displayed high interindi- vidual variability compared with healthy patients while there were no significant differences reported in terms of species richness.59 At the genus level the gut microbiota of patients with multiple sclerosis displayed significant reductions in Fae- calibacterium Prevotella and Anaerostiples.59 More clinical data are required to determine whether these alterations to the gut microbiota and the gastroin- testinal system in multiple sclerosis are driving the pathology or if these alterations are simply a comorbid consequence of the disease.Preclinical studies have provided a greater insight into how the microbiota-gut-brain axis is affected in multiple sclerosis and whether it contributes to the observed pathology.

Understanding how the gut microbiota is affected in such conditions will allow for the development of microbiota-based therapies which may provide us with safer and more efficacious treatment options for such conditions.DepressionEvidence for a role of the gut microbiota in depres- sion and other stress-related disorders has pre- dominantly arisen from preclinical studies for reviews on this topic see Refs.

However there is growing evidence to suggest a role for microbiota modulation of certain neurotransmitterpeptide systems in the brain.9596The gut microbiota influences social behaviors The concept that the gut microbiota may influence social behavior arose from experiments with germ-free mice.

Depletion of the murine gut microbiota with an antibi- otic cocktail served to enhance unbiased condi- tional place preference for cocaine which was reversed following treatment of antibiotic-treated mice with SCFAs.120 Such data indicate that the gut microbiota can influence drug-seeking behavior..6. th Gan Dao Tu 9-Tetrahydrocannibinol THC the active psy- chotropic chemical in cannabis was shown to alter the microbiota of mice observed as an increase in Clostridium leptum and decreases in Roseburia species.121 Moreover in diet-induced obese mice THC lowered the FirmicutesBacteroidetes ratio while also increasing A. muciniphilia a bacterial strain that has been previously associated with weight loss reducing insulin resistance and improv- ing intestinal barrier function.122 Whether THC affects gut-brain signaling to improve weight loss i.e.

Interestingly however gut bacte- rial diversity worsened across generations in mice on a low microbiota-accessible diet which became less amenable to improvement following restora- tion with a high-carbohydrate diet.123 The results of this study highlight how the human gut microbiota may have potentially evolved to be less diverse and amenable to modulation following the movement of humans from more indigenous rural communi- ties to Westernized lifestyles.

It is clear that there are multiple mecha- nisms through which gut bacteria can signal to thebrain such as through the vagus nerve immune system production of microbial metabolites and modulation of circulating tryptophan.81017135 Understanding how the gut commensals modulate behavior remains one of the biggest unanswered questions in microbiota-gut-brain axis research.
