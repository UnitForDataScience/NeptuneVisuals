As expected the HFS group increased the inflammatory markers TLR-4 NF-kB TNFab and MCP1 compared with the C group followed by the HFF group Figure A-D p  0.05 on the contrary we found a significant decrease in kidney UCP-1 only in the HFS group Figure E. In addition the consumption of HFS or HFF diets significantly increased ROS levels and MDA concentration in the kidney compared to the C group Figure FG.

Particularly B. producta was increased in the HFS group and R. flavefasciens in the HFF group Figure A-D. Clustering the bacterial communities using principal component analysis PCA revealed that the microbiota after the consumption of HFS or HFF diets was different to that of the C group ANOSIM R  0.56 p  0.001 Figure E. However when the HFS or HFF groups switched to the control diet the gut microbiota in part returned to a similar extent to that of the C group.

Remarkably the HFS group showed extremely high levels of LPS 6310 ngmL 489-fold higher than the C group followed by the HFF group 192-fold higher than the C group indicating a severe metabolic endotoxemia.Figure 3.

Rats were fed for four months with either high-fat  sucrose HFS or high-fat  fructose HFF or a control diet C. Half of the HFS or HFF groups were maintained with the same diet and the other half were switched to the consumption of C. HFS and HFF groups increased 51 and 19 body weight respectively compared with the C group.

The HFS group showed a significant reduction in the expression of Cat Gpx and Gr Figure E-H while the HFF group maintained similar levels of these enzymes as the control group suggesting a lesser oxidative stress than the HFS group.Figure 5.

Remarkably 51 of the body in the HFS group was fat mass and only 24 was lean mass whereas the HFF group had 40 fat mass and 48 lean mass indicating that the presence of sucrose in the diet produced a more deleterious effect than the fructose in the development of fat mass Figure BC.

the inability to switch substrates during the feeding period with lipids being the main substrate whereas the HFF group showed a less severe metabolic inflexibility compared with C group Figure D p  0.05.

Interestingly the HFF group showed the same trend as the HFS group but to a lesser extent Figure .

Nevertheless the HFS group showed more oxidative damage which was reflected in the levels of urine H2O2 excreted in comparison with the HFF group Figure H.Figure 4.

There was a remarkable decrease inC. eutactus in the HFS and HFF groups and there was a significant increase in L. reuteri and B. fragilis in HFF group.
