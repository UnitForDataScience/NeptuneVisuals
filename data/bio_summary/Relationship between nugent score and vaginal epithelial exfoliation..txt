Here we sought to confirm theearlier finding of increased epithelial exfoliation among women with BV and to expand on the previous findings to determine if increased epithelial exfoliation is a shared feature of vaginal microbiomes with Nugent score greater than 3.We used a matched cross-sectional design in which women defined as BV-positive Nugent 7-10 BV-negative Nugent 0-3 and BV intermediate Nugent 4-6 were matched on the basis of age race and lifetime number of sexual partners.

BV specimens Nugent 7-10 were randomly matched to specimens in the two other groups Nugent low and Nugent- intermediate in order to avoid comparing groups of women with potentially confounding baseline demographics.ResultsExfoliated epithelial cell counts were higher in the vaginal smears from BV-positive women compared with BV-negative women.

The finding of greater exfoliation in women with intermediate Nugent scores may explain previous findings that these women like their BV-positive counterparts are at increased risk of acquir- ing sexually transmitted infections trichomoniasis HIV and gonorrhea compared to women with Nugent scores 0-3 -.

Our data suggest that epithelial exfoliation may be a host response to elevated numbers of BV bacteria or the results of the action of bacterial virulence factors on epithelial cells even if women do not meet the full Nugent criteria for BV i.e.

We emphasize that our measures of exfoliation were not limited to epithelial clue cells rather all epithelial cells were counted to estimate the extent of exfoliation in relation to Nugent criteria.The fact that BV-positive and BV-intermediate were phenotypically and statistically indistin- guishable with respect to epithelial exfoliation is consistent with a role for Gram negative bacteria and Actinobacteria in BV pathophysiology.

How- ever until recently there was little quantitative evidence to support this common assertion.Recently we examined the quantity of epithelial cells present in human clinical vaginal smears and reported that specimens from women with Nugent-defined BV score 7-10 exhibited sig- nificantly more exfoliated epithelial cells than women with a Lactobacillus-dominant micro- biota Nugent scores 0-3.This previous study had some potential limitations.

In this study we show a correlation between total epithelial exfolia- tion cell counts in vaginal specimens and BV women with Nugent scores of 7-10 had higher levels of epithelial cells compared to women with scores of 0-3.

Whereas intermediate women have some lactobacilli women with BV have many fewer or absent lactobacilli.

We acknowledge the possibility that BV could result in inherent differences in the type andor quantity of biological material collected by vaginal swabbing or that procedure of Gram-staining could influence epithelial cells differ- ently because of inherent biological differences in samples from women with and without BV.

After adjustment for clustering introduced by matching the incidence rate ratios for the BV inter- mediate and BV positive groups compared to the BV negative group were 2.09 95 CI 1.50-2.90 and 1.71 95 CI 1.23-2.38 respectively.
