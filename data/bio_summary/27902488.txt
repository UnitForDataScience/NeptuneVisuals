By examining the histopathological and molecular features of colorectal preneoplastic lesion subtypes we aimed to show that early preneoplastic colorectal lesions can be used to identify individuals at risk of recurrent preneoplastic lesions and of developing CRC.

ReviewWhat influences preneoplastic colorectal lesion recurrenceGiulia De Maio1 Elisa Zama1 Claudia Rengucci1 Daniele Calistri11Biosciences Laboratory Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori IRST IRCCS Meldola FC ItalyCorrespondence to Daniele Calistri email Keywords recurrence preneoplastic lesions suppressor and serrated pathway microbiotaReceived August 02 2016Accepted November 15 2016Published November 25 2016ABSTRACTThe hypothesis of the local recurrence of preneoplastic lesions was first put forward in the 1950s.

However no clear molecular signature exists for all of the preneoplastic colorectal lesions identified to date a number of markers would seem to play a role in more than one lesion.For this reason a molecular characterization of preneoplastic lesions would help to better classify preneoplastic lesion subtypes in particular those with a higher risk of recurrence and with worse histopathological features.

Furthermore a better understanding of microbiota found in relapsed lesions could shed light on the bacteria present in preneoplastic and neoplastic colorectal lesions.

Several studies have analyzed the promoting or protecting role of microbial dysbiosis in the etiology of colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence 70-73 but few have focused on the correlation between the microbiota and colorectal adenoma recurrence.

Advanced colorectal polyps with the molecular and morphological features of serrated polyps and adenomas concept of a fusion pathway to colorectal cancer.

Histology subtypes and polyp size are associated with synchronous colorectal carcinoma of colorectal serrated polyps a study of 499 serrated polyps.

Despite this there are still no definitive molecular factors capable of identifying which early colorectal lesions are most likely to relapse.

However the way in which the gut microbiota influences adenoma recurrence remains to be clarified 15.We present an overview of emerging strategies that could help us to understand whether early preneoplastic colorectal lesions are capable of predicting the recurrence of preneoplastic and developing CRC.

We shed light on current histopathological and molecular features of preneoplastic colorectal lesions and put forward hypotheses about their involvement in recurrence.
