Included among these are all of the major causes of mortality in developed nations including cardiovascular disease most cancers kidney disease and dementias Pitt  Kaeberlein  Kaeberlein .The field of geroscience seeks to understand the biological mechanisms that underlie this relationship between aging and chronic disability and disease Sierra  Kohanski  Kennedy   S.L.

For example people with peri- odontal disease are at higher risk of developing other age-related conditions such as heart disease diabetes and Alzheimer's disease Razak et al.

If the goal is to understand mechanisms of oral disease that are particularly important in the elderly even older mice perhaps up to 30 months of age should be used however it is important to consider the differences between pathological changes due to disease progression versus changes associated with nor- mative aging particularly when utilizing animals at advanced ages.

This condition is primarily related to medications but also from other comorbid age- related conditions such as Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease and diabetes Yellowitz  Schneiderman  Levy .

Along with periodontal disease the lack of saliva will also affect the dental prosthesis contributing to denture sores and compro- mised retention of the prosthesis.From an economic standpoint treatment of oral dis- ease is costly as it is the fourth most expensive disease in most industrialized countries with periodontitis alone estimated to account for more than 50 billion dollars per year in lost productivity in the USA Tonetti et al.

To model inflammatory bowel disease andperiodontal disease progression in patients 11-12 week old BALBc mice were treated with oral delivery of DSS which induced IBD including diarrhea anemia dilation of the stomach wall dysregulated hepatic con- centration and severe alveolar bone loss Oz et al.

.It must be noted however that many of these studies reflect the biology of disease modeled in young adult or still-developing juvenile mice that may not reflect the biology of naturally developing human oral disease which most often occurs in an aged individual who may already be experiencing declines in immune func- tion and other physiological systems.

Despite this a majority of preclinical oral health research has not adequately considered the importance of aging in research aimed at the mechanistic understanding of oral disease.

In particular we discuss the relationship between the biology of aging and mech- anisms of oral disease.

These observations have contributed to growing opti- mism that advances in geroscience research can be harnessed to delay the onset and progression of multiple age-associated diseases and improve healthspan outside of a laboratory setting Kaeberlein .In contrast to major killers such as heart disease and cancer the relationship between biological aging and oral health has received less attention among the broader biomedical and geroscience research communities.
