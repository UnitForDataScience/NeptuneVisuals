however we previously reported that 48.3 3084 6391 of s. epidermis isolates from the conjunctival sac of patients more than 60-years old 87.9 before undergoing ophthalmic surgery at miyata eye hospital from 2008 to 2015 were methicillin-resistant.23 hori et al.2425 reported that methicillin-resistant cns mrcns including s. epidermidis accounted for 53.8 and 37.8 of the total cns isolates in dry eye patients mean age 60.3 years and patients undergoing cataract surgery mean age 66.3 years respectively.

we also compared the mic of s. epidermidis in patients with respect to the duration of xa by arbitrarily dividing these patients into two subgroups xa-1 and xa-2 with less and more than a 67-month duration respectively.

compared with the control group the xa group but not the tz group had a significantly higher number of mrse isolates.we further evaluated the influence of the duration of use of xa and tz on the methicillin resistance rates of s. epidermidis using logistic regression with duration of use as a covariate.

all subjects provided in- formed consent and written permission was obtained.sixty-three glaucoma patients 63 eyes and 44 healthy volunteers 44 eyes were continuously enrolled in this study at miyata eye hospital between february and september 2014. all patients had been receiving continuous monotherapy with prostaglandin analogs for glaucoma for at least 1 year.

there was a significant difference in the mean age between the healthy volunteers and glaucoma patients p  0.05.characterization of bacterial isolatesthe positive culture rate from glaucoma patients was 90.5 5763 eyes.

however further research is required to confirm the actual cause of this difference because the influence of the base components or main agents other than bac cannot be ruled out.one of the limitations of this study was that we were not able to recruit healthy volunteers of the same age group as the glaucoma patients for this study because it was difficult to find subjects with healthy eyes that had not used any eye drops such as dry eye therapeutic eye drops and those for cataract prevention who were in the same age group as the glaucoma patients.
