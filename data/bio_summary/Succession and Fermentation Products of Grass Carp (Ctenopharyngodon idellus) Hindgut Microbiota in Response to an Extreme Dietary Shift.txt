As we also found a positive correlation between the concentration of acetate and the total bacterial count in grass carp gut in our previous study   it is not unlikely that the lower accessibility and even indigestibility in some cases of nutrients in Sudan grass in comparison to fish meal may haveresulted in a decline in prokaryote and bacteria counts leading to a decrease in SCFA levels.Generally SCFAs provides 20-30 energy for herbivorous terrestrial animals   but given the relatively low concentrations of SCFAs in grass carp gut the contribution of these by-products of fermentation to the daily energy requirements of the host is probably limited which may further explain why grass carp fed on herbal diet need to eat as much as 40-100 of its body weight daily  .ETHICS STATEMENTNo specific permits were required for the described field studies.

As opposed to the high percentages observed in plant-diet intestinal samples the relative abundance of Bacteroides Lachnospiraceae and Erysipelotrichaceae found in Sudan grass was less than 0.6.Further analyses indicated that 14 OTUs were shared by all samples six of which belonged to BacteroidesFIGURE 1  A Relative abundance of different bacterial phyla in the hindgut of grass carp fed on fish meal day 0 and Sudan grass day 1-33.

The ratio of acetate to propionateFIGURE 4  Correlations and changes in relative abundance of microbial communities after a sudden transition from animal-based diet fish meal day 0 to plant-based diet Sudan grass day 1-33 in grass carp.

Among these GH5 encoded cellulase in bacteria but b-glucuronidase in grass carp while PL15 encoded pectinase in bacteria but dermatan-sulfate epimerase in grass carp.

However none of the enzymes involved in the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides have been detected in grass carp genome searched against dbCAN database yet   indirectly suggesting that gut microbiota are likely to be indispensable for digestion of plant cell wall polysaccharides in the digestive system of grass carp.

Here we determined the succession and metabolic products of intestinal microbiota in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus undergoing an abrupt and extreme diet change from fish meal to Sudan grass Sorghum sudanense.

2016.Diversity and activity of cellulolytic bacteria isolated from the gut contents of grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idellus Valenciennes fed on Sudan grass Sorghum sudanense or artificial feedstuffs.

The number of copies of the 16S rDNA gene per gram of gut content was calculated as follows N Q2 D 50 uL0.2 g Q is the detected copy number from 2 uL of diluted template D is the dilution factor 50 uL is the elution volume in genomic DNA extraction and 0.2 g is the wet weight of gut content used for DNA extraction.Prediction of Possible Glycoside Hydrolases GHs and Polysaccharide Lyases PLsThe GH and PL families in the genomes of Bacteroides and grass carp were analyzed.

The genome of grass carp was searched against dbCAN database     with default parameters.

Principal coordinates analysis PCoA was used to visualize the pairwise UniFrac distances among samples through R. Heat maps showing relative taxonomic abundance were generated in R. The shared GH and PL families between grass carp and bacterial7 8 9 groups of Bacteroides spp.
