most of these symptoms disappeared after ppi treatment and in the course of our study we have observed no additional symptoms or clinical signs of gastrointestinal tract infections after 4 weeks of omeprazole therapy in both groups.intragastric phafter omeprazole treatment we observed significant increase of mean intragastric ph in both groups patients treated with 20 mg per day 2.29 1.05 vs. 3.8 1.45p  0.001 and 20 mg twice daily 2.05 0.59 vs 5.06 1.61 p  0.001. the effect of the higher dose of omeprazole was significantly stronger p  0.016 than the effect of the standard dose lactulose hydrogen breath testwe have analyzed individual data from lhbt of 36 patients and found no change after omeprazole treatment in15 patients specifically 47 817 treated with 20 mg once daily and 36.8 619 treated with 20 mg twice daily.

treatment with omeprazole did not stimulate or inhibit p38 map kinase activity in pmns discussionin our present study treatment with the standard dose of omeprazole 20 mg has caused a modest increase of intra- gastric ph with the mean ph  4. the significant inhibition of gastric acid production mean ph 5.06 1.61 has been achieved only after treatment with a double standard dose of 40 mg of omeprazole.

in our study treatment with omeprazole had no effect on lhbt results in 47.0 and 36.8 patients treated respectively 20 mg and 40 mg per day.

one patient in omeprazole 20 mg twice daily group was exposed to antibiotics 2 months before enrolling to the study and 9 patients 5 in omeprazole 20 mg once daily group and 4 in omeprazole 20 mg twice daily group were exposed to ppis 4--8 weeks before the study.

therefore an increasing number of patients is being exposed to side effects of this treatment the most common of side effects headache diarrhea abdominal pain nausea vomi- ting flatulence occur in 5 of patients.

in some situations it may predispose to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth sibo or gastrointestinal infections salmonella is an acid- sensitive bacteria unable to survive in ph  3. the increased risk of salmonella infection has been reported not only in patients after gastrectomy but also in patients taking ppis the drugs inhibiting gastric acid secretion have been also proven risk factor for infection with campy- lobacter since the greater risk of gastrointestinal infection has been associated mostly with the ppis rather than h2-receptor antagonists treatment it may suggest the correlation between degree of inhibition of gastric acid secretion and the incidence of gastrointestinal infec- tion.

on the other hand although escherichia coli is an acid-sensitive organism infections with these bacteria have not been reported more common in patients taking ppis gastric acid suppression is considered as a risk factor of clostridium difficile--associated diarrhea cdad the risk of c. difficile infection cdi ranged from 1.4 to3.5 times higher among patients with ppi treatment com- pared with those without ppi therapy severalstudies reported that ppi administration may lead to changes in human gastrointestinal microbiota and reduce microbial diversity.

one of the recent studies reports that 6 months lasting treatment with ppi may produce bowel symptoms and sibo in 26 of patients in contrast in a retrospective study includ- ing 1191 patients ppi use was not found to be significantly associated with the presence of sibo hydrogen breath tests using various substrates like glucose lactulose lactose and fructose are being used to diagnose sibo and lactose or fructose malabsorption lactulose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and fructose.
