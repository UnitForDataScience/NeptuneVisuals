In 16 patients the increase in the colony count of Enterococcaceae after omeprazole treatment was found 8 patients in 20 mg once daily group and 8 patients in 20 mg twice daily group.Table 4The effect of omeprazole treatment on the NBT test results the level of NO and cGMP in PMNs culture supernatant and serum as well as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS and phospho-p38 MAP kinase in freshly isolated PMNs.0.3532 vs 40.357The data are shown as median minimum-maximum NBT nitroblue tetrazolium PMNs polymorphonuclear neutrophils NO nitric oxide cGMP cyclic guanosine monophosphate inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS.The decrease in the colony count of Enterococcaceae was observed in 7 patients in 20 mg omeprazole once daily group and in 3 patients in 20 mg omeprazole twice daily group.Function of PMNsNBT testsWe have found no effect of omeprazole treatment on the results of both spontaneous and stimulated NBT tests Concentration of NO in PMNs culture supernatants and serumTreatment with omeprazole had no effect on NO concentra- tion in the PMNs culture supernatant and serum Concentration of cGMP in PMNs culture supernatants and serumTreatment with omeprazole had no effect on cGMP concen- tration in the PMNs culture supernatant and plasma iNOS and phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase expression in isolated PMNsTreatment with omeprazole had no significant effect on determined by Western blotting iNOS protein expression .

The data are shown as mean - SD 1 omepra- zole 20 mg once daily before treatment 2 omeprazole 20 mg once daily after treatment 3 omeprazole 20 mg twice daily before treatment 4 omeprazole 20 mg twice daily after treat- ment.observed in 29.4 517 patients with omeprazole 20 mg once daily therapy and in 42.1 819 objects treated with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily but the difference is not statistically significant .

The data is shown for each patient as the area under the curve AUC before and after the omeprazole treatment.Table 3Bacterial strains and genera of fungi in stool cultures analysis after omeprazole treatment.Specific taxaEffect after treatmentOmeprazole 20 mg once daily n  24Omeprazole 20 mg twice daily n  24Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coliIncrease new strain5 13 0Increase number of patients with higher score in the semi-quantitative scale of stool culture bacterial counts after treatment compared to the score before treatment Decrease number of patients with lower score in the semi-quantitative scale of stool culture bacterial counts after treatment compared to the score before treatment New strain number of patients with the new microorganism appearing in the stool culture after omeprazole treatment.Stool cultures analysisWith culturing of stool samples we have identified 15 bac- terial strains and 2 genera of yeast .

We evaluated the effect of treatment with omeprazole on the gut microflora and neutrophil function.Methods In 50 patients we evaluated the effect of 4-week omeprazole treatment n  25 with 20 mg per day and n  25 with 20 mg twice daily on intragastric pH results of stool culture and lactulose hydrogen breath test LHBT and neutrophil function.Results The treatment caused significant increase of the mean intragastric pH especially in the group with 20 mg omeprazole twice daily from 2.05 - 0.59 to 5.06 - 1.6 P  0.001.

The ComfortTEC ZpH ZAI-BG-44 Sandhill Scientific Inc single-use probes with two pH channels gas- tric and esophageal were calibrated before procedure using the D82-3152 buffer solution pH 700 Soundhill Scientific Inc and D82-3151 buffer solution pH 400 Soundhill Scien- tific Inc. To analyze data of pH-monitoring BioVIEW analysis ver.5.3.4.Sandhill Scientific Inc software was used.Lactulose hydrogen breath testLactulose hydrogen breath test LHBT was performed in 36 out of 50 patients before treatment and after 4-week omeprazole therapy 17 patients with the dose of 20 mg per day and 19 patients with the dose of 20 mg twice daily.

The effect of the higher dose of omeprazole was significantly stronger P  0.016 than the effect of the standard dose Lactulose hydrogen breath testWe have analyzed individual data from LHBT of 36 patients and found no change after omeprazole treatment in15 patients specifically 47 817 treated with 20 mg once daily and 36.8 619 treated with 20 mg twice daily.

Most of these symptoms disappeared after PPI treatment and in the course of our study we have observed no additional symptoms or clinical signs of gastrointestinal tract infections after 4 weeks of omeprazole therapy in both groups.Intragastric pHAfter omeprazole treatment we observed significant increase of mean intragastric pH in both groups patients treated with 20 mg per day 2.29 1.05 vs. 3.8 1.45P  0.001 and 20 mg twice daily 2.05 0.59 vs 5.06 1.61 P  0.001.

A pro- ton pump inhibitor was randomly selected and administered orally for 4 weeks 25 patients were treated with omepra- zole 20 mg per day taken 30 minutes before breakfastand 25 patients with omeprazole 20 mg twice daily taken 30 minutes before breakfast and before the evening meal.Measuring intragastric pHTwenty-four-hour intragastric pH was evaluated before and after omeprazole treatment by Sleuth pH-analyzer Sand- hill Scientific Inc.

The increased risk of Salmonella infection has been reported not only in patients after gastrectomy but also in patients taking PPIs The drugs inhibiting gastric acid secretion have been also proven risk factor for infection with Campy- lobacter Since the greater risk of gastrointestinal infection has been associated mostly with the PPIs rather than H2-receptor antagonists treatment it may suggest the correlation between degree of inhibition of gastric acid secretion and the incidence of gastrointestinal infec- tion.
