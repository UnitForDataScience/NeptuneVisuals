several studies have demonstrat- ed a close interaction between microbiota and innate im- mune-cell components for reviews see 196-200. the individual composition of the microbiota thus adds an- other layer of complexity in the regulation and function of the innate immune system 196 201-204 in both health and disease 196 205 206. seminal findings sup- port an impact of the microbiome on i innate immune cells neutrophils 36 207 dcs 208-217 macro-phages 218-220 ilcs 198 221-225 nk cells 226and nkt cells 227 ii the complement system 228 and iii defensins 196 229 230. a major challenge in the field that remains is to define the critical microbiota- to-host interfaces that fine-tune the human immune sys- tem and to exploit their therapeutic potential.acknowledgementsthis work was supported by the dfg emmy noether program and dfg priority program 1937 g.g.. the authors thank peterweber university of tubingen tubingen germany for the excellent illustration.disclosure statementthere were no conflicts of interest.referencesbuchmann k evolution of innate immunity clues from invertebrates via fish to mammals.

here we sum- marize and highlight current concepts in the field focusing on innate immune cells as well as the inflammasome and dna sensing which appear to be critical for the activation and orchestration of innate immunity and may provide nov- el therapeutic opportunities for treating autoimmune auto- inflammatory and infectious diseases.c 2016 s. karger ag baselinnate immunitythe innate immune system is an evolutionarily con- served host defense system with key features being shared between plants invertebrates and mammals 1 2. in- nate immune defenses in mammals encompass virtually all tissues particularly barrier surfaces such as the skin or the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory and gastrointes- tinal tract.

however this paradigm has been recently chal- lenged with the concept of trained immunity 14 and the demonstration of memory responses of natural killer nk cells and innate lymphoid cells ilcs 15-17 for a review see 18. at host-environment contact interfac- es such as the skin the gut or the airways microbial stimuli initially elicit the secretion of generic antimicro- bial peptides amps such as defensins or cathelicidin ll-37 as well as organ-specific mediators such as derm- cidin for the skin 19 20. innate immune prrs proto- typically tlrs 21 22 expressed by resident epithelial or recruited hematopoietic cells sense pathogen-asso- ciated molecular patterns pamps or in the case of nonpathogenic microbes more broadly termed mi- crobe-associated molecular patterns mamps and trigger downstream effector programs.

at- tracted by chemokine gradients innate immune cells mi- grate into the infected target organ 28. chemokines recruit innate immune cells through cognate g-protein- coupled chemokine receptors to sites of inflammation and are termed according to their first cysteine residues into c c-c c-x-c and cx3c chemokines with c-c and c-x-c as the largest families 12 29. chemokines can be further classified as homeostatic and inflamma- tory chemokines depending on whether they play a role in basal homeostatic immune-cell trafficking or in in- flammation.

thus mdscs can be regarded as a key type of innate immune cell that dampens the activation and func- tion of adaptive t cells and innate nk cells immune cells.

in addition to traditional adaptive t and b cell subsets lymphocytes also encompass the innate lymphoid cells ilcs that belong to the innate immune system.
