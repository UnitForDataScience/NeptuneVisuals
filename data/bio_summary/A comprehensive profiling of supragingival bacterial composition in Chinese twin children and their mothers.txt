At the genus level a total of 19 genera of bacteria were found to have significant differences between the primary and mixed dentition groups 17 of them increased in mixed dentition and two decreased including one predominant genus Haemophilus P  0.02 Table S2.Between caries and caries-free children the caries children harboured a significantly higher proportion of Actinobacteria P  0.025 in primary dentition and P  0.021 in mixed dentition which may reflect theincrease of the predominant bacteria Corynebacterium P  0.01 in the mixed dentition group Tables S3 S4.In the primary dentition group Proteobacteria was the major phylum recovered while in the mixed dentition group Firmicutes was the major phylum recovered in the caries tissue.

This result could be due either to a small genetic influence relative to overall variation or to other confounding effects.Furthermore when focusing on the impact of caries status on the composition of the oral micro- biome the caries children and healthy children tend to divide into two clusters that were closely associ- ated with the health or disease status.

and .The comparison of oral microbiome in twin children at different ages and caries statusUnlike a previous study of childrens' saliva micro- biome in which it was determined that the primary dentition harbours a higher portion of ProteobacteriaTable 1 The comparison of richness and diversity between mother and childrenTable 2 The comparison of richness and diversity in supragingival plaque samples and carious tissueCrielaard et al.

have found an association between the microbiota and disease in plaque samples but not saliva in both gingivitis and dental caries we used supragingival dental plaque and caries tissue as our study object.In this study we explored the microbial composi- tion of both supragingival plaque and caries tissue from Chinese twin children and their mothers by using a high-throughput pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA.

1 Different relative abundance of bacterial taxonomy profiles of twin children in primary dentition asterisk significant differenceThe comparison between twin children and their mothersAt the phylum level two phyla--RF3 and Nitro- spirae--were found in the mother's oral cavity but not in the children's oral cavity however their abundance was relatively low 0.05.

The primary dentition twins who were at a relatively young age showed no significant difference of microbial similarity with their mothers while the older ones in the mixed dentition age showed a significant change compared to their mothers this suggests that the oral microbiome of the children become less similar to those of their mother when the children age and no longer cohabitate Fig.

There were eight pairs of twins in the primary dentition group ranging from 3 to 6 years old with an average age of 4.25 - 0.66 years and there were 11 caries-free CF children and five children with early childhood caries ECC.

There were 10 caries-free CF children and six caries children.

Our study supports that it is the shift in abundance of species groups rather than the 'appearance' of novel cariogenic species or the pathogenicity of a single species that best describes the distinction between caries and healthy microbiota.Furthermore we found no statistical difference of microbial diversity between children and their mother even at an extremely young age primary dentition age suggesting that the bacteria in children are already highly diverse Crielaard et al.

Besides the obvious family similarity we found that caries children and healthy children appeared to resemble each other more as shown in the phyloge- netic tree.
