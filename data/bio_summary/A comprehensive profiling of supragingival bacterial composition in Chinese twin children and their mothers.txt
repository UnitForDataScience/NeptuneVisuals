1 different relative abundance of bacterial taxonomy profiles of twin children in primary dentition asterisk significant differencethe comparison between twin children and their mothersat the phylum level two phyla--rf3 and nitro- spirae--were found in the mother's oral cavity but not in the children's oral cavity however their abundance was relatively low 0.05. by comparing the oral microbiota between mother and children it was determined that there was no significant difference in the composition of the microbiota between the primary dentition children and their mothers.

at the genus level a total of 19 genera of bacteria were found to have significant differences between the primary and mixed dentition groups 17 of them increased in mixed dentition and two decreased including one predominant genus haemophilus p  0.02 table s2.between caries and caries-free children the caries children harboured a significantly higher proportion of actinobacteria p  0.025 in primary dentition and p  0.021 in mixed dentition which may reflect theincrease of the predominant bacteria corynebacterium p  0.01 in the mixed dentition group tables s3 s4.in the primary dentition group proteobacteria was the major phylum recovered while in the mixed dentition group firmicutes was the major phylum recovered in the caries tissue.

this result could be due either to a small genetic influence relative to overall variation or to other confounding effects.furthermore when focusing on the impact of caries status on the composition of the oral micro- biome the caries children and healthy children tend to divide into two clusters that were closely associ- ated with the health or disease status.

have found an association between the microbiota and disease in plaque samples but not saliva in both gingivitis and dental caries we used supragingival dental plaque and caries tissue as our study object.in this study we explored the microbial composi- tion of both supragingival plaque and caries tissue from chinese twin children and their mothers by using a high-throughput pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s rrna.

there were eight pairs of twins in the primary dentition group ranging from 3 to 6 years old with an average age of 4.25 - 0.66 years and there were 11 caries-free cf children and five children with early childhood caries ecc.

there were also eight pairs of twins in the mixed dentition group ranging from 6 to 11 years old with an average age of 8.13 - 1.52. there were 10 caries-free cf children and six caries children.

our study supports that it is the shift in abundance of species groups rather than the 'appearance' of novel cariogenic species or the pathogenicity of a single species that best describes the distinction between caries and healthy microbiota.furthermore we found no statistical difference of microbial diversity between children and their mother even at an extremely young age primary dentition age suggesting that the bacteria in children are already highly diverse crielaard et al.

besides the obvious family similarity we found that caries children and healthy children appeared to resemble each other more as shown in the phyloge- netic tree.

caries children harbored a higher portion of actinobacteria than caries-free ones and one lineage was found to be less abundant in the caries tissues compared to the supragingival plaque at each level from the phylum down to the genus level which was fusobacteria at phylum fusobacteriia at class fusobacteriales at order leptotrichiaceae at family and leptotrichia at genus level.

community richness estimators chao1 p  0.016 and ace p  0.013 and a diversity estimator the simpson index p  0.016 revealed a statistically significant lower estimate of richness and diversity for carious tissue from mixed dentition children table .taxonomy-based comparisons of oral microbiota across age and caries statuscomparisons of the oral microbiota across age and caries status at each of the taxonomical levels-- phylum class order family and genus--were per- formed based on metastats analysis.

from the phylum level down to the genus level there were no 'caries- specific' taxa unique to either caries children nor caries tissue.

also the similarity level of primary dentition children to their mother was significantly higher than that of mixed dentition children suggesting that environmen- tal factors may have a stronger impact than the genetic factors on the constitution of the oral microbiome.keywords twin  oral microbiome 454 pyrosequencingintroductionhumans are considered superorganisms consisting of both eukaryotic cells and microbial communities as bacteria colonisation begins soon after birth turn- baugh et al.

in our cohort there were 13 caries-active children and 19 caries-free children respectively.all the twins were raised similarly and were healthy no systematic disease no systematic antibiotic appli- cations in the previous three months no medical history of hormone-based drugs or immunosuppres- sive drugs and no local usage of antibiotics for the oral cavity.

however in the mixed denti- tion group the proportion of proteobacteria wassignificantly increased in the children compared to their mothers p  0.006.at the genus level in both the primary and the mixed dentition groups of children porphyromonas was significantly increased while treponema was found to be significantly decreased compared to the adult group tables s7 s10.structural comparisons of oral microbiota between different ages of childrenphylogenic trees were constructed to compare the microbiome sharing of the mz and dz twins.

the primary dentition twins who were at a relatively young age showed no significant difference of microbial similarity with their mothers while the older ones in the mixed dentition age showed a significant change compared to their mothers this suggests that the oral microbiome of the children become less similar to those of their mother when the children age and no longer cohabitate fig.
