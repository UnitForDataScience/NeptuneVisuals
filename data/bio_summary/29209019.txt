Diverse gut compositions of people living in different regions may contribute to complexity of microbiota associated with hosts and further confirm the importance of unveiling gut microbiota diversity to uncover roles of microbiotas in host health and to discover new means of adaptation to different environments.Genetic differences were revealed by genome-wide analysis or other molecular methods between Tibetans and Han people-.

However some studies reported absence of significant structural changes in gut microbiota of individuals from six coun- tries and effects of body mass index age or gender were not observed on gut microbiota structure.

However no correlation exists between gut microbiomes and BMI data not shown.Beta diversity of gut microbiota among different places in Tibetan Plateau.

Different geographical locations lifestyles farming styles and frequencies of communication with other places may vary with gut microbiome of Tibetans.In this study to determine correlations between gut microbiota community structures of Tibetans and geog- raphy we analyzed feca microbiotas from 208 samples from six regions with altitudes ranging from 2800 m to 4500 m across the Tibetan Plateau and compared phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic relative abundance among these regions.ResultsDNA Sequencing and filtering.

Therefore core intestinal microbiota in all humans may vary within a limited range.In average Bacteroidetes 60.00 Firmicutes 29.04 and Proteobacteria 5.40 represented 90.00 of sequences identified in Tibetans this result agrees with those of previous studies revealing that majority of human gut microbiota can be attributed to these phyla.

Distinct distal gut microbiome diversity and composition in healthy children from Bangladesh and the United States.PloS One 8 e53838 2012.Yatsunenko T. et al.

Significant dif- ferences in gut microbiota were observed among different locations altitudes and ages.

Characterization of fecal microbiota across seven Chinese ethnic groups by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.PloS One 9 e93631 2014.Schnorr S. L. et al.

Lowest Chao index was 187 in Tianzhu TZ whereas lowest Shannon index reached 2.44 in Gannan GN.Altitude of locations of GN and TZ measured below 3000m whereas that of locations LS HY and GC was between 3000 and 4000 m. NQ was the harshest location with average altitude of over 4000 m. Along with rising altitude bac- terial diversity in gut increased from 2.80 in GN and TZ to 4.27 in NQ whereas richness in gut rose from 212 to 301.Figure 2.

However knowledge about the influences of altitude and geography on the gut microbiota of Tibetans is currently limited.
