Therefore genetic variants may shape the gut microbiota and subsequently drive the obesity phenotype.The above studies illustrated that obesity is undoubtedly heritable although there are likely more genes and related pathways that need to be identified.GenderGender is an important factor affecting obesity.

The challenges and potential of the treatment of obesity by gut microbiota modulation were extensively discussed.Factors related to intervention methodsThe efficacy of gut microbiota modulation on obesity varies for different methods.

Dietary intervention can alter gut microbial gene richness but the curative effect of dietary intervention on obesity depends on both diet quality and quantity.Influence of diet quality on gut microbiota interventionDiet quality has great influences on the efficacy of dietary intervention for obesity.

2015 reported that saturated lipids in lard diet promoted obesity in mice but a fish-oil diet that contains polyunsatu- rated fatty acids restrained it 30.Overall low-fat-high-fibre diets are recognized as a healthy choice to prevent obesity.

Some minor molecules in diets such as polyphenols flavonoids and medium-chain triglycerides are also able to shift gut microbiota and conse- quently alleviate obesity 34-39.Influence of diet quantity on gut microbiota interventionDietary intake is another important factor in obesity patho- genesis and is closely linked with appetite and diet quality.Appetite control is mainly based on gut-brain signalling and the intrinsic need for energy homeostasis.

Di- etary emulsifiers such as carboxymethyl-cellulose andpolysorbate-80 could disturb host-microbiota interactionsand increase the probability of obesity 4546.Antibiotic applicationThe association between obesity and antibiotic exposure has been demonstrated in both animal and human studies 47-49.

Many genes such as UCP1 TMEM18 ELAVL4 TRIM28 and S6K1 have been associated with obesity by influencing insulin secretion energy metabolism adipocyte formation and other processes 103106-109.Studies have revealed that host genotype can partly regu- late the abundances of some gut microbial taxa and alter the susceptibility of obesity 105110111.

Analyses on obesity in elderly people revealed that se- nescent immune cells tended to accumulate during the aging process contributing to the pathogenesis of obesity.
