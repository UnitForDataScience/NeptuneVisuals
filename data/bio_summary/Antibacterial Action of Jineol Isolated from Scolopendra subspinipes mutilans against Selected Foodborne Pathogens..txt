data were collected at each time point and presented as optical densities ods of the samples.determination of the effect of jineol on the cell wall morphology of foodborne pathogensscanning electron microscopic sem study was executed according to  to examine the effects of jineol on the morphological changes in the cell wall of the selected pathogens s. aureus kctc1621 and e. coli o157h7 at mic.

based on its nmr spectroscopic data analyses the compound was identified as 38-dihydroxyquinoline jineol   .antibacterial activitythis study showed antibacterial effects of the test compound jineol as confirmed by the presence of inhibitory zones in agar plates against the tested foodborne pathogenic bacteria s. aureus kctc1621 and e. coli o157h7.

however no significant release of k ions from the control sets were observed.release of 260 nm absorbing cellular materialssince loss of 260 nm cellular materials is considered a good indication of the antimicrobial efficacy of any test compound this assay confirmed that bacterial cells of tested foodborne pathogens s. aureus kctc-1621 and e. coli o157h7 upon treatment with jineol at mic had a severe inhibitory effect in terms of release of 260 nm absorbing materials dna and rna from them .

as a result it was observed that bacterialcells of tested foodborne pathogens s. aureus kctc-1621 1.62-3.12 and e. coli o157h7 1.15-2.98 showed significant differences in their respective ods as compared to control groups 1.62-1.65 and 1.15-1.18 measured at 260 nm.

aureus kctc-1621 cells treated with jineol at mic further confirmed its inhibitory potential against the tested pathogens suggesting its role as an effective antimicrobial to control foodborne pathogens.keywords antimicrobial effect jineol foodbrone pathogens scanning electron microscopyintroductionfoodborne illnesses caused by foodborne pathogenic bacteria affect a huge number of population world-wide.
