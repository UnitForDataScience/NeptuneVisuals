By highlighting bacterial clades with scarce genomic information and associating their environmental origin our study pinpoints environ- ments that warrant additional sampling for targeted metagenome-resolved genomics single-cell genomics and phylogeny-driven sequencing efforts.MethodsExtraction alignment filtering and clustering of bacterial SSU rRNAsTo extract SSU rRNA genes from all 6744 metagenomes Additional file  Table S1 and from bacterial isolategenomes single amplified genomes SAGs and metagenome-assembled genomes MAGs deposited in IMGM  cmsearch from the Infernal package  was employed using the covariance model for the bacterial SSU rRNA molecule RF00177  To ensure quality of SSU rRNA sequences and enhancing both aligned fraction for se- quence clustering and increased phylogenetic signal for tree building we removed sequences shorter than 1200 bp.

In particular the small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid SSU rRNA gene has for a long time been considered the gold standard for molecular taxonomic classification of bacteria and is still widely being used  despite some limitations  Amplicon-independent approaches such as genome-resolved metagenomics and single-cell sequen- cing allowed researchers to overcome some of the previous barriers and promoted the discovery of unknown bacterial lineages at an unprecedented pace - seemingly reaching a climax with currently more than 140 proposed bacterial phyla .

However much bacterial diver- sity is still largely unaccounted for due to limited availability of genome data and inherent biases and chimeras in amplicon data.Building on the wealth of existing metagenomic sequence data we depict a comprehensive and balanced view of the bacterial tree of life a view neither affected by PCR-introduced artifacts and biases challenging amplicon data nor by overrepresentation of certainclades as achieved by data de-replication after clustering.

In addition many SSU rRNA gene sequences of members of these phyla contain long insertion sequences The underrepresentation of these so-called blind spots in PCR-based studies is thus not surprising  Importantly many of the se- quences in clusters without associated referencegenomes are readily available in metagenomic data for further exploration and potentially double total gen- ome representation of order-level branches in the bacterial tree of life.Beyond the expansion of the bacterial tree by novel metagenomic SSU rRNA gene sequences our survey re- veals the relative contributions of established phyla to the overall taxonomic richness within the domain bac- teria Fig.

However when considering the 85 order-level clusters as reflected in the number of branches in our phylogenetic tree and less affected from oversampling of certain bacterial groups Parcubacteria is the major contributor to the bacterial tree 148 85 clusters trailed by Bacteroidetes 81 85 clusters and Chloroflexi 62 85 clusters.

A final phylogenetic tree was constructed with RAxML version 8.2 GTRGAMMAI and 1000 bootstrap replicate trees were generated.Cluster representatives were assigned to known bacter- ial phyla based on their position in the phylogenetic tree and branch support taking into account existing taxonomic assignments of SSU rRNA sequence ex- tracted from bacterial isolate genomes SAGs and MAGs in IMGM Novel metagenomic SSU rRNA gene sequences were assigned to these phyla when they branched together with known references in a monophy- letic clade.Phylogenetic diversityFor each of the major bacterial phyla all 97 OTUs were extracted and two phylogenetic trees were con- structed with RAxML version 8.2 under the gen- eral time-reversible evolutionary model with the CAT approximation of rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites GTRCATI.

Modern molecular approaches have provided a means to construct an increasingly detailed catalog of global bacterial diversity.

This collection of about 124000 bacterial se- quences  64000 from metagenomes and  60000 from reference genomes with a length of at least 1200 bp was first de-replicated at 97 nucleotide identity followed by clustering at 85 identity that approximates order level lineages To assess novelty of our metagenomic SSU rRNA sequences both 97 operational taxonomic units OTUs and 85 clusters were matched against the comprehensive SSU rRNA database SILVA In total 11278 97 OTUs were of sole metagenomic origin MG-only of which 4166 were completely novel with no match in the SILVA database  and 2826 97 OTUs had at least one cluster member derived from a genome sequence.

The tree was rooted based on a representative set of 15 archaeal SSU rRNA gene sequencessignal of the SSU rRNA gene as compared to concatenated alignments of marker proteins the phylogenetic tree constructed based on the genomic and metagenomic SSU rRNA genes resolves the majority of established bacterial phyla Fig.
