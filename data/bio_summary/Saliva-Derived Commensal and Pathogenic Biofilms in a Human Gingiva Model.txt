The novel host-microbiome model provides an ideal tool for future investigations of gingiva responses to commensal and pathogenic biofilms and for testing novel therapeutics.Keywords host-pathogen interactions oral mucosa immune evasion gingivitis bacteria keratinocytesIntroductionThe oral microbiome differs in composition among individuals and can contain hundreds of bacterial species Zaura et al.

In most cases the oral microbiome does not cause clini- cal problems and can therefore be considered commensal Zaura et al.

In contrast pathogenic oral microbiomes have a detrimental effect on the host tissue which causes dis-vivo situation the host-microbiome interaction should there- fore be investigated with multispecies microbiomes Klug et al.

This has also been argued by others and is reflected in multiple publications that investigate the host-microbiome interaction with biofilms composed of up to 11 species Guggenheim et al.

To reduce pathogen invasion host tissue reciprocally interacts with the bacteria by initiating an immune response and secret- ing antimicrobial peptides Mans et al.
