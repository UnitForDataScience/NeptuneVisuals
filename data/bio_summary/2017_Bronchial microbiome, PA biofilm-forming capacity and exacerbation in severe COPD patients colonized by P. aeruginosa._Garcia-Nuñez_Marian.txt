In addition for investigations involving human subjects informed consent has been obtained from the participants involved.summary pointsBronchial colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequent in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD.Most prevalent phyla in the bronchial microbiome of severe COPD patients are Proteobacteria and Firmicutes withPseudomonas and Streptococcus as the most frequently detected genera.a- and b-diversity in sputum show similar figures in groups differentiated according to biofilm-forming capacity in both exacerbation and stability.Comparative analyses of bacterial relative abundance according to biofilm-forming capacity identify statistically significant differences only for phyla and genera with median relative abundances below 1 with Fusobacterium as the only genus over-represented in both exacerbation and stability in samples with high biofilm-forming capacity.A difference in the microbial community composition is identified in near three quarters of exacerbations with previous paired stability samples available with over-representations of the genera Pseudomonas Moraxella Haemophilus Streptococcus and Corynebacterium that attained relative abundances over 50.

Differences in the relative abundance of Fusobacterium according to Pa biofilm- forming capacity p  0.05.EH Exacerbation with PA-high biofilm-forming capacity EL Exacerbation with PA-low biofilm- forming capacity RA Relative abundanceSH Stability with PA-high biofilm-forming capacity SL Stability with PA-low biofilm-forming capacity.Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and the most fre- quently detected genera were Pseudomonas and Streptococcus.

Patients were included in the study if they provided goodquality sputum samples for culture both during exacerbations and periods of stability and if they presented chronic colonization by P. aeruginosa demonstrated by the recovery of this PPM from at least two of the sputum samples cultured.ethics statementWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients before participating in this study.

Good- quality sputum samples positive for P. aeruginosa obtained from exacerbations andor a stability period were available from 21 patients 38.9n  10 accounting for more than 90 of the RA in all cases figures were slightly higher in exacerbation samples though the difference did not reach statistical significance Figure 2.

This population sample had a mean age of 72 SD 8 years and severe COPD mean FEV1 40.9 SD 10.4 table 1.sputum samplesThirty-seven sputum samples which were culture-positive for P. aeruginosa were studied corresponding to 21 exacerbations and 16 stabil- ity episodes.

Furthermore in seven cases 50 P. aeruginosa-positive results obtained by cul- ture during exacerbations were not paralleled by increases in the RA observed in 16S rRNA gene analyses while another PPM genus attained an RA over 50 in the exacerbation sample that had increased from baseline a finding that sup- ports the hypothesis that positive P. aeruginosa cultivated from sputum samples in exacerbated COPD patients may only be a marker of bron- chial colonization while the acute episode is caused by a different PPM Cohen's k  0.380Figure 3.

Our resultsare consistent with previous data that analyzed paired samples obtained from individual COPD patients and reported changes in their bron- chial microbiome during exacerbations 1549.

Fusobacterium genus was over-represented in samples harboring Pseudomonas strains with high biofilm-forming capacity in both exacerba- tion and stability samples.

The results obtained are in fact neither extensive to patients with moder- ate disease who show a different microbiome composition 40 nor to COPD patients colo- nized by other PPMs like H. influenzae which is often recovered from bronchial secretions in this clinical situation 2.Future perspectiveThis study focuses on the bronchial microbiome in severe COPD colonized by P. aeruginosa and the analysis of other COPD populations are outside the scopes of the present study.

In the present study we characterize the microbiome in bronchial secretions from severe COPD patients with positive cultures for P. aeruginosa first to determine their differences with regard to the ability of the strains recovered to form biofilms both during exacerbations and stability periods of the disease and second to identify genus that include potential pathogenic bacteria and were over-represented in exacerbations.MethodsDesign  populationParticipants were selected from a hospital- based prospective cohort of COPD patients regularly attending an outpatient respiratory clinic from 2010 onwards 16.
