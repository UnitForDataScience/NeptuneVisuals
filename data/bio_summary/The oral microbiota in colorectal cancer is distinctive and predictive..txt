shown are network plots of bacterial otus found in both the oral cavity and colonic microbiota in different groups of samples a diseased colorectal tissue on 65 individuals with crc and 2 polyps b oral swab samples 45 individuals with crc 21 individuals with polyps and 25 healthy controls c undiseased colorectal tissue off from 74 individuals with crc and 31 individuals with polyps d colorectal tissue from 59 healthy controls e faecal samples from 69 individuals with crc and 23 individuals with polyps and f faecal samples from 62 healthy controls.

strikingly as in crc the pathogen cag-type microbiota in children with cd comprised most of the statistically significantly more abundant bacterial otus including otus also found in the oral cavity  onlinesupplementary 7. detailed comparison of the otus found in the oral cavity and at colonic mucosal surfaces of individuals with crc or cd revealed that the same otus classified as fusobacterium haemophilus streptococcus gemella rothia actinomyces granulicatella and veilonella were detected in both cd and crc whereas otus classified as peptostreptococcus and parvimonas were only found in crc see also .

in order to compare bacterial operational taxonomic units otus obtained in the irish crc cohort sequenced region v3-v4 with otus obtained in the crohn's disease cohort v4 we shortened the sequences of the crc cohort to the sequenced region of the cd cohort using cutadaptand then processed the sequences of the two studies together.statistical analysis was carried out in r.a more detailed description of the employed protocols is available as online crc classifierthe random forest rf classifier to determine otus suitable as biomarkers of colonic lesions was described elsewhere.in brief we used log-ratio transformed values of otus present in at least 5 of individuals as input to the function aucrf of the aucrf package.significance of difference between roc curves was assessed using the function roc.test of the proc package.a schematic is depicted in online 1. we also employed an in-house pipeline for classification that consisted of a two-step procedure the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso feature selection followed by rf modelling.

differentially abundant otus were classified as haemophilus parvimonas prevotella alloprevotella lachnoanaerobaculum neisseria andoral and stool microbiota as biomarkers of crccurrent non-invasive screening tools for crc can reliably detect advanced carcinomas based on traces of blood in faeces released by colonic lesions but these methods suffer from low sensitivity for detecting early lesions.motivated by the find- ings presented above we assessed the suitability of oral micro- biota as a screening tool for identifying subjects with polyps and crc by employing a previously established rf classifica- tion methodologyonline 1. the model identified 16 oral microbiota otus that distinguish individuals with crc from healthy controls.

details of the overlap ofotus between the different sample types are presented in the venn diagram in online 5.low colonic abundance of lachnospiraceae favours colonisation of gut mucosa by oral pathogens linked to crc given the associations of oral bacteria with the altered microbiota found on crc biopsies and our current finding that characterising oral microbiota profiles has potential for crc detection we hypothesised that the oral micro- biota might generally be reflected in gut microbiota compo- sition.

some genera found in both cd and crc contained otus that were unique to either cd or crc eg the genus dialister wasfound in both cd and crc but the otus were different.

however it is not known if colonic mucosa-associated taxa are indeed orally derived if such cases are a distinct subset of patients or if the oral microbiome is generally suitable for screening for crc.methods we profiled the microbiota in oral swabs colonic mucosae and stool from individuals with crc 99 subjects colorectal polyps 32 or controls 103. results several oral taxa were differentiallyabundant in crc compared with controls for example streptococcus and prevotellas pp.

high abundance of lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with the colonisationof colonic tissue with oral-like bacterial networks suggesting a protective role for certain microbiota types against crc possibly by conferring colonisation resistance to crc-associated oral taxa and possibly mediated through habitual diet.conclusion the heterogeneity of crc may relate to microbiota types that either predispose or provide resistance to the disease and profiling the oralmicrobiome may offer an alternative screen for detecting crc.introductionmicrobes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human cancers most strikingly in the case of helicobacter pylori and gastric carcinoma and some gastric lymphomas.h.

previously several groups reported the applicability of faecal microbiota profiling as a tool for detection of crcs particularly in conjunction with the fobtor fit.moreover distinct bacterial profiles in the oral cavity have been associ- ated with oral cancersand with esophagealand pancreatic cancers.a single study identified significant differences in the bacteria present in oral rinse samples from individuals with crc compared with healthy controls.here we present the findings of an extended crc study population and include an assessment of the oral microbiota.

lasso improves accuracy and interpretability of models by effi- ciently selecting the relevant features a process which is tunedbmi body mass index crc colorectal cancer.streptococcus online 2. almost all differ- entially abundant otus 78 were less abundant in individuals with crc than in healthy individuals.

analysis of the abundances of 28 bacterial otus were optimal for the differ- entiation between individuals with polyps and healthy controls for 12 otus the abundance in the oral cavity was used while for 16 otus the faecal abundance was used the model for the detection of crcs used 63 otus 29 oral otus and 34 stool otus.we were able to confirm the predictive value of the oral microbiota for crc screening by employing an in-house pipe- line using a lasso feature selection step and a rf classifier within a 10-fold cv pipeline see online this methodology using the default probability threshold and when applied to the oral swab microbiota dataset yielded 74 sensitivity and 90 specificity auc 0.91 for the predic- tion of adenomas and 98 sensitivity and 70 specificity auc 0.96 for the prediction of crc respectively.

crc colorectal cancer fpr false-positive rate tpr true-positive rate.bacteria have also been linked to an inflammatory host response and accelerated progression of crc.our analysis focused on the 17 otus that were shared between the oral cavity and crc and polyp samples that is otus that were detected in 37 of both tissue samples and oral swabs.

bacteria of these two cags were significantly more abundant both on and off the tumour compared with healthy controls .additionally we analysed oral bacterial networks detected across different disease stages and different sample types that is in 1 oral swabs 2 in undiseased tissue from individ- uals with crc and polyps 3 in tissue from healthy controls4 in stool from individuals with crc and 5 in stool from healthy controls.

strikingly the bacterial networks detected on crc biopsies  and  were similar in oral swabs  undiseased tissue samples from individuals with crc and colonic polyps .

moreover similar networks of bacterial otus from the oral cavity were also found in tissue samples from healthy individuals  indicating that these networks exist prior to the development of crc and could theoretically be involved in the initiation of crc.
