results indicate that women with preterm delivery outcomes tend to have lesser diversity in their vaginal microbiome during their first 15-20 weeks of pregnancy as compared to women with term delivery outcomes.

after approximately 20 weeks of pregnancy the vaginal microbiome diversity in case of both term and preterm outcomes appear to converge and remain more or less stable in the remaining weeks of pregnancy.the observed temporal differences with respect to shannon diversity between microbial communities in vaginal samples taken from subjects with term or preterm delivery outcomes indicate the possibility of employ- ing a suitable diversity metric that can effectively capture the microbial community structure in early weeks of pregnancy and can therefore be potentially employed as a screeningdiagnostic marker for predicting preterm delivery risk.

in each set two-thirds of samples were ran- domly selected and used as a 'training corpus' for determining an optimal threshold value of tcs metric that would provide maximal separation quantified in terms of mcc between the microbiome samples correspond- ing to preterm case delivery and term control delivery outcomes.

on a different note early and more importantly 'accurate' prediction also finds application in identifyingrecruiting a cohort of high-risk subjects willing to par- ticipate in clinical trials of novel intervention techniques that reduce the risk of preterm delivery outcomes and associated complications.in summary this work explores and validates the utility of vaginal microbiome diversity in enabling 'early' prediction of preterm delivery outcomes.

a perfect mcc value of 1 indicates com- plete separation between the microbiome samples corresponding to the preterm delivery and the term delivery.

existing physicalbiochemical markers for predicting preterm birth risk are mostly suited for application at midlate pregnancy stages thereby leaving very short time between diagnosis and delivery for adopting appropriate intervention strategies.

recent studies indicating correlations between prefull-term delivery and the composition of vaginal microbiota in pregnant women have opened new diagnostic possibilities.

in this study we performed a thorough meta-analysis of vaginal microbiome datasets to evaluate the utility of popular diversity and inequality measures for predicting at an early stage the risk of preterm delivery.

the metric enables 'early' and highly accurate prediction of preterm delivery outcomes and can potentially be deployed in clinical settings for preterm birth risk-assessment.

overall these trends highlight the urgent need for greater international attention on developing improved methods for diagnosis prevention and management of preterm births.the entire cascade of patho-physiologic events that cause a preterm delivery ptd is not completely under- stood till date.

given this context diagnostic markers physical andor biochemical that can accurately indicate at an early stage of preg- nancy the possibility of progression towards a preterm delivery outcome assume a lot of significance.
