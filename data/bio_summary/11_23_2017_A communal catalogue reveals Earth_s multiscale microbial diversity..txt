For a given cluster of tag sequences T phylogenetic subtree or taxonomic group for example Firmicutes we then calculate cluster distribution vector asWT  WE1T ... WENT2where WE combined for all tag sequences in the sequence cluster is given byWET  meanWEBBT Clusters of tag sequences were defined in two ways first by partitioning using the taxonomic lineage information for the tag sequences second by maximum tiptotip branch length for nodes on the phylogenetic tree.

We generated sequence reads of 90-151 base pairs bp  Supplementary Table 1 totaling 2.2 billion sequences an average of 80000 sequences per sample.Sequence analysis and taxonomic profiling were done initially using the common approach of assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units OTUs clustered by sequence similarity to existing rRNA data bases.

As with unweighted UniFrac distance  clustering of samples using weighted UniFrac distance could be explained largely by environment.a250025002500200020002000150015001500100010001000500500500000100101102103104100101102103104100101102103104Observed tag sequences 90 bpObserved tag sequences 100 bpObserved tag sequences 150 bpbExtended Data Figure 3  Sequence length effects on observed diversity patterns.

We therefore used a referencefree method Deblur to remove suspected error sequences and provide singlenucleotide resolution 'subOTUs' also known as 'amplicon sequence variants' here called 'tag sequences' or simply 'sequences'.

Because Deblur tag sequences for a given metaanalysis must be the same length in each sample and some of the EMP studies have read lengths of 90 bp we trimmed all sequences to 90 bp for this meta analysis.

Because exact sequences are stable identifiers unlike OTUs they can be compared to any 16S rRNA or genomic data base now and in the future thereby promoting reusability.Microbial ecology without OTU clusteringWhile earlier largescale 16S rRNA amplicon studies adopted OTU clustering approaches in part out of concern that erroneous reads would dominate diversity assessments patterns of prevalence presence- absence in our results suggest that Deblur error removal produced ecologically informative sequences without clustering.

After rarefying to 5000 sequences per sample a total of 307572 unique sequences were contained in the 96 studies and 23828 samples of the 'QCfiltered' Deblur 90bp observation table.

Although contamination remains an issue in microbiome studies most of the very highly abundant and prevalent sequences here had higher mean relative abundances among samples than among notemplate controls Supplementary Table 3 suggesting that they did not originate from reagents.Matches between our sequences and existing 16S rRNA gene reference databases highlight the novelty captured by the EMP.

We conclude that environment specificity is best captured by individual 16S rRNA sequences below the typical threshold defining microbial species 97 identity of the 16S rRNA gene.The EMP dataset provides the ability to track individual sequences across the Earth's microbial communities.
