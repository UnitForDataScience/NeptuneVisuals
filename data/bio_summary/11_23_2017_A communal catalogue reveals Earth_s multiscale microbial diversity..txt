we generated sequence reads of 90-151 base pairs bp  supplementary table 1 totaling 2.2 billion sequences an average of 80000 sequences per sample.sequence analysis and taxonomic profiling were done initially using the common approach of assigning sequences to operational taxonomic units otus clustered by sequence similarity to existing rrna data bases.

principal coordinates pc1 versus pc2 and pc1 versus pc3 are shown coloured by empo levels2 and 3. as with unweighted unifrac distance  clustering of samples using weighted unifrac distance could be explained largely by environment.a250025002500200020002000150015001500100010001000500500500000100101102103104100101102103104100101102103104observed tag sequences 90 bpobserved tag sequences 100 bpobserved tag sequences 150 bpbextended data figure 3  sequence length effects on observed diversity patterns.

we therefore used a referencefree method deblur to remove suspected error sequences and provide singlenucleotide resolution 'subotus' also known as 'amplicon sequence variants' here called 'tag sequences' or simply 'sequences'.

because deblur tag sequences for a given metaanalysis must be the same length in each sample and some of the emp studies have read lengths of 90 bp we trimmed all sequences to 90 bp for this meta analysis.

because exact sequences are stable identifiers unlike otus they can be compared to any 16s rrna or genomic data base now and in the future thereby promoting reusability.microbial ecology without otu clusteringwhile earlier largescale 16s rrna amplicon studies adopted otu clustering approaches in part out of concern that erroneous reads would dominate diversity assessments patterns of prevalence presence- absence in our results suggest that deblur error removal produced ecologically informative sequences without clustering.

after rarefying to 5000 sequences per sample a total of 307572 unique sequences were contained in the 96 studies and 23828 samples of the 'qcfiltered' deblur 90bp observation table.

although contamination remains an issue in microbiome studies most of the very highly abundant and prevalent sequences here had higher mean relative abundances among samples than among notemplate controls supplementary table 3 suggesting that they did not originate from reagents.matches between our sequences and existing 16s rrna gene reference databases highlight the novelty captured by the emp.

we conclude that environment specificity is best captured by individual 16s rrna sequences below the typical threshold defining microbial species 97 identity of the 16s rrna gene.the emp dataset provides the ability to track individual sequences across the earth's microbial communities.

from this we generated 'emp trading cards' which promote explora tion of the dataset and here highlight the distribution patterns of three prevalent or environmentcorrelated tag sequences   supplementary table 3. the entire emp catalogue can be que ried using the redbiom software with commandline   and webbased  interfaces to find samples based on sequences taxa or sample meta data and to export selected sample data and metadata instructions at .

to compare the unique sequence diversity in this study to that in existing databases sequences from the complete deblur 90bp observation table were compared to the set of unique fulllength sequences from greengenes 13.8 and the noneukaryotic fraction of silva 128 data bases using the opensource sequence search tool vsearchin global alignment search mode requiring 100 similarity across the query sequence and allowing multiple 100 reference matches.prevalence as a function of sequencing depth.

the sepp method uses hmmerinternally for aligning each deblurred sequence to a reference greengenes alignment gg135ssualign99pfiltered.fasta with 99 threshold for clustering resulting in 203452 tag sequences and dividing the reference alignment to subsets with a thousand sequences each.

to reduce the effect of discretization on the entropy calculation in both analyses clusters of tag sequences were included in the analysis only if they had a minimum of 20 tag sequences.

for unique tag sequences that is a branch length threshold of 0.0 sequences were required to be found in a minimum of 10 samples.
