Both nisin and MON dramatically reduced gas and methane production compared with NC P  0.05 with MON resulting in the lowest gas production while NI5 leading to the lowest methane production.

Nisin significantly increased ammonia concentration P  0.05 in a dose-dependent manner whereas MON had no effect.Compared with NC both MON and nisin significantly increased culture pH.

Both MON and nisin reduced concentrations of total VFA acetate butyrate valerate and acetatepropionate ratio P  0.05 but increased propionate concentration with MON resulting in a greater than nisin.

Overall the results indicate that MON and nisin showed different impacts on dry matter digestibility ammonia production and VFA profiles especially BCVFA profiles.Effects of Nisin and Monensin on Rumen Microbial PopulationsQuantitative real-time PCR showed that both MON and nisin significantly reduced P  0.05 the population of total bacteria and methanogens compared with NC .

Both MON and nisin also significantly reduced the population of fungi P  0.05 with the greatest reduction observed for MON followed by NI5 and NI1.

The HAB quantified C. aminophilum and C. sticklandii which have been shown previously to be sensitive to MON and nisin responded differently to MON and nisin.

Compared to that of NC the population of C. aminophilum was increased P  0.05 by both MON and nisin  while that of C. sticklandii was decreased by MON but increased by nisin P  0.05.

The results indicate that MON and nisin showed different effects on the populations of some major rumen microbes.Effects of Nisin and Monensin on Rumen Bacterial CommunitiesThe effects of nisin and MON addition on the alpha diversity measurements of the ruminal bacterial community are summarized in .

Both MON and nisin significantly reduced Shannon diversity index and increased the Simpson index compared with NC P  0.05 but the reduction or increase magnitudes were greater for MON than for nisin P  0.05.

The ACE and Chao 1 estimates of richness were not influenced by MON or nisin P  0.05.In order to understand the impacts of MON and nisin on the overall rumen bacterial community PCA analysis was performed .
