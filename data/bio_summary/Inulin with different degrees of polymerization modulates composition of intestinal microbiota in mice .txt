PCoA score plots based on different groups a FH group b FM group c FL group d IH group e IM group and f IL group respectively.

e. Actinobacteria increased significantly from 0.11 to 3.79 P  0.05 in high dose of FOS FH group and Actinobac- teria increased from 0.06 to 2.01 P  0.05 in high dose of inulin IH group.

Compared to higher dose the low dose of FOS and inulin could hardly reach the distal colon and then producing only a small amount of beneficial metabolites thereby resulting in little change in bacterial composition and intestine microen- vironment.Interestingly although Bacteroides vulgatus cannot use FOS and inulin its abundance was increased in high dose groups.

The increasing extent was stronger in FOS group compared to in- ulin group in high dose groups Fig.

Additionally Lactobacillaceae in high dose groups was dramatically increased whereas no significant change was observed in low dose groups after FOS and inulin treatments Fig.

Significant changes were observed in high dose and middle dose groups.
