It should be noted that the term 'soil' in the context of microbiome studies may be used to refer to root zone soil rhizosphere soil or bulk soil where the latter is assumed to be largely free of direct root influenceand has higher diversity than rhizosphere soil  .

For consistency research cited in this review concerning soil microbiomes was conducted on non-plant associated bulk soil except where noted however it is worth noting that in some environments the methodology of bulk soil collection occasionally necessitates removal of root tissue from soil samples and therefore presence of root tissue may present a potential confounding factor in such analyses.

A study of four distinct rice genotypes in three soil types again found drought to be a significant factor and that directionality in drought responses in rhizosphere and root endosphere bacterial communities were largely conserved between soil types   implicating the plant host as an important player in such responses.Whether as a consequence of recruiting from drought- affected soil communities or due to endophytic communities experiencing similar responses to those in the exterior environment it has been shown that changes in relative abundance in the root microbiome are largely similar to those seen in soil.

Unfortunately while in such studies soil moisture is indeed significantly different between seasons presumably there are a number of environmental variables that similarly differ between seasons that represent confounding factors that cannotbe separated from soil moisture such as atmospheric CO2 and soil temperature both of which are confirmed to exert effects on soil bacterial communities    .

Plants recruit bacteria from soil communities and enrich for a host-specific root endophytic community typically of decreased diversity  .However this 'starting inoculum' of the soil microbiome will be affected by drought - both directly by selection for desiccation- tolerant taxa as well as indirectly through altered soil chemistry and diffusion rates.

To complicate matters further each of these factors can influence the others altered soil nutrient cycles and resulting shifts in the soil microbiome under drought will in turn have implications for plant health as plants depend on bacterial activity to make soil nutrients bioavailable.

Similarly drought-induced changes in plant exudate profiles can alter the composition and activity of the surrounding soil microbiome promoting further alterations to soil geochemistry that in turn alter magnitude and directionality of soil community shifts.

Here we summarize the observed trends in microbial biomass diversity composition and activity in soil microbial communities following drought treatment and describe potential causes of these shifts focusing first on potentially direct causes due to a loss of soil moisture and second on indirect causes mediated through changes in soil physicochemistry.In general total bacterial biomass has been observed to go down under drought     as well as in more arid soils along a precipitation gradient   as a consequence of resource limitation.

In another study when fertilizer was applied to soil plots that were subsequently exposed to drought there were vast increases in soil ammonium and nitrate which were hypothesized as being a result of reduced nitrification activity in soil microbes  .

In the future additional research to identify missing environmental parameters that play roles in shaping soil microbiomes under drought is needed.PLANT RESPONSES TO DROUGHTWhile changes in the surrounding soil chemistry and soil microbiome composition and activity can be expected to alter the available pool of bacteria from which plants recruit endophytic communities drought-induced changes in plant physiology and biochemistry are perhaps even more influential on root microbiome dynamics.
