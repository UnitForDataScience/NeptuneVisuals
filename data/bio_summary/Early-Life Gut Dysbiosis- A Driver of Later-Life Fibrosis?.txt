2253COMMENTARYkey pathogenic cell types pathways and mediators and for evaluating the efficacy and mechanism of action of novel therapies.In its earliest stage SSc is domi- nated by autoimmune and inflamma- tory features with tissue infiltration with activated T and B cells mono- cytes macrophages innate lymphoid cells and dendritic cells  .

In particular widely used rodent models of skin and lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin or other noxiousagents typically cause only localized and self-limited fibrosis do not generate disease-specific autoanti- bodies and lack the microvascular features of SSc.

Although the mice mount an anti-topoisomerase-I anti- body response similar to patients with SSc fibrosis preceded the appearance of these antibodies excluding their direct role in fibrosis initiation though perhaps not in its persistence.

The mecha- nistic links between the microbial alter- ations and increased fibrosis and potential direct connections between the gut microbiome and the skin   or the lung   or the effect of antibiotic by it- self on lung and skin fibrosis were not explored.

Despite encouraging recent clinical trials with mycophenolate mofetil autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and drugs targeting transforming growth factor-b IL-6 CD20B cells cannabinoid receptors and others effective disease-modifying therapy for SSc and other forms of fibrosis remains elusive.

The authors performed immu- nization with dendritic cells loaded with the topoisomerase-I peptide to induce immunity inflammation and skin and lung fibrosis in BALBc mice.

To maximize the value of preclinical SSc models whether for understanding pathogenesis or evalu- ating the efficacy and mode of action of novel therapies a combination strategy using multiple complementary disease models is recommended  .present an inter- esting and potentially informative novel approach to model SSc predicated on the putative roles of dendritic cells and topoisomerase-I-specific autoim- munity.

found that early-life antibiotic exposure resulted in increased later-life fibrosis in the skin and lungs.
