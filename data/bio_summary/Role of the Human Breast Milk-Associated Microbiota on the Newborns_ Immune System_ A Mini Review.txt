The main components of human milk are i macronutrients such as protein fat and lactose which concentration depends on the stage of lactation and maternal characteristics ii micronutrients including vitamins A B1 B2 B12 and D that vary in human milk in relation to maternal diet and body stores iii growth factor which are strongly active on the endocrine system nervous system vasculature and intestinal tract iv immunological factors which are essential to defend the newborn from inflammation and infection and for this reason the early milk is rich in immune components that can support infants in the first delicate stages of their life v the microbiota which comprises more than 200 different bacterial species with a pivotal role in the formation of the newborn's first gut microbiota  .The aim of the present Mini Review is to highlight the specific and fundamental role of human milk-associated bacteria in modulating and influencing the newborns' immune system during their life.THE MILK MICROBIOTA AND THE NEWBORN'S IMMUNE SYSTEMThe specific mechanisms that lead to the formation of the human milk microbiota are still unknown however there are different hypothesis that can explain the origin of milk- associated bacteria.

Interestingly human milk contained also a great number of intestinal bacteria which may spread from the maternal intestinal environment by a mechanism involving dendritic cells DCs and CD18 cells   these cellular types would be able to capture intestinal microorganisms from the gut lumen and transfer them to lactating mammary glands by means of translocation which results to be increased during late pregnancy and lactation  .

The microbiota associated to the human breast milk contributes to create the initial intestinal microbiota of infants having also a pivotal role in modulating and influencing the newborns' immune system.

The Auto Contractive Map for instance is a promising analytical methodology based on artificial neural network that can elucidate the specific role of bacteria contained in the breast milk in modulating the infants' immunological response.Keywords human milk milk microbiota colostrum immunomodulation newborn's immune system AutoCMINTRODUCTIONThe human milk is a rich and complete nourishment that is essential for the correct development of the infant's organism  .The first milk produced by mothers after the delivery is called colostrum and it is biochemically and functionally different from the mature milk  .

Consequently the milk microbiota can shape the initial intestinal microbiome of newborns together with the maternal intestinal and vaginal microorganisms that are ingested by the neonate during the passage through the birth canal  .

The constant intake during lactation of bacteria contained in the human milk leads to the formation of a transient intestinal microbiota that deeply impacts on thenewborn's development acting mainly on the maturation of his immune system  .

Moreover breast-fed newborns have shown to possess a more stable intestinal bacterial population and a well-balanced mucosal immune response if compared to the formula-fed ones     indeed a healthy intestinal microbiota can induce specific T cell responses and modulate substrates oxidation decreasing the impact of autoimmune and allergic diseases not only during childhood but also in adulthood    .

It has been shown that in germ-free mice the villus capillaries develop poorly during weaning and remained in this condition also during adulthood suggesting that the intestinal microbiota is fundamental for intestinal blood vessel to be completely developed  .

Indeed germ-free animals cannot developCorrect balancing between Th1 and Th2 response tolerance due to the lack of intestinal bacteria and only theadequate colonization of newborns' gut can lead to a completeDevelopment of oral tolerance Stimulation of Peyer's patches bacteria may stimulate the release of specific cytokines that create a balanced microenvironment suitable for naive Th0 cells to ripen toward Th1 cell type  .Bacteroides is a bacterial genus that is very abundant in human colostrum and it may have a main role in the early stages of newborns' gut colonization as reported by .

Infants are daily exposed to specific antigens part of which belong directly to the human milk microbiota and that can translocate across the intestinal barrier being involved in the presentation by antigen-presenting cells to T lymphocytes.
