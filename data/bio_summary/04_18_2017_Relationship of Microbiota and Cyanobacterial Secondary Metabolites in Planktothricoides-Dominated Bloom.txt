This suggested that bacterial community near the bottom waters had greater evenness compared to the surface community which was largely dominated by a few cyanobacterial OTUs that were more abundant.Observations from the two-dimensional nMDS plot that showed the distribution of samples and OTUs demonstrated a small but significant distinction between surface and bottom communities a.

This study aims to i determine the bacterial community associated with Planktothricoides bloom ii investigate diel and vertical variations of physiochemical variables cyanobacterial metabolites and microbial community and iii identify potential metabolite producers using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing combined with correlation analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODSSite Description and Sampling.

We speculate that this could be due to the core functions of the cyanobacterial bloom associated community being conserved across a wide variety of taxa as demonstrated in several studies.Further investigation on the metagenomes of cyanobacterial blooms of other dominant species could shed light on the functional association of the bacterial consortium in cyanobacteria-dominant ecology.Vertical stratification of the bacterial community was alsodemonstrated although not to a large extent.

Moving down the water column relative abundance of Sphingomonadaceae Proteobacteria Chitinophagaceae Cytophagaceae Bacterio- detes and Acidimicrobiaceae Actinobacteria were enriched among non-Cyanobacterial taxa in the community composition paired t test P  0.05 which is in agreement with theirnatural habitats of soil sediment or deep water layers.

Having a total catchment area of 100 km2 a water body surface area of 2.4 km2 and an average depth of nearly 4 m the water body is the largest multifunctional reservoir in Singapore providing recreation flood control and water storage to the country.

Recently more studies have focused on the bacterial community that thrives alongside the cyanobacterial popula- tion.Indeed heterotrophic bacteria can be influenced by biotic and abiotic factors induced by blooms such as nutrientsReceived November 26 2016RevisedMarch 7 2017Accepted March 27 2017Published March 27 2017c 2017 American Chemical Society4199DOI Riding on the development of high-throughput sequencing HTS information regarding bacterial groups and microbial diversity in bloom-affected water bodies is fast expanding but the existing literatures report only a few genera such as Microcystis Anabaena and Cylindrospermopsis.

Our study showed that including 16S rRNA-based taxonomic classification in routine water quality monitoring could be useful in identifying candidate biological sources of contaminants.qPCR and ddPCR are popular quantitative tools in ecological studies that enumerate absolute abundance of specific taxa or functional genes whereas high-throughput amplicon sequencing is capable of revealing the overall structure of the community in their respective proportions.However one of the major concerns of amplicon sequencing in diversity studies is the skewness of data due to bias in multitemplate PCR reactions regardless of the sequencing depth.The use of bothamplicon sequencing and of qPCR and ddPCR in this study allowed the evaluation of HTS performance in estimating population dynamics.

Although 16S rRNA gene is by the far the most-popular approach to study the diversity and abundance of bacterial community several intrinsic limi- tations such as bias in DNA extraction methodselectivity of primer choice of target hypervariable regions and availability of reference sequencescould lead to significantdifference to both 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCRresults.
