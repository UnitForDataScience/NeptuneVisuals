In all of the 47 species isolated using culture-dependent methods and the 51 species isolated using culture-independent methods only five species were found from the same woman using both techniques .

Thus culture-independent methods have demonstrated greater vaginal microbial diversity than previously recognized andhave identified under-documented species such as Lacto- bacillus iners and Atopobium vaginae as important constitu- ents of the vaginal microbiome worldwide .We have previously used culture methods to characterize the vaginal microbiome in Mysore .

A total of 47 spe- cies representing 26 unique species were obtained using culture-dependent methods and a total of 51 species repre- senting 27 distinct species were isolated using culture-inde- pendent methods .

Here we not only identified L. iners in the vaginal microflora in South Indian women but we found it to be the most prevalent species when using molecular approaches.Another notable strength of culture-independent methods was that it was better at detecting clinically relevant non- Lactobacillus species known to be associated with BV than traditional culture methods.

One annotated species found using culture-dependent methods was classified as 'other'.to lack of growth on culture or failure during 16S rDNA PCR which could be a source of potential bias in the study.Despite these limitations this study is the first to molecular methods to characterize the vaginal microflora among women of reproductive age in India.

BV is a risk factor for sexually transmitted infections including HIV .While vaginal microflora were traditionally characterized using cultivation methods today cultivation-independent molecular approaches are favored because certain vaginal microflora are not amenable to culturing .

We have clearly dem- onstrated the utility of using molecular approaches to char- acterize vaginal microbial diversity over the traditional culturing methods previously used in this setting.Funding informationDrs Pandya Riley and Madhivanan received support from the National Institutes of Health Global Health Equity Scholars Program R25 TW009338.AcknowledgementsFor their generous assistance on this project the authors would like to thank Poornima Jaykrishna Fazila Begum Savitha Gowda Chan- dramani Meena and Rani Chinnappa at Public Health Research Insti- tute of India without whose support this study could not have been carried out and all women in the study for their participation.Conflicts of interestThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.ReferencesAroutcheva A Gariti D Simon M Shott S Faro J et al.
