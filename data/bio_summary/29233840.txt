Fecal samples from PHTS cancer patients had relatively more abundant operational taxonomic units OTUs from family Rikenellaceae and unclassified members of Clostridia compared to those from non-cancer patients whereas families Peptostreptococcaceae Enterobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae represented relatively more abundant OTUs among fecal samples from PHTS non-cancer patients.

Due to this cut-off 2 of the 31 samples were excluded from further analyses thus 16 samples from PHTS patients with a history of cancer and 13 from PHTS patients without a history of cancer were used for the final analysis.Table 1 Demographic characteristics of study PHTS patients with and without cancer history.Values are presented as means -s.d.

Firmicutes was most dominant 46.2 followed by Bacteroidetes 19.6 Proteobacteria 12.0 Actinobacteria 10.6Fusobacteria 5.9 Candidatus Saccharibacteria 2.5 Spirochaetes 1.9 and three marginal phyla.Two cancer patients and one non-cancer patient did not provide oral wash samples thus 15 samples from PHTS patients with cancer and 14 from patients without cancer were used in the analysis.

Eleven bacterial phyla were detected Firmicutes was most dominant 58.8 then Bacteroidetes 16.4 Actinobacteria 10.7 Proteobacteria 10.5 Fusobacteria 1.8 and six marginal phyla.One cancer patient and three non-cancer patients did not provide urine samples thus 16 samples derived from patients with cancer and 12 from patients without cancer were used in the final analysis.

Comparison of oral wash and urine samples of PHTS patients with vs without cancer revealed no major shifts in diversity or community structure.Consistent with previous reports serving as positive controls we found that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were by far the most dominant phyla among human gut microbiota   and that Firmicutes predominated in both the oral cavity andthe male and female urinary tract  .We did not find any significant difference in alpha diversity in fecal samples from PHTS patients with compared to those without component cancers in contrast with previous reports of decreased diversity in cancer patients .

It is possible that the gut microbiome exerts a carcinogenic effect on the breast tissue via its role in estrogen metabolism future microbiome studies could include an analysis of urine estrogen levels in PHTS patients with and without breast cancer to investigate this possibility.Among fecal samples from cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients we report relatively increased abundance of family Rikenellaceae whose members are gram-negative non-motile anaerobes  reported to be enriched in mice consuming a high-fat diet  and diabetic mice .

Specifically we wished to explore whether the microbial communities of the gut oral cavity and urinary tract would differ in diversity and overall composition between PHTS patients with and without component cancers.Materials and methodsPatient enrollment and sample collectionWith approval from our Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects' Protection and after written informedconsent we contacted the subset of patients in our longitudinal Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer study protocol 8458-PTEN with identified pathogenic germline mutations in the PTEN gene.

Demographics clinical history and diet and lifestyle information were collected prospectively through completion of a questionnaire at the time of enrollment  see section on given at the end of this article.From each patient we obtained a midstream clean- catch urine specimen a saline oral rinse sample and a stool sample at the time of written consent from patients seen in our multidisciplinary PTEN clinic and by mail from patients not seen in clinic.Urine was centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min.

All patients returned a questionnaire assessing demographic and clinical characteristics.Twelve of the 17 cancer patients had a history of breast cancer 71 seven of thyroid 41 five of kidney 29 three of skin 18 two of endometrial 12 and one of colon cancer 6.

PHTS patients with a history of cancer had a higher mean age than non- cancer PHTS patients 56 vs 34 P  0.0002.
