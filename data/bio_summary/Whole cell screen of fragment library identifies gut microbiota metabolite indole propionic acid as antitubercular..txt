To what extent the observed in vivo activity of IPA is due to its direct antibacterial activity and its host immune-modulatory function remains to be determined.Taken together we screened a library of 1000 fragment-like molecules for whole- cell activity against M. tuberculosis and found that one unoptimized fragment hit IPA displayed in vivo tolerability and exposure as well as activity in a mouse model of tuberculosis.

The plasma of control mice that did not receive IPA contained approximately 300 to 1000 ngml of endogenous IPA see Discussion.

The most attractive hit based on M. tuberculosis whole-cell activity and in vitro tolerability fragment F1 or 3-1H-indol-3- ylpropanoic acid also known as indole propionic acid IPA molecular mass 189 gmol logarithm of partition coefficient between n-octanol and water 2.15 hydrogen bond acceptor 2 hydrogen bond donor 2 polar surface area 53 A  was selected for acute toxicity testing in mice.

The most potent hit indole propionic acid IPA 3-1H-indol-3-ylpropanoic acid a metabolite produced by the gut microbiota was profiled in vivo.

In a mouse model of acute M. tuberculosis infection IPA reduced the bacterial load in the spleen 7-fold.

Our results suggest that IPA should be evaluated as an add-on to current regimens and that fragment libraries should be further explored to identify antimycobacterial lead candidates.KEYWORDS tuberculosis fragments indole propionic acid gut microbiotauberculosis TB remains a global health threat killing 1.34 million people in 2016 .

In vivo pharma- cokinetic profiling of IPA revealed adequate exposure relative to potency when 100 mgkg was delivered via the oral route  and 30 to 33 oral bioavailability see Table S1 in the supplemental material.
