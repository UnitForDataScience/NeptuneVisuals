We conclude that while EBC and PSB samples do not produce equivalent microbiota samples the study of the EBC micro- biota may still be of interest.KEYWORDS 16S rRNA EBC colistimethate sodium colistin lung microbiota respiratory microbiota sheephe study of the lung microbiota is a relatively new field in comparison to other areas of microbiota research.

The most abundant OTUs on average in the different sample types were as follows Staphylococcus equorum 10.7 Mannheimia 6.5 and Staph- ylococcus sciuri 5.6 in PSB samples Staphylococcus equorum 5.5 Neisseriaceae 4.7 and Paracoccus 4.3 in EBC samples from conscious sheep cons and Staphy- lococcus equorum 5.1 Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.7 and Peptostreptococcus an- aerobius 3.2 in EBC samples from anesthetized sheep anaes.PSB samples contain more bacterial DNA than EBC samples.

EBC samples from conscious and from anesthetized sheep are labeled EBC cons and EBC anaes respectively.

PSB samples contained significantly more bacterial DNA P  0.005 than any other respiratory sample type or control.0.182 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test however PSB samples contained significantly more DNA than both EBC cons P  0.002 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test and EBC anaes P  0.002 Wilcoxon signed-rank test samples.No significant clustering of EBC by sampling method.

EBC samples from conscious and anesthetized sheep are labeled EBC cons and EBC anaes respectively.

For both EBC cons and EBC anaes samples pre- and post- treatment samples did not differ significantly by bacterial community structure P FIG 4 PCoA graph showing the significantly separate clustering of EBC anaes and PSB samples from sheep P  0.011 by AMOVA which may be due to the difference in variation between the two sample types P  0.026 by HOMOVA.

EBC anaes and EBC cons samples did not cluster separately from one another.Studies examining the utility of EBC for identifying lung-colonizing microorganisms have shown variable results.

In this study we compared EBC samples collected from conscious sheep and from the same sheep under anes- thesia to PSB samples taken from four spatially disparate sites within the lungs.We then extended this to address whether EBC analysis has the capacity to detect changes in bacterial community compositions by attempting to directly manipulate the lung microbiota with an inhaled antibiotic colistimethate sodium CMS which is active against Gram-negative bacteria.

Since EBC samples from conscious sheep would be expected to include more bacteria from the upper respira- tory tract than EBC samples from anesthetized sheep it was expected that these two groups of samples would cluster separately from one another.

We compared PSB samples with EBC anaes samples as we hypothesized that these would be less likely to be contaminated by upper respiratory tract microbes than EBC cons samples.
