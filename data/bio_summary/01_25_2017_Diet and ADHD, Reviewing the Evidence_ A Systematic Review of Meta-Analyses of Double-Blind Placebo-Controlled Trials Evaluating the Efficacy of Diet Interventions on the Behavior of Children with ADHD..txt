in fact drug treatment effects in children with adhd are usually assessed using parent ratings which is considered an 'ecologically valid method of assessment' .based on the results depicted in figs  and we hypothesize that the results of the ffd studies using a diet design   could be applicable to the general population of children with adhd provided that parents are interested in diet treatment while the results of the challenge studies - would be applicable to children with adhd who are alleged to respond to foods.

b bias presented as percentages across all included studies.doi10.1371journal.pone.0169277.g005the five dbpc ffd studies were marginal one ffd study was an inpatient study and no parents were involved  in the second ffd study ready-made meals were supplied  and in the three ffd challenge studies the diet impact was limited to the challenges provided by the research team -.

the dbpc pufa studies differed in dosage and type of fatty acids either omega-3 omega-6 or a combination of both and in duration of supplementation  while the suboptimal diet applied in the ffd studies see  may also have affected the ffd results.differences in conclusions between our and previous reviewsunlike the conclusions of previous reviews on adhd and diet - our review suggests that there is convincing evidence for the effect of a ffd on adhd.

the outcomes of the sub-analyses are shown in  resulting in a decrease of the heterogeneity in the subgroups compared to the overall analysis.sub-analysis based on the ffd meta-analysis by sonuga-barke et al.the ffd meta-analysis by sonuga-barke et al.

fourth it is conceivable that only parents interested in diet treatment will par- ticipate in a diet trial thus limiting the results of this review to children whose parents are receptive to a dietary approach of adhd.clinical implications and future researchour systematic review evaluating the results of all published meta-analyses including dbpc trials investigating the effect of diet interventions on adhd shows that the average ess are-0.05 to 0.17 pufa 0.08 to 0.44 afc and 0.51 to 0.80 ffd.

a short-term ffd fol- lowed by food challenges in children showing clinically relevant behavioral improvements diet responders eventually resulting in a personalized diet advice--would be achievable but may take at least one year   is considered burdensome       is feasible only in motivated families with good family structure  and would be easier to apply in younger children .

benton reported that the ffd consisted of lamb chicken potatoes rice banana apple and brassica foods chosen as they were unlikely to produce an adverse response but that the ffd might be adapted for each individual child .two meta-analyses evaluating either afc elimination  or pufa supplementation  referred to the previously conducted meta-analyses   while the ffd meta-analysis  did not mention the former ffd meta-analysis  see .

the differences in outcomes between diet types the quality of the evidence provided in the subgroup meta-analyses the differences in conclusions between our and previous reviews and the importance of addressing cis and heterogeneity is discussed below.differences in outcomes between diet typesshows that the ffd ess are considerably larger than the ess of afc and pufa which might be explained by inadequate blinding of the ffd an intervention eliminating many foods will conceivably be less easier to blind than afc and pufa which can be hidden in cookies candy bars or capsules.

the few-foods diet ffd and by supplement studies investigating the effects of vitamins minerals and poly- unsaturated fatty acids pufa on adhd .recent reviews on adhd and diet interventionsthe efficacy of diet treatments in adhd was recently evaluated in three reviews -.

did not report which studies were incorporated in the afc meta-analysis of eleven studies including hyperac- tive children only thus prohibiting further sub-analytic calculations only the sub-analytic results of the two ffd meta-analyses   are reported below.sub-analysis based on the ffd meta-analysis by bentonthe ffd meta-analysis by benton  published in 2007 resulted in i2  61 which is con- siderable.

indeed since 'adhd is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple causes that probably differ between individuals'  and interpersonal variability may be high when diet is concerned  differentiation between responders and non-responders and determination of response pre- dictors  are important to establish the clinical importance of an intervention for each individual child.quality of the evidence provided in the subgroup analysesthe bias results concerning blinding and attrition presented in  are commensurable with the trial quality ratings of the 5 dbpc ffd studies reported by sonuga-barke et al.

the results are presented in .discussionthe results of this systematic review conducted to synthesize meta-analytic results of diet interventions in children with adhd in order to determine the effectiveness of diet treat- ments on adhd show that the average ess of afc elimination and pufa supplementation are too small to contribute significantly to adhd treatment while the ffd ess are medium to large possibly offering novel treatment opportunities.

numbers of children included design results per rater and outcome measures are not provided for the 11 studies.the two ffd meta-analyses including the same five ffd studies reported the results of different raters.probably blinded assessments' meta-analysis.in one study more than half of the children in the pufa-group also received a multivitamin supplement .missing numbers of raters in this column used a variety of other rating scales.publication bias was not reported due to the small numbers of trials.doi10.1371journal.pone.0169277.t001ratings -0.05 95 ci -0.27-0.18 p  0.66 i2  0 teacher ratings and 0.16 95 ci 0.01- 0.31 p  0.04 i2  0 parent and teacher ratings.

however the three reviews show divergent conclusions i.e.there is evidence for a small effect of pufa on adhd while the potential effect of afc elimination remains unclear and more research is needed for a ffd  2 there is emerging consensus for the effect of food additives elimination concurrently providing a food additive list to be given to a patient while a one-week ffd is indicated in case of comorbid food allergy symptoms  and 3 none of the diet interventions are recommendable as adhd treatment .
