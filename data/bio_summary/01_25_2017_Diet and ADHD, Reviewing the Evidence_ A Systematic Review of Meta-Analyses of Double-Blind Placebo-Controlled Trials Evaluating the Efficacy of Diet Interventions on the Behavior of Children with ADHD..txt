B Bias presented as percentages across all included studies.doi10.1371journal.pone.0169277.g005the five DBPC FFD studies were marginal one FFD study was an inpatient study and no parents were involved  in the second FFD study ready-made meals were supplied  and in the three FFD challenge studies the diet impact was limited to the challenges provided by the research team -.

The outcomes of the sub-analyses are shown in  resulting in a decrease of the heterogeneity in the subgroups compared to the overall analysis.Sub-analysis based on the FFD meta-analysis by Sonuga-Barke et al.The FFD meta-analysis by Sonuga-Barke et al.

the DBPC PUFA studies differed in dosage and type of fatty acids either omega-3 omega-6 or a combination of both and in duration of supplementation  while the suboptimal diet applied in the FFD studies see  may also have affected the FFD results.Differences in conclusions between our and previous reviewsUnlike the conclusions of previous reviews on ADHD and diet - our review suggests that there is convincing evidence for the effect of a FFD on ADHD.

Benton reported that the FFD consisted of lamb chicken potatoes rice banana apple and brassica foods chosen as they were unlikely to produce an adverse response but that the FFD might be adapted for each individual child .Two meta-analyses evaluating either AFC elimination  or PUFA supplementation  referred to the previously conducted meta-analyses   while the FFD meta-analysis  did not mention the former FFD meta-analysis  see .

The differences in outcomes between diet types the quality of the evidence provided in the subgroup meta-analyses the differences in conclusions between our and previous reviews and the importance of addressing CIs and heterogeneity is discussed below.Differences in outcomes between diet typesshows that the FFD ESs are considerably larger than the ESs of AFC and PUFA which might be explained by inadequate blinding of the FFD an intervention eliminating many foods will conceivably be less easier to blind than AFC and PUFA which can be hidden in cookies candy bars or capsules.

Indeed since 'ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple causes that probably differ between individuals'  and interpersonal variability may be high when diet is concerned  differentiation between responders and non-responders and determination of response pre- dictors  are important to establish the clinical importance of an intervention for each individual child.Quality of the evidence provided in the subgroup analysesThe bias results concerning blinding and attrition presented in  are commensurable with the trial quality ratings of the 5 DBPC FFD studies reported by Sonuga-Barke et al.

the few-foods diet FFD and by supplement studies investigating the effects of vitamins minerals and poly- unsaturated fatty acids PUFA on ADHD .Recent reviews on ADHD and diet interventionsThe efficacy of diet treatments in ADHD was recently evaluated in three reviews -.

Fourth it is conceivable that only parents interested in diet treatment will par- ticipate in a diet trial thus limiting the results of this review to children whose parents are receptive to a dietary approach of ADHD.Clinical implications and future researchOur systematic review evaluating the results of all published meta-analyses including DBPC trials investigating the effect of diet interventions on ADHD shows that the average ESs are-0.05 to 0.17 PUFA 0.08 to 0.44 AFC and 0.51 to 0.80 FFD.

did not report which studies were incorporated in the AFC meta-analysis of eleven studies including hyperac- tive children only thus prohibiting further sub-analytic calculations only the sub-analytic results of the two FFD meta-analyses   are reported below.Sub-analysis based on the FFD meta-analysis by BentonThe FFD meta-analysis by Benton  published in 2007 resulted in I2  61 which is con- siderable.

However the three reviews show divergent conclusions i.e.there is evidence for a small effect of PUFA on ADHD while the potential effect of AFC elimination remains unclear and more research is needed for a FFD  2 there is emerging consensus for the effect of food additives elimination concurrently providing a food additive list to be given to a patient while a one-week FFD is indicated in case of comorbid food allergy symptoms  and 3 none of the diet interventions are recommendable as ADHD treatment .
