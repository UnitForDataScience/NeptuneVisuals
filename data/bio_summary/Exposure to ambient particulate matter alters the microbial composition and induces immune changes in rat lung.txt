Recent studieshave linked changes in the lung microbiome to human disease but the effects of PM on the lung microbiome are largely unknown .Research using culture-independent sequence-based techniques such as 16S ribosomal RNA microarrays has shown that the lungs are not sterile There is a growing understanding that the lung microbiome plays a critical role in health and disease In addition the lung microbiome community structure may not only reflect the presence of disease but also be associated with disease features and severity  adding to the com- plexity of characterizing polymicrobial-host interactions in the lung and their potential mechanistic relationship to Correspondence 1State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University 151 Yanjiang Road Guangzhou 510120 ChinaFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlechronic respiratory diseases.

Moreover some alterations in bacterial composition were found in the lungs of rats exposed to BMF or MVE supporting the hypothesis that BMF and MVE exposure can result in various COPD phenotypes .Exposure to ambient PM also affects innate and adap- tive immune responses in the rat lung and this may be partly explained by disordered microbial communities.

The BMF was generated by a burn stove 500 w for 10 min and the smoke was sent into the animal exposure room through a piston pump 5 Lmin.Exposure to MVE A Wuyang model WY48QT-2 1.6- Kw 125-cm3 one-cylinder four-cycle gasoline-powered motorcycle Guangzhou China was used as the MVE source.

Combined with our previ- ous findings from a 6-month exposure  the results indicate that BMF and MVE exposure alters the lung microbiome before lung morphometric changes occur.

A comparison of the BMF and MVE groups showed a higher prevalence of ClostridiaceaeHyphomonadaceae Brocadiaceae Veillonellaceae and Mycobacteriaceae in the BMF group while Pseudomona- daceae were more prevalent in the MVE group Fig.

Im- munoglobulin concentrations were expressed as mgmL of the BALF supernatant.Effects of PM exposure on lung morphologyFigure  shows that the Lm values in the lungs of rats exposed to BMF and MVE for 4 weeks did not differ from those of rats exposed to clean air.

We found that samples from the BMF and MVE groups contained higher bacterial abundances and bacterial diversity than samples from the control group based on the OTU numbers and alpha diversity supporting the study of Yu and colleagues who demonstrated that microbiota taxonomic alpha diver- sity increases with environmental exposures and that spe- cific aspects of the lung microbiota are related to different sources of PM .

Exposure to PM stimulates the bone marrow promoting the release of monocytes and their recruit- ment into the lung where they subsequently differen- tiate into tissue and alveolar macrophages In our study AMs from the BMF and MVE exposure groups displayed an increased capacity to phagocytose bac- teria.

The rats in the MVE group were exposed to PM for two 2-h exposure periods 5 days per week for 4 weeks.Sample preparation and isolation of alveolar macrophages AMsRats were sacrificed after the 4-week exposure period day 29 using pentobarbitone Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis MO USA administered by intra-peritoneal injection according to body weight 90 mgkg.

The variations in both the BMF exposure room and the MVE exposure room are depicted in Fig.
