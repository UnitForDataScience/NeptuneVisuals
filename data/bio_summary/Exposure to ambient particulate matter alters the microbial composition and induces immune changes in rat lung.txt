moreover some alterations in bacterial composition were found in the lungs of rats exposed to bmf or mve supporting the hypothesis that bmf and mve exposure can result in various copd phenotypes .exposure to ambient pm also affects innate and adap- tive immune responses in the rat lung and this may be partly explained by disordered microbial communities.

recent studieshave linked changes in the lung microbiome to human disease but the effects of pm on the lung microbiome are largely unknown .research using culture-independent sequence-based techniques such as 16s ribosomal rna microarrays has shown that the lungs are not sterile there is a growing understanding that the lung microbiome plays a critical role in health and disease in addition the lung microbiome community structure may not only reflect the presence of disease but also be associated with disease features and severity  adding to the com- plexity of characterizing polymicrobial-host interactions in the lung and their potential mechanistic relationship to correspondence 1state key laboratory of respiratory disease the first affiliated hospital of guangzhou medical university 151 yanjiang road guangzhou 510120 chinafull list of author information is available at the end of the articlechronic respiratory diseases.

inhaled ambient pm represents important environmental exposures that have been linked to death and disease  emerging epidemiological evidence also suggests that these expo- sures increase the risks of respiratory diseases - research on pm has mostly focused on the lung inflam- matory response to inhalation as this is considered the primary impact of pm exposure -.

how- ever our results were obtained from in vivo experi- ments and high-level pm exposures in vitro may not represent biological conditions in an ambient air- polluted environment  macrophage phagocytic activity increases with increasing pm concentrations but will be impaired when the phagocytic particles exceed 60 of the intracellular volume overloading the macrophages few data are available on the effects of ambient pm on immune functions in the lung.

some work on pm has centered on alterations in immunoglobulin produc- tion we found that pm exposure increased total iga levels in balf samples from both the bmf and mve exposure groups fig.

furthermore defining the composition of the resident microbiome and how microbial communities shift with exposure may help to explain their role in responding to inhaled particulate matter.conclusionthis study found that a short-term pm exposure can alter the microbial composition and induce immune changes in the rat lung.abbreviationsam alveolar macrophages balf bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bmf biomass fuel mfi median fluorescence intensity mve motor vehicle exhaustotu operational taxonomic unit pm particulate matteracknowledgementswe thank dr. binwei hao and jinding pu for processing the samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

we found that samples from the bmf and mve groups contained higher bacterial abundances and bacterial diversity than samples from the control group based on the otu numbers and alpha diversity supporting the study of yu and colleagues who demonstrated that microbiota taxonomic alpha diver- sity increases with environmental exposures and that spe- cific aspects of the lung microbiota are related to different sources of pm .

exposure to pm stimulates the bone marrow promoting the release of monocytes and their recruit- ment into the lung where they subsequently differen- tiate into tissue and alveolar macrophages in our study ams from the bmf and mve exposure groups displayed an increased capacity to phagocytose bac- teria.

a comparison of the bmf and mve groups showed a higher prevalence of clostridiaceaehyphomonadaceae brocadiaceae veillonellaceae and mycobacteriaceae in the bmf group while pseudomona- daceae were more prevalent in the mve group fig.

combined with our previ- ous findings from a 6-month exposure  the results indicate that bmf and mve exposure alters the lung microbiome before lung morphometric changes occur.

in general our study and the published literature show alterations in the adaptive immune response in rodent lungs following a pm exposure.in summary we demonstrated that a short-term pm exposure can alter the microbial composition and affect innate and adaptive immune responses in the rat lung.

in spite of the increasing attention paid to the gut microbiome in pm exposures few studies have attempted to elucidate the role of the lung microbiome in response to inhaled pm.
