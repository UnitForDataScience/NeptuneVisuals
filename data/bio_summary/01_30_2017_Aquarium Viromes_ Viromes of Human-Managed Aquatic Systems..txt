Similar results were also obtained in a freshwater virome study by  where aquatic viromes were classified into two representative groups freshwater virome and seawater virome highlighting that these two different environments contain unique virome signatures.

Of the 73 viral families 23 were detected in all eight virome sets 13 in seven virome sets seven in six virome sets and10 in five virome sets.

This helped to minimize potential bias in virome preparation and sequencing.Common Viruses Shared among Different Aquarium SystemsA total of 922.7 million high quality PE reads of the 17 virome data collections were assembled generating 928186 contigs with an average of 54599 35962 contigs per virome with a mean length of 938.2 70.9 bp Supplementary Table S2.

These findings show that water temperature and resident animal profiles such as total number of individual animals in the aquarium systems contribute to the composition of aquarium viromes.High Diversity of Viruses in the Aquarium SystemsPrior to examining and comparing relative abundance of viral families between aquarium viromes we included a virome ofLake Michigan LM from a previous study   as a virome derived from a native aquatic ecosystem with limited intentional human manipulation.

However shifts in the virome structure were thought to occur as a result of aquarium management practices including establishment of physicochemical properties such as salinity temperature and nutrient concentration and addition of resident animals and plants in the systems asTABLE 2  Summary of the contigs with significant BLASTN hits to known human papillomaviruses obtained from the aquaria.STB Stingray Touch after human contact.TABLE 3  Summary statistics of read mapping to reference genomes of human papillomaviruses.all viromes except Ascoviridae in the STA virome with average relative abundances of 0.6 1.2 and 6.0 respectively.

On the other hand the STB virome was observed to have the highest diversity of ARGs suggesting that the STB virome had resistance to a wider array of antibiotics with higher number of genes conferring resistance to the most kind of antibiotics than the other viromes.

To estimate the proportion of a particular viral taxonomic group compared to the rest of the virome and to compensate for different sequencing scale the summed relative abundance of all contigs in each virome was normalized to 100.

By generating two technical replicates for each of the seven samples AZ CR GLA GLB OC STA and WR and three biological replicates for the STB 17 virome data colletions 14 3 resulted in 935.4 million 100-bp PE Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 reads with an average of 55.0 37.8 mean SD million reads per virome Supplementary Table S2.

A one-way ANOVA using permutation tests showed that the model was statistically significant p 0.001 indicating that the four parameters were major factors influencing aquarium virome structures.The first two CCA axes CCA1 and CCA2 explained 96.6 of the total variance in the virome structures .

A recent ocean virome study reported a significant relationship between nitrite and nitrate concentrations and virome structure including viral morphology populations and protein clusters  .
