in addition data on microbial communities may also be crucial for the design and testing of therapeutic inter- ventions to restore microbial diversity thereby poten- tially reducing systemic inflammation.we recently observed that a cohort of adult survivorsof childhood leukemia in malaysia exhibited signs of increased immune activation and chronic inflammation we hypothesized that this inflammatory phenotype could be associated with persistent changes in microbial communities.

the microbially derived tryptophan catabolites and their effects on the host are considerably diverse  future studies quantifying trytophan catabolites such as kynurenine will help determine the relationship between microbial changes in the childhood cancer survivors and tryptophan metabolism.conclusionswhile the mechanisms underlying our observed associa- tions here are still poorly understood the basic observationof dysbiosis and reduced microbial diversity in adult survi- vors of childhood all raises several crucial hypotheses.

reduced microbial diversity is often associated with chronic diseases -a different microbial signature in adult survivors of childhood allthe dominant phyla in both groups are the firmicutes and bacteroidetes fig.

using subjects from this cohort we inves- tigated whether adult survivors of childhood all have reduced microbial diversity compared to controls with- out history of cancers.methodsstudy cohortparticipants for this study were selected from a larger study originally to explore the presence of a phenotype of aging on young adult leukemia survivors adult survivors of childhood all who attended a late-effect surveillance clinic at the university of malaya medical centre ummc malaysia for their annual follow-up were recruited.

correlation coefficient rho and p value are presented in additional file  table s3.resultsadult survivors of childhood all have reduced anal microbial diversityanal swab samples were collected from 73 adult survi- vors of childhood all and 61 healthy controls see table the demographic characteristics of survivors and controls were comparable.
