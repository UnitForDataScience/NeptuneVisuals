Comparison of urine specimens to healthy controls have shown that the microbiota differ in varying urologic diseases including urge urinary incontinence neurogenic bladder dysfunction and urologic chronic pain syndromes such as interstitial cystitis and chronic nonbacterial prostatitis.

The microbiomic approach to bacterial detection instead uses a culture-independent method of isolating the 16S ribosomal RNA from existing bacteria present in the collected specimen and amplifies this genomic material without relying on amplificationreplication of the whole microorganism itself 77.Early studies applying these culture-independent PCR- based methods of detecting uropathogens in expressed prostatic secretions prostatitis patients demonstrated the presence of detectable bacterial ribosomal RNA in both chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic non-bacterial prostatitis 78.
