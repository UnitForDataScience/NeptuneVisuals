Spore formation is likely to be a critical factor in the ecology of this nutritionally highly specialized bacterium which was previously regarded as 'non-sporing' helping to explain its widespread occurrence in the gut microbiota through the ability to transmit between hosts.IntroductionRuminococcaceae are an important family of Firmicutes bacteria within gut microbial communities La Reau et al.

These bacteria account for around 20 of the healthy human colonic microbiota based on molecular surveys Suau et al.

2001 with two species Faecalibacte- rium prausnitzii and Ruminococcus bromii among the four most abundant contributors to the human faecal metage- nome in European adults Zhernakova et al.

prausnitzii in particular has been implicated in health maintenance Sokol et al.

2008 a scarcity of cultured isolates partly due to fastidious growth requirements Herbeck and Bryant 1974 Ze et al.

Significantly the relative abundance of R. bromii 16S rRNA gene sequences has been found to increase rapidly and dramatically in faecal samples from human volunteers after switching onto diets high in RS Walker et al.

2011 Salonen et al.

Similar rapid population increases have been reported for R. bromii within the rumen microbiota in cattle fed starch-enriched diets Klieve et al.

bromii in releasing energy from RS to other members of the microbial community and the drop in RS fermentation when this species is absent from the community justifies designating it as a 'keystone' species within the human colonic microbiota Ze et al.
