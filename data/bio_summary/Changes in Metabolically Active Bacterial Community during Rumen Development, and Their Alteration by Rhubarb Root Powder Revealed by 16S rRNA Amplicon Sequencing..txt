As all these investigations were focused on mature ruminants and rumen fermentation it would be promising to explore the effects of rhubarb as feed additive in shaping the rumen bacteria community in early life during rumen development.Within the rumen ecosystem bacterial species are considered to have a more important role compared to protozoa and fungi in determining the extent and rate of feed degradation and utilization for the production of microbial protein and VFA which significantly contributes to the maintenance and to the production of meat and milk of the host ruminant Miron et al.

The bacterial communityin the rumen can been divided into four classes according to their different spatial locations 1 free-living bacteria associated with the rumen liquid phase 2 bacteria associated with feed particles 3 bacteria associated with rumen epithelium and4 bacteria attached to the surface of protozoa or contained as endosymbionts inside the protozoal cells Koike et al.

8159. doi The objective of this present study was to explore the initial establishment of metabolically active bacteria and subsequent evolution in four fractions rumen solid-phase RS liquid-phase RL protozoa-associated RP and epithelium-associated RE through early weaning and supplementing rhubarb root powder in 7 different age groups 1 10 20 38 41 50 and 60 d during rumen development.

Variations of the distributions of some specific bacterial genera across fractions were observed and supplementation of rhubarb affected the relative abundance of various genera of bacteria.Keywords rumen development bacterial colonization microbial ecology microbial programming early weaning black goats rhubarbINTRODUCTIONThe complex rumen ecosystem harbors various prokaryotic bacteria and archaea and eukaryotic protozoa and fungi microorganisms which symbiotically convert feed stuffs into microbial biomass and fermentation end products that can be utilized by the host Dehority 2003 Kong et al.

1994 which implies the feasibility to regulate the rumen microbial community at the early period of rumen development i.e.

Moreover the epimural bacterial community which significantly differs from that of rumen contents may influence the extent of development of the rumen epithelium and the immune function Malmuthuge et al.

Therefore it would be of great significance to comprehensively explore the simultaneous evolution of the bacterial populations associated with these four fractions during rumen development.Up to now most of the investigations on the rumen microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing have been conducted based on DNA-derived amplicons Li et al.

Lettat and Benchaar 2013 reported that despite the minor disparities in the abundance of different taxa the RNA-based analysis was more discriminative than the DNA-based counterpart in identifying diet-induced alterations within the microbial community.In the present study we aim to deepen the understanding of bacterial colonization during rumen development and offer theoretical foundations for the manipulation of rumen microbiome and fermentation in early life.

For the most of the days during rumen development the abundance of the Prevotellaceae UCG-001 phylotypes in RE was significantly P  0.05 or numerically higher while the ratio of Prevotella in RE was significantly P  0.05 or numerically fewer thanIn the past few decades research has been performed to explore the initial establishment of the bacterial microbiota in the rumen.
