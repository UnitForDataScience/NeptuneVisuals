those most at risk can be identified by screening for antibodies to the insulin-producing beta cells before symptoms appear.but just because the acetate- and butyrate-enriched starch prevented diabetes in the nod mice doesn't neces- sarily mean it will work in humans noted julia greenstein phd vice president of112jama july 11 2017 volume 318 number 2news  analysisdiscovery research at jdrf formerly the juvenile diabetes research founda- tion a us nonprofit that helped fund the australians' mouse study.the nod mouse model is quite different than human type 1 diabetes she said.

we've got so many things now that work in nod mice none of which worked in people at risk of diabetes.one problem is that it's not clear whether the difference in gut flora seen in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with those who don't have type 1 diabetes is a cause or an effect of the disease said greenstein.it's also unclear whether the starch may prevent diabetes from ever occurring or sim- ply delays it and long-term preclinical and clinical studies are needed to address these possibilities she added.beyond type 1 diabetesobservational studies have linked high-fiber diets toalowerrisk of colon cancer while high quantities of red meat intake are associated with a higher risk of colon cancer.in 2014 csiro scientists published a that found that butyrylated high-amylose maize starch prevented an in- crease in colon cancer biomarkers in the rec- tal mucosa of people who ate a diet high in red meat.our primary research for some years has been the effects of butyrate on reduc- ing the risk of colon cancer clarke said.

type 1 diabetes in humans like diabetes in the nod mice develops when t cells a type of immune cells mistake beta cells--the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas--as foreign invaders and attack and destroy them.the findings suggest acetate and butyrate have different mechanisms of action.

no question.jay skyler md deputy director for clinical research and academic programs at the university of miami's diabetes research institute and formerly founding chair of type 1 diabetes trialnet an inter- national consortium of scientists research- ing ways to prevent delay or reverse the disease was less enthusiastic.

from 2012 to 2014 for ex- ample rural hospitals averaged a 2  compared with 5.9 for urban hospitalswhy the thinner margins rural hospi- tals serve populations that tend to have than those served by urban hospitals.

nevertheless rural hospital profit margins have declined in states that did not expand medicaid while those in most states that did expand medicaid saw margins re- main stable or improve.depending on whether and in what form the be- comes law it could accelerate rural hospital closures if it increases the number of unin- sured people and places limitations on state medicaid expansion.114jama july 11 2017 volume 318 number 2

i see this as the beginning of an era ofthe use of medicinal foods to treat human disease said charles mackay phd senior author of a recently published in nature immunology that found that the acetylate- and butyrate-enhanced starch benefited the immune system in the gut protecting against type 1 diabetes in a strain of mice bred to develop the disease.

the modified starch when fermented by gut bacteria in the animals' colons produced higher levels of the short-chain fatty acids scfas acetate and butyrate than thenonmodified starch.none of the mice fed a combination diet yielding high levels of both acetate and butyrate developed diabetes.

nearly every mouse of the nod strain gets type 1 diabetes.

on the other hand greenstein said only 50 to 60 of genetically predisposed humans develop type 1 diabetes because en- vironment also plays a role.

ingredion can claim that the starch might reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes al- though it must add that the fda has con- cluded that there is limited scientific evi- dence for this claim.jama july 11 2017 volume 318 number 2113news  analysiswhile some of the news coverage of mackay's article suggested that people could get a similar benefit from eating more fruits and vegetables he called that notion a bit simplistic.natural foods don't contain acetate and butyrate in amounts as large as those in the modified high-amylose maize starch mackay said.
