a 7-day infection of sheep with h. contortus significantly altered nearly 98 and 94 of genera in the abomasal and ruminal microbiome in a corresponding manner p  0.04-0.05. in this context the approximate altered genera 50 days after infection in the ovine abomasal and ruminal microbiome were around 62 and 69 respectively p  0.04-0.05. strikingly haemonchus infection may have pronounced effect on the abomasal and ruminal microbiome at 7 dpi however only slight differences at 50 dpi have been found in the abomasal and ruminal microbiome.

a 7-day infection of sheep with h. contortus sig- nificantly altered approximately 98 and 94 of genera in the abomasal and ruminal bacterial profile respectively p  0.04- 0.05. however the approximate altered genera 50 days after infection in the ovine abomasal and ruminal microbiome were about 62 and 69 correspondingly p  0.04-0.05 with increase in some bacteria and decrease in others.

our results sug- gest that the abomasal and ruminal microbial community of the early h. contortus-infected sheep had been more taxon-rich compared to that in the late infection sheep.

relatedly the ruminal microbiome displayed signifi- cant differences in various microbial diversity indices such as simpson's index shannon-wiener species diversity indexand genus richness at the early and late stage of infection compared to the uninfected-control sheep p  0.05. these results further confirm the association between haemonchus infection and bacterial community structure and diversity.

it remained approxi- mately constant from 7 to 50 days after infection p  0.67 a two- tailed t-test using instat software graphpad software san diego calif. eggs first appeared in the faeces at day 16 post- infection peaked on day 34 post-infection and then declined in subsequent days in lambs infected with h. contortus s2 table.haemonchus infection-associated histopathologic changes of the abomasummicroscopic evaluation of the abomasal samples showed histopathologic lesions for all infected sheep.

no significant differences in the ruminal ph value at 50 dpi were found compared to the uninfected-control group s3 table.haemonchus infection-associated abomasal and ruminal microbial changesthe 16s rrna amplicon metagenomic analysis of abomasalruminal bacteriafour groups of sheep 7 dpi and time-matched uninfected-control groups 50 dpi and time-matched uninfected-control groups were used for the experiment however only three groups werefig.

moreover the kruskal-wallis test showed that ruminal fluid ph values of the healthy and infected sheep were statistically augmented at 7 dpi p  0.05 however the ruminal ph values remained largely within normal limits at 50 dpi p  0.13. these findingsfig.

furthermore our results did show that the abomasal microbiome of haemonchus - infected sheep had greater genus richness at 7 dpi compared to 50 dpi and control-uninfected groups respectively p  0.04. similarly the genus richness of the 7 dpi ruminal microbial group tends to greater than in control-uninfected and 50 dpi groups cor- respondingly p  0.05.the most striking result to emerge from the abomasal and ruminal microbial data is that the genus prevotella was sig- nificantly different in the 7 dpi group compared to the control- uninfected and 50 dpi groups p  0.05. it has been demon- strated that the dominance of prevotella was associated with higher carbohydrates especially fiber-rich diets in humans wu et al.

.the analysis of microbial community structure and dominant taxathe abomasal and ruminal microbial communities were studied to identify h. contortus-induced shifts using the illumina miseq platform in an experiment where the animals were fed a fixed- formula diet containing forage and concentrate in a ratio of 1 to 1. throughout haemonchus infection significant changes in the abundance and composition of abomasal and ruminal microbiota were observed.

upon arrival at the china agricultural university facilities all sheep were tagged each sheep was assigned an arbitrary number for sample identi- fication purposes weighed and then treated with double doses of ivermectin shijiazhuang fengqiang animal pharmaceutical co. ltd and a single dose of levamisole hebei new century pharmaceutical co. ltd. these two broad-spectrum anthelmin- tics ivermectin and levamisole are effective against nematode parasites to assure the removal of any undetected nematode in- fections.

contortus genbank accession number x78803.1 were kindly provided by professor dr. hu from state key laboratory of agricultural microbiology college of veterinary medicine huazhong agricultural university wuhan 430070 hubei china after baermannized and diluted to a concentration of 1000 l3  ml in sterile phosphate-buffered saline pbs ph 7.4. larval motility was examined before used.parasite infectionsa total of twelve 3-month-old sheep were randomly allocated into two groups uninfected-control and haemonchus-infected groups each consisting of six sheep in separate areas within the university facility under the same environmental conditions to avoid cross-contamination.

nevertheless it is currently unexplored whether similar changes occur during haemonchus infection in sheep.

the second group of six sheep after being fasted for 12 h was orally inoculated with a single dose of 5000 h. contortus l3 using a syringe attached to a short rubber tube and maintained for 7- and 50-days after infection.

the beta di- versity analysis showed three very distinct clusters separating haemonchus- infected early and late stages of infection and uninfected-control sheep fig.
