Our results sug- gest that the abomasal and ruminal microbial community of the early H. contortus-infected sheep had been more taxon-rich compared to that in the late infection sheep.

The rarefaction curves for ruminal microbiota reached the near plateau phase depicting satisfying sampling depthLentisphaerae Bacteroidetes Ten ericutes CandidatedivisionTM7 Synergistetes Firmicutes Elusimicrobia Fibrobacteres Proteobacteria Cyanobacteria Actinobacteria and Spirochaetae and rumi- nal microbiota phyla such as Tenericutes Lentisphaerae Fibrobacteres Proteobacteria Spirochaetae Actinobacteria CandidatedivisionTM7 Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes compared to those of uninfected-control ani- mals S10 Table S11 Table.DiscussionThe current study was conducted to investigate Haemonchus infection-associated abomasal histopathological abomasal and ruminal microhabitat and abomasal and ruminal micro- bial changes.The more extreme histopathological changes observed in the abomasal mucosa at 7 dpi were necrosis of the mucosa severe cystic enlargements and infiltration by mononuclear cells es- pecially lymphocytes compared to the mild changes observed in the 50 dpi group.

The second group of six sheep after being fasted for 12 h was orally inoculated with a single dose of 5000 H. contortus L3 using a syringe attached to a short rubber tube and maintained for 7- and 50-days after infection.

The beta di- versity analysis showed three very distinct clusters separating Haemonchus- infected early and late stages of infection and uninfected-control sheep Fig.

The abomasal and ruminal microbial communities of the early and late H. contortus-infected sheep displayed significant differences employing ge- nus evenness Simpson and Shannon-Wiener species diversity indices at the genus-level in comparison with the uninfected- control group.Beta diversityComputing differences between microbial communities were calculated exploiting the default beta diversity metrics of weighted and unweighted UniFrac Lozupone  Knight betadiversitythroughplots.py.

A 7-day infection of sheep with H. contortus sig- nificantly altered approximately 98 and 94 of genera in the abomasal and ruminal bacterial profile respectively P  0.04- 0.05.

A 7-day infection of sheep with H. contortus significantly altered nearly 98 and 94 of genera in the abomasal and ruminal microbiome in a corresponding manner P  0.04-0.05.

Relatedly the ruminal microbiome displayed signifi- cant differences in various microbial diversity indices such as Simpson's index Shannon-Wiener Species diversity indexand genus richness at the early and late stage of infection compared to the uninfected-control sheep P  0.05.
