undigested IMO might exert protective effects on the intestinal mucosa that might be associated with a physical effect of IMO such as an ultrainfiltration action and local covering of mucosa and the resulting improvement of the ultrastructure of intestinal mucosa is helpful to block the vicious cycle of local inflammation at the VHS status.SummaryTaken together IMO can significantly improve the visceral hyperalgesia of WAS-induced IBS rats and repair the damages on epithelial ultrastructure of intestinal mucosa.

This does not alter our adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.Abbreviations AWR abdominal withdrawal reflex ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IBS irritable bowel syndrome IMO isomalto- oligosaccharides ITR intestinal transit rate SEM scanning electron microscopy SPF specific pathogen free VHS visceral hypersensitivity WAS water avoidance stress.ConclusionIn this randomized placebo-controlled study the results showed that IMO amelioratedWAS-induced visceral hyperalgesia in rats this effect may be attributed to the repair of dam- ages on intestinal epithelial ultrastructure.IntroductionIrritable bowel syndrome IBS is a physiological-psychological-social disease and its etiology is related to genetics foods infection and mental factors.

Our findings indicate that 2-week IMO treatment may improve VHS in IBS rats but has no significant influence on intestinal motility.This study aimed to explain the therapeutic effect of IMO on VHS in IBS rats from the aspects of change in gut microbiota mucosal barrier function and systemic immune response.

Our study for the first time indicated that IMO could reverse damage to the ultrastructure of intestinal mucosal epithelium in WAS- induced IBS rats an action that paralleled the improvement of VHS in these rats.

After IMO treatment secretory granules were no longer observed at the opening of mucosal glands mild Effect of IMO on the distribution of gut microbiota in WAS rats.WAS Water avoidance stress IMO isomalto-oligosaccharides n  9 in each group.

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of the prebiotic isomalto-oligosaccharides IMO on visceral hyper- sensitivity VHS in rats and to explore potential mechanism.MethodsWater avoidance stress WAS was used to induce VHS in rats.

In this study they declared the reduction in irinotecan-induced a chemotherapy medication intestinal toxicity in rats by non-digestible carbohydrates also including IMO did not correlate to stimulation of specific bacterial taxa.

This result shows that the rats had developed obviously diarrhea.After establishment of the animal model VHS was measured in WAS rats and control rats.

Although therapeutic efficacy of IMO has not been reported in non-constipation pre- dominant IBS we speculated that IMO might exert a therapeutic effect on IBS to a certain extent because IBS patients have a high incidence of abnormal gut microbiota.The chronic stress model water avoidance stress WAS can induce anxiety-like behaviors and visceral hyperalgesia accompanied by increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IFN-g and numbers of mucosal mast cells.

To pre- pare the 5 IMO solution 5 g of IMO powder were dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water and sterilized under ultraviolet radiation for 30 min.
