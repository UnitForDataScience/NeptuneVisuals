LysoPC lysophosphatidylcholine LysoPE lysophosphatidylethanolamine LysoPC and lysoPE were detected as two different forms which contain the fatty acyl chain at sn-1 and sn-2 site on the backbone of glycerol.a Assignment of metabolites was carried out using HMDB NIST Wiley 8 high resolution mass data ppm and in house libraryb It identified as taurine conjugated with cholic acid affiliation taurochlic acid or tauro-muricholic acid or tauroallocholic acid or taurohyocholic acid tauroursocholic acidc It identified as taurine conjugated with deoxycholic acid affiliation taurodeoxycholic acid or tauroursodeoxycholic acid or taurochenodesoxycholic acidd It identified as cholic acid affiliation cholic acid or muricholic acid or lithocholic acide It identified as deoxycholic acid affiliation deoxycholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid Bold values indicate the fold change  2.0 or  0.5 compared to NOR grouporrelation network of intestinal microbiome and endogenous metabolites of large intestinal contents according to pearson's correlation coefficient -0.99r0.99.

The following metabolites showed particularly high varia- tion amino acids--asparagine 1 tryptophan 11 and valine 13 organic compounds-- malic acid 14 and succinic acid 16 nucleobase--uracil 20 carbohydrates--fructose 22 glyceric acid 24 and mannose 26 fatty acids--linoleic acid 31 oleic acid 32 and palmi- toleic acid 34 lipids--lanosterol 35 monoolein 36 monopalmitin 37 monoacylglycerol184 38 lysoPE 150 39 lysoPC 180 45 lysoPE 180 47 lysoPE 181 49lysoPE 182 50 lysoPC 201 51 and lysoPC 201 52 the bile acids- taurocholic acid53 55 taurodeoxycholic acid 54 and deoxycholic acid 57.The correlation analysis between the large intestinal microbiome and endogenous metabo- lites showed that the bacteria in the classes Bacilli Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia which were significantly discriminated between experimental mice groups showed high positive and neg- ative correlations with intestinal endogenous metabolites .

Numbers on metabolites were identical on .Additionally some phenolic acids including the derivatives of benzenepentanoic acid pheny- lacetic acid phenylpropionic acid and ferulic acid were also observed and .DiscussionIn this study we investigated the effects of GTS on the large intestinal microbiome and exo endogenous metabolomes for the mice groups subjected to the gradients of chronic UVB- doses using integrated microbiome-metabolome analyses.

The correlation network was constructed using endogenous metabolites and bacte- rial classes according to Pearson's correlation coefficient  - 0.99 using the Cytoscape software version 3.4.0.ResultsThe green tea supplements GTS modulate large intestinal microbiome altered through UVB exposure in mice groupsWe investigated the in vivo mitigation of the detrimental effects of chronic UVB exposure through green supplements GTS on the large intestinal microbial communities and exo endogenous metabolomes using mice model.

Especially Clostridia and Bacilli showed high correlations with bile acids including deoxycholic acid taurodeoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid.The exogenous metabolic derivatives of green tea catechin in large intestinal contents and liver sample extracts from UVB irradiated mouse withwithout GTSA total of 26 and 27 catechin metabolites were detected from the large intestinal contents and liver samples respectively and .

The UVB irradiation with GTS dietary administra- tions most significantly reduced the Firmicutes abundance including Clostridia and Bacilli which might be correlated to the reduction in the levels of bile acids in large intestinal contents and .In conclusion we outlined an in vivo integrated microbiome-metabolome methodology towards probing the GTS mediated modulation of large intestinal microbiome and metabo- lome altered through UVB exposures.

In this study we aimed to establish a correlative microbiome-metabolome model underpinning the effects of chronic UVB irradiation on large intestinal microbiota of UVB treated mice groups with GTS alleviating the intestinal microbiome and exoendogenous metabolomes.Material and methodsChemicalsAcetonitrile methanol and water were obtained from Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA USA.

Hence we propose that in vivo transformed catechin derivatives and phenolic acids potentially affect the gut micro-environ- ment in the large intestine as well as in body which together modulates the gut microbiome leading to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.Furthermore we observed a clear variation in the endogenous metabolite levels from large intestinal contents following the chronic UVB irradiation andor GTS dietary administration in mice groups.

In addition phenolic acids such as 3-phenylpropionic acid 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-4-hydroxyphenyl-propionic acid are known to decrease the cyclooxygenase-2 COX-2 protein level and to induce stimuli such as growth factors cytokines TNF-a and lipopolysaccharides .
