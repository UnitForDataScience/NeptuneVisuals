the following metabolites showed particularly high varia- tion amino acids--asparagine 1 tryptophan 11 and valine 13 organic compounds-- malic acid 14 and succinic acid 16 nucleobase--uracil 20 carbohydrates--fructose 22 glyceric acid 24 and mannose 26 fatty acids--linoleic acid 31 oleic acid 32 and palmi- toleic acid 34 lipids--lanosterol 35 monoolein 36 monopalmitin 37 monoacylglycerol184 38 lysope 150 39 lysopc 180 45 lysope 180 47 lysope 181 49lysope 182 50 lysopc 201 51 and lysopc 201 52 the bile acids- taurocholic acid53 55 taurodeoxycholic acid 54 and deoxycholic acid 57.the correlation analysis between the large intestinal microbiome and endogenous metabo- lites showed that the bacteria in the classes bacilli clostridia and erysipelotrichia which were significantly discriminated between experimental mice groups showed high positive and neg- ative correlations with intestinal endogenous metabolites .

pair-wise correlations between the intestinal microbiome and large intestinal endogenous metabolites were calculated using pearson's correlation coefficient test with average values of each groups as implemented by pasw sta- tistics 18. the correlation network was constructed using endogenous metabolites and bacte- rial classes according to pearson's correlation coefficient  - 0.99 using the cytoscape software version 3.4.0.resultsthe green tea supplements gts modulate large intestinal microbiome altered through uvb exposure in mice groupswe investigated the in vivo mitigation of the detrimental effects of chronic uvb exposure through green supplements gts on the large intestinal microbial communities and exo endogenous metabolomes using mice model.

especially clostridia and bacilli showed high correlations with bile acids including deoxycholic acid taurodeoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid.the exogenous metabolic derivatives of green tea catechin in large intestinal contents and liver sample extracts from uvb irradiated mouse withwithout gtsa total of 26 and 27 catechin metabolites were detected from the large intestinal contents and liver samples respectively and .

the uvb irradiation with gts dietary administra- tions most significantly reduced the firmicutes abundance including clostridia and bacilli which might be correlated to the reduction in the levels of bile acids in large intestinal contents and .in conclusion we outlined an in vivo integrated microbiome-metabolome methodology towards probing the gts mediated modulation of large intestinal microbiome and metabo- lome altered through uvb exposures.

in this study we aimed to establish a correlative microbiome-metabolome model underpinning the effects of chronic uvb irradiation on large intestinal microbiota of uvb treated mice groups with gts alleviating the intestinal microbiome and exoendogenous metabolomes.material and methodschemicalsacetonitrile methanol and water were obtained from fisher scientific pittsburgh pa usa.

hence we propose that in vivo transformed catechin derivatives and phenolic acids potentially affect the gut micro-environ- ment in the large intestine as well as in body which together modulates the gut microbiome leading to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.furthermore we observed a clear variation in the endogenous metabolite levels from large intestinal contents following the chronic uvb irradiation andor gts dietary administration in mice groups.

after 1 week of acclimation the mice were randomly divided into three groups control nor n  12 uvb exposed uvb n  12 and uvb-exposed and fed on diet containing 1 green tea extract ugts n  12. four fluorescent lamps tl 20w12 rs slv wavelength 290-390 nm peak emis- sion 315 nm philips amsterdam netherlands were used for uvb irradiation and moni- tored intensity with a uv meter variocontrol waldmann ver.

in addition phenolic acids such as 3-phenylpropionic acid 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-4-hydroxyphenyl-propionic acid are known to decrease the cyclooxygenase-2 cox-2 protein level and to induce stimuli such as growth factors cytokines tnf-a and lipopolysaccharides .

at the genus level 7 out of 46 genera showed differences among the mice groups with uvb triggered an increase in lactobacillus and lactococcus whereas gts induced the enrichment of allobaculum parvibacter lachnoclostridium and two unclassified taxa from ruminococca- ceae and lachnospiraceae families.comparison of the intestinal microbiome in the nor uvb and ugts groups.

additionally the observed congruency with published literatures suggests a potential correlation between the chronic uvb irradiation and the overall modulation of the intestinal microbiomes.in uvb-exposed mice with gts administration ugts a significantly enriched micro- bial community diversity was observed especially with higher abundance of allobaculum lachnoclostridium parvibacter and unclassified taxa from ruminococcaceae and lachnospir- aceae  as compared to uvb and nor groups.

in uvb-exposed mice groups uvb class bacilli and order bifidobacteriales were observed as discriminant taxa with decreased lysophospholipid levels compared to the unexposed mice groups subjected to normal diet nor.
