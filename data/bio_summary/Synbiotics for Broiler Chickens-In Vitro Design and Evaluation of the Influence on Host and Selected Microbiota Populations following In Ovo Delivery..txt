Growth of bacteria in the MRS medium supplemented with the prebiotics glucose GOS RFO inulin or beta-glucan was measured using the automated growth analyzer Bioscreen C Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd. for 72 h.doi10.1371journal.pone.0168587.g001Dose optimization in testing trialSignificant differences in hatchability of eggs injected in ovo were observed between two doses of prebiotics 2 mg egg-1 and 5 mg egg-1.

In the previous trials we observed changes in broiler performance traits BWG and FCE introduced by in ovo treatment with prebiotics and synbiotics.

In another experiment in ovo injection of GOS and RFO prebiotics alone also increased BWG but with higher FI and FCE .

In ovo injection of prebiotics and synbiotics affects the digestive potency of the pancreas in growing chickens.

311794.Competing Interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.AbstractSynbiotics are synergistic combinations of prebiotics and probiotics.

The term synbiotic is used to describe syner- gistic combinations of prebiotics and probiotics .

The in ovo method of delivery of microflora-promoting bioactive compounds which was developed by our group is based on a single dose of prebiotics or synbiotics injected into the air cell precisely on day 12 of egg incubation -.
