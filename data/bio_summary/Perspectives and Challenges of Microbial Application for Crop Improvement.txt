plants influence the proliferation of soil microorganisms in the vicinity of their roots via root exudation walker et al.

root exudation together with mucilage lost cap- border- epidermal and cortical cells and with soil chemicals leads to the changes in ph and redox gradients which help to shape the microbial communities around roots figure 1 lareen et al.

these particular mechanisms are not always well understood but the possible explanations for the direct promotion of plant growth include hormones produced such as abscisic acid gibberellic acid cytokinins and auxins important enzymes like 1-aminocyclopropane- 1-carboxylate acc deaminase to decrease the amount of ethylene in emerging plants and plants under stress conditions contributing systemic resistance by compounds produced by bacteria biofilm formation by rhizobacteria extracellular matrix ryu et al.
