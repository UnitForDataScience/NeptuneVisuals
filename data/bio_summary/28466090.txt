4 PCA plots of data produced using a pipeline 1 and b pipeline 2 for the bacterial DNA sequence analysisbut the importance of the pipeline used in DNA sequencing data analysis is emphasized by the present results.Fungal AnalysisThe fungal DNA sequences analysed only by one pipeline and the UNITE database indicated the presence of asco- mycetes and basidiomycetes with few other groups Fig.

This led us to carry out a more detailed comparison of the methods employed in such studies.Microbiomes of Biofilms on Decorative Siliceous Stone Drawbacks...849Materials and MethodsSamplingSamples were obtained from the front facades of three churches in the centre of the city of Rio de Janeiro Brazil Nossa Senhora do Monte do Carmo CA situated on Praca XV de Novembro Sao Francisco de Paula SF in the Largo de Sao Francisco de Paula and Nossa Senhora da Candela'ria C located in Pio X Square.

Similarity levels between the three commu- nities were also determined using the Jaccard Similarity Index Sj whereSj  Total number of shared taxa 7 number of shared taxa  number of unique taxa in Sample a  number of unique taxa in Sample b....etc.. A similarity index of unity means that the populations are the same.Results and DiscussionLight microscopy of adhesive tape samples indicated the heterogeneous nature of the biofilms a fact that is well known and has been pointed out as a relevant factor in the design of sampling techniques for traditional analyses of building stone .Pipelines and Results for Bacterial AnalysesBoth pipelines used for bacterial DNA analysis indicated that Actinobacteria were major components of the C and CA biofilms but that Gammaproteobacteria were the principal members of the SF biofilm Figs.

In addition the SF biofilm contained higher levels of cyanobacteria and fewer thermophilic bacteria such as the Actinobacteria order Thermoleophilia 0.425 and 0.96 average OTUs for C and CA 0.06 and 0.06 for SF using pipeline 1 and 2 respectively.

The pipeline used in analysis of the V4 region of rRNA bacterial gene sequences influenced the taxa detected with two major classes and many genera identified only by the pipeline using the Greengenes and not the Silva database.

SF church of Sao Francisco de Paula CA church of Nossa Senhora do Monte do Carmo C church of Nossa Senhora da Candela'riamolecular analysis and their sequences are thus not present in the databases.

The collection of software applications used to process a DNA data set is called the pipeline and is often developed ''in house'' for analysis of specific environments see for example  and refer- ences therein.

Adhesive tape samples were not used for either SEM or DNA analyses but were easily examined by light microscopy.Data AnalysisDNA sequences were analysed by 3 different pipelines involving software packages and the Greengenes pipeline1 and Silva pipeline 2 databases for bacteria and the UNITE database for fungi details can be found in  and .

Both pipelines allowed the detection of many halophilic bacterial taxa Salinicoccus Oceanospir- illales Halobacteriaceae Archaea Salinimicrobium Kocuria Cellulomonas and Halococcus while pipeline 1 only showed OTUs belonging to the halophilic genera Salinicola Marinobacter and Halobacillus in correlation the chemical analyses indicated high levels of sodium chloride and calcium sulphate in the samples.Coccoid cyanobacteria tentatively identified as Chroococcidiopsis were seen in light microscopy exami- nations of the tape strips and crushed stone samples and filamentous cyanobacteria were detected by SEM in sev- eral samples some were seen penetrating into the stone becoming endolithic in nature.

For C vs CA Sj was 0.46 for C  CA vs SF 0.21.
