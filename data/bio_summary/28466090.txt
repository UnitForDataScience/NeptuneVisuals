For a review written prior to the introduction of NGS techniques into this area see .We have applied NGS methods along with more tra- ditional techniques to study the microbial communities in biofilms on degrading stone buildings of historic and cultural importance using siliceous stone facades of churches in the city of Rio de Janeiro Brazil as study sites   and found some problems resulting from the analysis of the NGS results.

SF church of Sao Francisco de Paula CA church of Nossa Senhora do Monte do Carmo C church of Nossa Senhora da Candela'riamolecular analysis and their sequences are thus not present in the databases.

Similarity levels between the three commu- nities were also determined using the Jaccard Similarity Index Sj whereSj  Total number of shared taxa 7 number of shared taxa  number of unique taxa in Sample a  number of unique taxa in Sample b....etc.. A similarity index of unity means that the populations are the same.Results and DiscussionLight microscopy of adhesive tape samples indicated the heterogeneous nature of the biofilms a fact that is well known and has been pointed out as a relevant factor in the design of sampling techniques for traditional analyses of building stone .Pipelines and Results for Bacterial AnalysesBoth pipelines used for bacterial DNA analysis indicated that Actinobacteria were major components of the C and CA biofilms but that Gammaproteobacteria were the principal members of the SF biofilm Figs.

4 PCA plots of data produced using a pipeline 1 and b pipeline 2 for the bacterial DNA sequence analysisbut the importance of the pipeline used in DNA sequencing data analysis is emphasized by the present results.Fungal AnalysisThe fungal DNA sequences analysed only by one pipeline and the UNITE database indicated the presence of asco- mycetes and basidiomycetes with few other groups Fig.

1 NGS analysis using Pipeline 1 with the Greengenes database showing main bacterial classes detected in the biofilm community on the three church facades.

2 NGS analysis using Pipeline 2 with the Silva database showing main bacterial classes detected in the biofilm community on the three church facades.
