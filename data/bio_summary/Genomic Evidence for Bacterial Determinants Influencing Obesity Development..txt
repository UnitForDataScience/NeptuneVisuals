The gene counts per genome are two Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus gasseri five Lactobacillus fermentum Lactobacillus reuteri six Lactobacillus sakei sakei 10 or 11 Lactobacillus plantarum.

a Gene neighborhood of gene for universal stress protein Amc0071 in Akkermansia muciniphila b Relatedness of gene neighborhood of gene for universal stress protein gene with red rectangle in Akkermansia muciniphila to other genomes in the Integrated Microbial Genomes system.

We have also identified a possible stress response-equipped biological process involving genes for sirtuin and the universal stress protein in Bacillus megaterium .A Lactobacillus plantarum gene for the universal stress protein is involved in response to phenolic acid compounds found in food products of plant origin .

A data set was constructed that included gene identifiers BioCyc IMGM RefSeq Locus Tag operon status 0 or 1 transcription direction code 010 011 110 111 gene product description for adjacent genes position of adjacent gene before or after and lactobacilli weight modification annotation protection or gain.The predicted protein products with pfam protein domain functions encoded in the same operon as a gene for a lactobacilli universal stress protein Table  were 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase pfam02558 ApbA pfam08546 ApbAC dipeptidase PepV pfam01546 PeptidaseM20 manganese transport protein pfam01566 Nramp and sensory protein pfam03073 TspOMBR.

Using the genome of L. plantarum WCFS1 as the reference the genes tagged as lp1702 and lp1703 and respectively annotated as membrane protein and diacylglycerol kinase family protein were in the same transcription direction as the two-gene operon.Gene Neighborhood of Gene for the Universal Stress Protein in Akkermansia muciniphila GenomeThe presence of a two-gene operon annotated for energy metabolism and stress response functions in Lactobacillus plantarum encouraged us to investigate the gene neighborhood of the only gene for universal stress protein encoded in the genome of Akkermansia muciniphila ATCC BAA-835.

Our evaluation of the gene neighborhood of the only gene for the universal stress protein familyAmc0071 in the probiotic Akkermansia muciniphila genome revealed an operonic arrangement with the gene for tryptophanyl-transfer ribonucleic acid tRNA synthase in which the human homology is associated with the waist-hip ratio WHR and body fat distribution.

Our research strategy of combining bioinformatics and visual analytics methods was based on the identification of operon gene arrangements in genomes of Lactobacillus species and Akkermansia muciniphila that include at least a gene for a universal stress protein.

lp1701 JDM11432 pfam03073 TspOMBR.Alignment of Genomic Regions for Two-Gene Operons that include Gene for Universal Stress ProteinA total of nine universal stress proteins Lactobacillus sakei LSA0042 LSA0247 Lactobacillus reuteri LAR1223 Lactobacillus plantarum lp1322 JDM11117 lp1701 JDM11432 and lp2993 JDM12397 in the weight-modifying lactobacilli were identified as part of two-gene operons.

Interactive visual representations were constructed to accomplish the objective to determine protein length distribution and protein domain architecture of lactobacilli universal stress proteins.Evaluation of the Genomic Context of Genes Encoding Universal Stress ProteinsThe genomic context of genes encoding universal stress proteins were obtained through interaction with information on the respective gene pages in BioCyc PathwayGenome Database Collection  and the IMGM.

Predicted protein functions of neighboring genes of genes for universal stress protein in representative genomes of lactobacilli investigated for body weight-modifying characteristics.Protein Pfam families encoded in two-gene operon that includes a gene for universal stress protein.
