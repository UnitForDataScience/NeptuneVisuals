In one report the level of histatin 5 in children's saliva had no association with ECC.Another group demonstrated a significant increase in the concentration of salivary histatin 5 in children with ECC n  41 average age  5 - 2.3 years in comparison with the control group n  41 average age  5 - 1.5 years.The most recent longitudinal study published by Ao et al.

The results showed increased concentrations of antimicrobial peptides AMPs IgA and Streptococcus mutans over time.This review aims to summarize the following 1 whether salivary microbes can be utilized as biomarkers for ECC risk assessment2 the influence of salivary proteins on oral microorganisms and caries occurrence and 3 whether salivary proteins can be used as biomarkers to predict ECC susceptibility and outcomes.MICROORGANISMS AS A RISK FACTOR FOR ECCMutans streptococci and lactobacilliDental caries is the most common chronic infectious oral disease among children and teenagers in the world.

In a study conducted on 120 childrenwith and without caries which included preschool level aged between 4 and 6 years old n  60 and school level aged between 9 and 11 years old n  60 children the salivary mucins levels were measuredTable 2 The most common major salivary glycoproteins expressed in salivaTable 3 The most common minor salivary glycoproteins expressed in salivausing ELISA.

The identification of biomarkers for children at high risk of ECC is not only critical for early diagnosis but also important for preventing and treating the disease.International Journal of Oral Science Online publication 10 November 2017 e1 doi5Keywords caries risk assessment early childhood caries salivary microorganisms salivary proteinsINTRODUCTIONDental caries are one of the most common chronic infectious diseases of preschool-aged children characterized by the destruction of tooth tissues by synergistic complex effects among acids generated from the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates by bacteria and susceptible host factors such as teeth and saliva.

examined 42 children aged 36-71 months and demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the salivary lysozyme level in caries- free children 9 573.81 ngml- 1 compared with ECC children 2 180 ngmL - 1.

There have been relatively few studies assessing the relationship between salivary defensins and their usage as biomarkers for caries risk prediction forTable 1 The most common AMPs expressed in salivaSalivary componentsMain functionsSourcesReference Cathelcidin LL3Antimicrobial activitySalivary glands and duct neutrophil leukocytes and gingival sulcusHistatinsAntifungal and antibacterialParotid and submandibular salivary duct cellsAlpha-defensinvHNP1-3Microbicidal activity antiviral activityNeutrophil granulocytesBeta-defensins hBD1 hBD2 hBD-3Microbicidal activity and antiviral propertiesMucosal cellsStatherinRemineralization of enamelMajor and minor salivary glandsECC therefore we cannot consider it as a caries risk prediction tool for ECC.Histatins.

Two forms of glycoproteins are present in the saliva major salivary glycoproteins  and minor salivary glycoproteins .Major salivary glycoproteins.

To date other salivary protein components have no association no clear association has been found between other salivary proteins and ECC risks with caries risk prediction and the amount of total salivary proteinsis found not to be useful in predicting caries risk.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 81400502 Qiong Zhang and the Young Teacher Research Start Funding of Sichuan University 2016SCU11049 Yuan Zhou.

In a longitudinal study salivary concentrations of alpha-defensins 1-3 cathelicidins LL-37 LF calprotectin and salivary immunoglobulin A IgA in 1-year-old children were measured at baseline.

Several other investigations did not observe a statis- tically significant difference in the total salivary protein concentration between children with and without ECC.It is possible that the lack of association between salivary proteins and dental caries is due to the different levels of structure and function redundancies found in saliva.
