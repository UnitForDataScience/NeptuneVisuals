The use of temperature and humidity controller systems in the warehouse used for withering the grapes could have prevented the growth of these molds.Interestingly we found that Diplodia found exclusively in must samples was positively correlated with compounds usually detected in traces in grapes and fresh fruits 1- pentanol and 26-dimethoxyphenol the latter also called syringol Escudero et al.

As observed from the comparison of different vintages other environmental conditions imposed by the withering can shape the grape mycobiota while the initial withering does not affect the grape mycobiota the harsh conditions imposed by a prolonged withering contribute to the shaping of the fungal populations.Conserved Microbial and Chemical Characteristics of Amarone FermentationDespite the several differences observed among samples and associated to the vintage both grapes and fresh musts ofV.

Even more important several fungal genera among those constantly present in must samples of different vintages like Zygosaccharomyces Metschnikowia and Candida are known to hold relevant roles either useful or detrimental in the fermentation for the production of volatile aroma compounds Loureiro and Malfeito-Ferreira 2003 Sipiczki 2006 Oro et al.

NA  the sample was not analyzed with the corresponding technique.Quantification of Total Fungi and BacteriaTo monitor the absolute amounts of microbes present in the samples we carried out quantitative Real Time PCR qRT- PCR as previously described Stefanini et al.

The withering process is also known to favor the growth of fungi of the genus Botrytis the noble rot whose relevance in determining the microbial and chemical characteristics of withered wines has been suggested Fedrizzi et al.

In a recent study Salvetti and co-workers have shown that the microbial populations present after the grape withering is widely defined by drying parameters such as temperature relative humidity and ventilation Salvetti et al.

A similar increase in glycosylated precursor compounds was previously observed to occur during grape maturation Ryona and Sacks 2013 thus suggesting that the processes begun in grape ripening proceed also during withering as previously proposed Di Carli et al.

Nevertheless the withering period to which Corvina grapes are subjected for Amarone production also influences the microbial populations Salvetti et al.

These compounds increase during grapes withering confirming previous observations for compounds of the same class Bellincontro et al.

2012 and Nigrospora genera were significantly more abundant in all the samples collected in the 2014 vintage Supplementary Figure 4 and were estimated to be more abundant in grape samples compared to must Figure 3.
