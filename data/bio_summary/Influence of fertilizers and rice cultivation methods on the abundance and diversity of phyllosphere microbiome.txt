However several other researchers have reported that the rhizosphere of rice showed the cultivar-specific influences on the ammonia oxidizing and nitrogen fixing microbial communities The present investigation revolved around the key questions i can the methods of rice cultivation and fertilizer application influence the diversity of the microbiome in terms of the different phylagroups among the bacterial communities in the phyllosphere of rice ii Can the method of cultivation modulate the distribution of functional traits among the bacteria isolates Hence we focused on the influences of fertilizer application and the methods of rice cultivation conventional flooded SRI and DSR on the structural and functional diversity of the rice phyllospheremicrobiome.2  MATERIALS AND METHODS2.1  Experimental site and its designThe present study was conducted during the 2015 wet kharif season as a field experiment at the ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute 28deg40' N 77deg12' E with an altitude of228.6 m above mean sea level New Delhi.

DISCUSSIONThe phyllosphere of rice is an important habitat for diverse organisms including bacteria archaea and fungi exhibiting pathogenic or symbiotic interactions Rice plants grown under different methods of cultivation such as conventionalFIGURE 8 The observation plot of DGGE profiles by the principal component analysis PCA of DGGE profiles of the communities of Bacteroidetes Bac- Planctomycetes P- and Firmicutes Fir- from rice phyllosphere under the conventional- system of rice intensification SRI and direct seed rice DSR methods of cultivation without control or with recommended doses of fertilizers RDFSRI and DSR withwithout fertilization exhibited differ- ences in their physiological activities and microbial pop- ulations as a result of the aerobicanaerobic ecological milieu in soil bringing about changes in the quantity and forms of nutrients Gopalakrishnan et al.

The eubacterial commu- nity profiles of each treatment showed to a lesser extent the influences of the cultivation methods and fertilizer application.The present study is the first report on the influences of the cultivation methods of rice on the phyllosphere microbiomes.

SRI and DSR denote System of Rice Intensification and Direct Seed Rice methods of cultivation respectively RDF refers to recommended doses of fertilizers and DGGE to Denaturing Gradient Gel ElectrophoresisTABLE 2 Leaf pigments and mineral nutrients as influenced by various modes of cultivation along with fertilizer applicationAll the values are means of three replicates means followed by a common letter in a column are not significantly different at 5 level of probability.

From the loading plot it was concluded that the conventional method of rice cultivation without chemical fertilizers supports higher microbial population including N-fixers and siderophore producers while the conventional method of cultivation with the recommended dose of fertilizers RDF showed higher numbers of oligotrophs and P-solubilizers.

These results are similar to our findings where the application of fertilizers RDF brought about distinct changes in the diversity indices particularly in the conventional mode of cultivation as reflected in terms of Maregalef and Menhinick indices.Various methods of cultivation along with the fertilizer application had a distinct impact on the bacterial communities which were reflected by the number and abundance of different phylotypes.

RESULTSThe present study involved a systematic investigation of the culturable and unculturable diversity of the phyllosphere microbiome from rice plants grown under different methods of cultivation.

Interestingly the number of isolates producing IAA was highest in the phyllosphere under the SRI method of cultivation.
