lastly ssc in preterm in- fants improved the duration of breastfeeding .in mothers of full-term infants ssc during the first hours after birth decreases maternal anxiety improves maternal caregiving behavior and is associated with longer breastfeeding duration only one study studied the effects of ssc on maternal outcomes beyond the first postnatal hours.

in addition all participants that are enrolled in the study will be covered by the indemnity for negligent harm insurance standard arrangements of the behavioural science institute radboud university nijmegen the netherlands.sample size calculationthe sample size was calculated with a power analysis using the g power 3 online tool the effect size of f  .24 for maternal depressive symptoms was based on the study of bigelow and colleagues and was calculated by using the mean levels and the pooled standard deviation of maternal depressive symptoms for the ssc and the control group the power analysis indicated that a total group size of 84 mother-infant dyads was required to maintain a power of 80 to detect a minimum effect size of f  .24 for maternal depressive symptoms with a significance level of0.05.

all expectant women will be informed about the study with the study flyer and study website.after signing up all expectant mothers will be tele- phoned by the principle investigator to provide more in- formation about the study.

this randomized controlled trial rct will be the first to investigate the effectiveness of a ssc intervention in decreasing maternal postpartum depres- sive symptoms and improving additional outcomes in mothers and their full-term infants including maternal mental health maternal and infant physical health in- fant crying and sleeping behavior the quality of the mother-infant relationship and the long-term infant general development even up to 1 year of age.

addition- ally two potential underlying mechanisms for the effect- iveness of ssc on maternal and infant outcomes will be examined namely maternal oxytocin concentrations and infant intestinal microbiota.maternal postpartum depressive symptomsbetween 20 to 40 of mothers show subclinical levels of depressive symptoms within the postpartum period -.

as ssc may constitute a daily hour of maternal relaxation that also includes touch ssc may also improve maternal sleep quality physical health and physical recovery from the delivery.the potential positive effects of ssc are not re- stricted to the mothers as ssc may also be related to various beneficial outcomes in the full-term infant.

the hormone oxytocin is released after the activation of multiple sen- sory nerves and in response to low intensity stimulation of the skin including touch as well as to suckling of the nipple oxytocin concentrations increase during social interaction including parent-infant interactions the elevated concentrations of oxytocin are related to improved maternal mental health by means of lower levels of maternal anxiety and stress and improved bonding between mother and child to conclude ssc may increase the maternal concentrations of oxyto- cin through the activation of multiple sensory nerves.

this study showed that mothers in the intervention group n  30 compared to mothers in the control group n  60 showed statistically significant lower levels of postpartum depressive symptoms at 1 week and at 1 month after birth.

next to maternal postpartum depressive symptoms this study found that a one-month intervention period of ssc was associated with a quicker maternal postpartum decrease in cortisol concentrations cortisol can be described as a measure of physio- logical stress since cortisol is the end product of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that is activated in response to stressful events previous research in adults has shown that relaxation interventions can improve sleep quality physical health and recovery after surgery - moreover multiple reviews show that touch including physical intimacy and massage therapy decreases physiological stress and pain and improves sleep and health .

infants in ssc slept for a longer period of time spent most of the time in quiet sleep and needed a shorter period to enter quiet sleep than when they were sleeping in a crib next to the mother  in the current study as secondary outcomes we will investigate whether a 5-week daily ssc intervention period starting at birth improves ma- ternal mental health maternal and infant physicalhealth infant crying and sleeping behavior the quality of the mother-infant relationship and the long-term infant general development up to 1 year of age.potential underlying mechanismsthe underlying working mechanisms that relate ssc early in life to improved maternal and infant outcomes are mainly unknown.

mothers will be told that the study will focus on the relationships between infant sleep and feeding behavior mother-infant contact and maternal and infant mental and physical health.

next a home visit in late pregnancy week 34-36 will be arranged for interested and eligible women to explain the study in person by the principle investigator.randomizationprimiparous mothers are expected to have more opportun- ities to provide ssc to their infants compared to multipar- ous mothers.

participants and the principle investigator will not be blinded for the group allocation.intervention and control conditionthe study of bigelow and colleagues requested their mothers to provide at least 6 h of ssc per day in the first week after birth and continue with at least 2 h of ssc per day until the infant was one moth of age however many mothers did not meet the ssc criterion.
