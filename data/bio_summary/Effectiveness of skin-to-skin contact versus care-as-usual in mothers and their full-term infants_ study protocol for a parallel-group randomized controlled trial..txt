In addition all participants that are enrolled in the study will be covered by the indemnity for negligent harm insurance standard arrangements of the Behavioural Science Institute Radboud University Nijmegen The Netherlands.Sample size calculationThe sample size was calculated with a power analysis using the G Power 3 online tool The effect size of f  .24 for maternal depressive symptoms was based on the study of Bigelow and colleagues and was calculated by using the mean levels and the pooled standard deviation of maternal depressive symptoms for the SSC and the control group The power analysis indicated that a total group size of 84 mother-infant dyads was required to maintain a power of 80 to detect a minimum effect size of f  .24 for maternal depressive symptoms with a significance level of0.05.

The hormone oxytocin is released after the activation of multiple sen- sory nerves and in response to low intensity stimulation of the skin including touch as well as to suckling of the nipple Oxytocin concentrations increase during social interaction including parent-infant interactions The elevated concentrations of oxytocin are related to improved maternal mental health by means of lower levels of maternal anxiety and stress and improved bonding between mother and child To conclude SSC may increase the maternal concentrations of oxyto- cin through the activation of multiple sensory nerves.

This randomized controlled trial RCT will be the first to investigate the effectiveness of a SSC intervention in decreasing maternal postpartum depres- sive symptoms and improving additional outcomes in mothers and their full-term infants including maternal mental health maternal and infant physical health in- fant crying and sleeping behavior the quality of the mother-infant relationship and the long-term infant general development even up to 1 year of age.

Lastly SSC in preterm in- fants improved the duration of breastfeeding .In mothers of full-term infants SSC during the first hours after birth decreases maternal anxiety improves maternal caregiving behavior and is associated with longer breastfeeding duration Only one study studied the effects of SSC on maternal outcomes beyond the first postnatal hours.

To main- tain equal groups we will recruit 116 participants 58 mothers and their infants in each arm.ParticipantsA total sample of 116 healthy expectant mothers will be re- cruited during pregnancy in the region of the Radboud University The Netherlands.

Addition- ally two potential underlying mechanisms for the effect- iveness of SSC on maternal and infant outcomes will be examined namely maternal oxytocin concentrations and infant intestinal microbiota.Maternal postpartum depressive symptomsBetween 20 to 40 of mothers show subclinical levels of depressive symptoms within the postpartum period -.

As SSC may constitute a daily hour of maternal relaxation that also includes touch SSC may also improve maternal sleep quality physical health and physical recovery from the delivery.The potential positive effects of SSC are not re- stricted to the mothers as SSC may also be related to various beneficial outcomes in the full-term infant.

The mothers in the SSC condition will be encouraged to provide daily SSC to the infant.Home visit on week five after birthOn 34 days after birth the experimenter will remind the mother to fill out the additional questionnaires the 72-h infant crying and sleep logbook the maternal sleep log- book and to collect an infant stool sample on week 5.

We hypothesize that compared to the control care-as-usual group the SSC group will showImproved maternal outcomesMental healthlower levels of depressive symptoms primary outcomelower levels of anxietylower levels of stresslower levels of traumatic stress following child birthbetter sleep quality.Physical healthbetter physical recovery from the deliverybetter health fewer illnesses and health problemsmore frequent and a longer duration of breastfeedinglower levels of physiological stress.Mother-infant relationshipbetter bonding to the infantbetter quality of maternal caregiving behavior.Improved infant outcomesBehaviorlower amounts of daily fussing and cryingbetter sleep quality.Physical healthbetter growth and health fewer illnesses and health problemslower levels of physiological stress.General developmentbetter regulation capacitiesbetter social-emotional capacitiesbetter language cognitive and motor capacities.Potential underlying mechanismshigher levels of maternal oxytocin concentrations.
