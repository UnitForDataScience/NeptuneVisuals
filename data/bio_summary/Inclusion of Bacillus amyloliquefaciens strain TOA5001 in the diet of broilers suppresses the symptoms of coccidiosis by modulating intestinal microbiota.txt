Feed conversion ratio FCR was similar in the control and probiotic administration groups between days 28 to 36 but between days 36 and 49 it seemed improved in the probiotic administration group 2.04 compared with the control group 2.63.

Villous height of jejunum at day36 tended to be higher P  0.08 in the probiotic administration group compared with the control group and villous height in the ileum was signifi- cantly higher in the probiotic administration group than in the control group Fig.

The use of BA as a probiotic may thus reduce the severity of coccidial infection through inhibiting the associated C. perfrin- gens colonization of the intestine.In this study we evaluated the effect of dietary administration of BA on C. perfringens colonization in the gut of coccidia-infected chicks.

The detection rate of C. perfringens was similar between groups in the ileal and cecal digesta at day 36 whereas it was lower in the probiotic administration group com- pared with the control group in both ileal and cecal digesta at day 49 Fig.

At day 36 the numbers of E. coli in ileal digesta were lower in the probiotic administration group than in the control group and they also tended to be lower P  0.056 in the cecal digesta of the pro- biotic administration group compared with the control group Fig.

The effectiveness of this probiotic against coccidiosis was associated with stimulation of total immunoglobulin A IgA production in the intestine and elongation of the villous height in the jejunum.

The experimental design is described below.Preparation of probioticA probiotic was prepared with corn starch as a car- rier and B. amyloliquefaciens strain TOA5001 at 1 9 108 colony-forming units cfug of corn starch.

The feed for the treatment group was supplemented with 0.2 of the prepared probiotic ww so that the final concentration of BA was 2 9 105 cfug of feed.

The probiotic was added on day 0 to the starter diet and on days 20 and 35 to the grower diet.
