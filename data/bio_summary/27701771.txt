At the univariable level children who had received antibi- otic treatment had significantly lower intelligent test scores at the age of three-and-a-half years seven years and 11 years lower reading ability scores at the age of seven years higher behavioural difficulty scores at the age ofthree-and-a-half years seven years as rated by parents and by the child themselves higher scores on the Conners oppositional behaviour subscale as rated by parents greater number of ADHD symptoms at the age of 11 as rated by both parents and teachers and greater depression symp- tomatology at the age of 11.After adjustment for SGA status sex maternal school leaving age maternal smoking in pregnancy method of delivery and breastfeeding duration the following outcome variables remained statistically significantly associated with antibiotic use higher parent-rated total behavioural diffi- culty score at age of three-and-a-half years and 11 years in particular conduct problems higher self-rated peer diffi- culties lower self-rated prosocial behaviour scores at age 11 higher parent-rated ADHD symptoms at age 11 higher teacher-reported symptoms of ADHD at age 11 and higher depression symptom scores at age 11.Antibiotic use between the ages of 12 months and three- and-a-half years was not significantly associated with any of the outcome measures Table S2.

The aim of this study therefore was to examine the association between antibiotic use in early life and later cognitive behavioural and mood outcomes in our longitu- dinal cohort study.METHODSubjectsParticipants in this study were children enrolled in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study ABC study at birth from the Auckland District Health Board area between October 1995 and November 1997 or from the Waitemata District Health Board area between October 1995 and August 1997.

The parents of the child participants gave signed consent for the study with the children themselves giving assent at 11 years of age.RESULTSSubjectsOf the 871 European mothers and their children enrolled in the ABC study at birth 550 responded at three-and-a-half years 591 responded at seven years of age and 620 responded at 11 years of age.

In brief the study was a case-control study in which all small-for-gestational age children SGA birthweight10th percentile for sex and gestation and a random selection of appropriate-for-gestational age children AGA birthweight10th percentile for sex and gestation were invited to participate.

A total of 49 9.3 children had been admitted to hospital during the first three-and-a-half years of life.Association of antibiotic use and neurocognitive outcomesTable 1 shows the relationship between antibiotic use in the first year of life and cognitive behavioural and emotional outcomes at three-and-a-half years seven years and 11 years of age.

Intelligence test scores and measures of behavioural difficulties were obtained when children were three-and-a-half years seven years and11 years of age.Results Antibiotic use in the first year of life was reported in 70 of the 526 children with antibiotic data assessed at age three-and-a-half years.

In addition the figure of 70 of infants receiving antibiotics suggests many of these treatments were likely to be for minor childhood illnesses that would not be expected in them to impact on development.The finding that it is antibiotic use in the first year of life as opposed to antibiotic use between 12 months and three- and-a-half years of life that is associated with behavioural mood and cognitive outcomes later in childhood is consis- tent with the theoretical underpinnings of the development of the gut-brain axis.

Infor- mation on children's antibiotic use in the first year of life was gathered retrospectively via maternal interview when children were aged three-and-a-half years.

Admission to hospital in the first three-and-a-half years of life was not significantly associated with any of the outcome measures data not shown.DISCUSSIONThis study has demonstrated an association between antibiotic treatment in the first year of life and poorer cognitive behavioural and emotional outcomes throughout childhood.

Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence in this field by being the first to show a link between early antibiotic use in the first year of life and later behavioural emotional and cognitive out- comes during childhood.Limitations of this study need to be considered.
