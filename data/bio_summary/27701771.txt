the aim of this study therefore was to examine the association between antibiotic use in early life and later cognitive behavioural and mood outcomes in our longitu- dinal cohort study.methodsubjectsparticipants in this study were children enrolled in the auckland birthweight collaborative study abc study at birth from the auckland district health board area between october 1995 and november 1997 or from the waitemata district health board area between october 1995 and august 1997. the methodology of the abc study has been described in detail previously 21. in brief the study was a case-control study in which all small-for-gestational age children sga birthweight10th percentile for sex and gestation and a random selection of appropriate-for-gestational age children aga birthweight10th percentile for sex and gestation were invited to participate.

at the univariable level children who had received antibi- otic treatment had significantly lower intelligent test scores at the age of three-and-a-half years seven years and 11 years lower reading ability scores at the age of seven years higher behavioural difficulty scores at the age ofthree-and-a-half years seven years as rated by parents and by the child themselves higher scores on the conners oppositional behaviour subscale as rated by parents greater number of adhd symptoms at the age of 11 as rated by both parents and teachers and greater depression symp- tomatology at the age of 11.after adjustment for sga status sex maternal school leaving age maternal smoking in pregnancy method of delivery and breastfeeding duration the following outcome variables remained statistically significantly associated with antibiotic use higher parent-rated total behavioural diffi- culty score at age of three-and-a-half years and 11 years in particular conduct problems higher self-rated peer diffi- culties lower self-rated prosocial behaviour scores at age 11 higher parent-rated adhd symptoms at age 11 higher teacher-reported symptoms of adhd at age 11 and higher depression symptom scores at age 11.antibiotic use between the ages of 12 months and three- and-a-half years was not significantly associated with any of the outcome measures table s2.

in addition to demonstrating disruption to the gut microbiota antibiotic-treated mice had impaired novel object recogni- tion memory which is consistent with previous reports 27. changes in circulating metabolites cerebral signalling molecules and expression of neuropeptides such as brain derived neurotrophic factor were also demonstrated posing a plausible pathway connecting antibiotic-induced dysbiosis to cognitive outcomes 28.recent publications have reviewed the link betweenantibiotic use in human populations and the resulting impact on the gut microbiota 1529. associations between antibiotic use in early life and later allergic disease and obesity have been reported in a number of studies and havebeen recently reviewed 1920. our study contributes to the growing body of evidence in this field by being the first to show a link between early antibiotic use in the first year of life and later behavioural emotional and cognitive out- comes during childhood.limitations of this study need to be considered.

faecal microbial diversity was greater and bacteroidetes andproteobacteria were significantly more abundant whereas the proportion of firmicutes was markedly lower in patients with depression compared with healthy controls 7. other studies have focused on gut microbiota differ- ences in autism spectrum disorder 8. further clinical evidence arises from studies of the effect of probiotic treatment in early life and later outcomes such as reduced risk of eczema 910 and lower risk of a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd at age 13 years 11.while much of the emerging literature has focused on the potential benefits of probiotic treatment antibiotics used to treat pathogenic bacterial infections are known to disrupt the diversity and number of microbial organisms in the intestine 12. these perturbations in the gut microbiota have been shown to persist for up to four weeks following cessation of treatment in children 13. furthermore researchers have suggested that early exposure to antibi- otics may be associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder 14 and increased risk of allergic disease 15. in animal models antibiotic use in early life has been shown to increase risk of central adiposity and obesity in rodents 16 and this has more recently been shown in human studies 1718. two recently published reviews have summarised the literature indicating a link between antibiotic exposure and later disease including allergy and obesity 1920. to date the effect of early antibiotic use on later cognitive behavioural and emotional outcomes has not been examined.

the parents of the child participants gave signed consent for the study with the children themselves giving assent at 11 years of age.resultssubjectsof the 871 european mothers and their children enrolled in the abc study at birth 550 responded at three-and-a-half years 591 responded at seven years of age and 620 responded at 11 years of age.

intelligence test scores and measures of behavioural difficulties were obtained when children were three-and-a-half years seven years and11 years of age.results antibiotic use in the first year of life was reported in 70 of the 526 children with antibiotic data assessed at age three-and-a-half years.

a total of 49 9.3 children had been admitted to hospital during the first three-and-a-half years of life.association of antibiotic use and neurocognitive outcomestable 1 shows the relationship between antibiotic use in the first year of life and cognitive behavioural and emotional outcomes at three-and-a-half years seven years and 11 years of age.

if confirmed by further research these findings could have implications for the use of antibiotics for minor illnesses in infancy.introductionemerging literature suggests that later health and disease are influenced by the development stabilisation and func- tion of the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract and that dysbiosis has flow on effects on the brain and the behaviour 12.the human gut microbiota refers to microorganisms living in the intestine which has recently been estimated to equal the total number of human cells in the body 3. microbial colonisation of the human gut begins in utero as bacteria have been found in umbilical cord placenta amniotic fluid and also in meconium 4. after birth the gastrointestinal tract is colonised by a rapidly diversifying microbiota and it is in the early years of life that the establishment of a stable gut microbiome occurs.

the sdq wascompleted by the parents when their children were three- and-a-half years seven years and 11 years of age and by the children themselves at 11 years of age.conners rating scales revised crs-rthe crs-r is a screening questionnaire for symptoms of behavioural problems in particular adhd in children.

the wechsler intelligence scale for children fourth edition full scale intelligence quotient was the primary cognitive outcome measure at seven years of age and the wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence was used when children were 11 years of age.

infor- mation on children's antibiotic use in the first year of life was gathered retrospectively via maternal interview when children were aged three-and-a-half years.

mothers were only asked whether they had received antibiotics or not during pregnancy asked at birth and for their child whether they had received antibiotics in the first year of life or from one to three- and-a-half years of age asked at three-and-a-half years.our study was conducted in a sample of children whose mothers identified their ethnic identity as european.

we hypothesised that antibiotic use in early life is associated with a detrimental effect on later neurocognitive outcomes.methods eight hundred and seventy-one european mothers and their children enrolled in the auckland birthweight collaborative study at birth.

in addition the figure of 70 of infants receiving antibiotics suggests many of these treatments were likely to be for minor childhood illnesses that would not be expected in them to impact on development.the finding that it is antibiotic use in the first year of life as opposed to antibiotic use between 12 months and three- and-a-half years of life that is associated with behavioural mood and cognitive outcomes later in childhood is consis- tent with the theoretical underpinnings of the development of the gut-brain axis.
