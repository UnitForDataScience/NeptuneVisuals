Inflammatory mediators and inflammatory in Orai1flfl and Orai1-- mice the pancreasa MPO was measured in extracts prepared from the pancreas of Orai1flfl black andOrai1-- mice red.b-g Serum from Orai1flfl black Orai1-- mice maintained on solid red and liquid diets blue was used to measure MPO b TNFa c IL2 d IL4 e IL6 f and IL12 g. The number of mice is indicated in the column and the p values relative to the level in Orai1flfl are listed above the columns.h-k Fecal SCFAs were analyzed in Orai1flfl maintained on solid black or liquid dietgreen and Orai1-- mice maintained on liquid diet.

Analysis of intestinal innate immunity in Orai1flfl and Orai1-- micea-d Phloxine Btartrazine staining of intestinal sections obtained from Orai1flfl a and Orai1-- mice maintained on liquid b or solid diet c. d Shows the average number of Paneth cellsfield analyzed in the indicated number of fields obtained from 3 mice in each line.e-h Intestinal sections from 3 Orai1flfl 3 Orai1-- mice on liquid diet and 4 Orai1-- miceon solid diet were stained for lysozyme green and counterstained for DAPI blue.

1b.Necropsy of mice with Orai1-- in pancreatic acini henceforth referred to as Orai1-- mice and their Orai1flfl littermates revealed that Orai1-- mice on SD were lean with reduced ingesta and had a high prevalence of gastrointestinal inflammation and systemic bacterial infection supplementary table 1.

This was out of proportion to the mild pancreatic damage seen in Orai1-- mice.Deletion of Orai1 causes intestinal bacterial overgrowth and systemic infectionThe gastrointestinal inflammation and bacterial infection noted in the pathological analysis led us to measure the intestinal bacterial burden in Orai1-- mice.16S rRNA sequencing in Figure 4a showed increased cecal bacterial load in Orai1-- mice on SD.

As controlsAhuja et al.Page 7survival was intact in Orai1-- mice on PLD transplanted with cecal material from Orai1flfl mice and Orai1flfl mice transplanted with cecal material from Orai1-- mice on SD.Lack of pancreatic antimicrobials disrupts the gut microbiome homeostasisThe results in Figure 6 indicate that reduced antibacterial activity indeed caused intestinal bacterial overgrowth and that bacterial outgrowth is the cause of death in Orai1-- mice on SD.

TX tamoxifenOrai1-- mice maintained on solid SD or liquid LD diets were supplemented with digestive enzymes in the SD red or drinking water purple.Consumption of solid food by Orai1flfl and Orai1-- mice.Consumption of liquid food by Orai1flfl and Orai1-- mice.

The columns show the average staining intensity relative to actin and is plotted as mean-s.e.m.i-k Activity of total lipase i 6 mice amylase j 9 mice and trypsin k 3 mice in Orai1flfl black and Orai1-- acinar cells red.Ahuja et al.Page 18Time course of exocytosis stimulated by 100 pM CCK8 in acini obtained from age- matched Orai1flfl and Orai1-- mice 10 blue circles 30 red triangles and 112 green squares days after deletion of Orai1.Chymotrypsin in feces of Orai1flfl mice black and Orai1-- mice maintained on solidred and liquid diets blue for 10 days after final Tamoxifen gavage.Ahuja et al.Page 19Figure 3.

Bacterial burden and intestinal inflammation in Orai1-- micea Cecal bacterial 16S rRNA was measured in Orai1flfl mice and Orai1-- mice maintained on liquid LD or solid diets SD.b-d Duodenal b Jejunal c and colonic d sections obtained from Orai1-- micemaintained on liquid upper images or solid diets lower images were stained for adherent gram negative blue and positive red bacteria.

Analysis of the microbiome in Orai1flfl and Orai1-- micePCoA analysis in Orai1flfl mice maintained on solid diet black Orai1flfl mice maintained on liquid diet green Orai1-- mice maintained on solid diet red and Orai1-- mice maintained on liquid diet blue.

Rescue by PLD furtherAhuja et al.Page 4supports the notion that impaired digestive enzyme secretion is not the cause of Orai1-- mouse death.The lack of ingesta and visceral fat suggested that the Orai1-- mice do not eat normally so their dietary intake was monitored.
