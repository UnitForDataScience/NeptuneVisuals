These samples were designated sample 1 unaged raw TLs sample 2 unaged redried TLs sample 3 aging raw TLs and sample 4 aging redried TLs.DNA extraction and PCR amplificationMicrobial DNA was extracted from TL samples using anE.Z.N.A.

According to the RDP Classifier results sample 1 comprised the greatest num- ber of genus types which agrees with the Shannon-Weiner index results in which sample 1 showed the highest level of bacterial diversity among the four samples.At the genus level the relative abundance of Bacillus was 22.38 for sample 1 which increased to 44.85 after threshing and redrying sample 2 and to 51.61 after 1 year of aging sample 3.

Sample 1 unaged raw TLs sample 2 unaged redried TLs sample 3 aging raw TLs sample 4 aging redried TLsrepresentation of the majority of dominant bacteria on the TLs.

The average lengths were 428.07 bp for sample 1 429.02 bp for sample 2 434.00 bp for sample 3 and 428.31 bp for sample 4.

Overall 283 OTUs were obtained from the four samples using UPARSE with 77 OTUs from sample 1 72 OTUs from sample 2 66 OTUs from sample 3 and 68 OTUs from sample 4.

Comparing these four samples there were 11 unique OTUs in sample 1 2 unique OTUs in sample 2 6 unique OTUs in sample 4 and 0 unique OTU in sample 3.

OTU numbers decreased after 1 year of aging both on raw and redried TLs with 66 OTUs in aging raw TLs 77 OTUs in unaged raw TLs 68 OTUs in aging redried TLs and 72 OTUs in unaged redried TLs.

1 unaged raw TLs 2 unaged redried TLs 3 aging raw TLs 4 aging redried TLsanalysis sample 1 was significantly different from the other three samples and was characterized by one main cluster.

The Shannon value decreased after threshing and redrying sample 2 2.52 as well as after 1 year of aging sample 3 2.33.
