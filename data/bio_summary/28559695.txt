Multiple theories linking irritable bowel syndrome etiology with the intestinal microbiota have been proposed which together with the discovered irritable bowel syndrome- associated GI microbiota alterations imply that bacteria could play a part in irritable bowel syndrome etiology 10.The overall microbial community from fecal samples of irritable bowel syndrome subjects has been analyzed applying denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE microarray HITCip and PhyloChip and sequencing conventional Sanger sequencing and 2nd generation 454 pyrosequencing.

Fecal microbiota transplantation seems to be one of the most effective methods of treating the postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome with recurrent episodes caused by Clostridium difficile.Keywords gastroenteritis microbiota postinfectious irritable bowel syndromeThe irritable bowel syndrome IBS is an association of chronic and recurrent symptoms such as constipation diarrhea bloating andor abdominal pain having no abnormalities biochemical or structural detectable by conventional laboratory methods.

This suggests an exposure to pathogenic organisms that disrupts the intestinal barrier function and alters the neuromuscular function and triggers chronic inflammation which sustains irritable bowel syndrome symptoms 8.DefinitionThe postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of symptoms mentioned in the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome with Rome IV criteria being the most recently defined 2.

In addition to overall dysbiosis specific bacterial groups are either elevated Lactobacillus Veillonella Ruminococcus Enterobacteriaceae aerobes group S. aureus or reduced Bifidobactrium B.catenulatum Bacteroides in irritable bowel syndrome with the exception of bifidobacteria 10.TreatmentCurrently there is no widely accepted management strategy for postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.Treatment is frequently symptom directed rather than curative and includes agents prescribed for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome- D 14.

The efficacy of antibiotics for the treatment of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome has not been specifically evaluated but research suggests that antibiotics may be effective in treating a subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome 25.Prophylaxis aimed at preventing or early treatment of acute bacterial diarrhea may reduce the risk of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome development by reducing the occurrence duration and severity of the chronic inflammation and mucosal alterations believed to play a role in disease persistence.

DUMITRASCU21Department of Infectious Diseases Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca Romania22nd Medical Department Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and PharmacyCluj-Napoca RomaniaAbstractAfter acute infectious gastroenteritis up to thirty percent of patients present prolonged gastrointestinal symptoms and a part of those affected patients can have the diagnostic criteria for postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.Treatment is symptom directed rather than curative and includes agents prescribed for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in general.

Probiotic treatment is effective in restoring the intestinal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and in animal models there are improvements of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome.

The onset of symptoms must be at least 6 months before according to Rome IV criteria 2.The earliest description of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome PI-IBS dates from 1962 Chaudhary and Truelove reported that one third of their patients with aManuscript received 08.11.2016Accepted 15.12.2016Address fohistory of gastroenteritis went on to develop irritable bowel syndrome type symptoms 3.

Furthermore though some will recover spontaneously even at six years nearly two thirds remain symptomatic 7.The current conceptual framework regarding the pathogenic mechanisms for postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome suggests that postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome is associated with alteration of motility increased intestinal permeability an increased numbersof enterochromaffin cells and persistent intestinal inflammation.

Several studies have documented that postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome can respond to cholestyramine 21 which is nevertheless rather poorly tolerated owing to its unpleasant taste in its currentformulation.Antibiotics the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome include symptoms bloating abdominal pain and altered bowel habits are similar to those experienced by subjects with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO.
