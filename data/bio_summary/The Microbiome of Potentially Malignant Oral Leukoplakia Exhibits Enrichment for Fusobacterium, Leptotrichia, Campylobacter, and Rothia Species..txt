In the current study we analyzed the microbiome of oral leukoplakia in 36 patients compared to healthy mucosal tissue from the same patients and healthy control subjects to determine if specific microbial enrichments could be identified early in the malignant process that could play a role in the progression of the disease.

No normal sites were present in four patients and five patients presented with more than one OLK and were swabbed at both sites Supplementary Table S1.

Colonization levels were lower at contralateral healthy mucosa from the same group of patients 20 and in healthy control patients 13.5.

This analysis identified increased abundance of several taxa in OLK patients q  0.015 LDA  3.0 including Rothia mucilaginosa OTU004Alloprevotella spp.

and Campylobacter concisus OTU0053.Comparison of the levels of these two organisms in all patients with mild moderate or severe dysplasia revealed that severe dysplasia was associated with elevated levels of Leptotrichia spp.
