These findings suggest that functions of salivary microbes devote to environmental re- sponses in the daytime whereas those devote to metabolisms in the evening and these functional oscillations may be related with main- tenance of the oral homeostasis.Recently it was reported that the gut microbiome exhibited the circadian oscillation in the microbial abundance in mice and the cir- cadian oscillation was abolished by disruption of a host circadian clock gene.From these observations it can be suggested that the circadian oscillation of the salivary microbiome is regulated by host clock genes.

Thus these data suggested the high inter-subject variation in the circadian oscillation profile.Bacterial phenotypes and oscillation patternsTo examine if the oscillation patterns of the salivary microbiome is determined by the bacterial phenotype we compared the oscillation patterns between strict aerobes AE facultative anaerobes FA and strict anaerobes AN.

These apparent discrepancies between the salivary microbiome in the oral cavity and the gut microbiome in the intestine suggest the existence of different regulations and responses between them.On the other hand several studies reported the association of the salivary microbiome with not only oral manifestations such as peri- odontitis and dental cariesBehcet's syndrome and aphthous sto- matitisbut also with several systemic diseases including pancreatic cancer inflammatory bowel disease IBD celiac disease rheumatoid arthritisand hepatic cirrhosis.These reports suggest that physiological changes at the distal lesion sites largely contribute to the alteration of salivary microbiome and that the salivary micro- biome appears to be more sensitive to host-related rather than environment-related factors in comparison with the gut microbiome.

These data suggested that mi- crobial cell number also exhibited the circadian oscillation with indi- vidual differences.Characterization of circadian oscillation patterns We characterized the oscillation pattern of salivary microbes at the phylum and genus level.

Therefore this inconsistency suggested that the hierarchical clustering was insufficient to differen- tiate subtle changes in variations within individuals.The circadian oscillation completely disappeared with very low UniFrac distances between the samples in the in vitro incubation ex- periments suggesting that the circadian oscillation in the salivary microbiome is not an autonomous process but a response linked to certain host's signals andor oral environmental changes associated with them.

Also we quantitatively evaluated the microbial com- position by mapping 100 K high-quality reads onto the reference genomes under the conditions described previously.Periodicity discrimination method PDMIn this study we developed a PDM for evaluation of the periodicity of oscillation patterns of the relative abundance of given taxa and microbial categories.The microbial relative abundance data at sampling times in a day 1200 1600 2000 000 400 800 was normalized as follows.ddn - dmindmax-dmindn denotes each value of the day dnorm denotes the normalized value dmin denotes the minimum value of the day and dmax denotes the maximum value of the day.

Normalized values of each day were all in the interval 0 1.To figure out the periodicity of a given taxon X in a subject the normalized abundance data of every 4 h for 3 days were prepared as a list and the average normalized abundance of each time zone was calculated as shown below.Then the list was sorted with time zones column vector in the shown table by the average normalized abundance of each time zone.

The microbes in the throat tonsil and tongue may be the resources of the salivary microbiome because the salivary microbiome composition is similar to that of these micro- biomes.-In this context the recent paper showed that the plaque microbiome exhibited little circadian oscillationsuggesting that the sensitivity to stimuli in the oral cavity differed between the plaque and salivary and possibly tongue and tonsil microbiomes.We observed differences in the circadian periodicities P values estimated by the PDM among various microbial categories byFigure 4.

The circadian oscillation was completely abolished by incubating the saliva in vitro suggesting that host's physiological changes mostly contributed to the microbial oscillation.
