Fasting plasma samples were used for the de- termination of FPG fasting plasma insulin FPI total choles- terol triglycerides HDL-C LDL-C and plasma TMAO and 2-h OGTT plasma samples were used only to determine the 2-h postglucose load of OGTT.

Our aim therefore was to determine the association of plasma TMAO with type 2 diabetes and to examine whether the association may be modified by a common FMO3 genetic variation in a case- control study.This study was funded by the National Science and Technology Support Program of China 2012BAI02B02 the China Postdoctoral Science Foun- dation 2016M602314 the Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities HUST 2016YXMS219.Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 are available from the Online Supporting Material link in the online posting of the article and from the same link in the online table of contents at Address correspondence to LL e-mail lgliumails.tjmu.edu.cn or FBH e-mail frank.huchanning.harvard.edu.Abbreviations used FMO3 flavin monooxygenase 3 FPG fasting plasma glucose FPI fasting plasma insulin FXR farnesoid X receptor OGTT oral-glucose-tolerance test TMAO trimethylamine-N-oxide.Received March 21 2017.

From the lowest to the highest quartiles of plasma TMAO the multivariable adjusted ORs of type 2 diabetes were 1.00 reference 1.38 95 CI 1.08 1.77 1.64 95 CI 1.28 2.09 and 2.55 95 CI 1.99 3.28 P- trend  0.001 each SD of ln-transformed plasma TMAO was associated with a 38 95 CI 26 51 increment in ORs of type 2 diabetes.

The positive association between plasma TMAO and type 2 diabetes was consistent in each rs2266782 genotype group and no significant interaction was ob- served P  0.093.Conclusions Our results suggested that higher plasma TMAO was associated with increased odds of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and that this association was not modified by the FMO3 rs2266782 polymorphism.

We also lacked information on plasma choline betaine and trimethylamine which were related to plasma TMAO concentrations however previous studies have shown that the associations between plasma TMAO and disease outcomes were independent of choline itself or its other me- tabolites 8-10.

Concentrations of plasma TMAO were measured and FMO3 E158K polymorphisms rs2266782 were genotyped.Results Medians IQRs of plasma TMAO concentration were1.47 mmolL 0.81-2.20 mmolL for controls and 1.77 mmolL 1.09-2.80 mmolL for type 2 diabetes cases.
