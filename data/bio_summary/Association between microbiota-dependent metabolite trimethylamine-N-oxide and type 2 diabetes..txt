in a recent metabolomic study of type 2 diabetes risk in 2 cohorts of chinese adults the pooled result of the association between plasma tmao and type 2 diabetes risk did not reach significance although the associations showed the same positive direction in both cohorts 19. in that study however the sample preparation and measurement methods differed from our study and .50 metabolites were semiquantitatively measured without standard curves.considering that higher production of tmao could be causedby a high intake of phosphatidylcholine our results were in line with previous findings that suggested that a higher intake of phosphatidylcholine was independently associated with an in- creased risk of type 2 diabetes in 3 us populations 16. li et al.showed that participants in the top quintile of dietary phos- phatidylcholine intakes had a 34 95 ci 27 44 higher risk of type 2 diabetes than those in the bottom quintile intakes however the study did not investigate the direct association of circulating tmao with the risk of type 2 diabetes.

am j clin nutr 2017106888-94.keywords trimethylamine-n-oxide type 2 diabetes flavin monooxygenase 3 polymorphisms nutrition metaboliteintroductiontrimethylamine-n-oxide tmao is formed in the liver by trimethylamine which is generated exclusively by the gut mi- crobiota from dietary trimethylamine-containing compounds including phosphatidylcholine choline and carnitine 1-3. the tmao meta-organismal pathway has been shown to enhance the accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages and platelethyperreactivity which promotes atherosclerosis and cardiovas- cular disease in animal models 4-7. accordingly elevated plasma tmao has been shown to increase the risk of cardio- vascular disease 4 5 major adverse cardiac events 8-10 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 11 independent of traditional risk factors.in animal models tmao exacerbated impaired glucose tol- erance and hyperglycemia by blocking the hepatic insulin sig- naling pathway and causing inflammation in adipose tissue 12. consistently decreasing plasma tmao could reduce plasma glucose and insulin in mice by inhibiting the main tmao- generating enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 fmo3 13 which is required for the development of metabolic dysfunction 14 15. a recent prospective study indicated that higher intake of phosphatidylcholine the precursor to the generation of tmao was independently associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in 3 us populations 16. previous studies have yielded inconsistent associations between plasma tmao and type 2 diabetes 5 17-19 and whether the association varies by fmo3 genetic variations has not yet been investigated.

red meat is an important source of carnitine and choline which are precursors to tmao and its consumption was associated with glucose me- tabolism 25 26 and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes 27-30. red meat contains other nutrients or compounds related to the development of type 2 diabetes 31 32 and to our knowledge whether tmao is responsible for the association between con- sumption of red meat and risk of type 2 diabetes has not been investigated.

the positive association between plasma tmao and type 2 diabetes was consistent in each rs2266782 genotype group and no significant interaction was ob- served p  0.093.conclusions our results suggested that higher plasma tmao was associated with increased odds of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and that this association was not modified by the fmo3 rs2266782 polymorphism.

in general the associations between plasma tmao and type 2 diabetes were consistent across different risk strata subgroups defined by age sex bmi current smoking status current drinking status physical ac- tivity family history of diabetes and hypertension table 3. a significant interaction was found between plasma tmao concentration and current drinking status p  0.001 and the association was stronger in the drinker group than in the nondrinker group.no significant association was observed between rs2266782 and type 2 diabetes supplemental table 1. the positivetable 1anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of the study population11 data are presented as n  for categorical data means 6 sds for parametrically distributed data and medians iqrs for nonparametrically distributed data.

in the present study however the fmo3 rs2266782 polymorphism was not associatedwith type 2 diabetes and no interaction was detected between rs2266782 genotypes and plasma tmao in relation to type 2 diabetes.our findings are biologically plausible although the un- derlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

the fmo3 rs2266782 polymorphism was not as- sociated with type 2 diabetes.

our aim therefore was to determine the association of plasma tmao with type 2 diabetes and to examine whether the association may be modified by a common fmo3 genetic variation in a case- control study.this study was funded by the national science and technology support program of china 2012bai02b02 the china postdoctoral science foun- dation 2016m602314 the sanming project of medicine in shenzhen and the fundamental research funds for the central universities hust 2016yxms219.supplemental tables 1 and 2 are available from the online supporting material link in the online posting of the article and from the same link in the online table of contents at address correspondence to ll e-mail lgliumails.tjmu.edu.cn or fbh e-mail frank.huchanning.harvard.edu.abbreviations used fmo3 flavin monooxygenase 3 fpg fasting plasma glucose fpi fasting plasma insulin fxr farnesoid x receptor ogtt oral-glucose-tolerance test tmao trimethylamine-n-oxide.received march 21 2017. accepted for publication june 20 2017. first published online july 19 2017 888am j clin nutr 2017106888-94. printed in usa.
