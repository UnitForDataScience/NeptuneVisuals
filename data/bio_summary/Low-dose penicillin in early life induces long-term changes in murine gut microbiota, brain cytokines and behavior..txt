The large increase in Proteobacteria was induced by the family Enterobacteriaceae which represented 45 of all bacteria in AB-treated mice 25 in ABJB1 mice and o1 in CT mice Supplementary Figs 11 and 14.

In addition Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB- 1 have demonstrated psychoactive and neuroactive properties by reducing anxiety and depression-like behaviours in healthy mice via the vagus nerve.Here we investigate the long-term consequences of a low doseof penicillin given to mice during the perinatal period from 1 week before birth to weaning on gut microbiota intestinal barrier function BBB integrity cytokines expression andbehaviour.

Post hoc tests showed that AB-treated mice spent less time in the novel mouse chamber compared to CT P 0.002 and ABJB1 mice P 0.10 2c.

The phylum Deferribacteres was almost totally absent in all mice treated with AB and ABJB1 while present in all CT mice at both study time points.

In our current study even after 3 weeks of antibiotic cessation mice still exhibited significant behavioural and social alterations suggesting that the pre-weaning bacterial colonizationis important to durably establish certain behaviours as suggested previously.Interestingly we found that some of the AB-treated mice exhibited aggressive behaviour in the resident-intruder paradigm and spent more time interacting with the CD-1 aggressor.

Here we investigate whether low-dose penicillin in late pregnancy and early postnatal life induces long-term effects in the offspring of mice.

The antibiotic-treated mice exhibit impaired anxiety-like and social behaviours and display aggression.

Recent experimental studies have found that alteration of the gut microbiota induced by early life AB exposure may drive lasting immune and metabolic consequences in mice.

showed in mice that the pre-weaning period is critical for antibiotic-driven shift in microbiota to alter the immune response and increase susceptibility to allergy.
