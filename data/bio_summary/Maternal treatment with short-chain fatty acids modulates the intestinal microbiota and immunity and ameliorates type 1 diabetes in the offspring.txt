indicates that infection with krv led to a 2-fold reduction in the frequency of cd4 cells compared with the uninfected control p  0.001. treatments with formate and propionate did not modulate the percentage of cd4 cells whereas therapy with butyrate re- sulted in a 2-fold increase in the percentage of cd4 cells compared with krv only p  0.05. the cd4 cell number was reduced in the peyer's patches of animals treated with krv only compared with naive rats p  0.001. we further noted that the frequency of treg cells was reduced by 60 in rats treated with krv only compared with uninfected animals p  0.001. the proportion of treg cells in rats treated with krv plus butyrate but not formate or propio- nate was significantly increased compared to rats administered krv only p  0.001. a 75 reduction in the total treg cell number was detected in rats injected with krv versus thegene expression in the peyer's patches from scfa-treated lew1.wr1 rats.

in contrast the shannon alpha diversity that takes in account the richness of a sample the number of species and the evenness of taxa in the sample the relative preva- lence of the various otus within the community was comparable between groups p  0.4 and was not affected by krv p  0.3 or scfa treatment p  0.2. together the 16s sequence data provide evidence that scfa therapy alters the overall composition and diversity of intesti- nal bacterial communities among treatment groups.scfa treatment alters the abundance of individual bacterial taxawe used protocol 1 to investigate whether scfa therapy alters the abundances of individual gut bacteria.

statistical analyses among groups were performed using the log rank test p  0.001 for formate p  0.005 for propionate and p  0.006 for butyrate versus krv only.

animals treated with scfas did not show any signs of morbidity or mortality altered growth or abnormal behavior at any time point during the experiment.compared with krv infection without scfa therapy treating rats with sodium butyrate n  15 sodium formate n  24 or sodium propionate n  18 reduced the incidence oft1d to 20 versus 60 2439 in animals that received krv alone p  0.006 for butyrate p  0.001 for formate p  0.005 for propionate.

the reduction in these taxa in the scfa-treated animals is reminiscent of our earlier studies demon- strating a correlation between a reduction in the abundances of these genera and diabetes pre- vention following therapy with blockers of innate immunity   and antibiotics .due to the tight interdependence between the gut microbiota and the immune system   it is plausible to hypothesize that the changes detected in the gut bacterial composition in animals treated with scfas could be secondary to the effect of these metabolites on the immune system.

however scfa treatment resulted in notable changes in the fecal microbiota as evidenced by the fol- lowing analyses.permanova tests presented in revealed significant associations between genus- level microbiome composition and scfa treatment p0.0001 but no or small effects of krv infection when analyzed alone p  0.17 or as a covariate with scfa treatment p  0.06. fur- thermore an exploratory principal component analysis pca indicated that scfa-treated and untreated animals clustered separately along the first pc axis and that no separation was evident between krv-infected and uninfected animals and .

not only did both krv infection p  0.01 and scfa species p  0.003 contribute as main effects but also the krv x scfa interaction term was also significantly p0.001 associ- ated with sobs.

the data presented in dem- onstrate that as we previously reported  infection with krv increased the level of bifidobac- terium and clostridium but not that of bacteroides and lactobacillus compared with untreated control animals p  0.001 and p  0.01 respectively.

the data presented in indicate that 60 59 of animals treated with krv plus scfas beginning at weaning developed diabetes p  0.7 versus krv only.we next determined whether scfa-induced disease prevention was associated with altered insulitis n  3-5 per group 220 islets per animal were screened for insulitis.
