Animals treated with SCFAs did not show any signs of morbidity or mortality altered growth or abnormal behavior at any time point during the experiment.Compared with KRV infection without SCFA therapy treating rats with sodium butyrate n  15 sodium formate n  24 or sodium propionate n  18 reduced the incidence ofT1D to 20 versus 60 2439 in animals that received KRV alone p  0.006 for butyrate p  0.001 for formate p  0.005 for propionate.

Shown are paraffin sections of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of pancreatic tissue isolated from uninfected control rats KRV-infected rats at 21 days following infection insulitis KRV- plus SCFA-treated animals at 40 days following infection as indicated and KRV-infected rats at diabetes onset Panel C.For quantitative PCR analysis bacterial DNA was recovered using the QIAmp DNA stool mini kit Qiagen Valencia CA according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Median abundance of bacterial communities in LEW1.WR1 rats treated with SCFAs.PThe highlights in the KRV column represent significant differences adjusted FDR p values 0.1 compared with uninfected rats the highlights in the KRV plus SCFAs columns represent significant differences versus KRV the highlights in the SCFAs only columns represent significant differences compared with the uninfected control.

The proportion of Treg cells in rats treated with KRV plus butyrate but not formate or propio- nate was significantly increased compared to rats administered KRV only p  0.001.

Statistical analyses among groups were performed using the log rank test p  0.001 for formate p  0.005 for propionate and p  0.006 for butyrate versus KRV only.
