thus microbiota-derived metab- olites from choline as trimethylamine and its liver- produced derivative trimethylamine-n-oxide are mar- kers of cardiovascular risk in hiv-infected patients in long-term art-treated patients hiv infection was associated with defects in metabolites recovered from proline phenylalanine and lysine metabolism and accumulation of products of the kynurenine pathway derived from tryptophan metabolism the serum kynureninetryptophan ratio was associated with non- aids related outcome and death and with gut dysbiosis determination of this ratio should be important for patients' follow-up adaptive immune activation and immune senescence markerssome age-related markers of adaptive immunity are modified during hiv infection and could be informative in addition to the cd4thcd8th ratio expansion of terminally differentiated cd28- t cells and increased frequency of t-cell receptor rearrangement excision circle-positive t cells the number of cmvth t cells could also be monitored to assess the effect of latent viral infection.

thus adipose tissue is at the nexus of pathways involved in life span age-related diseases inflammation and metabolism during ageing accumulation of senescent adipocyte precursors with decreased adipogenesis results in deleterious hypertrophy of existing adipocytes hiv-infected patients receiving first generation art developed lipodystrophy with peripheral lipoatrophy and sometimes central fat accumulation associated with fat inflammation and metabolic disorders lipody- strophic features are still observed in some patients hiv itself could be involved in the adipose tissue proinflammatory phenotype as adipose tissue is an hiv reservoir with latently infected cell populations despite effective art ageing and hiv-linked lipodystrophies present similar adipose tissue dysfunction with low-grade inflammation and extracellular-matrix remodeling in addition to central fat redistribution increased visceral and ectopic fat and dysmetabolic features in vitro tat nef and vpr affect adipocyte differentiation and tat and nef induced premature senescence of adipose tissue stem cells personal results.

both chronic and recent hiv infection in art-receiving patients led to an average ageing advance of 4.9 years increasing expected mortality risk by 19. specific decreased methylation of the human leucocyte antigen hla locus was predictive of lower cd4thcd8th ratio linking molecular ageing epigenetic regulation and disease progression adjustment on cytomegalovirus cmv infection which is more prevalent in hiv-infected patients and a major driver of immunosenescence is required.macromolecular damagedamage to protein dna lipids and other macromol- ecular components is an important contributor to specific age-related diseases dna modifications can occur spontaneously or be caused by environmental factors and accumulate when cell repair system cannot cope with damage telomeres repetitive nucleotide sequences at each chromosome end protect genome.

mechanisms specific to hiv-infected patients are indicated in white.decreases with age and is associated to age-related diseases and decreased life span decreased telomere length was reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc isolated from art- naive or art-controlled hiv-infected patients com- pared with noninfected individuals and associated with poor immune recovery.

this accumulation results from mutations in the gene encoding lamin-ac responsible for hutchinson- gilford progeria or from deficiency in the activity of the metalloprotease zmpste24 maturating prelamin-a to lamin-a during ageing senescent cells accumulate in some tissues skin lung spleen endo- thelium adipose tissue which is deleterious in olderorganisms and results in decreased tissue function impaired regeneration fibrosis and secretory-associated senescence phenotype-related inflammation pbmc of naive hiv-infected patients presented features of ageing and senescence p16ink4a increased expression and reduced telomere length in art-controlled patients these two markers were associated with lower current cd4th levels tat and nef activated senescence pathways in mscs and induced a proin- flammatory profile in cultured adipocytes and mscs first generation protease inhibitors inhibited zmpste24 and caused farnesylated prelamin-a accumulation which contributes to premature senescence in tissues of protease inhibitor-treated individuals as well endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells treated with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors presented to different extents features of cell senescence and inflammation third inflammation and innate immune activation can result from harmful products as lipopolysaccharide produced by oral or gut microbiota leaking into the blood.

however even if adaptive immune activation and immune senescence markers are increased in ageing hiv- infected patients they fail to predict non-aids-defining morbidity and mortality in most studies evaluating these patients by contrast to markers of innate immune activation and inflammation .environment-related factorsbehavioural risk factors are strongly associated with ageing.

it is important also to acknowledge that even if a number of biomarkers are altered in hiv- infected patients this does not result at present in a clear interventional strategy for a given patient.genetic and epigenetic markerswe propose to analyze the apoe4 genotype which was shown to be associated with neurocognitive impairment and with accelerated cognitive decline in hiv-infected patients independently of cholesterol levels measures of the epigenetic clock and of the specific hypomethylated status of the hla region require further validation macromolecular damagetelomere length and telomerase activity are related to ageing and affected by art.

in hiv-infected patients telomere length has not been associated with comorbid- ities except an inverse relationship to lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and therefore could not be recommended at the individual level.adaptation to stressaccumulation of mtdna mutations represents a useful marker particularly when performed in highly purified t-cell subsets.

importantly serum oxidized ldl level is elevated in hiv-infected patients associated with atherosclerosis and decreased in response to statin therapy together with reduced coronary atherosclerosis this marker appears useful.inflammationit is important to determine which markers could be useful to follow ageing and age-related comorbidities in well controlled hiv-infected patients.

in hiv-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor-based art metabolomics analysis has revealed that lipid alterations are linked to markers of inflam- mation microbial translocation and hepatic function in cerebrospinal fluid the metabolomics profile of young hiv-infected patients presented similarities to that of aged hiv-negative controls and was associated with worse neurocognitive test scores and plasma inflamma- tory biomarkers in oral wash samples art-naive individuals presented an increased ratio of phenylalanine tyrosine associated with immune activation metabolomics can also reveal microbiota modifications because some biomarkers could be the end products of microbes' metabolism.

up to now these markers widely used in clinical studies which were consistently reported to be increased in comorbid hiv-infected patients have not yet been proven to have clinical utility for patients' follow-up.

basic science and pathogenesis of ageing with hiv potential mechanisms and biomarkersclaire lagathu andrea cossarizza ve'ronique be're'ziat milena nasi jacqueline capeauand marcello pintithe increased prevalence of age-related comorbidities and mortality is worrisome in ageing hiv-infected patients.

in antiretroviral treatment-controlled patients epigenetic clock appears to be advanced and some haplogroups are associated with hiv infection severity.

telomere shortening is enhanced in hiv-infected patients because of hiv and some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
