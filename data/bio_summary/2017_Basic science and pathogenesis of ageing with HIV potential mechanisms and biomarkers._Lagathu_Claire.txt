Thus microbiota-derived metab- olites from choline as trimethylamine and its liver- produced derivative trimethylamine-N-oxide are mar- kers of cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients In long-term ART-treated patients HIV infection was associated with defects in metabolites recovered from proline phenylalanine and lysine metabolism and accumulation of products of the kynurenine pathway derived from tryptophan metabolism The serum kynureninetryptophan ratio was associated with non- AIDS related outcome and death and with gut dysbiosis Determination of this ratio should be important for patients' follow-up Adaptive immune activation and immune senescence markersSome age-related markers of adaptive immunity are modified during HIV infection and could be informative in addition to the CD4thCD8th ratio expansion of terminally differentiated CD28- T cells and increased frequency of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circle-positive T cells The number of CMVth T cells could also be monitored to assess the effect of latent viral infection.

Thus adipose tissue is at the nexus of pathways involved in life span age-related diseases inflammation and metabolism During ageing accumulation of senescent adipocyte precursors with decreased adipogenesis results in deleterious hypertrophy of existing adipocytes HIV-infected patients receiving first generation ART developed lipodystrophy with peripheral lipoatrophy and sometimes central fat accumulation associated with fat inflammation and metabolic disorders Lipody- strophic features are still observed in some patients HIV itself could be involved in the adipose tissue proinflammatory phenotype as adipose tissue is an HIV reservoir with latently infected cell populations despite effective ART Ageing and HIV-linked lipodystrophies present similar adipose tissue dysfunction with low-grade inflammation and extracellular-matrix remodeling in addition to central fat redistribution increased visceral and ectopic fat and dysmetabolic features In vitro Tat Nef and Vpr affect adipocyte differentiation and Tat and Nef induced premature senescence of adipose tissue stem cells personal results.

Viral protein r Vpr can also induce intrinsic T-cells apoptosis causing a rapid decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and therelease of cytochrome c. As well Tat downregulates B-cell lymphoma 2 Bcl-2 Autophagy is a mechanism through which cargo is sequestered in a double-membrane vesicle which then delivers the content to a lysosome for degradation Autophagy declines with ageing and is a major contributor to this process Its impairment could accelerate ageing through aberrant nuclear division Accordingly in animal models pharmacological or genetic autophagy enhancement extends life span whereas its inhibition shortens life span Downregulation of key autophagy genes as autop- hagy-related 5 ATG5 and autophagy-related 7 ATG7 was reported in human brain ageing and autophagy is altered in age-related neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases Mitophagy the autophagic mitochondria degradation is required to guarantee mitochondrial quality control and cell survival and is defective during ageing leading to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria Several HIV proteins can interfere with autophagy.

Such studies will mainly benefit from large cohorts of well paired ageing HIV-infected and noninfected individuals prospectively followed.We can expect that data issued from large-scale 'omics' approaches obtained in large cohorts will rapidly emerge to better quantify biological ageing better predict morbidity and mortality in these patients and increase their healthspan.AcknowledgementsConflicts of interestThere are no conflicts of interest.ReferencesKennedy BK Berger SL Brunet A Campisi J Cuervo AM Epel ES et al.

Moreover some protease inhibitors can increase oxidative stress because of prelamin A accumulation see below.Control of cell death autophagyCell propensity to apoptosis undergoes age-dependent changes and is altered in several comorbidities Lymphocytes are continuously exposed to damage and respond with a series of mechanisms including apoptosis Cells from elderly are less prone to damage and ROS-induced apoptosis whereas mainly CD4th and also CD8th cells are more sensitive to tumor necrosis factor-alpha TNFa-induced apoptosis Acti- vation-induced cell death AICD of immune cells is often impaired with ageing with a progressive increased expression of CD95th the main mediator of AICD During HIV infection chronic immune activation is accompanied by higher expression of TNF superfamily ligands and their receptors particularly Fas ligand or CD95L and tumor-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand TRAIL and higher AICD Regarding HIV proteins secreted transactivator of transcription Tat upregulates CD95L and TRAIL in T cells or macrophages whereas negative regulatory factor Nef and glycoprotein 120 gp120 upregulate CD95L expression resulting in bystander apoptosis of uninfected T cells.

This accumulation results from mutations in the gene encoding lamin-AC responsible for Hutchinson- Gilford progeria or from deficiency in the activity of the metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 maturating prelamin-A to lamin-A During ageing senescent cells accumulate in some tissues skin lung spleen endo- thelium adipose tissue which is deleterious in olderorganisms and results in decreased tissue function impaired regeneration fibrosis and secretory-associated senescence phenotype-related inflammation PBMC of naive HIV-infected patients presented features of ageing and senescence p16INK4a increased expression and reduced telomere length In ART-controlled patients these two markers were associated with lower current CD4th levels Tat and Nef activated senescence pathways in MSCs and induced a proin- flammatory profile In cultured adipocytes and MSCs first generation protease inhibitors inhibited ZMPSTE24 and caused farnesylated prelamin-A accumulation which contributes to premature senescence in tissues of protease inhibitor-treated individuals As well endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells treated with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors presented to different extents features of cell senescence and inflammation Third inflammation and innate immune activation can result from harmful products as lipopolysaccharide produced by oral or gut microbiota leaking into the blood.

However even if adaptive immune activation and immune senescence markers are increased in ageing HIV- infected patients they fail to predict non-AIDS-defining morbidity and mortality in most studies evaluating these patients by contrast to markers of innate immune activation and inflammation .Environment-related factorsBehavioural risk factors are strongly associated with ageing.

Basic science and pathogenesis of ageing with HIV potential mechanisms and biomarkersClaire Lagathu Andrea Cossarizza Ve'ronique Be're'ziat Milena Nasi Jacqueline Capeauand Marcello PintiThe increased prevalence of age-related comorbidities and mortality is worrisome in ageing HIV-infected patients.

Therefore an important question is whether ageing mechanisms associated with HIV-infection are similar or not to those observed in the general population At the cellular level ageing results from time-dependent accumulation of cellular damage affecting molecules or organelles Once a certain level of damage is reached cells undergo temporary cell cycle arrest apoptosis or cellular senescence Here we present the main ageing mechanisms according to the seven pillars of ageing and also to the mechanisms detailed by Lopez-Otin .
