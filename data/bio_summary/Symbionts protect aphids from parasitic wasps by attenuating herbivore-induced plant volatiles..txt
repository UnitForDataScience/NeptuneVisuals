The effectiveness of the two-chamber olfactometer used here was assessed in preliminary tests with a limited number of plant replicates n  4.These tests showed that relative to plants that carried an empty clip cage plants carrying a clip cage with aphids were more attractive to wasps.We first compared the attraction of plants that had been fed on by aphids that naturally carried H. defensa with the same clone from which the symbiont had been removed strains 101 132 and 302 Table .

which is less well characterised but is known to influence aphid body colour and hence possibly attraction to natural enemies.Our study shows that plants infested with aphids carrying different symbiont species and strains are less attractive to the parasitic wasp A. ervi through systemic changes in herbivore- induced plant volatiles ultimately reducing parasitic wasp recruitment and increasing aphid fitness.

Relative to plants fed upon by symbiont-free aphids blends of plants fed upon by aphids carrying the symbiont H. defensa are different and total emissions are lower.

Across a large set of experiments with different symbiont strains and plant species and using choice experiments parasitic wasps were significantly less likely to be attracted to plants that had previously been fed on by aphids carrying H. defensa compared to plants fed on by aphids that carried no secondary symbionts Fig.

This was true in experiments where the comparison was between natural aphid- symbiont associations and the same aphid clone from which the symbiont had been removed using antibiotics Fig.

Natural symbiont infections were removed with antibiotics in the Regiella strains 319 and 126 while the others were artificially microinjected into an aphid clone naturally lacking any secondary symbiont and which was collected on Lathyrus pratensisstrains of a species failing to confer the expected advantage and in the case of H. defensa different isolates protecting against dif- ferent wasp species.

In the case of R. insecticola the variation in response found is alsonot surprising because symbiont effects may depend on the symbiont strain as well as on its interaction with the genotype of the aphid.

As in previous experiments for Regiella strains 319 and 126 natural symbiont infections were removed with antibiotics whereas the others were artificially microinjected into an aphid clone naturally lacking any secondary symbiont and which was collected on Lathyrus pratensis.Statistical analyses.
