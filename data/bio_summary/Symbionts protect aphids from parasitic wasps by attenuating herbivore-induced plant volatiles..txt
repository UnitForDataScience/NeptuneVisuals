this was true in experiments where the comparison was between natural aphid- symbiont associations and the same aphid clone from which the symbiont had been removed using antibiotics fig.

in the case of r. insecticola the variation in response found is alsonot surprising because symbiont effects may depend on the symbiont strain as well as on its interaction with the genotype of the aphid.

as in previous experiments for regiella strains 319 and 126 natural symbiont infections were removed with antibiotics whereas the others were artificially microinjected into an aphid clone naturally lacking any secondary symbiont and which was collected on lathyrus pratensis.statistical analyses.

which is less well characterised but is known to influence aphid body colour and hence possibly attraction to natural enemies.our study shows that plants infested with aphids carrying different symbiont species and strains are less attractive to the parasitic wasp a. ervi through systemic changes in herbivore- induced plant volatiles ultimately reducing parasitic wasp recruitment and increasing aphid fitness.

there was no correlation between aphid vigour measured by relative progeny production and wasp preference suggesting that the results are not affected by any influence of the symbiont on the damage caused by the aphid to the plant fig.

finally we repeated two of the experiments with natural h. defensa infections but with the aphid feeding on the host plant species from which they were collected ononis spinosa strain 101 and lotus pedunculatus strain 132. the pea aphid taxon is composed of host-adapted races or biotypes and microsatellite analyses had shown that these clones belonged to the biotypes associated with the two host plants.effect of symbiont h. defensa on parasitic wasp attack.

b. this means that the reduced attraction is not due to diminished damage caused by aphids carrying a potentially costly symbiont a conclusion confirmed by the lack of a correlation between wasp preference and aphid vigour as estimated by relative progeny production fig.

note that the same symbiont strain and aphid clone may have been used in different testspreferences when the experiments with these clones were repe- ated on the natural host plant as we had when working with vicia faba fig.

four experiments were carried out with regiella insecticola two using natural associations and two in which different symbiont strains were introduced into an aphid clone that carried noab1.41.21.00.80.60.250.350.450.55prop.

further research is also needed to understand the molecular mechanisms through which symbionts in the aphid are able to affect plant physiology pos- sibly through changes in the phytohormone levels.products derived from the obligate symbiont buchnera aphi- dicola have been found in the saliva of a. pisum and are known to induce plant defences.
